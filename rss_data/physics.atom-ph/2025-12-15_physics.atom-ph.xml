      <title>Neutral Barium in Solid Neon: Optical Spectroscopy and First Excited State Lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix isolation spectroscopy enables probing atomic properties in controlled cryogenic environments. We present a spectroscopic study on neutral barium atoms embedded in a neon cryogenic crystal at 6.8 K, extending previous investigations performed in other noble gas hosts. The visible and near-infrared emission spectra were recorded under two different laser excitation schemes. First, 10-ns laser pulses at 355 nm were used to directly excite high-lying energy levels of barium, enabling the observation of fluorescence cascades. Second, a tunable continuous-wave laser operating between 700 nm and 900 nm allowed us to determine the matrix-induced shifts of barium energy levels relative to their vacuum values, as well as the inhomogeneous linewidths of the observed transitions and to perform lifetime measurements. Our results confirm multiple radiative pathways and matrix-induced relaxation channels affecting the 5d6s and 6s6p barium manifolds. Furthermore, we present the first lifetime measurement of the barium 5d6s 3D1 state in a neon crystal, yielding 0.39 \pm 0.02 s, with a predicted increase of about 10% at 2 K. The study of fluorescence and spectroscopic properties of barium isolated in neon represents an important step toward future searches for the electron electric dipole moment using barium monofluoride in neon matrices, where neutral barium atoms may act as unavoidable impurities and potential sources of background and systematic limitations.</description>

      <title>Verification and experimental validation of neutral atom beam source produced by L-PBF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report validation tests of a calcium atomic beam source manufactured by Laser Powder Bed Fusion (L-PBF). We quantitatively evaluated the surface quality and elemental composition of the printed part and defined reference parameters for reliable operation in ultra-high vacuum. Safe operating conditions of the atomic oven were derived from simulations and experimental measurements. The ability of the device to deliver an atomic beam to the main experimental region, the electron/ion trap, was verified via atomic fluorescence imaging.</description>

      <title>Feynman Diagrams for Matter Wave Interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11446v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new theoretical framework based on Feynman diagrams to compute phase shifts in matter wave interferometry. The method allows for analytic computation of higher order quantum corrections, beyond the traditional semi-classical approximation. These additional terms depend on the finite size of the initial matter wavefunction and/or have higher order dependence on $\hbar$. We apply the method to compute the response of matter wave interferometers to power law potentials and potentials with an arbitrary spatial dependence. The analytic expressions are validated by comparing to numerical simulations, and estimates are provided for the scale of the quantum corrections to the phase shift response to the gravitational field of the earth, anharmonic trapping potentials, and gravitational fields from local proof masses. We find that for certain experimentally feasible parameters, these corrections are large enough to be measured, and could lead to systematic errors if not accounted for. We anticipate these corrections will be especially important for trapped matter wave interferometers and for free-space matter wave interferometers in the presence of proof masses. These interferometers are becoming increasingly sensitive tools for mobile inertial sensing, gravity surveying, tests of gravity and its interplay with quantum mechanics, and searches for dark energy.</description>

      <title>Atomic and molecular systems for radiation thermometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atoms and simple molecules are excellent candidates for new standards and sensors because they are both all identical and their properties are determined by the immutable laws of quantum physics. Here, we introduce the concept of building a standard and sensor of radiative temperature using atoms and molecules. Such standards are based on precise measurement of the rate at which blackbody radiation (BBR) either excites or stimulates emission for a given atomic transition. We summarize the recent results of two experiments while detailing the rate equation models required for their interpretation. The cold atom thermometer (CAT) uses a gas of laser cooled $^{85}$Rb Rydberg atoms to probe the BBR spectrum near 130~GHz. This primary, {\it i.e.}, not traceable to a measurement of like kind, temperature measurement currently has a total uncertainty of approximately 1~\%, with clear paths toward improvement. The compact blackbody radiation atomic sensor (CoBRAS) uses a vapour of $^{85}$Rb and monitors fluorescence from states that are either populated by BBR or populated by spontaneous emission to measure the blackbody spectrum near 24.5~THz. The CoBRAS has an excellent relative precision of $u(T)\approx 0.13$~K, with a clear path toward implementing a primary</description>

      <title>Table-top all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) has emerged as a powerful technique within the field of attosecond science, combining extremely high temporal and excellent spectral resolution. So far, ATAS has been implemented in pump-probe experiments where an attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) pump or probe pulse was combined with a near-infrared (NIR) pulse in the femtosecond range, with the attosecond time resolution deriving from sub-cycle NIR-driven dynamics. Investigations of ultrafast electron dynamics in atoms, molecules and solids, with potential impact across physics, chemistry, and biology, would benefit significantly from the ability to perform all-attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (AATAS). Here we demonstrate time-resolved AATAS using a table-top high-harmonic generation (HHG) source. The method is applied to investigate previously unresolved electronic coherences in Xe, revealing oscillatory valence hole motion with a 3-femtosecond period. In addition, systematic investigations of electron dynamics in Kr, Ar, and Ne are presented. Our work shows that, thanks to its broad bandwidth, high stability and easy accessibility, HHG is an ideal source for AATAS, offering the potential for replication in numerous laboratories.</description>

      <title>Efficient Exploration of Chemical Kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating reaction rates and chemical stability is fundamental, yet efficient methods for large-scale simulations remain out of reach despite advances in modeling and exascale computing. Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability.
  This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.</description>
