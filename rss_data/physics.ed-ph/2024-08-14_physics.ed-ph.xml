      <title>Galileo's Ship and the Relativity Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is widely acknowledged that the Galilean Relativity Principle, according to which the laws of classical systems are the same in all inertial frames in relative motion, has played an important role in the development of modern physics. It is also commonly believed that this principle holds the key to answering why, for example, we do not notice the orbital velocity of the Earth as we go about our day. And yet, I argue in this paper that the precise content of this principle is ambiguous: standard presentations fail to distinguish between two principles that are ultimately inequivalent, the "External Galilean Relativity Principle" (EGRP) and the "Internal Galilean Relativity Principle" (IGRP). I demonstrate that EGRP and IGRP play distinct roles in physics and that many classical systems that satisfy IGRP fail to satisfy EGRP. I further show that the Relativity Principle introduced by Einstein in 1905-which is not restricted to classical systems-also leads to two inequivalent principles. I conclude by noting that the phenomenon originally captured by Galileo's famous ship passage is much more general than contemporary discussions in the philosophy of symmetries suggest.</description>

      <title>Visual relativistic mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many formalisms of special relativity are shown in various textbooks. However, even in those where the underlying geometry of Minkowski space is emphasized, the visualisations are lacking. This article aims to remedy this by expressing relativistic concepts in a visual manner, using the full power of hyperbolic trigonometric functions. Minkowski diagrams in energy-momentum space are used and then augmented in comparison with previous uses in literature by direct usage of triangles in Minkowski space. As a proof-of-concept for the advantages of this holistic approach, elegant new derivations of the relativistic rocket equation and the relativistic Doppler effect are presented.</description>
