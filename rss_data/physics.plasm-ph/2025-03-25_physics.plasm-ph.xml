      <title>Aligning Thermal and Current Quenches with a High Density Low-Z Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional approach for thermal quench mitigation in a tokamak disruption is through a high-Z impurity injection that radiates away the plasma's thermal energy before it reaches the wall. The downside is a robust Ohmic-to-runaway current conversion due to the radiatively clamped low post-thermal-quench electron temperature. An alternative approach is to deploy a low-Z (either deuterium or hydrogen) injection that aims to slow down the thermal quench, and ideally aligns it with the current quench. This approach has been investigated here via 3D MHD simulations using the PIXIE3D code. By boosting the hydrogen density, a fusion-grade plasma is dilutionally cooled at approximately the original pressure. Energy loss to the wall is controlled by a Bohm outflow condition at the boundary where the magnetic field intercepts a thin plasma sheath at the wall, in addition to Bremsstrahlung bulk losses. Robust MHD instabilities proceed as usual, while the collisionality of the plasma has been greatly increased and parallel transport is now in the Braginskii regime. The main conclusion of this study is that the decreased transport loss along open field lines due to a sufficient low-Z injection slows down the thermal quench rate to the order of 20 ms, aligned with the current quench timescale for a 15 MA ITER plasma.</description>

      <title>Performance prediction of fully three-dimensional solid-state propulsion systems by eigenvalue problem decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A three-component plasma fluid model that considers the presence of electrons, positive ions, and negative ions consists of a nonlinear system of partial differential equations, incorporating numerous disparate time scales both spatially and temporally, and therefore, it is known to be challenging to solve. In this study, on the basis of the model, we develop an Anemone solver capable of numerically estimating the corona inception voltage and energy conversion efficiency in a three-dimensional solid-state electroaerodynamic propulsion system. In previous research, the discharge inception voltage and initial discharge region in the governing equations were obtained by solving a large-scale eigenvalue problem based on global stability analysis. However, in this study, we employ the method of characteristics to obtain the subproblem, transforming it into a large number of smaller-scale eigenvalue problems. Furthermore, we successfully converted these eigenvalue problems into integral equations, making them easier to handle. Finally, we validated the prediction results based on the theoretical results in a previous study.</description>

      <title>T3ST code: Turbulent Transport in Tokamaks via Stochastic Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the Turbulent Transport in Tokamaks via Stochastic Trajectories (T3ST) code, designed to address the problem of turbulent transport using a statistical approach complementary to gyrokinetics. The code employs test-particle methods to track the dynamics of charged particles in axisymmetric magnetic equilibria, accounting for both turbulence and Coulomb collisions. The turbulence is decoupled from plasma dynamics and represented through a statistical ensemble of synthetic random fields with specified spectral properties. This approach enables T3ST to compute transport coefficients as Lagrangian correlations - orders of magnitude faster than gyrokinetic codes.</description>

      <title>Phase Stability Analysis of Volume-preserving Algorithms for Accurate Single Particle Orbit Simulations in Tokamak Plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Second-order Volume-preserving algorithms (VPAs) for simulating charged particle motion in electromagnetic fields have been generalized to a rotating angle formulation by using the matrix decomposition methods. Based on this method, the phase stability of this class of VPAs has been analyzed by using the Discrete Fourier Transformations (DFT) technique. It is found that two prominent VPAs, namely the $G_h^2$ and the Boris algorithm, exhibit optimal phase precision for high-frequency (gyro motion) and low-frequency dynamics (transit/bounce motion), respectively. These findings have been empirically verified through numerical experiments. The insights gained from this study enable the selection of an appropriate VPA for practical simulations based on the characteristic frequencies of specific physics problems, which can substantially enhance numerical accuracy and improve computational efficiency for long-term simulations.</description>

      <title>Coupled 2-D MHD and runaway electron fluid simulations of SPARC disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Runaway electrons (REs) generated during disruption events in tokamaks can carry mega-Ampere level currents, potentially causing damage to plasma-facing components. Understanding RE evolution during disruption events is important for evaluating strategies to mitigate RE damage. Using two-dimensional toroidally symmetric magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations in M3D-C1, which incorporates a fluid RE model evolved self-consistently with the bulk MHD fluid, we examine the seeding and avalanching of REs during disruptions in the SPARC tokamak - a compact high-field high-current device designed to achieve a fusion gain Q &gt; 2 in deuterium-tritium plasmas. The M3D-C1 simulations of unmitigated disruptions demonstrate RE plateau formation and peaking of the final current density, which agree well with the results of lower-fidelity reduced RE fluid models. This work provides the first systematic comparison and benchmarking of different primary sources, including activated tritium beta decay and Compton scattering, in SPARC disruption simulations with self-consistent MHD and RE coupling.</description>

      <title>Experimental Evidence of Vortex $\gamma$ Photons in All-Optical Inverse Compton Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortex $\gamma$ photons carrying orbital angular momenta (OAM) hold great potential for various applications. However, their generation remains a great challenge. Here, we successfully generate sub-MeV vortex $\gamma$ photons via all-optical inverse Compton scattering of relativistic electrons colliding with a sub-relativistic Laguerre-Gaussian laser. In principle, directly measuring the OAM of $\gamma$ photons is challenging due to their incoherence and extremely short wavelength. Therein, we put forward a novel method to determine the OAM properties by revealing the quantum opening angle of vortex $\gamma$ photons, since vortex particles exhibit not only a spiral phase but also transverse momentum according to the quantum electrodynamics theory. Thus,$\gamma$ photons carrying OAM anifest a much larger angular distribution than those without OAM, which has been clearly observed in our experiments. This angular expansion is considered as an overall effect lying beyond classical theory. Our method provides the first experimental evidence for detecting vortex $\gamma$ photons and opens a new perspective for investigating OAM-induced quantum phenomena in broad fields.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of three-dimensional Yukawa or dust crystals from molecular dynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16335v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents the calculation of elastic properties of three-dimensional Yukawa or dust crystals using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The elastic properties are computed by deforming (compressing/expanding) the dust crystals along different directions. The stress and strain of the deformed crystal are used to calculate elastic properties. The bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Poisson's ratio are determined as a function of shielding parameter $\kappa$ and strong coupling parameter $\Gamma$. The bulk and shear modulus values at 0 K temperature are consistent with the previous literature results, while the finite-temperature results are new. The finite-temperature bulk modulus of Yukawa crystals is found to be higher than that of 0 K crystals. The shear modulus of the Yukawa solids decreases nonlinearly near the solid-liquid boundary in the premelting region. The Poisson's ratio of Yukawa crystals changes sharply at the solid-liquid boundary, emphasizing its potential for identifying phase transitions and assessing incompressibility in Yukawa systems. The bulk and shear moduli calculated in this paper are useful for determining accurate values of sound and shear velocity in Yukawa systems across a wide range of the ($\kappa$, $\Gamma$) parameter space.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Collisional Losses from a Magnetic Mirror Using the Lenard-Bernstein Collision Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Collisions are crucial in governing particle and energy transport in plasmas confined in a magnetic mirror trap. Modern gyrokinetic codes model transport in magnetic mirrors, but some utilize approximate model collision operators. This study focuses on a Pastukhov-style method of images calculation of particle and energy confinement times using a Lenard-Bernstein model collision operator. Prior work on parallel particle and energy balances used a different Fokker-Planck plasma collision operator. The method must be extended in non-trivial ways to study the Lenard-Bernstein operator. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we compare our results with a modern finite element solver. Our findings reveal that the particle confinement time scales like $a \exp(a^2)$ using the Lenard-Bernstein operator, in contrast to the more accurate scaling that the Coulomb collision operator would yield $a^2 \exp(a^2)$, where $a^2$ is approximately proportional to the ambipolar potential. We propose that codes solving for collisional losses in magnetic mirrors utilizing the Lenard-Bernstein or Dougherty collision operator scale their collision frequency of any electrostatically confined species. This study illuminates the collision operator's intricate role in the Pastukhov-style method of images calculation of collisional confinement.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric model for 1-color laser filament THz emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A 3D axisymmetric model for laser beam propagation in air is proposed for use with THz emission calculations. The model accounts for nonlinear propagation of the femtosecond pulse that generates the filament (Kerr self-focusing and plasma defocusing). The formalism proposed can be applied across a broad range of experimental parameters - focal lengths, beam profiles, and intensities. We adapt existing models of 1-color THz emission for use with the beam propagation model to calculate THz emission signatures. Two of these THz emission models are used - a 1D model and a more detailed 3D axisymmetric model. For the test case considered, nonlinear propagation dynamics have a large impact on the amplitude of the THz signal, but only a minimal impact on the frequency content and angular distribution of the signal.</description>

      <title>A Grad-Shafranov model for compact quasisymmetric stellarators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Grad-Shafranov equation (GSE) valid for compact quasisymmetric stellarators is derived by an asymptotic expansion around a vacuum field carried to first order. We obtain an equation for the existence of flux surfaces leading up to the GSE. The flux surface label must simultaneously satisfy the existence equation and the GSE, which generally leads to an overdetermined problem. We show how the overdetermined problem can be resolved within our model for a class of hybrid devices similar to that studied by Henneberg and Plunk (S. Henneberg and G. Plunk, PRR 2024). We are also able to solve the existence equation for flux surfaces analytically in the most general case by introducing a special coordinate system. This will enable us to carry out an optimization seeking to minimize the error in our GSE while obeying the flux surface existence equation, which will allow us to find solutions outside the class of hybrid devices. This will allow for a coarse-grained approximate search in the space of quasisymmetric equilibria that should be faster than a conventional stellarator optimization. Nevertheless, it would still be necessary to fine-tune the approximate solutions using conventional tools to obtain a more precise optimized equilibrium.</description>
