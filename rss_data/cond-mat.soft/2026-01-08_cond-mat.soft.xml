      <title>Polymorph Selection in Charged Colloids in the Second Nucleation Step</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study polymorph selection in a model of charged colloids, with a focus on the higher-order structure prior to and during nucleation. Specifically, we carry out molecular dynamics simulations of a repulsive Yukawa system with a slightly softened (Weeks-Chandler-Andersen) core. We consider the case where the interaction is long-ranged and the BCC crystal is stable, and also intermediate- and short-ranged cases where the FCC crystal is stable. We use two methods for structure identification, the topological cluster classification (TCC) [A. Malins et al., J. Chem. Phys. 139, 234506 (2013)] and the bond orientational order parameter analysis of W. Lechner and C. Dellago [J. Chem. Phys.129, 114707 (2008)]. Under conditions of high supersaturation, appropriate to experiments with colloids, we find that the system forms a precursor state in which the particles are hexagonally ordered. ~That is to say, the precursors are indistinguishable from an HCP crystal using the bond orientational order parameters. This ordering occurs at state points both when the body-centred cubic crystal is the stable phase, and also when the face-centred cubic crystal is stable. In all cases, the stable polymorph forms from the precursor phase in a second stage. Although at freezing, the fluid is very much more ordered when the interactions are short-ranged (when FCC is stable), at the supersaturations where nucleation occurs in our simulations, the higher-order structure of the metastable fluids is almost identical for the long-, short-, and intermediate-ranged systems when measured with the TCC.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials under uniform shear flow: comparison with simplified model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a kinetic-theory framework to investigate the steady rheology of a dilute gas interacting via a repulsive potential under uniform shear flow. Starting from the Boltzmann equation with a restitution coefficient that depends on the impact velocity and potential strength, we derive evolution equations for the stress tensor based on Grad's moment expansion. The resulting expressions for the collisional rates and transport coefficients are fitted with simple analytical functions that capture their temperature dependence over a wide range of shear rates. Comparison with direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results shows excellent quantitative agreement for the shear stress, temperature anisotropy, and steady viscosity. We also analyze the velocity distribution functions, revealing that the system remains nearly Maxwellian even under strong shear.</description>

      <title>Shape Elasticity in Colloidal Bent-Core Liquid Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Curved particles have been shown to stabilize a range of states with unique order in dense suspensions of colloidal bent core liquid crystals. The shape of the colloidal rods encourages the formation of curved director fields. However, states of constant bend cannot uniformly fill either two or three dimensional Euclidean space and are therefore geometrically frustrated. As a result, curved rods are forced to couple their preference for bend with additional twist and splay deformations, giving rise to twist-bend and splay-bend states of nematic and smectic order. In this article, we study the effect of rod curvature on these diverse states of liquid crystalline order using molecular dynamics simulations of a bonded particle model of curved rods with tunable shape elasticity. Focusing on the case of intermediately curved rods, we find that curved rods go through a sequence of isotropic, nematic twist-bend and smectic splay-bend ordering as the density is increased from the dilute limit, in agreement with previous studies of rigid rods. As the rods become more elastic, the critical concentration separating these phases is shifted to higher density. Lastly, we find that flexibility weakens the first-order phase transition separating the isotropic and nematic twist-bend phases.</description>

      <title>Ghost-Mode Filtered Fluctuating Lattice Boltzmann Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuating lattice Boltzmann solvers are widely employed to model mesoscopic fluid behavior in soft-matter systems, including colloidal suspensions and dilute polymer solutions. Despite their utility, these methods can lose accuracy and stability when non-hydrodynamic modes interfere with the dynamics, especially in single--relaxation-time schemes. Here, we introduce a ghost-mode filtered fluctuating lattice Boltzmann method (GMF-FLBM) for the D3Q27 lattice, obtained by selectively eliminating the propagation of the ghost deterministic content while preserving the necessary stochastic forcing. We show, over a broad range of relaxation times, that GMF-FLBM recovers the amplitudes of equilibrium fluctuations with a comparable accuracy as a fully regularized high-order formulation, while requiring only minor adjustments to the conventional BGK collision framework.</description>

      <title>Two Charging Mechanisms in Contact Electrification of Liquid and Ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microscopic and fundamental origin of slide electrification, where droplets of water move across insulating surfaces accumulating and depositing electrical charges, is still debated. Charge transfer is often attributed to ion transfer at the receding contact line. However, it is still unclear whether ion transfer alone can fully account for the observed charge separation. We examined slide electrification of two polar, self-ionizing liquids (water, formamide) and two non-polar liquids (diiodomethane, bromonaphthalene). By cooling below the melting temperature, we were able to compare this process to tribocharging of the respective frozen components. Despite having ions immobilized at sub-freezing temperatures, the ice of the polar liquids continues to accumulate significant charge. Non-polar liquids exhibit lower charging (&lt;25% of polar liquids) and nearly identical charging behaviour in both their liquid and frozen phases on five different substrates. Since non-polar liquids contain few free ions, these observations indicate an alternative charging mechanism, which could be electron transfer. Our findings suggest that slide electrification operates through two mechanisms, with the dominant charge transfer pathway shifting between ions and electron transfer depending on the electronegativity, phase, and temperature.</description>

      <title>Clustering Dynamics of SiO2-Pt Active Janus Colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active colloid clustering is central to understanding non-equilibrium self-organization, with implications for programmable active materials and synthetic or biological assemblies. While most prior studies have focused on dimers or small aggregates, the dynamics of larger clusters remain relatively unexplored. Here, we experimentally investigate chemically active, monodisperse SiO2-Pt Janus colloid (JC) clusters as large as n=9 in a dynamic clustering regime, where clusters continuously form, dissolve, and merge as swimmer density increases. We show that clusters move in circular trajectories, and that both their translational and rotational dynamics can be predicted directly from the orientations of constituent JCs. Furthermore, we identify that their formation undergoes a mechanistic transition: while small clusters are mediated by chemical interactions, larger clusters are predominantly formed by steric effects. This transition arises from a mismatch of motilities between incoming JCs and clusters, combined with increased Pt-surface exposure. Our results extend prior dimer-focused studies to larger aggregates and establish a predictive description that bridges individual swimmer behavior with collective dynamics.</description>

      <title>Transport properties in a model of confined granular mixtures at moderate densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work derives the Navier--Stokes hydrodynamic equations for a model of a confined, quasi-two-dimensional, $s$-component mixture of inelastic, smooth, hard spheres. Using the inelastic version of the revised Enskog theory, macroscopic balance equations for mass, momentum, and energy are obtained, and constitutive equations for the fluxes are determined through a first-order Chapman--Enskog expansion. As for elastic collisions, the transport coefficients are given in terms of the solutions of a set of coupled linear integral equations. Approximate solutions to these equations for diffusion transport coefficients and shear viscosity are achieved by assuming steady-state conditions and considering leading terms in a Sonine polynomial expansion. These transport coefficients are expressed in terms of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses and diameters of the mixture's components, and the system's density. The results apply to moderate densities and are not limited to particular values of the coefficients of restitution, concentration, mass, and/or diameter ratios. As an application, the thermal diffusion factor is evaluated to analyze segregation driven by temperature gradients and gravity, providing criteria that distinguish whether larger particles accumulate near the hotter or colder boundaries.</description>

      <title>Modulus and confinement effects on self-repeating, power-amplified snapping of soft, swollen beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latch-mediated Spring Actuation (LaMSA) is a mechanism found in nature, employed by organisms that generate the highest levels of power density through repeatable, rapid energy release. While LaMSA has been used in engineered systems like archery bows, catapults, and jumping robots, most such technologies require external power for self-repeating motion. Recent advances in soft actuators have demonstrated that engineered gels swollen with a volatile solvent are capable of self-repeating, high specific-power generation by taking advantage of balances between environmental interaction (evaporation) and elasticity. These systems rely upon snap-through instabilities. Due to the complex coupling between material properties and geometry, both of which evolve as self-repeating motion continues, an understanding of how polymer properties and boundary conditions control the lifetime, count, and magnitude of power generating events for a given amount of solvent remains unrealized. We overcome the challenges in characterizing the performance of evaporation-driven, power-generating gels by measuring accumulating force response from evaporation in parallel with the profile deformation of the structure. By optimizing the balance between swelling properties and elasticity, the lifetime of snapping is increased by 445% from previous literature, snapping at a maximum power density of about 87 W/kg. This power is achieved with swollen beams 50 mm in length after 53 mg of solvent had evaporated and is comparable to the power output of adult jumping mantises at 68 W/kg at a similar size scale.1 We develop scaling relationships that balance Flory-Rehner swelling theory with buckling mechanics to generate insight into optimizing lifetime and power of autonomous power-generating systems.</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: Part II -- Network-level mechanisms and emergent dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the phenomenological and microscopic models reviewed in Part I, this second part focuses on network-level mechanisms that generate emergent temperature response curves. We review deterministic models in which temperature modulates the kinetics of coupled biochemical reactions, as well as stochastic frameworks, such as Markov chains, that capture more complex multi-step processes. These approaches show how Arrhenius-like temperature dependence at the level of individual reactions is transformed into non-Arrhenius scaling, thermal limits, and temperature compensation at the system level. Together, network-level models provide a mechanistic bridge between empirical temperature response curves and the molecular organization of biological systems, giving us predictive insights into robustness, perturbations, and evolutionary constraints.</description>

      <title>Interplay of activity and non-reciprocity in tracer dynamics: From non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation to giant diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions play a key role in shaping transport in active and passive systems, giving rise to striking nonequilibrium behavior. Here, we study the dynamics of a tracer -- active or passive -- embedded in a bath of active or passive particles, coupled through non-reciprocal interactions. Starting from the microscopic stochastic dynamics of the full system, we derive an overdamped generalized Langevin equation for the tracer, incorporating a non-Markovian memory kernel that captures bath-mediated correlations. This framework enables us to compute the tracer's velocity and displacement response, derive a generalized nonequilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relation that quantifies deviations from equilibrium behavior, and determine the mean-squared displacement (MSD). We find that while the MSD becomes asymptotically diffusive, the effective diffusivity depends non-monotonically on the degree of non-reciprocity and diverges at an intermediate value. This regime of giant diffusivity provides a generic mechanism for enhanced transport in active soft matter and has direct implications for biological systems exhibiting chase-and-run or predator-prey interactions. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations of active Brownian particles, highlighting experimentally accessible signatures of non-reciprocal interactions in soft matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates govern essential cellular processes yet elude description by traditional equilibrium models. This roadmap, distilled from structured discussions at a workshop and reflecting the consensus of its participants, clarifies key concepts for researchers, funding bodies, and journals. After unifying terminology that often separates disciplines, we outline the core physics of condensate formation, review their biological roles, and identify outstanding challenges in nonequilibrium theory, multiscale simulation, and quantitative in-cell measurements. We close with a forward-looking outlook to guide coordinated efforts toward predictive, experimentally anchored understanding and control of biomolecular condensates.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Long Wavelength Mermin-Wagner Fluctuations in Active Crystals and Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two-dimensions (2D), the Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg (MWH) fluctuation plays a significant role, giving rise to striking dimensionality effects marked by long-range density fluctuations leading to the singularities of various dynamical properties. According to the MWH theorem, a 2D equilibrium system with continuous degrees of freedom cannot achieve long-range crystalline order at non-zero temperatures. Recently, MWH fluctuations have been observed in glass-forming liquids, evidenced by the logarithmic divergence in the plateau value of mean squared displacement (MSD). Our research investigates long-wavelength fluctuations in crystalline and glassy systems influenced by non-equilibrium active noises. Active systems serve as a minimal model for understanding diverse non-equilibrium dynamics, such as those in biological systems and self-propelled colloids. We demonstrate that fluctuations from active forces can strongly couple with long-wavelength density fluctuations, altering the lower critical dimension ($d_l$) from $2$ to $3$ and leading to a novel logarithmic divergence of the MSD plateau with system size in 3D.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a data-driven framework for learning hydrodynamic equations from particle-based simulations of active matter. Our method leverages coarse-graining in both space and time to bridge microscopic particle dynamics with macroscopic continuum models. By employing spectral representations and sparse regression, we efficiently estimate partial differential equations (PDEs) that capture collective behaviors such as flocking and phase separation. This approach, validated using hydrodynamic descriptions of the Vicsek model and Active Brownian particles, demonstrates the potential of data-driven strategies to uncover the universal features of collective dynamics in active matter systems.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous transition to active nematic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Active fluids exhibit chaotic flows at low Reynolds number known as active turbulence. Whereas the statistical properties of the chaotic flows are increasingly well understood, the nature of the transition from laminar to turbulent flows as activity increases remains unclear. Here, through simulations of a minimal model of unbounded and defect-free active nematics, we find that the transition to active turbulence is discontinuous. We show that the transition features a jump in the mean-squared velocity, as well as bistability and hysteresis between laminar and chaotic flows. From distributions of finite-time Lyapunov exponents, we identify the transition at a value $A^*\approx 4900$ of the dimensionless activity number. Below the transition to chaos, we find subcritical bifurcations that feature bistability of different laminar patterns. These bifurcations give rise to oscillations and to chaotic transients, which become very long close to the transition to turbulence. Overall, our findings contrast with the continuous transition to turbulence in channel confinement, where turbulent puffs emerge within a laminar background. We propose that, without confinement, the long-range hydrodynamic interactions of Stokes flow suppress the spatial coexistence of different flow states, and thus render the transition discontinuous.</description>

      <title>libMobility: A Python library for hydrodynamics at the Smoluchowski level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02135</link>

Abstract: Effective hydrodynamic modeling is crucial for accurately predicting fluid-particle interactions in diverse fields such as biophysics and materials science. Developing and implementing hydrodynamic algorithms is challenging due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, necessitating efficient management of large-scale computations and sophisticated boundary conditions. Furthermore, adapting these algorithms for use on massively parallel architectures like GPUs adds an additional layer of complexity. This paper presents the libMobility software library, which offers a suite of CUDA-enabled solvers for simulating hydrodynamic interactions in particulate systems at the Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa (RPY) level. The library facilitates precise simulations of particle displacements influenced by external forces and torques, including both the deterministic and stochastic components. Notable features of libMobility include its ability to handle linear and angular displacements, thermal fluctuations, and various domain geometries effectively. With an interface in Python, libMobility provides comprehensive tools for researchers in computational fluid dynamics and related fields to simulate particle mobility efficiently. This article details the technical architecture, functionality, and wide-ranging applications of libMobility. libMobility is available at https://github.com/stochasticHydroTools/libMobility.</description>

      <title>Strong anchoring boundary conditions in nematic liquid crystals: Higher-order corrections to the Oseen-Frank limit and a revised small-domain theory</title>

Abstract: Strong anchoring boundary conditions are conventionally modelled by imposing Dirichlet conditions on the order parameter in Landau--de Gennes theory, neglecting the finite surface energy of realistic anchoring. This work revisits the strong anchoring limit for nematic liquid crystals in confined two-dimensional domains. By explicitly retaining a Rapini-Papoular surface energy and adopting a scaling where the extrapolation length $l_{ex}$ is comparable to the coherence length $\xi$, we analyse both the small-domain ($\epsilon = h/\xi\to 0$; $h$ is the domain size) and Oseen-Frank $(\epsilon \to \infty$) asymptotic regimes. In the small-domain limit, the leading-order equilibrium solution is given by the average of the boundary data, which can vanish in symmetrically frustrated geometries, leading to isotropic melting. In the large-domain limit, matched asymptotic expansions reveal that surface anchoring introduces an $O(1/\epsilon)$ correction to the director field near boundaries, in contrast to the $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ correction predicted by Dirichlet conditions. The analysis captures the detailed structure of interior and boundary defects, showing that mixed (Robin-type) boundary conditions yield smoother defect cores and more physical predictions than rigid Dirichlet conditions. Numerical solutions for square and circular wells with tangential anchoring illustrate the differences between the two boundary condition treatments, particularly in defect morphology. The results demonstrate that a consistent treatment of anchoring energetics is essential for accurate modelling of nematic equilibria in micro- and nano-scale confined geometries.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Line Energy of a Topological Phase</title>

Abstract: In interacting topological systems, Landau-like order parameters interplay with the band topology of fermions. The physics of domain formation in such systems can get significantly altered due to the presence of topological fermions. In this work we show that coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field can drastically modify the nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets of the scalar field leads to substantial quantum corrections to the interface energy. This leads to an increase in the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively demonstrate that topological phases have a characteristic quantum correction to the interfacial line energy. Apart from material systems, our work opens up a host of questions regarding the impact of fermionic topological terms on classical phase transitions and associated criticality.</description>
