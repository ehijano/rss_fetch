      <title>Extracting light-cone wave functions from covariant amplitudes: a detailed study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a conjectured formula that systematically maps covariant off-shell amplitudes to light-cone wave functions in scalar field theory. Through an explicit comparison at one-loop accuracy, we establish its equivalence to the light-cone perturbation theory series, thereby validating the conjecture at this order. Applying this formula, we efficiently re-derive wave functions from known covariant amplitudes, bypassing both the conceptual complexities of light-cone quantization and the technical challenges of perturbative calculations in this framework. In addition to simplifying computations, this approach opens new avenues for applications in gauge theories and deeper explorations of the fundamental equivalence between covariant and light-cone quantization.</description>

      <title>On Gauging Finite Symmetries by Higher Gauging Condensation Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the work by C{\'o}rdova-Costa-Hsin (arXiv:2412.16681), we propose an EFT-style, Lagrangian procedure to gauge finite 0-form symmetries in untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories on closed oriented manifolds using higher gauging condensation defects and point out its limitations. Using this proposal, we construct effective actions of untwisted Dijkgraaf-Witten theories with Heisenberg gauge group over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ and show that the braiding data from Hopf link and the fusion rules match with the expected discrete gauge theories. We also study the symTFT implications of these effective Lagrangians and clarify their relations with higher group global symmetries.</description>

      <title>Higher-form symmetries in supergravity, scalar charges and black-hole thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Minimal 5-dimensional supergravity compactified on a circle gives the T$^{3}$ model of $\mathcal{N}=2,d=4$ supergravity, whose duality group is SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$. We study exhaustively the relations between all the local and global symmetries of both theories and between the corresponding conserved currents and charges, including the on-shell closed generalized Komar charges associated to isometries. We find that the 2-dimensional subgroup of SL$(2,\mathbb{R})$ that does not include electric-magnetic transformations is realized as a higher-form symmetry group that acts on the 5-dimensional metric and vector field. Using the generalized Komar charges we compute the Smarr formulas for black holes, showing that they are identical once the relations between all the 5- and 4-dimensional thermodynamical quantities are taken into account, which is only possible if certain constraints on the fields are satisfied. We notice that on-shell closed 5-dimensional 3-form charges give, upon dimensional reduction, on-shell closed 3-form currents and 2-form charges. The dimensional reduction of the 5-dimensional generalized Komar 3-form charge associated to a Killing vector gives a new 4-dimensional on-shell closed 3-form current which must be associated to a new global symmetry of the theory when it admits that Killing vector. Some of the results that we have derived are valid for theories of Einstein--Maxwell-like theories of $(p+1)$-forms with Chern--Simons terms, which includes 11-dimensional supergravity as a particular example.</description>

      <title>Affine Symmetry and the Group-Theoretic Basis of the Unruh Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A massless scalar field in two spacetime dimensions splits into two independent sectors of left and right-moving modes on the light cone. At the quantum level, these two sectors carry a representation of the group of affine transformations of the real line, with translations corresponding to transformations generated by light-cone momenta and dilations given by light-cone Rindler momenta formed by a linear combination of generators of boosts and dilations. One-particle states for inertial observers are eigenvectors of translation generators belonging to irreducible representations of the affine group. Rindler one-particle states are related to eigenfunctions of the generator of dilations. We show that simple manipulations connecting these two representations involving the Mellin transform can be used to derive the thermal spectrum of Rindler particles observed by an accelerated observer. Beyond providing a representation-theoretic basis for vacuum thermal effects, our results suggest that analogous phenomena may arise in any quantum system admitting realizations of translation and dilation eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Super-Giants in Gutowski-Reall Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present all bosonic giant and dual-giant type configurations of a probe D3-brane in the BPS single-parameter Gutowski-Reall black hole in 10d type IIB supergravity that do not break any of its supersymmetries. The resulting D3-brane world-volumes can be given by the common zeros of three holomorphic functions of five complex scalar harmonics of the geometry. These probe branes support world-volume electromagnetic fields which we characterise completely in terms of pull-backs of closed 2-forms. Our configurations can be seen as natural generalisations of known supersymmetric D3-branes in $AdS_5 \times S^5$ and approach them far away from the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Schwinger-Keldysh Cosmological Cutting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the realisation of unitarity-based cutting rules for primordial cosmological correlators computed within the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral formalism. While cutting rules have been previously derived for wavefunction coefficients, here we examine them directly at the level of cosmological observables expressed diagrammatically. The resulting rules closely resemble those familiar from flat-space scattering amplitudes, but with an additional subtlety: in order to express the discontinuity of a correlator as the product of lower-order correlators, one must introduce a specific combinations of diagrams which do not appear in the computation of observables themselves. We explicitly verify these rules for several classes of correlators, both at tree level and with loop corrections, arising from theories involving different types of interactions.</description>

      <title>The species scale and the refined TCC bound in time-dependent backgrounds of string theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The species scale is the energy scale at which quantum corrections to Einstein's theory of gravity become significant. In many cases, this scale corresponds to the string mass scale, which can be much lower than the Planck scale in the weak coupling limit. In this note, we explore a variant of the TCC conjecture, which we refer to as the refined TCC. This version is related to the species scale as a new cutoff in quantum gravity, and we study whether stringy modes remain stringy and never exceed the Hubble horizon. The refined TCC predicts a shorter lifetime for de-Sitter spacetime and imposes a bound on the cosmological constant. We present supporting evidence for the refined TCC from cosmological solutions of different compactifications of various string theories. Furthermore, it is argued that both the TCC and the refined TCC are incompatible with the big-bang singularity. Therefore, if the TCC and the refined TCC hold, the big bang singularity must be ruled out. In scenarios such as string gas cosmology, where the TCC is realized, the spacetime background remains completely regular.</description>

      <title>Chiral Higher Spin Gravity From Strong Homotopy Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this thesis, we derive the equations of motion of Chiral Higher Spin Gravity (HiSGRA) in terms of its underlying $L_\infty$-algebra. Chiral HiSGRA contains self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity as closed subsectors, which themselves form closed subsectors of Yang-Mills and general relativity. We begin by constructing a covariant formulation for self-dual Yang-Mills and self-dual gravity, and subsequently extend this construction to the full Chiral Higher Spin Gravity.
  Remarkably, the $L_\infty$-algebra is constructed from an $A_\infty$-algebra of pre-Calabi-Yau type, suggesting a deep connection to non-commutative deformation quantization. The structure maps of the resulting $L_\infty$-algebra are expressed as integrals of a simple exponential over convex polygons in $\mathbb{R}^2$. The existence of this covariant and coordinate independent formulation of chiral HiSGRA demonstrates, via the AdS/CFT correspondence, that $O(N)$ vector models possess a closed chiral subsector.
  Finally, we prove that the $A_\infty$-algebra follows from Stokes' theorem -- a crucial feature of the known formality theorems. To this end, we construct integration spaces that generalize convex polygons to $\mathbb{R}^3$, and are intimately connected to positive Grassmanians. This Stokes-based derivation points towards a novel generalization of Kontsevich' formality theorem to the non-commutative setting.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the two-field scalar and spinor Quantum Electrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first systematic resurgent analysis of the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics for the most general constant background field configuration. In contrast to the extensively studied single-field cases, the two-field case exhibits unique asymptotic structures, leading to a substantially richer pattern of singularities in the Borel plane. Explicit large-order asymptotic formulas for the weak-field coefficients in both spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics are derived. These reveal a nontrivial interplay between alternating and non-alternating factorial growth, governed by distinct structures associated with electric and magnetic contributions, and smoothly interpolating between the known single-field limits. Using Borel dispersion techniques, we demonstrate that the complete instanton structure underlying Schwinger pair production in two-field backgrounds is encoded in the divergent perturbative coefficients. We then construct resurgent approximants using Pad\`e-Borel and Pad\`e-Conformal-Borel resummation schemes adapted to the two-field case. For the spinor case, conformal improvement results in a significant enhancement in reconstructing both the real and imaginary parts of the effective Lagrangian across a wide range of field ratios, accurately capturing the subtle sign-changing features in the strong-field regime. In the scalar case, it yields only marginal improvement. Detailed comparisons with exact special-function representations demonstrate the reliability of reconstructions from a modest number of weak-field coefficients. This work establishes a natural completion of the resurgence programme for constant electromagnetic backgrounds, providing a robust analytic framework for exploring nonperturbative physics and strong-field phenomena in spinor and scalar quantum electrodynamics, from finite perturbative data.</description>

      <title>Physical constraints on the MSS chaos-bound in black hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chaotic motion near black holes has recently been examined through the lens of the Maldacena-Shenker-Stanford (MSS) chaos-bound, but reported violations remain contradictory. A major source of this ambiguity lies in the common practice of treating the angular momentum of test particles as a freely adjustable parameter, rather than a quantity fixed by the circular-orbit conditions. In this work, we develop a fully constrained framework in which the angular momentum of particles is determined exactly from the underlying geometry and is used consistently in both the orbital and Lyapunov analyses. For the charged Kiselev black hole, previously reported chaos-bound violations disappear under a consistent treatment of angular momentum, indicating that these effects are apparent rather than physical. This inference is reinforced by the exact agreement between our results and the standard circular-orbit condition obtained from the effective-potential approach. By extending the analysis to geometries containing higher-order curvature terms, we find genuine chaos-bound violations at large charge-to-mass ratios, originating from curvature corrections rather than orbital parameters. This framework, therefore, provides a systematic means of distinguishing apparent from physical chaos-bound violations in Einstein gravity and its extensions.</description>

      <title>Two point amplitude for closed superstrings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a prescription for computing the tree-level two-point amplitude of closed strings in the pure spinor superstring formalism, thereby completing the analysis of such superstring amplitudes. The construction relies on fixing the residual conformal Killing group using a mostly BRST-exact operator that has been successfully applied in the open-string case. Earlier attempts at a straightforward extension to closed strings--treating them na\"ively as products of open strings--fail. Nevertheless, we show that a consistent prescription can be obtained by replacing the open-string BRST charge with the closed-string BRST charge. The key idea is to employ closed-string vertex operators with nonstandard ghost-number assignments, rather than the conventional ghost-number (1,1) vertices. Furthermore, since the pure spinor BRST cohomology for closed strings vanishes at total (left plus right) ghost number four or higher, we find that the resulting prescription is essentially unique.</description>

      <title>On The Consistent Supersymmetric Reduction Of Heterotic Supergravity With Geometrically Arising Yang-Mills Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper arXiv:2501.04771, a novel compactification of heterotic supergravity on a warped product of $\R\times T^{1,1}$ was constructed, where $T^{1,1}$ is a five-dimensional coset space $(SU(2)\times SU(2))/U(1)$. It was shown that this admits a four dimensional Minkowski vacuum solution with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry, and furthermore that in the bosonic sector there exists a remarkable fully consistent truncation in which the gauge bosons of the $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ isometries of the $T^{1,1}$ are retained. In this paper, we examine this reduction further, and show that the consistency can be extended to include the fermionic sector also. Thus the heterotic theory admits a consistent reduction to give an ungauged ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity coupled to $SU(2)\times SU(2)$ Yang-Mills multiplets and a scalar multiplet.</description>

      <title>Integrability and the spectrum of two-dimensional fishnet CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a closed set of equations for the spectrum of two-dimensional bi-scalar fishnet conformal field theory, comprising Baxter equations and quantisation conditions, which we derive operatorially from the underlying sl(2) spin chain. These equations are reminiscent of the Quantum Spectral Curve (QSC) framework found in other holographic CFTs and are expected to provide a complete non-perturbative description of the spectrum at arbitrary coupling. We solve the QSC numerically at finite coupling and uncover a rich analytic structure, including state collisions and complex energy levels. Analytically, we introduce a new method to derive the Asymptotic Bethe Ansatz equations, which control the spectrum up to wrapping order and incorporate spinning states. We further extend our results to the twisted case, which may be particularly useful for future separation of variables analyses of correlation functions in this theory.</description>

      <title>Generalised Entanglement Entropies from Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce generalisations of von Neumann entanglement entropy that are invariant with respect to certain scale transformations. These constructions are based on Unit-Invariant Singular Value Decomposition (UISVD) with its right-, left-, and bi-invariant incarnations, which itself are variations of the standard Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) that remain invariant under (appropriate set of) diagonal transformations. These measures are naturally defined for non-Hermitian or rectangular operators and remain useful when the input and output spaces possess different dimensions or metric weights. We apply the UISVD entropy and discuss its advantages in the physically interesting framework of Biorthogonal Quantum Mechanics, whose important aspect is indeed the behavior under scale transformations. Further, we illustrate features of UISVD-based entropies in other representative settings, from simple quantum mechanical bipartite states to random matrices relevant to quantum chaos and holography, and in the context of Chern-Simons theory. In all cases, the UISVD yields stable, physically meaningful entropic spectra that are invariant under rescalings and normalisations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the presence of families of exact solutions for a complex scalar field that behaves according to the rules of discrete $Z_N$ symmetry. Since the family of models is exactly solved, the results appear to be of interest to integrability, to build junctions and networks of localized structures and to describe scalar dark matter in high energy physics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For simple, simply-connected compact Lie groups, Dynkin embedding indices obey a universal scaling law with a direct topological meaning. Given an inclusion $f:G\hookrightarrow H$, the Dynkin embedding index $j_f$ is characterized equivalently by the induced maps on $\pi_3$ and on the canonical generators of $H^3$, $H^4(B{-})$, and $H^4(\Sigma{-})$. Consequently, $j_f$ controls instanton-number scaling, the quantization levels of Chern--Simons and Wess--Zumino--Witten terms, and the matching of gauge couplings and one-loop RG scales. We connect this picture to representation theory via the $\beta$-construction in topological $K$-theory, relating Dynkin indices to Chern characters through Harris' degree--$3$ formula and Naylor's suspended degree--$4$ refinement. Finally, we apply these results to F-theory to explain the prevalence of index-one matter: we propose a ``genericity heuristic'' where geometry favors regular embeddings (typically $j_f=1$) associated with minimal singularity enhancements, while higher-index embeddings require non-generic tuning.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Decay around Black Holes formed from Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We re-examine the problem of vacuum decay in the presence of spherically symmetric black holes. Within the semiclassical approximation, we study configurations describing a bubble of true vacuum propagating outside a black hole formed from gravitational collapse. We find that the saddle point is dominated by a single energy state and that the dependence on the initial conditions in the stellar interior vanishes exponentially fast at late stages of the collapse. Prescriptions are given for implementing the corresponding boundary conditions in the eternal black-hole geometry. We find that vacuum decay can only be weakly catalyzed by the black hole, as the suppression exponent attains a minimum at a finite black-hole mass. In the limit of vanishing black-hole mass, the suppression smoothly approaches the flat-space result.</description>

      <title>Phase Space Formulation of S-matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an exact relation between the S-symplectomorphism and the S-matrix by means of the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics. The adjoint action of the S-matrix defines a fuzzy diffeomorphism on phase space whose classical limit is the S-symplectomorphism. The relation between classical and quantum eikonals is immediate via $\hbar$-deformation of each Poisson bracket in the Magnus formula. Diagrammatic computation of quantum eikonal is illustrated for quantizations in both symmetric and normal orderings.</description>

      <title>Torus Knots and Minimal Models Revisited : Rational VOA characters from non-hyperbolic knots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2003, Hikami and Kirillov uncovered an intriguing connection between torus knots $\mathcal{K}_{(P,Q)}$ and Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(P,Q)$ by relating the Kashaev invariants of the knots to the characters of the corresponding minimal models. In this work, we recover and extend this connection by combining the 3D--3D correspondence with a bulk--boundary correspondence. More concretely, we study the 3D $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theories associated with torus-knot complements via the Dimofte--Gaiotto--Gukov construction and show that, in the infrared, these theories either flow to a unitary TQFT (when $|P-Q| = 1$), whose boundary chiral algebra reproduces that of the associated unitary minimal model, or to a 3D $\mathcal{N}=4$ rank-0 SCFT (when $|P-Q| &gt; 1$), which realizes the corresponding non-unitary chiral minimal model at the boundary after an appropriate topological twist. This framework yields new Nahm-sum-like expressions for the characters of Virasoro minimal models and other related rational conformal field theories, providing a systematic algorithm for constructing characters of rational VOAs directly from the combinatorial data of an ideal triangulation of a non-hyperbolic knot complement.</description>

      <title>Bosonic and Fermionic love number of static acoustic black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute static ($\omega\to0$) tilde Love numbers for scalar ($s=0$) and Dirac ($s=1/2$) perturbations of static acoustic black holes (ABHs) in (3+1) and (2+1) dimensions respectively. By imposing horizon regularity condition and matching to the large-radius expansion, we extract the ratio between decaying and growing modes. It turns out that in (3+1) dimensions the scalar Love number is generically nonzero for ABHs, while the Fermionic Love numbers follow a universal power-law form $F^{\pm1/2}_{\ell m}=\pm 4^{-(\ell+1/2)}$. In (2+1) dimensions the scalar field exhibits a strange logarithmic structure, causing the Bosonic Love number to vanish for even $m$ but remain nontrivial for odd $m$; In contrast, the Fermionic Love number in this case retains a simple power-law form $F_m=4^{-m}$ and is generically nonzero. These results provide insights into tidal response in analogue gravity systems and highlight qualitative differences between integer- and half-integer-spin fields.</description>

      <title>Universal Nonminimal Coupling-to-Starobinsky Matching and a Single-Field Attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish an off-shell commutativity theorem in 4D parity-even quadratic gravity that the Hubbard-Stratonovich/Legendre lifts, algebraic elimination of auxiliaries, including the torsionless Palatini connection, and Jordan-Einstein Weyl rescalings commute at the action level up to boundary terms. This yields a frame-independent characterization of the propagating degrees of freedom and isolates a universal scalaron EFT in the metric branch, while clarifying the algebraic nature of the Palatini $f(R)$ scalar. We obtain, as a result, a frame-universal matching from the generic nonminimal couplings to a positive $R^2$ sector and a quantitative single-field attractor bound, enhanced by a $1/\Delta N$ selection term, providing sharp and falsifiable CMB targets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a black hole state in a spin chain by studying thermal correlators in holography. Focusing on the Heisenberg model we investigate the thermal and complexity properties of the black hole state by evaluating its entanglement entropy, emptiness formation probability and Krylov complexity. The entanglement entropy grows logarithmically with effective central charge c=5.2. We find evidence for thermalization at infinite temperature.</description>

      <title>Central Charges and Vacuum Moduli of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ Theories from Class $\mathcal{S}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,4)$ supersymmetric theories obtained from a topologically-twisted reduction of 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ class $\mathcal{S}$ theories on a Riemann surface. This study addresses subtle aspects of central charges, unbroken gauge groups, and emergent superconformal R-symmetries of these theories. Focusing on infrared vacuum structures, we propose conjectural formulas for the central charges. For theories with the gauge group $SU(2)$, we use a Lagrangian description to analyze the vacuum moduli spaces. In particular, we examine two distinct branches -- the special Higgs branch and the twisted Higgs branch -- by computing their Hilbert series, and find agreement with the proposed central charge formulas.</description>

      <title>Massive gravity applications for $T\overline{T}$ deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the massive gravity approach to stress-tensor deformations in a variety of scenarios, obtaining novel results and establishing new connections. Starting with perturbation theory, we show that the addition of $\text{tr} T+\Lambda_{2}$ to $T\overline{T}$ can be recovered and we construct the deformed action of an interacting non-abelian spin-1 along with spin-1/2 seed model, extending previous findings. As a result, a set of algebraic properties for certain hypergeometric functions is derived, allowing us to initiate the algebraic study of special functions directly via stress-tensor deformations and massive gravity. Moreover, we sharpen the connection between the trace-flow equation and the local renormalization group in any dimension. In $d&gt;2$, the usual initial condition for the coupling leads to a potential known as ghost-free, minimal massive gravity. Upon expansion around the reference background, we retrieve Fierz-Pauli at leading order, matching the random geometry and holographic approaches. At the same time, we demonstrate that a change of coordinates interpretation is possible for the corresponding operator, which we verify with a simple example. Finally, we study the family of $(\text{tr} T)^{n}$ deformations advancing earlier work, and illustrate how the massive gravity description of non-linear electrodynamics can be incorporated in our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel semiclassical framework tailored to determine the scaling dimensions of heavy neutral composite operators in conformal field theories (CFTs) which are inaccessible with other current methodologies. It utilizes the state-operator correspondence to map the desired scaling dimensions to the semiclassical energy spectrum of periodic homogeneous field configurations on a cylinder. As concrete applications, we provide detailed analyses for the $\phi^4$ theory near four dimensions and $\phi^6$ near three dimensions, semiclassically determining the full spectrum of neutral operators in the traceless symmetric Lorentz representations. Our methodology is presented pedagogically and is readily applicable to a vast class of CFTs.</description>

      <title>Generalized Virial Identities: Radial Constraints for Solitons, Instantons, and Bounces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological solitons and tunneling configurations (monopoles, vortices, Skyrmions, sphalerons, and bounces) are characterized by profile functions that encode their physical properties. Derrick's scaling relation provides a global integral constraint on these profiles, but reveals nothing about the local balance between kinetic and potential contributions in different regions. We derive a continuous family of virial identities for O($n$) symmetric configurations, parameterized by an exponent $\alpha$ that controls the radial weighting: negative $\alpha$ emphasizes the core where topological boundary conditions are imposed, large positive $\alpha$ emphasizes the asymptotic tail, and $\alpha = 1$ recovers the classical Derrick relation. The family provides a systematic decomposition of the global constraint into radially-resolved components, with special $\alpha$ values isolating specific mechanisms. For BPS configurations, where the Bogomolny equations imply pointwise equality between kinetic and potential densities, the virial identity is satisfied for all valid $\alpha$. We verify the formalism analytically for the Fubini-Lipatov instanton, BPS monopole, and BPST instanton. Numerical tests on the Coleman bounce and Nielsen-Olesen vortex illustrate how the $\alpha$-dependence of errors distinguishes core from tail inaccuracies: the vortex shows errors growing at negative $\alpha$ (core), while the bounce shows errors growing at positive $\alpha$ (tail). Applications to the electroweak sphaleron, where the Higgs mass explicitly breaks scale invariance, and the hedgehog Skyrmion illustrate the formalism in systems with multiple competing length scales.</description>

      <title>Two roads to fortuity in ABJM theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently proposed addition to the holographic dictionary connects extremal black holes to fortuitous operators -- those which are only supersymmetric for sufficiently small values of the central charge. The most efficient techniques for finding them come from studying the cohomology of a nilpotent supercharge. We explore two aspects of this problem in weakly-coupled ABJM theory, where the gauge group is $\mathrm{U}(N) \times \mathrm{U}(N)$ and the Chern-Simons level is taken to be large. Adapting an algorithm which has been used to great effect in $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills, we enumerate 244 low-lying fortuitous operators and sort them into multiplets of the centralizer algebra. This leads to the construction of two leading fortuitous representatives for $N = 3$ which are subleading for $N = 2$. In the second part of this work, we identify a truncation of ABJM theory where the action of the one-loop supercharge matches the one in the BMN subsector of $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Super Yang-Mills. This allows a known infinite tower of representatives to be lifted from one theory to the other.</description>

      <title>From black holes to solvable irrelevant deformations and back</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a combined review on the Kerr/CFT correspondence on the one hand and solvable irrelevant deformations of two-dimensional QFTs - specifically, the $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations - on the other. These subjects are interconnected, since the microscopic description of general black holes can be linked to very special irrelevant deformations of two-dimensional CFTs; conversely, one may draw interesting insights into black hole microscopics from the study of the exactly solvable $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations.
  The Kerr/CFT part emphasizes the conceptual challenges faced by this proposed holographic description of general extremal black holes, especially in light of recent advances indicating that the classical geometry of extremal black holes is unreliable. The review of the $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ deformations is self-contained and presented from a purely field-theoretical perspective. It covers core topics such as the finite-size spectrum, thermodynamics, scattering, non-perturbative definition and the holographic dictionary for these deformations. Particular emphasis is placed upon the extended symmetries of $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ - deformed CFTs, including the perfect match between the symmetries derived via field-theoretic methods and the asymptotic symmetries of the dual spacetimes. These symmetries are also central to understanding the precise relationship between single-trace $T\bar T$ and $J\bar T$ - deformed CFTs and three-dimensional asymptotically linear dilaton and, respectively, warped AdS backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Approaching a dynamical extreme black hole horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an explicit closed form description of the late-time near-horizon approach to dynamical extreme Reissner-Nordstrom (DERN) black holes. These are spherically symmetric dynamical solutions of Einstein-Maxwell theory coupled to a neutral scalar that feature: (i) a spacetime metric which tends to that of a static extreme Reissner-Nordstrom (RN), and (ii) a scalar field which displays the linear Aretakis instability ad infinitum in the non-linear theory. We employ the two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity to solve explicitly for the non-linear s-wave dynamics of the four-dimensional theory near an ${\rm AdS}_2\times {\rm S}^2$ throat. For a teleologically defined black hole horizon, we impose boundary conditions on JT's dilaton field (which encodes the gravitational dynamics) and the scalar matter as follows: (i) the JT dilaton decays at late times on the ${\rm AdS}_2$ boundary to a value that corresponds to a static extreme RN in the exterior, and (ii) the scalar obeys boundary conditions characteristic of linear Aretakis behavior on ${\rm AdS}_2$. We ensure our DERN solutions are singularity-free and we note that our approach to DERN is accompanied by a final burst of outgoing scalar matter flux leaking out of the ${\rm AdS}_2$ throat. The boundary conditions we impose on the JT dilaton place its late-time boundary profile on the threshold of black hole formation with sub-extreme and super-extreme RN on either side of our DERNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some recent all-loop results on the renormalization of supersymmetric theories are summarized and reviewed. In particular, we discuss how it is possible to construct expressions which do not receive quantum corrections in all orders for certain ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric theories. For instance, in ${\cal N}=1$ SQED+SQCD there is a renormalization group invariant combination of two gauge couplings. For the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model there are two such independent combinations of the gauge and Yukawa couplings. We investigate the scheme-dependence of these results and verify them by explicit three-loop calculations. We also argue that the all-loop exact $\beta$-function and the corresponding renormalization group invariant can exist in the $6D$, ${\cal N}=(1,0)$ supersymmetric higher derivative gauge theory interacting with a hypermultiplet in the adjoint representation.</description>

      <title>A Rosetta Stone for Wilson Line Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the construction of a map between weak (gauge) and strong (string) coupling degrees of freedom for the supersymmetric Wilson line-defect in the planar N=4 Super-Yang-Mills. By analysing the Partition Functions at zero and infinite coupling, we propose a map from degrees of freedom capturing single- and singlet two-particle states at zero coupling to infinite coupling. This map predicts that the dimension of states in these particular sectors doubles as it goes from zero to infinite coupling. We test this prediction against the non-perturbative spectrum of insertions on the Wilson line obtained using integrability. In addition to already available integrability-based results, we obtain the non-perturbative scaling dimension of the simplest non-trivial operator with transverse spin about the Wilson line, thereby extending the Quantum Spectral Curve construction to such charged sectors.</description>

      <title>Scattering Amplitudes and Conservative Binary Dynamics at $O(G^5)$ without Self-Force Truncation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the complete potential-graviton contributions to the conservative radial action and scattering angle for two non-spinning bodies in general relativity, accurate through fifth order in Newton's constant and including second-order self-force (2SF) effects. The calculation is carried out in the scattering-amplitude framework, combining the double copy, effective field theory, and multi-loop integration techniques based on integration by parts and differential equations. To address a major computational bottleneck, we develop improved integration-by-parts algorithms that render calculations at this order tractable. The amplitude is presented as a series expansion, following the strategy used earlier in maximal supergravity. For the first self-force sector, which involves only polylogarithmic functions, we also provide a closed-form analytic expression. For the second self-force sector, as in earlier supergravity work, we find nontrivial cancellations among contributions related to integrals supported on Calabi-Yau geometry.</description>

      <title>Ordering-Independent Wheeler-DeWitt Equation for Flat Minisuperspace Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider minisuperspace models with quadratic kinetic terms, assuming a flat target space and a closed Universe. We show that, upon canonical quantization of the Hamiltonian, only a restricted subset of operator orderings is consistent with the path-integral viewpoint. Remarkably, all consistent orderings are physically equivalent to all orders in $\hbar$. Specifically, each choice of path-integral measure in the definition of the wavefunction path integral uniquely determines an operator ordering and hence a corresponding Wheeler-DeWitt equation. The consistent orderings are in one-to-one correspondence with the Jacobians associated with all field redefinitions of a set of canonical degrees of freedom. For each admissible operator ordering--or equivalently, each path-integral measure--we identify a definite, positive Hilbert-space inner product. All such prescriptions define the same quantum theory, in the sense that they lead to identical physical observables. We illustrate our formalism by applying it to de Sitter Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and to the Starobinsky model.</description>

      <title>Limits of applicability of holographic dual descriptions to QCD: virtuality and coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtuality and coherence determine the limits of applicability of holographic concepts in QCD. In light-front quantization, the invariant mass controls the off-shell behavior of a physical process and thus provides a measure of its virtuality. In impact space, the corresponding quantity is the invariant transverse separation between quarks and gluons, $\zeta$, which is identified with the holographic coordinate $z$ in holographic light-front QCD. By embedding the internal structure of hadrons and implementing an effective superconformal symmetry, the mapping between quantum states and classical gravity -- central to the holographic principle -- yields new analytic insights into the strong-interaction dynamics responsible for the emergence of a confinement scale and the observed hadron spectrum. We show that the possible emergence of a gravity dual to physical QCD is restricted to the Regge limit of high-energy scattering, where many partonic degrees of freedom participate coherently. This criterion provides a quantitative definition of the domain of applicability of holographic QCD to dynamical processes and allows it to be tested directly against experimental results. By further enforcing analyticity together with exact QCD constraints at asymptotic infinity, the holographic framework can be consistently extended beyond the infrared domain. To illustrate this procedure, we briefly discuss recent work by the HLFHS collaboration, where the effective strong coupling was extended from the Regge-limit domain, through the near-perturbative transition region, and into the ultraviolet Bjorken-limit domain. The resulting scheme provides a unified and precise nonperturbative description of the strong coupling across all virtuality scales.</description>

      <title>Taxonomy of coupled minimal models from finite groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fixed points of $N$ coupled Virasoro minimal models have recently been argued to provide large classes of compact unitary CFTs with $c&gt;1$ and only Virasoro chiral symmetry. In this paper, we vastly increase the set of such potential irrational fixed points by considering couplings that break the maximal $G=S_N$ symmetry into various subgroups $H\subset G$. We rigorously classify all the fixed points with $N=4,5$ and do an extensive search for solutions of the beta function equations with $N\geq6$. In particular, we find non-trivial fixed points with $H=\mathbb{Z}_{N-1} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2, \, S_{M}\times S_{N-M}$ and rigorously prove that real fixed points with $H=(S_{N/2}\times S_{N/2})\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ exist for all even $N\geq6$. We also identify fixed points with finite Lie-type symmetry $H=\rm{PSL}_2(N)\subset S_N$ where $N=7,11,13$ and uncover a non-unitary fixed point with $H=M_{22}\subset S_{22}$, a sporadic Mathieu group. Along the way, we encounter conformal manifolds at leading order in perturbation theory which we resolve at sub-leading order.</description>

      <title>Twisted de Rham theory for string double copy in AdS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is motivated by the recent evidence for a double-copy relationship between open- and closed-string amplitudes in Anti-de Sitter (AdS) space. At present, the evidence has the form of a double-copy relation for string-amplitude building blocks, which are combined using the multiple-polylogarithm (MPL) generating functions. These generate MPLs relevant for all-order AdS curvature corrections of four-point string amplitudes. In this paper, we prove this building-block double copy using a new, noncommutative version of twisted de Rham theory. In flat space, the usual twisted de Rham theory is already known to be a natural framework to describe the Kawai-Lewellen-Tye (KLT) double-copy map from open- to closed-string amplitudes, in which the KLT kernel can be computed from the intersections of the open-string amplitude integration contours. We formulate twisted de Rham theory for noncommutative-ring-valued differential forms on complex manifolds and use it to derive the intersection number of two open-string contours, which are closed in the noncommutative twisted homology sense. The inverse of this intersection number is precisely the AdS double-copy kernel for the four-point open- and closed-string generating functions.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Transport In Low Dimension Materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This dissertation presents a systematic theoretical investigation into realizing a condensed matter analogue of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) in a quasi-planar, 2+1D system. The research establishes a conceptual bridge between the anomalous transport phenomena of high-energy physics and the emergent electronic properties of engineered honeycomb lattices. The central objective is the formulation of a low-energy effective Hamiltonian that incorporates the necessary ingredients for a CME-like effect. This is achieved by moving beyond pristine graphene, whose inherent sublattice symmetry precludes the formation of a mass gap necessary for defining robust pseudo-chiral states. The core of this work is a model based on a honeycomb lattice with explicitly broken sublattice symmetry, which introduces a band gap and endows the quasi-particles system with a well-defined pseudo-chirality based on sublattice polarization. A time-reversal symmetry-breaking parameter is introduced to asymmetrically modify the valley gaps, creating a controllable non-equilibrium imbalance analogous to the chiral chemical potential in relativistic systems. A key finding is the validation of the physical model consistency; through commutator calculations, the total angular momentum - comprising both orbital and an emergent lattice spin component - is shown to be a conserved quantity. This research successfully transforms the abstract possibility of a 2D CME into a concrete, self-consistent theoretical framework, detailing the precise symmetry conditions required for its manifestation.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of the Masses of Various Meson States: A Comparative Study in SU(3) and SU(4) extended Linear-Sigma Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the extended Linear-Sigma Model (eLSM), the chiral phase structure of meson states, including pseudoscalars ($J^{pc}=0^{-+}$), scalars ($J^{pc}=0^{++}$), vectors ($J^{pc}=1^{--}$), and axial-vectors ($J^{pc}=1^{++}$), is investigated with the mean-field approximation. A systematic comparison between SU(3) and SU(4) configurations is provided. It has been found that the estimations of meson masses derived from SU(4) eLSM are more congruent with experimental values than those derived from SU(3) eLSM. Consequently, we conclude that an increase in quark degrees of freedom significantly enhances the accuracy of meson mass simulations. We investigate the effect of temperature on the masses of various meson states calculated in the SU(3) and SU(4) eLSM. After establishing all the fitting parameters, the temperature dependence of meson masses shows that although various meson states exhibit unique patterns in their mass changes with temperature, they all seem to share a similar range of dissolution temperatures. This means that the critical temperature that marks the phase transition from hadrons to quarks appears to vary slightly depending on the meson states. In this regard, we find that the quarkonium states, formed by a quark and its antiquark, are largely unaffected by variations in the temperature.</description>

Abstract: We develop a systematic Hamiltonian formulation of minimally doubled lattice fermions in (3+1) dimensions, derive their nodal structures (structures of zeros), and classify their symmetry patterns for both four-component Dirac and two-component Weyl constructions. Motivated by recent single-Weyl proposals based on Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) representation, we argue that the corresponding single-Weyl Hamiltonians are obtained from the minimal-doubling Hamiltonians supplemented by an appropriate species-splitting mass term, and we re-examine the non-onsite symmetry protecting the physical Weyl node in terms of a Ginsparg-Wilson-type relation. We then construct a one-parameter family of deformations that preserves all the symmetries and demonstrate that, once the parameter exceeds a critical value, additional Weyl nodes emerge and the system exits the single-node regime. This indicates that in interacting theories radiative corrections can generate symmetry-allowed counterterms, so maintaining the desired single-Weyl phase generically requires "moderate" parameter tuning.</description>

      <title>amangkurat: A Python Library for Symplectic Pseudo-Spectral Solution of the Idealized (1+1)D Nonlinear Klein-Gordon Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces amangkurat, an open-source Python library designed for the robust numerical simulation of relativistic scalar field dynamics governed by the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation in $(1+1)$D spacetime. The software implements a hybrid computational strategy that couples Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization with a symplectic St\o rmer-Verlet temporal integrator, ensuring both exponential spatial convergence for smooth solutions and long-term preservation of Hamiltonian structure. To optimize performance, the solver incorporates adaptive timestepping based on Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) stability criteria and utilizes Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation for parallelized force computation. The library's capabilities are validated across four canonical physical regimes: dispersive linear wave propagation, static topological kink preservation in phi-fourth theory, integrable breather dynamics in the sine-Gordon model, and non-integrable kink-antikink collisions. Beyond standard numerical validation, this work establishes a multi-faceted analysis framework employing information-theoretic entropy metrics (Shannon, R\'{e}nyi, and Tsallis), kernel density estimation, and phase space reconstruction to quantify the distinct phenomenological signatures of these regimes. Statistical hypothesis testing confirms that these scenarios represent statistically distinguishable dynamical populations. Benchmarks on standard workstation hardware demonstrate that the implementation achieves high computational efficiency, making it a viable platform for exploratory research and education in nonlinear field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we construct new classes of topological black hole solutions in anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime using a novel model of nonlinear electrodynamics called Modification Maxwell (ModMax) and Modification phantom or Modification anti-Maxwell (ModAMax). We then evaluate the thermodynamic quantities and verify the first law of thermodynamics. Our study examines how the parameters of the ModMax and ModAMax fields, as well as the topological constant, affect the black hole solutions, thermodynamic quantities, and local and global thermal stabilities. Furthermore, within the framework of extended phase space thermodynamics, we analyze the Joule-Thomson expansion process and determine the inversion curves. This analysis reveals that the ModMax and ModAMax parameters significantly alter the cooling and heating behavior of these AdS black holes, depending on their topology. Finally, by treating these topological Mod(A)Max AdS black holes as heat engines, we assess their efficiencies, demonstrating that the parameters of nonlinear electrodynamics and horizon topology play crucial roles in enhancing or suppressing the system's thermodynamic performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a point of view on resurgence theory based on the study of perverse sheaves on the complex line carrying an algebraic structure with respect to additive convolution. In particular, we lift the concept of alien derivatives introduced originally by J. \'Ecalle, to the framework of perverse sheaves and study its behavior under sheaf-theoretic convolution. The full fledged resurgence theory needs a (yet undeveloped) generalization of the concept of perverse sheaves allowing infinite, possibly dense, sets of singularities. We discuss possible approaches to defining such objects and some potential examples of them coming from Cohomological Hall Algebras, wall-crossing structures and Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate metric perturbations of a spherically symmetric black hole in higher curvature gravity. We show that higher curvature corrections deform the near-horizon region of the effective potential, and that the deviations of the quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies from their general relativity (GR) values become more pronounced for overtone modes. We find that, as the order of the higher curvature term increases, the deformations approach the horizon and the deviations of the overtone QNM frequencies grow progressively larger. We also analyze the ringdown waveforms in the higher curvature gravity model. We consider setups in which the deviations from the vacuum-GR QNMs remain mild for the fundamental mode and the first few overtones, and show that these shifted QNMs can be identified in the ringdown signal through waveform fitting.</description>

      <title>Field Theory via Higher Geometry II: Thickened Smooth Sets as Synthetic Foundations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the second in a series of papers that aim to develop rigorous and most encompassing foundations for field theory, where in the first installment, we laid out the natural formulation of bosonic variational field theory via the functorial geometry of smooth sets. Here, we extend this to the category ThickenedSmoothSets of infinitesimally thickened smooth sets. We first describe the Cahiers topos in a simplified, but fully rigorous, $\mathbb{R}$-algebraic setting -- which should serve as a more accessible introduction to the theory of Synthetic Differential Geometry to both physicists and mathematicians. Then, we formulate local Lagrangian field theory in this rigorous setting in which infinitesimal spaces exist and interact correctly with the field-theoretic spaces of infinite jet bundles, off-shell and on-shell spaces of fields etc.
  This setting subsumes all previous constructions and further recovers all the relevant tangent bundles of traditional (off-shell and on-shell) field theory considerations via the synthetic tangent bundle construction, i.e., as ``infinitesimal curves'' in those spaces, which were previously defined only in an ad-hoc manner. Beyond finally establishing a firm foundation for such aspects of the theory, this approach recognizes the variational principle of local Lagrangian field theory, equivalently, as the intersection of thickened smooth sets. It also suggests the rigorous formalization of perturbative field theory as the restriction to a (synthetic) infinitesimal neighborhood around a field configuration. Furthermore, our context naturally accommodates more general, rigorous considerations, in which the manifolds may have boundaries and corners, a situation that has recently been attracting greater attention in the field-theoretical literature.</description>

      <title>On the Cocycle Structure of the Boltzmann Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on a cocycle structure, we identify a new derivation of the Boltzmann distribution for finite energy-level systems from the maximal entropy principle (MEP). Our approach does not rely on the method of the Lagrange multiplier, and it provides a more transparent way to understand the dependence on the energy levels of the temperature $T = 1/\beta$ for the equilibrium distribution. Finally, we make two curious observations associated with our derivations.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Area Bound for Information Transfer Through Semiclassical Traversable Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a rigorous geometric bound on the transmission of quantum information through semiclassical traversable wormholes. We initially prove an area theorem showing that the minimal throat surface of a traversable wormhole cannot increase using Raychaudhuri's equation together with the null energy condition for the infalling matter. Then, the max-flow in the bit-thread picture, which corresponds to the initial minimal throat area, is shown to set the upper bound on information transfer. We also discuss two glued HaPPY codes as a toy model for a wormhole.</description>

      <title>Gauge Symmetry in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of non-Abelian gauge theories requires careful handling of gauge redundancy. We address this challenge by presenting universal principles for treating gauge symmetry that apply to any quantum simulation approach, clarifying that physical states need not be represented solely by gauge singlets. Both singlet and non-singlet representations are valid, with distinct practical trade-offs, which we elucidate using analogies to BRST quantization. We demonstrate these principles within a complete quantum simulation framework based on the orbifold lattice, which enables explicit and efficient circuit constructions relevant to real-world QCD. For singlet-based approaches, we introduce a Haar-averaging projection implemented via linear combinations of unitaries, and analyze its cost and truncation errors. Beyond the singlet-approach, we show how non-singlet approaches can yield gauge-invariant observables through wave packets and string excitations. This non-singlet approach is proven to be both universal and efficient. Working in temporal gauge, we provide explicit mappings of lattice Yang-Mills dynamics to Pauli-string Hamiltonians suitable for Trotterization. Classical simulations of small systems validate convergence criteria and quantify truncation and Trotter errors, showing concrete resource estimates and scalable circuit recipes for SU($N$) gauge theories. Our framework provides both conceptual clarity and practical tools toward quantum advantage in simulating non-Abelian gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Noether-Ward identities for scalar field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the gravitational Noether-Ward identities for the evolution of general metric perturbations on quantum matter backgrounds. In this work we consider Einstein's gravity covariantly coupled to a massive, non-minimally coupled, quantum scalar field in general curved backgrounds. We find that each term in the equation of motion for gravitational perturbations satisfies its own Noether-Ward identity. Even though each term is non-transverse, the whole equation of motion maintains transversality. In particular, each counterterm needed to renormalize the graviton self-energy satisfies its own Noether identity, and we derive the explicit form for each. Finally, in order to understand how the Noether-Ward identities are affected by the definition of the metric perturbation, we consider two inequivalent definitions of metric perturbations and derive the Noether-Ward identities for both definitions. This implies that there are Noether-Ward identities for every definition of the metric perturbation.</description>

      <title>Panhandle polynomials of torus links and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use a decomposition of the tensor of the fundamental representation of the quantum group $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_N)$ and the Rosso-Jones formula to establish a peculiar ``panhandle'' shape of the HOMFLY-PT polynomial of the reverse parallel of torus knots and links. Due to their panhandle-like intrinsic properties, the HOMFLY-PT polynomial is referred to as a ``panhandle polynomial''. With the help of the $\ell$-invariant, this extends to links the Etnyre-Honda result about the arc index and maximal Thurston-Bennequin invariant of torus knots. It has further geometric consequences, related to the braid index, the existence of minimal string Bennequin surfaces for banded and Whitehead doubled links, the Bennequin sharpness problem, and the equivalence of their quasipositivity and strong quasipositivity. We extend these properties to torus links, which relate to the classification of their component-wise Thurston-Bennequin invariants. Finally, we discuss the definition of the $\ell$-invariant for general links.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the analytic results for the non-singlet contributions to the three-loop mixed strong-electroweak ${\mathcal{O}}(\alpha_s^2\alpha)$ virtual corrections to the quark form factors. The primary challenge of this computation arises from the presence of massive vector bosons within the loops. This significantly increases the complexity of the integration-by-parts reduction of the scalar integrals and complicates their evaluation via the method of differential equations. To obtain the physical results, we perform the appropriate ultraviolet renormalization and subtract the universal infrared divergences. The resulting finite remainders are expressed in terms of Harmonic Polylogarithms and Generalized Polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>Graph restricted tensors: building blocks for holographic networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze few-body quantum states with particular correlation properties imposed by the requirement of maximal bipartite entanglement for selected partitions of the system into two complementary parts. A novel framework to treat this problem by encoding these constraints in a graph is advocated; the resulting objects are called ``graph-restricted tensors''. This framework encompasses several examples previously treated in the literature, such as 1-uniform multipartite states, quantum states related to dual unitary operators and absolutely maximally entangled states (AME) corresponding to 2-unitary matrices. Original examples of presented graph-restricted tensors are motivated by tensor network models for the holographic principle. In concrete cases we find exact analytic solutions, demonstrating thereby that there exists a vast landscape of non-stabilizer tensors useful for the lattice models of holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a wall-crossing framework for operational enumerative invariants of equivariant 3-Calabi--Yau categories arising from virtual cycles. The strategy follows ideas of Joyce's ``universal'' wall-crossing framework arXiv:2111.04694, using the authors' symmetrized pullback technique to preserve the symmetry of the (almost-perfect) obstruction theories throughout. As an application, we define and study wall-crossings of simple type between operational equivariant Donaldson--Thomas (DT), Pandharipande--Thomas (PT), and Bryan--Steinberg (BS) vertices. In particular, we give an explicit DT/PT descendent vertex correspondence in the Calabi--Yau limit. As another application, we construct and prove wall-crossing formulas for operational refined semistable Vafa--Witten invariants.</description>

      <title>Lectures on Gauge theories and Many-Body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: These lectures discuss two correspondences between gauge theories and integrable many-body systems. The first correspondence goes back to the work of many mathematicians and physicists in the 1980-1990's. It is realized by an infinite dimensional Hamiltonian reduction and its quantum counterpart. In this approach the quantization parameters of the gauge theory coincide with the quantization parameters of the many-body system. The second correspondence emerged in the mid-1990's, it involves non-trivial dualities, relating classical problems on one side to quantum on another and vice versa. This duality has various reincarnations: Fourier and Legendre transforms, Langlands duality, etc. The quantization parameters are mapped to geometric parameters. Simple questions on one side solve complicated ones on the other and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Lense-Thirring Acoustic Black Holes : Shadows and Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Lense-Thirring Acoustic Black Hole (LTABH), motivated by the relevance of analogue models for black holes embedded in various physical systems, such as the cosmological microwave background or quantum superfluids. We investigate the LTABH spacetime geometry, showing that the roots of the metric function determine a partition of the spacetime into four regions, depending on the acoustic parameter $\xi $ (whereas the dependence vanishes for the rotation parameter $a$); on the other hand, the parameter $a$ turns out to affect the critical radii associated to the maxima of the effective potential. All in all, both the acoustic sphere radius $r_{as}$ and the photon sphere radius $r_{ps}$, respectively giving rise to the acoustic shadow $R_{as}$ and to the optical shadow $R_{s}$, depend on $\xi $ and $a$. More precisely, the rotation parameter $a$ is more relevantly affecting $R_{s}$ (through a right shift), while $R_{as}$ retains its circular shape. For what concerns the acoustic parameter, we notice that the higher $\xi $ is, the larger the size of both shadows. All of these results are confirmed through a detailed analysis of the distortions and of the shadows radii. Moreover, by deriving the magnitude of the precession frequency $\Omega $, we observe that it significantly increases near the acoustic horizons, both in the extremal and in the non-extremal cases, which implies that the Lense-Thirring (frame dragging) effect, which can be traced back to $\xi $ itself, becomes important near such regions. On the other hand, we also show that there are regions of the LTABH spacetime in which $% \Omega $ vanishes, suggesting that therein possible probe particles would not be affected by the frame dragging at all. Finally, we derive the deflection of the light near the LTABH.</description>

      <title>q-Opers and Bethe Ansatz for Open Spin Chains I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In in a nutshell, the classical geometric $q$-Langlands duality can be viewed as a correspondence between the space of $(G,q)$-opers and the space of solutions of $^L\mathfrak{g}$ XXZ Bethe Ansatz equations. The latter describe spectra of closed spin chains with twisted periodic boundary conditions and, upon the duality, the twist elements are identified with the $q$-oper connections on a projective line in a certain gauge. In this work, we initiate the geometric study of Bethe Ansatz equations for spin chains with open boundary conditions. We introduce the space of $q$-opers whose defining sections are invariant under reflection through the unit circle in a selected gauge. The space of such reflection-invariant $q$-opers in the presence of certain nondegeneracy conditions is thereby described by the corresponding Bethe Ansatz problem. We compare our findings with the existing results in integrable systems and representation theory. This paper discusses the type-A construction leaving the general case for the upcoming work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new class of integrable 3D lattice models, possessing continuous families of commuting layer-to-layer transfer matrices. Algebraically, this commutativity is based on a very special construction of local Boltzmann weights in terms of quantum dilogarithms satisfying the inversion and pentagon identities. We give three examples of such quantum dilogarithms, leading to integrable 3D lattice models. The partition function per site in these models can be exactly calculated in the limit of an infinite lattice by using the functional relations, symmetry and factorization properties of the transfer matrix. The results of such calculations for 3D models associated with the Faddeev modular quantum dilogarithm are briefly presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conjecture by two of the authors (N.E.M. and S.S.) that a \cPT-symmetric phase plays a role in understanding singular renormalisation group (RG) flows for a Chern-Simons (CS) gauge theory of axions, has been reexamined and significantly improved. We have used the more complete Wetterich equation, which includes gravitational couplings in a systematic way from the start, to understand the emergence of this phase. The singular structure of the RG flows has persisted on including gravitational-couplings, thereby offering further support to the conjecture that \cPT -symmetric phases of (repulsive) gravity characterise string-effective CS gravitational theories, where the axion is the massless string-model independent axion, which can also play a role of a totally-antisymmetric torsion degree of freedom. This has suggested a novel interpretation of the currently observed acceleration of the expansion of the Universe in terms of such a phase at large (cosmological) scales.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star Equation of State with Nucleon Short-Range Correlations: A Concise Review and Open Issues</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nucleon short-range correlations (SRCs) and the associated high-momentum tail (HMT) in its momentum distribution $n(k)$ represent a universal feature of strongly interacting Fermi systems. In nuclear matter, SRCs arise primarily from the spin-isospin dependence of the tensor and short-range components of the nucleon-nucleon interaction, leading to a substantial depletion of its Fermi sea and a characteristic $k^{-4}$ tail populated predominantly by isosinglet neutron-proton pairs. These microscopic structures modify both the kinetic and interaction contributions to the Equation of State (EOS) of dense matter and thereby influence a broad range of neutron-star (NS) properties. This short review provides a streamlined overview of how SRC-induced changes in $n(k)$ reshape the kinetic EOS, including its symmetry energy part and how these effects propagate into macroscopic NS observables, including mass-radius relations, tidal deformabilities, direct Urca thresholds and core-crust transition. We summarize key existing results, highlight current observational constraints relevant for testing SRC-HMT effects, and outline open questions for future theoretical, experimental, and multimessenger studies of dense nucleonic matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, the poles and the resulting dispersion spectra from the relativistic kinetic equation have been analyzed with the help of a proposed collision kernel that conserves both the energy-momentum tensor and particle current by construction. The dispersion relations, which originally come out in the form of logarithmic divergences, in the long wavelength limit exhibit the systematic gradient structure of the relativistic hydrodynamics. The key result is that, in the derivative expansion series, the spatial gradients appear in perfect unison with the temporal gradients in the non-local relaxation operator like forms. It is then shown that this dispersion structure, including non-local temporal derivatives, is essential for the preservation of causality of the theory truncated at any desired order.</description>

Abstract: The van der Waals interaction between neutral atoms is typically studied using stationary perturbation theory for the short-distance (London) limit, while long-distance (Casimir-Polder) results are usually derived via semiclassical, time-dependent approaches. In this pedagogical article, we demonstrate that reformulating stationary perturbation theory calculations in terms of time-ordered correlation functions significantly simplifies the mathematical treatment. This reformulation is particularly advantageous for higher-order calculations required in the long-distance regime, where retardation effects become important. Our approach provides a unified framework that connects both limiting cases while offering a clear conceptual picture suitable for advanced quantum mechanics courses.</description>

      <title>Frozen Neutron Stars in Four-Dimensional Non-polynomial Gravities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the structure and properties of neutron stars in four-dimensional non-polynomial gravities. Solving the modified Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations for three different equations of state (BSk19, SLy4, AP4), we confirm that neutron star solutions remain in existence. As the modification parameter $\alpha$ increases, neutron stars grow in both radius and mass. We find that, when the parameter $\alpha$ is sufficiently large, a frozen state emerges at the end of the neutron-star sequence. In this state, the metric functions approach zero extremely close to the stellar surface, forming a critical horizon, making it nearly indistinguishable from a black hole to an external observer. Such a frozen neutron star constitutes a universal endpoint of the neutron-star sequence in this theory, independent of the choice of the equation of state. Based on our results and current observational constraints, we derive bounds on the modification parameter $\alpha$ and show that frozen neutron stars remain allowed in the bounds.</description>

      <title>Spectral reconstruction based on dimensional reduction in high-temperature gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a numerical spectral reconstruction workflow for high-temperature gauge theories that incorporates elements of semi-classical real-time evolution directly into standard lattice QCD simulations via high-temperature dimensional reduction, thus counteracting the deterioration of Euclidean-time correlators at high temperatures. With a moderate numerical cost, our method allows to estimate spectral functions with parametrically better frequency resolution as compared with spectral reconstruction methods based on Euclidean-time correlators alone. The method is tested on a simple (1+1)-dimensional Abelian gauge theory with fermions, where our method precisely reproduces the full quantum spectral functions calculated using exact numerical diagonalization in the high-temperature, weak-coupling regime. We also demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by applying it to light-quark meson correlators in lattice QCD deep in the deconfinement regime.</description>

Abstract: We implement a probe counterpart of Newman-Janis algorithm, which Wick rotates the all-orders geodesic deviation equation into a part of exact spinning-particle equations of motion. Consequently, the gravitational dynamics of the Kerr black hole in its point-particle effective theory is completely constrained in the self-dual sector for a hidden symmetry, implying the spin exponentiation of same-helicity gravitational Compton amplitudes to all multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Interfaces Between Symmetry-Enriched Critical Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gapless quantum phases can become distinct when internal symmetries are enforced, in analogy with gapped symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, this distinction does not always lead to protected edge modes, raising the question of how the bulk-boundary correspondence is generalized to gapless cases. We propose that the spatial interface between gapless phases -- rather than their boundaries -- provides a more robust fingerprint. We show that whenever two 1+1d conformal field theories (CFTs) differ in symmetry charge assignments of local operators or twisted sectors, any symmetry-preserving spatial interface between the theories must flow to a non-invertible defect. We illustrate this general result for different versions of the Ising CFT with $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2^T$ symmetry, obtaining a complete classification of allowed conformal interfaces. When the Ising CFTs differ by nonlocal operator charges, the interface hosts 0+1d symmetry-breaking phases with finite-size splittings scaling as $1/L^3$, as well as continuous phase transitions between them. For general gapless phases differing by an SPT entangler, the interfaces between them can be mapped to conformal defects with a certain defect 't Hooft anomaly. This classification also gives implications for higher-dimensional examples, including symmetry-enriched variants of the 2+1d Ising CFT. Our results establish a physical indicator for symmetry-enriched criticality through symmetry-protected interfaces, giving a new handle on the interplay between topology and gapless phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: From our work on partition functions in log gravity, we show that the palindromic numerators in two variables of bigraded symmetric orbifold Hilbert series take the form of sums of products of Kostka-Foulkes polynomials associated with a pair of partition $\lambda$ and $\mu=(1^n)$. The log partition function also being a KP $\tau$-function, our work gives a new description of Hall-Littlewood and Kostka-Foulkes polynomials as palindromic numerators of quotient expansions in the moduli space of formal power series solutions of the KP hierarchy. Using the structure and properties of the log partition function, we also show that the palindromic polynomials are eigenvalues of a differential operator arising from a recurrence relation and acting on the Hilbert series.</description>

Abstract: The de Sitter conjecture yields a severe bound on possible vacua for a consistent quantum gravity. We extend the de Sitter conjecture by taking into account dynamics of the scalar field. We then apply such an extended de Sitter conjecture to a quintessence model of inflation for which dynamics of the scalar field is essential, and obtain an allowed region of parameters of the scalar potential wider than previously considered cases with the conventional de Sitter conjecture. The new bounds in the swampland conjecture could have implications in several situations to construct compactification models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the chiral higher-spin symmetry algebras $\mathfrak{ca}$ of various twistorial higher-spin theories. These symmetries play the roles of asymptotic symmetries on the celestial twistor sphere, which constrain the observables of twistorial theories. To first order in quantum correction, we show that the chiral algebras associated with anomaly-free holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories are associative themselves. On the other hand, the chiral algebras associated with anomalous holomorphic twistorial higher-spin theories only become associative upon including suitable axionic currents. When computing $4d$ form factors in terms of correlation functions between higher-spin currents on the celestial twistor sphere, we observe that there are some non-vanishing higher-spin form factors. This observation, however, is only well justified for the case of theories with Yang-Mills-like interactions. We also give some brief comments on the case of higher-derivative interactions.</description>

      <title>Supercurrents and (Partial) Supersymmetry in Adjoint QCD$_2$ and Its Generalizations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $1+1$-dimensional $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to an adjoint Majorana fermion, also known as adjoint QCD$_2$, has the surprising feature that at fermion mass $\sqrt{\frac{g^2 N}{2 \pi}}$ it exhibits supersymmetry. In this paper, we obtain a deeper insight into how the supersymmetry works by constructing the gauge invariant, Lorentz covariant supercurrent $j_{\mu A}$. Its conservation relies crucially on the presence of a quantum anomaly. We generalize this construction to a class of models where, in addition to an adjoint Majorana fermion of an appropriate mass, the gauge theory is coupled to some collection of massless fermions ($SU(N)$ may be replaced by a more general gauge group). In general, these models have a supersymmetric massive sector and a non-supersymmetric CFT sector [arXiv:2202.04017], but there are cases in which both sectors are supersymmetric. An example of such a gapless, fully supersymmetric model is $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled to three adjoint Majorana fermions, of which two are massless and the third has mass $\sqrt{\frac{3g^2 N}{2\pi}}$.</description>

      <title>Crossing symmetry including non planar diagrams in perturbative QFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05044v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We venture a proof of crossing symmetry for non-planar diagrams in perturbative QFT. For the planar diagrams a proof of crossing is available in the literature and our method closely follows the one depicted in that case. We classify the non-planar diagrams broadly into two types. For one of these types the proof is pretty straightforward and hence the result extends to all point all loop on-shell amplitudes. These are called the "trivial" cases while for the other type we find certain cases called the "non trivial" cases for which the proof is much more subtle. We present an explicit example of such a "non trivial" case at 3-loop order and argue how the proof of crossing symmetry holds true when all subtleties are taken into consideration. Based on this simple example we argue how the proof works out in general for these "non-trivial" cases at higher loop and with arbitrary number of non-planar edges.</description>

Abstract: Dynamics of gravity interaction with matter at one-loop level of effective quantum field theory naturally sets the cut-off scale $\Lambda_E$ in a sub-Planckian region through incorporating the gauge coupling constant $\alpha(\Lambda_E)$ and the reduced Planckian mass $\tilde m_\text{pl}$ into relation $ \Lambda_E\sim \tilde m_\text{pl}\,\alpha(\Lambda_E)/(4\pi)$ numerically yielding $\Lambda_E\sim 10^{16}$ GeV. Such two scales are empirically inherent for an inflationary cosmology.</description>

      <title>Bounding field excursions along null geodesics with applications to cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scalar fields in theories of gravity often inhabit a moduli space of vacua, and coherent spatial or temporal variations in their expectation values can produce measurable gravitational effects. Such variations are expected in contexts ranging from inflationary cosmology to the near-horizon regions of near-extremal black holes, where they can deflect light rays and shift horizons. This work derives a quantitative field excursion bound (FEB) on scalar variations along null geodesics, expressed in terms of the expansion parameter. The bound follows from the Raychaudhuri equation, assuming that all other fields satisfy the null energy condition (NEC). It is saturated in certain spacetimes containing a timelike naked singularity. A possible generalization to semiclassical spacetimes that violate the NEC, but satisfy a strengthened version of the quantum focusing condition (QFC), is proposed. In cosmology, the FEB constrains the extent of large field excursions to be linearly bounded by the number of e-folds, independent of the inflationary model. This has notable implications for anthropic scenarios, where large excursions are often invoked to access favorable vacua.</description>

Abstract: We study the scalar potentials that arise from higher curvature corrections in general $f(R)$ theories of gravity and their connection to a dynamical species scale. Starting from general considerations in arbitrary dimensions, we show that at large field values, the scalar potential generated by an infinite series of curvature terms and the field dependent species scale arising from circle compactification both decay exponentially, in complementary ways. We identify conditions under which these two effects precisely balance out, giving rise to exponentially flat, plateau-like potentials. We additionally find a precise embedding of Starobinsky inflation consistent with the Swampland program, and we discuss possible implications the mechanism proposed could have for M and string theory.</description>

      <title>Macdonald index from 3d TQFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new fermionic sum formula for the Macdonald index of a class of Argyres-Douglas theories. The formula arises naturally from a three-dimensional topological field theory obtained via a twisted dimensional reduction of the 4d theory. Such a reduction often gives rise to a 3d ${\mathcal N}=2$ abelian Chern-Simons matter theory, which is expected to flow to an ${\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal fixed point. After performing a topological twist, we obtain a 3d TFT admitting boundary conditions that support the vertex operator algebra associated with the original 4d theory. In this framework, the Macdonald index appears as a half-index of the 3d gauge theory, with the Macdonald grading determined by a distinguished $U(1)_A$ symmetry in the infrared ${\mathcal N}=4$ superconformal algebra. We present a general procedure to identify this $U(1)_A$ symmetry and, whenever possible, show that it reproduces the refined character of the associated vertex operator algebra, thereby recovering the Macdonald index. Our construction also gives a hint towards the IR formula for the Macdonald index in terms of 4d BPS particles on the Coulomb branch.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13688v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the nonperturbative solution of the loop equation in quenched QCD (one quark loop in full gluon vacuum, including nonplanar graphs). This solution relies on a specific local minimum of the Plateau problem -- one that is additive over the closed parts of the bounding loop formed at self-intersections. This surface applies to large loops, leading to quark confinement via a factor $\exp(-\kappa S[C])$ multiplying the perturbative Wilson loop $W_{pert}[C]$. Crucially, the confinement mechanism relies on the self-duality of the area derivative -- a property that exists exclusively in four dimensions. This geometric constraint ensures stability only in four dimensions, distinguishing the resulting spectrum from standard string models, which are stable only in higher embedding dimensions. We compute the high-energy meson spectrum resulting from this novel confinement mechanism. The result is a usual linear Regge trajectory with the slope $\alpha' = \frac{1}{2 \pi \sigma}$ in our normalization of string tension $\sigma = 2 \sqrt{2} \kappa$. However, there are no string modes to be added to the spectrum in our solution, which amounts to the static linear potential for the quark pair. As we argue, the fluctuations of ``flux tube'' between quarks are accounted for in the gluon diagrams in $W_{pert}[C]$, and do not contribute to the confining force. This eliminates the problems of quantization of string in four dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The textbook N=1 supergravity has an F-term potential depending on a superpotential $W(z_i)$ and a Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$, with the scalar potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})=e^K (|DW|^2 - 3 |W|^2)$. In this approach, it is not always easy to find the potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ with the required properties. We show that in supergravity with a nilpotent superfield and with any Kahler potential $K(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i} )$ one can obtain any desired potential $V(z^i, \bar z^{\bar i})$ by a proper choice of the Kahler metric of the nilpotent superfield. This construction is particularly suitable for cosmological and particle physics applications, which may require maximal freedom in the choice of kinetic terms and scalar potentials.</description>

      <title>A New Type of Saddle in the Euclidean IKKT Matrix Model and Its Emergent Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the equation of motion of the Euclidean IKKT matrix model, and realize a new type of classical saddle that only exists in $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit. Under the assumption that the matrices are the generators of $\mathfrak{so}(n,m)$, we identify a unique solution, that is, $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. Even though it has $6$ generators and thus $6$ non-zero matrices, they are not independent due to the $2$ Casimir constraints in $\mathfrak{so}(1,3)$. Exploiting the Lie-algebraic structure and the Casimir constraints, we derive a four-dimensional space that a test scalar propagates on. The associated metric possesses $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ isometry, which is closely related to the Taub NUT/Bolt geometry and, more broadly, to black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Functional Renormalization Group flows as diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05973v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In order to find reliable and efficient numerical approximation schemes, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of one-particle irreducible two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. Based on this reformulation and reinterpretation we adopt a numerical scheme for the solution of field-dependent flow equations as nonlinear partial differential equations. We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more interesting problems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.06815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend recent discussions on generalization of the Connected Wedge Theorem about $2$-to-$2$ holographic scattering problem to $n$-to-$n$ scatterings ($n&gt;2$). In this broader setting, our theorem provides a weaker necessary condition for the connectedness of boundary entanglement wedges than previously identified. Besides, we prove a novel sufficient condition for this connectedness. We also present a analysis of the criteria ensuring a non-empty entanglement wedge intersection region $\mathcal{S}_E$. These results refine the holographic dictionary between geometric connectivity and quantum entanglement for general multi-particle scattering.</description>

      <title>BPS Fivebrane Stars and BTZ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a large new class of BPS supergravity solutions parametrized by arbitrary chiral wave profiles on fundamental string and Neveu-Schwarz fivebrane sources. The effective action approach we employ describes the regime where the brane sources are slightly separated. String probes see these backgrounds as smooth and effectively capped off at the scale of that separation. Within the space of solutions is a large ensemble of ultracompact objects exhibiting many of the features of extremal BTZ black holes, in particular having a deep $AdS_2$ throat. We present the details of solutions with circular source profiles, and compare them to known superstratum geometries. The separation of the sources makes them structurally more like BPS fivebrane stars than like extremal black hole microstates. When evaluated on the supergravity background, the brane effective action governs (chaotic) near-BPS dynamics, and exhibits a collective mode analogous to the Schwarzian mode of $AdS_2$ black holes. Finally, we discuss the approach to the black hole phase as the sources coalesce, in which the semiclassical approximation breaks down due to the appearance of light D-brane excitations; this bulk realization of the fivebrane deconfinement transition connects directly to the Hawking-Page transition.</description>

      <title>The ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with extra $SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ gauge symmetry from intersecting D6-branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By introducing an extra stack of D6-branes to standard ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, we extend the landscape of its complete search. In this construction, the $d$-stack of D6-branes is introduced besides the standard $a,~b,~c$-stacks. More intersections from the extra stacks of D6-branes appear, and thus Higgs/Higgs-like particles arise from more origins. Among these models, we find eight new classes of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_{R_1}\times SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{R}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$, where $d$-stack of D6-branes carries the gauge symmetries $SU(2)_{R_2}$ and $SU(2)_{L_2}$, respectively. The $SU(2)_{L_1/R_1} \times SU(2)_{L_2/R_2}$ can be broken down to the diagonal $SU(2)_{L/R}$ gauge symmetry via bifundamental Higgs fields. In such a way, we for the first time successfully constructed three-family supersymmetric Pati-Salam models from non-rigid D6-branes with extra $d$-stacks of D6-branes as visible sectors. Interestingly, by introducing extra stack of D6-branes to the standard supersymmetric Pati-Salam models, the number of filler brane reduces in general, and eventually the models without any $USp(N)$ gauge symmetry present. This reduces the exotic particles from filler brane intersection yet provides more vector-like particles from ${\cal N}=2$ subsector that are useful in renormalization group equation evolution as an advantage. Moreover, interesting degeneracy behavior with the same gauge coupling ratio exists in certain class of models.</description>

      <title>A pathway to non-perturbative Quantum Affine Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19315v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore a new route toward a non-perturbative quantization of gravity based on a purely affine formulation, where the affine connection is the fundamental field and the metric, when it exists, emerges as a derived quantity. Starting from the Palatini formulation of General Relativity, we recall how an equivalent Eddington-type purely affine action arises at the classical level under mild assumptions. A key feature for the non-perturbative program is that, in the pure gravity case, for a positive cosmological constant, the action is bounded below, allowing one to define a well-posed statistical ensemble of connections. We discretize this theory on a fixed hypercubic lattice and construct the corresponding partition function, including torsionful and torsionless ensembles. We provide an open C++ Monte Carlo implementation that can simulate these ensembles in arbitrary dimension, and we present proof-of-principle results in two dimensions.</description>

      <title>The DSSYK Model: Charge and Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Anti-de Sitter/Conformal Field Theory correspondence (AdS/CFT) is one of the most significant findings in theoretical physics and forms the basis of this thesis. Although highly powerful, the main limitation of AdS/CFT is that AdS does not appear in the real world outside of very specific limits. This limitation justifies the attempt to generalize the holographic principle to other spacetimes. In this thesis, we will pursue this direction and seek spacetimes that have at least some connection to de Sitter (dS), whose cosmological interest is evident. dS is, in fact, not only the geometry that best represents our Universe on large scales in the present, but also during the inflationary epoch that followed the Big Bang, where our current description of Nature fails completely.
  First, we will present some basic facts about the AdS/CFT correspondence. Then, the gravitational path integral will be introduced. After presenting the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and dilaton-gravity models, a holographic link between the two will be established. Next, we will discuss the double-scaled limit of SYK, known as DSSYK. We will then consider a ``charged'' variation of SYK with Dirac fermions, for which we will determine the fermionic two-point function. After studying the thermodynamic properties of the gravitational dual of DSSYK and the quasinormal modes of massive real scalars propagating in this geometry, we will conjecture how to modify the duality when considering the Dirac version of the model, showing that several bounds constrain the space of possible dual theories. Finally, we will summarize our findings and present an outlook on possible future developments based on the results described here.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we analyze the analytic structure of tree-level flat-space wavefunction coefficients (WFCs), with particular attention to fermionic operators, and derive cutting rules for internal-fermion lines. Building on these results, we set up an iterative procedure that, starting from the flat-space S-matrix, reconstructs the 3- and 4-point WFCs with the correct partial- and total-energy poles and satisfying the requisite cutting rules. Consequently, the "four-particle test" for flat-space WFCs imposes no additional constraints beyond the consistency of the flat-space S-matrix.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Boundary Correlators in (EA)dS space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we bootstrap de Sitter wavefunction coefficients (WFCs) involving fermionic operators. Starting with a fixed total-energy pole order, we systematically impose the conformal Ward identities (CWI) together with cutting-rule constraints. We derive the relevant cutting rules for fermionic exchange for the first time, enabling a complete determination of fermionic three- and four-point WFCs. We show that CWI fixes the leading total-energy-pole residue to the flat-space amplitude and subleading residues to curvature induced corrections to bulk vertices. The structure of the Ward-Takahashi identities are similarly fully determined. As an application, we derive four massless spin-1/2 WFC due to graviton exchange. We also revisit the tension between conserved spin-3/2 operators and de Sitter geometry. We demonstrate that the reality conditions appropriate to dS and Euclidean AdS (EAdS) lead to distinct three-point WFCs for two spin-3/2 operators and the stress tensor. Consequently, the residue of the leading total-energy pole for the four-point WFC receives graviton- and photon-exchange contributions with opposite signs in dS, whereas they appear with the same sign in EAdS. This result is reminiscent of the classic analysis by Pilch, van Nieuwenhuizen, and Sohnius, though formulated in an on-shell framework.</description>

Abstract: It is a long-standing problem in general relativity that the notion of angular momentum of an isolated system has supertranslation ambiguity. In this paper, we argue that the ambiguity is essentially because of the gravitational wave memory. When properly subtracting the memory effect of the observer, one can introduce a supertranslation invariant definition of the angular momentum at null infinity.</description>

      <title>Error and Disturbance as Irreversibility with Applications: Unified Definition, Wigner--Araki--Yanase Theorem and Out-of-Time-Order Correlator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14172v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Defining an error of measurement has long been a foundational problem in science: even in classical experiments, data are statistical and admit no single universally optimal definition of error. In quantum mechanics, the challenge deepens: observed entities often lack preexisting definite values, and the act of measurement unavoidably disturbs the system of interest. Consequently, both error and disturbance must be quantified, and various definitions have been proposed to date. However, a unified perspective for understanding the differences and similarities among these diverse definitions of error and disturbance, and an operational framework for distinguishing between them, remain elusive. In this Letter, we propose a novel framework for defining error and disturbance using irreversibility. Our framework converts the error and disturbance of a quantum measurement of a system under consideration into the irreversibility of an ancillary qubit system, using a quantum comb composed of loss and recovery processes. The mechanism enables us to make the operational distinction that error uses the classical outputs, while disturbance uses the quantum outputs of the measurement in the recovery process. Furthermore, our framework yields several key consequences: (i) it encompasses existing definitions, (ii) it establishes a universal constraint on error and disturbance defined by any measure of an arbitrary quantum process under a conservation law, and (iii) it reveals an operational connection between irreversibility and the out-of-time-ordered correlator (OTOC), a metric of quantum chaos. It also provides a constraint on the OTOC under a conservation law and a method for its experimental evaluation, which is demonstrated on a quantum processor.</description>

Abstract: We revisit an argument, originally given by Kivelson and Ro\v{c}ek, for why the existence of fractional charge necessarily implies fractional statistics. In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a global one-form ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, can be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, together with anomalies in ensemble averages, which may then be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <title>Nonminimal infrared gravitational reheating in light of ACT observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflation is known to produce large infrared scalar fluctuations. Further, if a scalar field $(\chi)$ is non-minimally coupled with gravity through $\xi \chi^2 R$, those infrared modes experience \textit{tachyonic instability} during and after inflation. Those large non-perturbative infrared modes can collectively produce hot Big Bang universe upon their horizon entry during the post-inflationary period. We indeed find that for reheating equation of state (EoS), $w_{\phi} &gt; 1/3$, and coupling strength, $\xi&gt;1/6$, large infrared fluctuations lead to successful reheating. We further analyze perturbative reheating by solving the standard Boltzmann equation in both Jordan and Einstein frames, and compare the results with the non-perturbative ones. Finally, embedding this infrared reheating scenario into the well-known $\alpha-$attractor inflationary model, we examine possible constraints on the model parameters in light of the latest ACT, DESI results. To arrive at the constraints, we take into account the latest bounds on tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r_{0.05}\leq 0.038$, isocurvature power spectrum, $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{S}} \lesssim 8.3\times 10^{-11}$, and effective number of relativistic degrees of freedom, $\Delta N_{\rm eff} \lesssim 0.17 $. Subject to these constraints, we find successful reheating to occur only for EoS $w_{\phi}\gtrsim 0.6$, which translates to a sub-class of $\alpha-$attractor models being favored and placing them within the 2$\sigma$ region in the $ n_s-r$ plane of the latest ACT, DESI data. In this range of EoS, we find that the coupling strength should lie within $2.11\lesssim\xi\lesssim 2.95$ for $w_{\phi}=0.6$. Finally, we compute secondary gravitational wave signals induced by the scalar infrared modes, which are found to be strong enough to be detected by future GW observatories, namely BBO, DECIGO, LISA, and ET.</description>

      <title>Gauge fields in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20134v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gauge field theory of the standard electroweak model in the presence of the electroweak bubble wall is investigated with an eye toward its applications to microscopic phenomena, which are supposed to have occurred during the phase transition in the early universe. The asymptotic fields are defined anew so that the effects of the position-dependent Higgs condensate are taken into account through the position-dependent $W$ and $Z$ boson masses. A novel method of massive gauge field quantization in the $R_{\xi}$-gauge with $\xi =1$ is proposed for the case of the position-dependent masses. Our procedure is based on the eigenfunction expansion method associated with second-order differential operators, i.e., a sort of generalized Fourier expansion.The commutation relations of creation and annihilation operators of various wave propagation modes are given in terms of the so-called spectral function. The decoupling of unphysical states from the physical S-matrix is also investigated along the line of Kugo-Ojima's quartet mechanism on the basis of the BRST symmetry. It is pointed out that one of the quartet fields is not merely the unphysical scalar field but should be a linear combination of the unphysical scalar and the gauge fields. The physical and unphysical polarizations of the gauge field waves are unambiguously distinguished and this will help us evaluate the friction caused by the physical polarization states of $W$ and $Z$ boson waves on the bubble wall during the phase transition in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Sourced Carrollian Fluids Dual to Black Hole Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20284v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The (degenerate) geometry of event horizons is linked to Carrollian fluids. We investigate the behavior of event horizons via a perturbative coupling to a massless scalar field, making connections to Carrollian hydrodynamics with a driving source, and discuss the fluid equilibration in tandem with the horizon's relaxation to equilibrium. We observe that after the perturbation dies off, the Carrollian fluid energy and momentum densities approach equilibrium as the horizon asymptotically becomes non-expanding. We connect the equilibration of the Carrollian fluid dual to the black hole horizon through the expansion of its background geometry.</description>

      <title>Plunge spectra as discriminators of black hole mimickers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work explores the prospect of using the plunge to identify potential black hole mimickers. We show that the plunge excites two generic spectral features. (i) At low frequencies, there is a comb of sharp resonances at the real parts of the mimicker quasi-normal modes. (ii) Above a threshold $M\omega_{\rm th}\!\approx\!0.39$ (for the dominant mode), the spectrum undergoes a qualitative break: with the black hole mimicker displaying significant deviations from the black hole. Though individual plunge SNRs in extreme mass ratio events are low and detecting them in a sea of noise is difficult, the coherent spectral features identified here may allow for enhancing the SNR by using multiple events.</description>

      <title>Mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, and tidal love numbers of anisotropic neutron stars in f (R,T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mass-radius relation, moment of inertia, and tidal love numbers of anisotropic neutron stars (NSs) have been investigated in $f(R,T)$ gravity by imposing two equations of state (EoS). We use the simplest form $f(R,T)=R+2\beta T$ model and adopt the anisotropy approach called Horvat model. To examine the viability of our calculations, we utilize the constraints from GW170817 and GW190814 observations. Moreover, we consider three values of $\beta$, i.e. $\beta=0$, $\beta=-0.01$, $\beta=-0.02$ and four anisotropy parameters $\alpha$, i.e. $\alpha=-0.12$, $\alpha=-0.06$, $\alpha=0.06$, $\alpha=0.12$. Our findings suggest that all physical quantities depend on both parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Nevertheless, the impact of $\alpha$ is much more significant than $\beta$. The calculation of masses satisfy each used constraints for specific values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In the case of the moment of inertia, the results are compatible with the constraint obtained from radio observation of heavy pulsar. On the other hand, the tidal deformability of the NSs composed of one EoS satisfy the GW170817 constraint while the NSs composed of the other one EoS are too small. These small numbers can be interpreted as the property of secondary object observed in GW190814. As a result, our theoretical investigation of NSs constructed with two EoS can be NSs candidates for GW170817 and GW190814, respectively.</description>

      <title>Interactions of Neutrino Wave Packets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22005v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The low energy effective field theory of interacting neutrinos derived from the Standard Model may be framed as a pointlike interaction and thereby modeled on a lattice of neutrino momenta. We identify a path to take a continuum limit of this lattice problem in the Center of Momentum frame. In this limit, the weak interaction is found to become trivial between incoming plane waves describing ultrarelativistic particles, unless finite neutrino wave packet sizes are taken into consideration. We follow up with an analytic treatment of interacting neutrino wave packets, demonstrating the importance of the wave packet size for characterizing neutrino-neutrino scattering in dense environments.</description>

      <title>Reinforcement Learning techniques for the flavor problem in particle physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25495v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short review discusses recent applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to the flavor problem in particle physics. Traditional approaches to fermion masses and mixing often rely on extensions of the Standard Model based on horizontal symmetries, but the vast landscape of possible models makes systematic exploration infeasible. Recent works have shown that RL can efficiently navigate this landscape by constructing models that reproduce observed quark and lepton observables. These approaches demonstrate that RL not only rediscovers models already proposed in the literature but also uncovers new, phenomenologically acceptable solutions.</description>

      <title>Study the nature of dynamical dark energy by measuring the CMB polarization rotation angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) support the dynamical dark energy. Intriguingly, the data favor a transition of the dark energy equation of state across $w=-1$, a hallmark of the Quintom scenario. In this paper, we consider a different approach to the dynamical nature of dark energy by investigating its interaction with ordinary matters, specifically the Chern-Simons (CS) interaction with photons. In cosmology, this interaction rotates the polarized plane of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons, which induces non-zero polarized TB and EB power spectra. We forecast this measurement with the Ali CMB Polarization Telescope (AliCPT) experiment. We take the best-fit value of the isotropic rotation angle from Planck data as our fiducial input. We project that 11 module-year (modyr) of observations will yield an improved detection sensitivity with a significance $\sim 5\sigma$, given a calibration precision of $0.1^\circ$ in the polarization angle. We also forecast AliCPT's sensitivity to the amplitude of a scale invariant spectrum of the anisotropic polarization rotation field. With $50$~modyr of observations, the large-aperture configuration is expected to reach $\sigma_{A_{\mathrm{CB}}}\sim10^{-2}$, offering a sixfold improvement over the small-aperture design and enabling competitive tests of spatial fluctuations in the dark energy field.</description>

      <title>Consistent Regularization of Signature-Changing BTZ Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spacetime singularities represent a fundamental challenge in gravitational physics. We present a mathematically consistent framework for signature-changing black holes based on the $(2+1)$-dimensional BTZ metric, where the signature transitions from Lorentzian $(-,+,+)$ to Euclidean $(+,+,+)$ at the horizon. We identify and rectify a critical inconsistency in previous regularization schemes concerning second-order distributional terms $\varepsilon''(r)$, introducing a \emph{modified Hadamard regularization} that respects distribution theory. This produces a vacuum solution free of surface layers and impulsive gravitational waves. Geodesic analysis reveals that radially infalling observers require infinite proper time to reach the horizon, effectively preventing access to the would-be singularity while maintaining finite curvature invariants throughout the spacetime. We further establish the physical robustness of the geometry by demonstrating linear stability against gravitational perturbations, showing that quantum scalar field propagation remains unitary and well-defined across the signature change, and reinterpreting the $r=0$ region as a topological boundary rather than a curvature singularity. Our work establishes atemporality via signature change as a mathematically rigorous mechanism for \emph{singularity avoidance} in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The Serendipitous Axiodilaton: A Self-Consistent Recombination-Era Solution to the Hubble Tension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13544v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axio-dilaton cosmology provides a minimal benchmark model for both Dark Matter (DM) and Dark Energy (DE) that is well motivated by fundamental physics. The axion and dilaton arise as pseudo-Goldstone modes of symmetries that predict particle masses depend on the dilaton, and therefore to evolve cosmologically, leading to correlated modifications of recombination physics, the sound horizon, and late-time expansion and growth histories. We confront this model with Planck 2018 temperature, polarisation, and lensing data, SPT-3G high-$\ell$ measurements, DESI DR2 BAO, and Pantheon$+$ supernovae, assuming that the axion makes up all of the dark matter and that the dilaton plays the role of a dark energy field. We find that it fits the data somewhat better than $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, with the $\chi^2$ lowered by $\simeq 7$ for three additional parameters, and significantly raises the inferred Hubble constant to $H_0 \simeq 69.2\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the Hubble tension to $\lesssim 3\sigma$ and thereby allowing a joint fit of CMB and SH0ES data. The model fits this enlarged data set as well as the $w_0w_a$ model with an electron mass modified by hand at recombination, though it does so with calculable dynamics. Axio-dilaton self-interactions robustly fake a phantom equation of state in DESI measurements. There is a sting: cosmology prefers dilaton-matter couplings $|\mathbf{g}|\sim 10^{-2}$-$10^{-1}$, which are large enough to have been detected in solar-system tests of General Relativity. These results show how axio-dilatons can provide a viable cosmology preferred by current data at surprisingly large couplings, within a framework that links dark energy, dark matter, and time-dependent particle masses in a coherent way. They suggest both new observable signals and new theoretical directions, aimed at resolving the apparent inconsistency with non-cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Is energy conserved in general relativity ?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This short report is dedicated to the 40th anniversary of International Journal of Modern Physics A (IJMPA) and Modern Physics Letters A (MPLA). While the report is based on a series of papers[1-8], its content reflects my personal viewpoints. Therefore I am solely responsible for all the statements in the report. In this report we discuss conservation of energies in a curved spacetime including general relativity. We argue that the matter energy is not necessarily conserved in a curved space time due to a lack of time translational invariance, and adding energy of gravitational fields to recover the conservation law of energies fails due to Noether's 2nd theorem. We show that there exists conserved quantities associated with the matter energy momentum tensor other than the energy in a curved spacetime, and discuss consequences of the existence of such conserved charges.</description>
