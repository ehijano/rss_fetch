      <title>Experimental and numerical study of CO$_{2}$ dissolution in a heterogeneous Hele-Shaw cell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the convective instability resulting from the dissolution of carbon dioxide (CO$_{2}$) into water in a heterogeneous Hele-Shaw cell utilizing both experimental and numerical approaches. Experiments are conducted in a Hele-Shaw cell with a variable gap width corresponding to a log-normally distributed permeability of variance $\sigma_{\log K}^2 = 0.135$. Two mean gaps (370 $\mu$m and 500 $\mu$m) with the same correlation lengths ($\lambda_x$ = 0.032 m and $\lambda_z$ = 0.016 m) are considered. Experiments in homogeneous cells with a constant gap are also performed. The CO$_2$ partial pressure ($P_{\text{CO}_{2}}$) is varied between $12\%\pm 1\%$ (0.12 bar) and $85\%\pm 1\%$ (0.85 bar). The convective patterns are visualized using Bromocresol green. The effect of the heterogeneity on the instability is analyzed through its wavenumber, amplitude and growth rate. There is a good agreement between the experimental and numerical results. Fingers appear more dispersive and distorted in the heterogeneous media. Heterogeneous cases display a larger instability amplitude, faster growth rate and smaller dimensionless wavenumber. This reflects that heterogeneity accelerates the instability and the merging of the fingers. A comparison of the autocorrelation function of the fingering patterns and the permeability field shows that heterogeneity increases the dimensionless correlation length of the fingering pattern, which slows down its growth when its size becomes comparable to the heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reduced-Order Models for Turbulent Flows Using Recurrent Neural Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper-orthogonal decomposition (POD) based reduced-order models (ROM) of structurally dominant fluid flow can support a wide range of engineering applications. Yet, although they perform well for unsteady laminar flows, their straightforward extension to turbulent flows fails to capture the effects of small scale eddies and often leads to divergent solutions. Several approaches to mimic nonlinear closure terms modeling techniques within ROM frameworks have been employed to include the effect of higher modes that are often neglected. Recent success of neural network based models show promising results in modeling the effects of turbulence. In this study, we augment POD-ROM with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to develop ROM for turbulent flows. We simulate a three dimensional flow past a circular cylinder at Reynolds number of 1000. We first compute the POD modes and project the Navier-Stokes equations onto the limited number of modes in a Galerkin approach to develop a conventional ROM and LES-inspired ROM for comparison. We then develop a hybrid model by integrating the output of Galerkin projection ROM and long short-term memory (LSTM) RNN and term it as a physics-guided machine learning (PGML) model. The novelty of this study is to introduce a hybrid model that integrates LES inspired ROM and RNN to achieve more accurate and reliable predictions of turbulent flows. The results demonstrate that PGML for higher temporal coefficients outperforms the conventional and LES-inspired ROM.</description>

      <title>Analytical and numerical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous occurrences of melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation phenomena</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) Stefan problem is a prototypical heat and mass transfer problem that analyzes the temperature distribution in a material undergoing phase change. In addition, it describes the evolution of the phase change front within the phase change material (PCM). Analytical solutions to the two-phase Stefan problem that describe melting of a solid or boiling of a liquid have been extensively discussed in the literature. Density change effects and associated fluid flow phenomena during phase change are typically ignored to simplify the analysis. As the PCM boils or condenses, it undergoes a density change of 1000 or more. The effects of density changes and convection cannot be ignored when dealing with such problems. In our recent work, we found analytical solutions to the two-phase Stefan problem that account for a jump in the thermophysical properties of the two phases, including density. In the present work, we extend our prior analyses to obtain analytical solutions to the three-phase Stefan problem in which an initially solid PCM melts and boils under imposed temperature conditions. This scenario is typical of metal additive manufacturing (AM) and welding processes, wherein a high-power laser melts and boils the metal powder or substrate. While deriving the analytical solution, all relevant jump conditions, including density and kinetic energy, are accounted for. It is shown that the three-phase Stefan problem admits similarity transformations and similarity solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first work that presents an analytical solution to the three-phase Stefan problem with simultaneous melting, solidification, boiling, and condensation (MSNBC). Furthermore, we describe a numerical method for solving the three-phase Stefan problem with second-order accuracy.</description>

      <title>Techniques for improved statistical convergence in quantification of eddy diffusivity moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While recent approaches, such as the macroscopic forcing method (MFM) or Green's function-based approaches, can be used to compute Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes closure operators using forced direct numerical simulations, MFM can also be used to directly compute moments of the effective nonlocal and anisotropic eddy diffusivities. The low-order spatial and temporal moments contain limited information about the eddy diffusivity but are often sufficient for quantification and modeling of nonlocal and anisotropic effects. However, when using MFM to compute eddy diffusivity moments, the statistical convergence can be slow for higher-order moments. In this work, we demonstrate that using the same direct numerical simulation (DNS) for all forced MFM simulations improves statistical convergence of the eddy diffusivity moments. We present its implementation in conjunction with a decomposition method that handles the MFM forcing semi-analytically and allows for consistent boundary condition treatment, which we develop for both scalar and momentum transport. We demonstrate that for a two-dimensional Rayleigh-Taylor instability case study, when this technique is applied with O(100) simulations, we achieve a similar quality of convergence as with O(1000) simulations using the original method. We then demonstrate the impacts of improved convergence on the quantification of the eddy diffusivity.</description>

      <title>Droplets Suspended Beneath a Fiber Hub</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Droplet-fiber interactions, prevalent in nature and widely applied across various engineering fields, have garnered significant research interest. Many works have focused on the interactions between droplets and single or two fibers. However, the wetting behavior of droplets, especially the maximum droplets that can be retained, on fiber hubs formed by many fibers is rarely studied. The current work explores the capability of fiber hubs to retain liquid droplets. We develop analytical and semi-empirical models to predict the maximum droplet volume on a fiber hub, validating them against experimental data. The variation of maximum volume follows two distinct regimes as the fiber count increases, with a critical fiber number ($n^* = 32$) marking the transition between them. In Regime I ($n\le n^*$), the volume increases with fiber number, and the stability of a droplet is dictated by the pinning of three-phase contact lines. In Regime II ($n&gt;n^*$), the volume plateaus, with droplets under a fiber hub behaving similarly to those on a flat surface, where the stability is governed by Rayleigh-Taylor instability.</description>

      <title>Assessment of the point-wise approach for the Turbulent Settling of finite-size particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the settling of suspensions of relatively large particles with a diameter of the order of ten Kolmogorov scales and density slightly larger than the carrier fluid in statistically steady homogeneous isotropic turbulence. The particle-to-fluid density ratio is varied to obtain a wide range of Galileo numbers, which are the ratios between buoyancy and viscous forces. We analyse the problem through high-resolved one-way coupled direct numerical simulations where the particles are modeled as material points. The physical parameters are chosen in the same range used in recent particle-resolved simulations, against which we compare (PRS, [1, 2]). The results of the point-wise simulations are in good agreement with the PRS ones, showing a reduced settling speed for the range of parameters under investigation, relevant to suspensions settling in aqueous media, at volume fractions up to a few percent for density ratios order of one. Results are obtained neglecting the inter-particles and particle-fluid interactions while purposely including/not including the different forces (e.g. Stokes drag, added mass, lift force) in the particles' equations of motion to highlight their contributions respectively. At a high Galileo number, the mean settling velocity is only slightly affected by turbulent fluctuations, and it is the same obtained for the settling velocity of a single particle in a quiescent fluid. When the Galileo number is reduced, the settling velocity is progressively affected by turbulent fluctuations that cause a substantial decrease in the particle sedimentation speed. The present results are particularly relevant for applications. Point-wise models endowed with an accurate description of the hydrodynamic force are effective in capturing the particle settling speed and other higher-order statistics as demonstrated by direct comparison against particle-resolved simulations [1, 2].</description>

      <title>A stochastic force model for a finite-size spherical particle in turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting particle-laden flows requires accurate fluid force models. However, a reliable particle force model for finite-size particles in turbulent flows remains lacking. In the present work, a fluid force model for a finite-size spherical particle in turbulence is developed by simulating turbulent flow past a fixed spherical particle using particle-resolved direct numerical simulation (PRDNS). Our simulation demonstrates that turbulence increases the mean drag force of the particle, which is consistent with previous studies. By correlating the DNS data as functions of the Reynolds number of particles, the ratio of the particle-to-turbulence scale, and the intensity ratio of the turbulence, an empirical correlation for the mean drag force is obtained. Furthermore, we find that the fluctuations of both the drag and lateral forces follow the Gaussian distribution. Consequently, the temporal variations of the fluctuating drag and lateral forces are modeled using a stochastic Langevin equation. Empirical correlations of the fluctuation intensities and time scales involved in the stochastic model are also determined from the DNS data. Finally, we simulate the movement of a finite-size particle in turbulence and the dispersion of particles in a turbulent channel flow to validate the proposed model. The proposed fluid force model requires the mean flow velocity, the kinetic energy of the turbulence, and the dissipation rate of the turbulence as inputs, which makes it well suited for combination with the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) approach.</description>

      <title>Efficient single-precision simulations of nematohydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of nematohydrodynamics on graphics processing units (GPUs) are typically performed using double precision, which ensures accuracy but significantly increases computational cost. However, consumer-grade GPUs are optimized for single-precision calculations, making double-precision simulations inefficient on widely available hardware. In this work, we demonstrate that single-precision simulations can achieve the same accuracy as double-precision methods while delivering a 27-fold increase in computational speed. To achieve this, we introduce two key improvements: (i) the shifted distribution function in the lattice Boltzmann method, which mitigates precision loss at low velocities, and (ii) the use of larger time steps in the finite-difference solver, which reduces numerical errors and improves overall accuracy. We find that, unlike in double precision, accuracy in single-precision simulations follows a non-monotonic trend with respect to the finite-difference time step, revealing an optimal regime for precise computations. To illustrate the effectiveness of our approach, we simulate the dynamics of single and multiple skyrmionic tubes in Poiseuille flow. Our results confirm that optimized single-precision simulations enable fast and accurate modeling of complex nematohydrodynamic systems, making large-scale simulations feasible on standard gaming GPUs.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced collisions of uncharged cloud droplets in an electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the collisions of uncharged, conducting droplets settling under gravity in the presence of an external electric field. Previous studies have derived a near-field asymptotic expression for the electric-field-induced attraction, suggesting that this force can overcome lubrication resistance and drive surface-to-surface contact between two spherical conductors within a finite time. However, for droplets moving in air, traditional lubrication theory breaks down when the inter-droplet gap approaches the mean free path of air molecules. To account for this, we incorporate non-continuum hydrodynamic effects to estimate the gravity-driven collision efficiency under electric-field-induced forces. This study examines how an external electric field influences the trajectories of settling droplet pairs of unequal sizes. By analyzing their motion, we compute collision efficiencies and explore their dependence on droplet size ratio, electric field strength, the angle between the field and gravity, and key dimensionless parameters governing electric-field-induced and van der Waals forces. Our findings reveal that electric-field-induced forces significantly enhance collision efficiency, highlighting their critical role in droplet coalescence dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spatio-temporal characterization of nonlinear forcing and response in turbulent channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadratic convection term in the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations is considered as a nonlinear forcing to the linear resolvent operator, and it is studied in the Fourier domain through the analysis of interactions between triadically compatible wavenumber-frequency triplets. A framework to quantify the triadic contributions to the forcing and response by each pair of triplets is developed and applied to data from direct numerical simulations of a turbulent channel at $Re_{\tau} \approx 550$. The linear resolvent operator is incorporated to provide the missing link from energy transfer between modes to the effect on the spectral turbulent kinetic energy. The coefficients highlight the importance of interactions involving large-scale structures, providing a natural connection to the modeling assumptions in quasi-linear (QL) and generalized quasi-linear (GQL) analyses. Specifically, it is revealed that the QL and GQL reductions efficiently capture important triadic interactions in the flow, especially when including of a small number of wavenumbers into the GQL large-scale base flow. Additionally, spatio-temporal analyses of the triadic contributions to a single mode representative of the near-wall cycle demonstrate the spatio-temporal nature of the triadic interactions and the effect of the resolvent operator, which selectively amplifies certain forcing profiles. The tools presented are expected to be useful for improving modeling of the nonlinearity, especially in QL, GQL, and resolvent analyses, and understanding the amplitude modulation mechanism relating large-scale fluctuations to the modulation of near-wall structures.</description>

      <title>Efficient data-driven flow modeling for accurate passive scalar advection in submesoscale domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowing the sea surface velocity field is essential for various applications, such as search and rescue operations and oil spill monitoring, where understanding the movement of objects or substances is critical. However, obtaining an accurate approximation of these advection processes is challenging, even with modern measuring equipment, such as high-frequency radar or advanced simulations based on oceanic flow models. Therefore this paper presents a data-driven framework to approximate sea surface velocity from spatially distributed observations, thus enabling efficient probability advection modeling across submesoscale domains. The system approximates transient flows by leveraging quasi-steady flow assumptions. To overcome the limitations of point measurements in capturing domain-wide circulation, the method employs a fusion of two simplified 2D flow models to approximate submesoscale dynamics, enabling complete velocity field reconstruction from scattered data. To ensure reliable flow dynamics, the approach iteratively adjusts boundary conditions in numerical simulations to align the simulated flow with observations. Experimental validation in Kvarner Bay using GPS-tracked drifters confirmed the system's ability to replace computationally intensive transient simulations by approximating flow fields based on model simplifications. The results demonstrate its efficiency across domains, making it a practical tool for real-world submesoscale applications requiring swift passive scalar advection.</description>

      <title>Trapping and Transport of Inertial Particles in a Taylor-Green Vortex: Effects of Added Mass and History Force</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of small inertial particles in a two-dimensional, steady Taylor-Green vortex flow. A classic study by Taylor (2022) showed that heavy inertial point particles (having density parameter R = 1) are trapped by the flow separatrices when the particle Stokes number St, which measures the particle's inertia, is less than 1/4. Here, we consider finitely dense particles, incorporating the previously neglected effects of added mass and the Boussinesq-Basset history force. Using linear stability analysis near stagnation points, we determine the critical parametric conditions in the St-R plane that leads to particle trapping within vortex cells. We identify additional stagnation points perceived by inertial particles, beyond the traditional ones at vortex cell corners, when the added mass effect is included, and we analyze their stability. Numerical analysis of the full nonlinear system confirms the existence of distinct particle behaviours--trapped, diffusive, and ballistic--depending on initial conditions, consistent with Nath et al. (2024), with modifications due to added mass effect. We delineate the regions in the St-R plane where these behaviours dominate based on the prominent particle dynamics. However, when both the history force and added mass effect are included, all particles exhibit ballistic motion regardless of St and R.</description>

      <title>Gravity-induced Diffusivity of an Axisymmetric Brownian Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A rigid axisymmetric particle with hydrodynamic anisotropy exhibits gliding motion in a quiescent Newtonian fluid under gravity. When Brownian motion is significant, the orientation of the particle fluctuates during sedimentation. We perform an analytical calculation for this sedimentation process. Our results show that gravity can significantly enhance the spatial diffusion of the particle. In addition to Brownian diffusion, gravity induces an additional apparent diffusivity. This gravity-induced diffusivity increases quadratically with the sedimentation P\'eclet number in the high P\'eclet number regime and is further enhanced by hydrodynamic anisotropy when the particle shape deviates from a sphere at a fixed P\'eclet number. When the centers of mass and buoyancy deviate from the hydrodynamic center, the particle tends to align with the direction of gravity. This alignment reduces the effective translational resistance along the gravity direction, thereby increasing the sedimentation velocity. At a given P\'eclet number, the horizontal diffusivity exhibits a peak before converging to the normal diffusion constant as the center deviation becomes larger.</description>

      <title>Low Mach number limit for the diffusion approximation model in radiation hydrodynamics at equilibrium-diffusion regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The low Mach number limit for the compressible viscous diffusion approximation model arising in radiation hydrodynamics is rigorously justified. For the 3-D Cauchy problem, the solutions in an equilibrium diffusion regime are shown to converge to the solutions of an incompressible Navier-Stokes equations locally and globally in time as Mach number goes to zero, when the effect of the small temperature variation upon the limit is taken into account.</description>

      <title>An implicit shock tracking method for simulation of shock-dominated flows over complex domains using mesh-based parametrizations</title>

Abstract: A mesh-based parametrization is a parametrization of a geometric object that is defined solely from a mesh of the object, e.g., without an analytical expression or computer-aided design (CAD) representation of the object. In this work, we propose a mesh-based parametrization of an arbitrary $d'$-dimensional object embedded in a $d$-dimensional space using tools from high-order finite elements. Using mesh-based parametrizations, we construct a boundary-preserving parametrization of the nodal coordinates of a computational mesh that ensures all nodes remain on all their original boundaries. These boundary-preseving parametrizations allow the nodes of the mesh to move only in ways that will not change the computational domain. They also ensure nodes will not move between boundaries, which would cause issues assigning boundary conditions for partial differential equation simulations and lead to inaccurate geometry representations for non-smooth boundary transitions. Finally, we integrate boundary-preserving, mesh-based parametrizations into high-order implicit shock tracking, an optimization-based discontinuous Galerkin method that moves nodes to align mesh faces with non-smooth flow features to represent them perfectly with inter-element jumps, leaving the intra-element polynomial basis to represent smooth regions of the flow with high-order accuracy. Mesh-based parametrizations enable implicit shock tracking simulations of shock-dominated flows over geometries without simple analytical parametrizations. Several demonstrations of mesh-based parametrizations are provided.</description>

      <title>Wave-Particle Based Multiscale Modeling and Simulation of Non-equilibrium Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for the direct numerical modeling and simulation of turbulent flows. The kinetic model equation is firstly extended to turbulent flow with the account of coupled evolution of kinetic, thermal, and turbulent energy. Based on the kinetic model, a unified framework for the laminar and turbulent flow is constructed through wave-particle decomposition, following the coupled evolution of wave and particles. The modeling is based on the assumption that the turbulence emergence is attributed to the breakdown of continuously connected fluid elements under the cell resolution. Then, the non-equilibrium transport of discrete fluid elements carrying the turbulent kinetic energy is constructed by the particle movement. The model leverages a hybrid wave-particle representation, where wave dynamics governed by the Navier-Stokes equations provide a background flow structure, while particle transport is driven by the unresolved turbulent dynamics. Particle non-equilibrium trajectory crossing, collision, and interaction with the background wave, distinguish the current model from conventional RANS and LES methodologies for the turbulent flow simulation. Instead of the dissipation model constructed in the mixing length theory, the present model presents a upgrading non-equilibrium transport model with particle penetration and collision. The transition between laminar and turbulent states is determined by the particle density in the wave-particle decomposition inside each cell. Emphasizing genuine non-equilibrium particle transport, the proposed multiscale method demonstrates enhanced accuracy for capturing the turbulent flow, where the Reynolds stress can be directly obtained from the flow field in the study of compressible mixing layer. This work offers a versatile tool for turbulence research with potential applications in aerospace, energy systems, etc.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the piston effect in supercritical fluids via a reversible--irreversible vector field splitting-based explicit time integration scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the vicinity of the liquid--vapor critical point, supercritical fluids behave strongly compressibly and, in parallel, thermophysical properties have strong state dependence. These lead to various peculiar phenomena, one of which being the piston effect where a sudden heating induces a mechanical pulse. The coupling between thermal and mechanical processes, in the linear approximation, yields a non-trivially rich thermoacoustics. The numerous applications of supercritical fluids raise the need for reliable yet fast and efficient numerical solution for thermoacoustic time and space dependence in this sensitive domain. Here, we present a second-order accurate, fully explicit staggered space-time grid finite difference method for such coupled linear thermoacoustic problems. Time integration is based on the splitting of the state space vector field representing the interactions that affect the dynamics into reversible and irreversible parts, which splitting procedure leads to decoupled wave and heat equations. The former is a hyperbolic partial differential equation, while the latter is a parabolic one, therefore, different time integration algorithms must be amalgamated to obtain a reliable, dispersion error-free, and dissipation error-free numerical solution. Finally, the thermoacoustic approximation of the supercritical piston effect is investigated via the developed method.</description>

      <title>Short-Time Force Response during the Impact of a Droplet with Gas Bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06378v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The presence of gas or vapour bubbles may strongly influence the forces that occur during the impact of a liquid mass onto a solid. Here, we study this effect numerically, in a well-controlled manner, by simulating the short-time interaction between an impacting droplet and a solid surface, mediated by the gas layer between droplet and solid just before collision, in the presence and absence of bubbles. A boundary integral method is used to simulate the falling droplet, the mediating air layer is modeled using lubrication theory, whereas uniform gas bubbles are added to the droplet that obey a polytropic equation of state. We show that the presence of gas bubbles inside the droplet can have a significant influence on the force exerted on the substrate, even before touchdown. This is due to the transmission of load from the solid, through the gas layer and finally into the bubbly droplet, buffering the impact. We simulate different bubble configurations, modifying their number, size, shape and initial position. It is found that larger bubbles, as well as those close to the impact zone, dampen the collision more as compared to small bubbles or the ones that are far from the droplet's surface. In addition, multiple small bubbles are shown to have a similar or even greater effect as a single large bubble.</description>

      <title>A geometrical Green-Naghdi type system for dispersive-like waves in prismatic channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08625v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 2D free surface gravity waves in prismatic channels with bathymetric variations uniquely in the transverse direction. Starting from the Saint-Venant equations (shallow water equations) we derive a 1D transverse averaged model describing dispersive effects solely related to variations of the channel topography. These effects have been demonstrated in Chassagne et al. JFM 2019 to be predominant in the propagation of bores with Froude numbers below a critical value of about 1.15. The model proposed is fully nonlinear, Galilean invariant, and admits a variational formulation under natural assumptions about the channel geometry. It is endowed with an exact energy conservation law, and admits exact travelling wave solutions. Our model generalizes and improves the linear equations proposed by Chassagne et al. JFM 2019, as well as Quezada de Luna and Ketcheson JFM 2021. The system is recast in two useful forms appropriate for its numerical approximations, whose properties are discussed. Numerical results allow to verify against analytical solutions the implementation of these formulations, and validate our model against fully 2D nonlinear shallow water simulations, as well as the famous experiments by Treske J. Hyd. Res. 1994.</description>

      <title>Simulation and modelling of convective mixing of carbon dioxide in geological formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform large-scale numerical simulations of convection in 3D porous media at Rayleigh-Darcy numbers up to $Ra=8\times10^4$. To investigate the convective mixing of carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) in geological formations, we consider a semi-infinite domain, where the CO$_2$ concentration is constant at the top and no flux is prescribed at bottom. Convection begins with a diffusion-dominated phase, transitions to convection-driven solute finger growth, and ends with a shutdown stage as fingers reach the bottom boundary and the concentration in the system increases. For $Ra \ge 5\times10^3$, we observe a constant-flux regime with dissolution flux stabilizing at 0.019, approximately 13\% higher than in 2D estimates. Finally, we provide a simple and yet accurate physical model describing the mass of solute entering the system throughout the whole mixing process. These findings extend solutal convection insights to 3D and high-$Ra$, improving the reliability of tools predicting the long-term CO$_2$ dynamics in the subsurface.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 strongly indicate the features of multiscale physics that can be identified using the Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between the scale transformation using filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and the inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We show that the spin angular momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. Our theoretical analysis shows that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the microscopic fluctuations even at the macroscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the microscopic fluctuations. In particular, the fluctuations can be amplified according to the size of the kernel radius at the macroscopic scale. Our further theoretical analysis shows that the Condiff viscosity model can serve as an SGS model and incorporate the quantum vortex interactions into the two-fluid model. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of the cryogenic liquid helium-4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous fluid particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity.</description>

      <title>Weak-Strong Uniqueness and Extreme Wall Events at High Reynolds Number</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00994v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Singular or weak solutions of the Euler equations have been hypothesized to acccount for anomalous dissipation at very high Reynolds numbers and, in particular, to explain the d'Alembert paradox of non-vanishing drag. A possible objection to this explanation is the mathematical property called "weak-strong uniqueness", which requires that any admissible weak solution of the Euler equations must coincide with the smooth Euler solution for the same initial data. As an application of the Josephson-Anderson relation, we sketch a proof of conditional weak-strong uniqueness for the potential Euler solution of d'Alembert within the class of strong inviscid limits. We suggest that the mild conditions required for weak-strong uniqueness are, in fact, physically violated by violent eruption of very thin boundary layers. We discuss observational signatures of these extreme events and explain how the small length-scales involved could threaten the validity of a hydrodynamic description.</description>

      <title>A fully conservative discrete velocity Boltzmann solver with parallel adaptive mesh refinement for compressible flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a parallel and fully conservative adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) implementation of a finite-volume-based kinetic solver for compressible flows. Time-dependent H-type refinement is combined with a two-population quasi-equilibrium Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook discrete velocity Boltzmann model. A validation has shown that conservation laws are strictly preserved through the application of refluxing operations at coarse-fine interfaces. Moreover, the targeted macroscopic moments of Euler and Navier-Stokes-Fourier level flows were accurately recovered with correct and Galilean invariant dispersion rates for a temperature range over three orders of magnitude and dissipation rates of all eigen-modes up to Mach of order 1.8. Results for one- and two-dimensional benchmarks up to Mach numbers of 3.2 and temperature ratios of 7, such as the Sod and Lax shock tubes, the Shu-Osher and several Riemann problems, as well as viscous shock-vortex interactions, have demonstrated that the solver precisely captures reference solutions. Excellent performance in obtaining sensitive quantities was proven, for example in the test case involving nonlinear acoustics, whilst, for the same accuracy and fidelity of the solution, the AMR methodology significantly reduced computational cost and memory footprints. Over all demonstrated two-dimensional problems, up to a 4- to 9-fold reduction was achieved and an upper limit of the AMR overhead of 30% was found in a case with very cost-intensive parameter choice. The proposed solver marks an accurate, efficient and scalable framework for kinetic simulations of compressible flows with moderate supersonic speeds and discontinuities, offering a valuable tool for studying complex problems in fluid dynamics.</description>

      <title>Intermittency assessed through a model of kurtosis-skewness relation in MHD in fast dynamo regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Intermittency as it occurs in fast dynamos in the MHD framework is evaluated through the examination of relations between normalized moments at third order (skewness S) and fourth order (kurtosis K) for both the velocity and magnetic field, and for their local dissipations. As investigated by several authors in various physical contexts such as fusion plasmas (Krommes (2008)), climate evolution (Sura &amp; Sardeshmukh (2008)), fluid turbulence or rotating stratified flows (Pouquet et al. (2023)), approximate parabolic K(S) ~ alpha laws emerge whose origin may be related to the applicability of intermittency models to their dynamics. The results analyzed herein are obtained through direct numerical simulations of MHD flows for both Taylor-Green and Beltrami ABC forcing at moderate Reynolds numbers, and for up to 314000 turn-over times. We observe for the dissipation 0.2 &lt; alpha &lt;3.0, an evaluation that varies with the field, the forcing, and when filtering for high-skewness intermittent structures. When using the She &amp; Leveque (1994) intermittency model, one can compute alpha analytically; we then find alpha = 2.5, clearly differing from a (strict) parabolic scaling, a result consistent with the numerical data.</description>

      <title>On the prediction of underwater aerodynamic noise of offshore wind turbines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing demand for offshore wind energy has led to a significant increase in wind turbine size and to the development of large-scale wind farms, often comprising 100 to 150 turbines. However, the environmental impact of underwater noise emissions remains largely unaddressed. This paper quantifies, for the first time, the underwater aerodynamic noise footprint of three large offshore turbines (5 MW, 10 MW, and 22 MW) and wind farms composed of these turbines. We propose a novel methodology that integrates validated wind turbine noise prediction techniques with plane wave propagation theory in different media, enabling turbine designers to predict and mitigate underwater noise emissions. Our results confirm that aerodynamic noise from offshore wind farms presents a potential environmental challenge, with negative effects on marine life. Addressing this issue is crucial to ensuring the sustainable expansion of offshore wind energy.</description>
