      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the 3D Navier-Stokes Equations in the Limiting Case: Infinitely Nested Logarithmic Improvements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a complete framework for infinitely nested logarithmic improvements to regularity criteria for the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Building upon our previous works on logarithmically improved and multi-level logarithmically improved criteria, we demonstrate that the limiting case of infinitely nested logarithms fully bridges the gap between subcritical and critical regularity. Specifically, we prove that if the initial data $u_0 \in L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)$ satisfies the condition $\|(-\Delta)^{1/4}u_0\|_{L^q(\mathbb{R}^3)} \leq C_0\Psi(\|u_0\|_{\dot{H}^{1/2}})$, where $\Psi$ incorporates infinitely nested logarithmic factors with appropriate decay conditions, then there exists a unique global-in-time smooth solution to the Navier-Stokes equations. This result establishes global well-posedness at the critical regularity threshold $s = 1/2$. The proof relies on infinitely nested commutator estimates, precise characterization of the critical exponent function in the limiting case, and careful analysis of the energy cascade. We also derive the exact Hausdorff dimension bound for potential singular sets in this limiting case, proving that the dimension reduces to zero. Through systematic construction of the limiting function spaces and detailed analysis of the associated ODEs, we demonstrate that infinitely nested logarithmic improvements provide a pathway to resolving the global regularity question for the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Complex structure of time-periodic solutions decoded in Poincar\'{e}-Lindstedt series: the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the rich structure of spherically symmetric time-periodic solutions of the cubic conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{S}^{3}$. We discover that the families of solutions bifurcating from the eigenmodes of the linearised equation form patterns similar to the ones observed for the cubic wave equation. Alongside the Galerkin approaches, we study them using the new method based on the Pad\'{e} approximants. To do so, we provide a rigorous perturbative construction of solutions. Due to the conformal symmetry, the solutions presented in this work serve as examples of large time-periodic solutions of the conformally coupled scalar field on the anti-de Sitter background.</description>

      <title>On Outer Pressure Problem of Compressible Navier-Stokes System with Degenerate Heat-Conductivity in Unbounded Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The compressible Navier-Stokes system with the constant viscosity and the nonlinear heat conductivity which is proportional to a positive power of the temperature and may be degenerate is considered. Under the outer pressure boundary conditions in one-dimensional unbounded spatial domains, the global existence of the strong solutions is obtained after proving that both the specific volume and temperature are bounded from below and above independently of time and space. Moreover, the asymptotically stability of global solutions is established as time tends to infinity.</description>

Abstract: In the article we establish the global well-posedness in W^{1,(6,2)}(R \times R+) of the integro-differential equation containing the cube of the one dimensional Laplacian and the transport term. Our proof relies on a fixed point technique. Furthermore, we formulate the condition leading to the existence of the nontrivial solution for our problem under the consideration.

      <title>Spectral properties of operators and wave propagation in high-contrast media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper aims to study the spectral properties of elliptic operators with highly inhomogeneous coefficients and related issues concerning wave propagation in high-contrast media. A unified approach to solving problems in bounded domains with Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions, as well as in infinite periodic media, is proposed. For a small parameter $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ characterizing the contrast of the components of the medium, the analyticity of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions is established in a neighborhood of $\varepsilon = 0$. Effective operators corresponding to $\varepsilon = 0$ are described.</description>

      <title>Global Existence and Finite-Time Blow-Up of Solutions for Parabolic Equations Involving the Fractional Musielak $g_{x,y}$-Laplacian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the parabolic fractional Musielak $g_{x,y}$-Laplacian equation:
  \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{aligned}
  u_{t} + (-\Delta)_{{g}_{x,y}}^{s} u &amp;= f(x,u), &amp;&amp; \text{in } \Omega \times (0, \infty),
  u &amp;= 0, &amp;&amp; \text{on } \mathbb{R}^N \setminus \Omega \times (0, \infty),
  u(x,0) &amp;= u_0(x), &amp;&amp; \text{in } \Omega, \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation*} where $(-\Delta)_{{g}_{x,y}}^{s}$ denotes the fractional Musielak $g_{x,y}$-Laplacian, and $f$ is a Carath\'eodory function satisfying subcritical growth conditions. Using the modified potential well method and Galerkin's method, we establish results on the local and global existence of weak and strong solutions, as well as finite-time blow-up, depending on the initial energy level (low, critical, or high). Moreover, we explore a class of nonlocal operators to highlight the broad applicability of our approach.
  This study contributes to the developing theory of fractional Musielak-Sobolev spaces, a field that has received limited attention in the literature. To our knowledge, this is the first work addressing the parabolic fractional $g_{x,y}$-Laplacian equation.</description>

      <title>Regularity estimates for quasilinear elliptic PDEs in non-divergence form with Hamiltonian terms and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate regularity estimates for a class of quasilinear elliptic equations in the non-divergence form that may exhibit degenerate behavior at critical points of their gradient. The prototype equation under consideration is $$ |\nabla u(x)|^{\theta}\left( \Delta_{p}^{\mathrm{N}} u(x) + \langle\mathfrak{B}(x), \nabla u\rangle \right) + \varrho(x) |\nabla u(x)|^{\sigma} = f(x) \quad \text{in} \quad B_1, $$ where $\theta &gt; 0$, $\sigma \in (\theta, \theta + 1)$, and $p \in (1, \infty)$. The coefficients $\mathfrak{B}$ and $\varrho$ are bounded continuous functions, and the source term $f \in \mathrm{C}^{0}(B_1) \cap L^{\infty}(B_1)$. We establish interior $\mathrm{C}^{1,\alpha}_{\text{loc}}$ regularity for some $\alpha \in (0,1)$, along with sharp quantitative estimates at critical points of existing solutions. Additionally, we prove a non-degeneracy property and establish both a Strong Maximum Principle and a Hopf-type lemma. In the final part, we apply our analytical framework to study existence, uniqueness, improved regularity, and non-degeneracy estimates for H\'{e}non-type models in the non-divergence form. These models incorporate strong absorption terms and linear/sublinear Hamiltonian terms and are of independent mathematical interest. Our results partially extend (for the non-variational quasilinear setting) the recent work by the second author in collaboration with Nornberg [Calc. Var. Partial Differential Equations 60 (2021), no. 6, Paper No. 202, 40 pp.], where sharp quantitative estimates were established for the fully nonlinear uniformly elliptic setting with Hamiltonian terms.</description>

      <title>Large-time behavior of solutions to the Boussinesq equations with partial dissipation and influence of rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the stability and large-time behavior of solutions to the rotating Boussinesq system under the influence of a general gravitational potential $\Psi$, which is widely used to model the dynamics of stratified geophysical fluids on the $f-$plane. Our main results are threefold: First, by imposing physically realistic boundary conditions and viscosity constraints, we prove that the solutions of the system smust necessarily take the following steady-state form $(\rho,u,v,w,p)=(\rho_s,0,v_s,0, p_s)$. These solutions are characterized by both geostrophic balance, given by $fv_s-\frac{\partial p_s}{\partial x}=\rho_s\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial x}$ and hydrostatic balance, expressed as $-\frac{\partial p_s}{\partial z}=\rho_s\frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial z}$. Second, we establish that any steady-state solution satisfying the conditions $\nabla \rho_s=\delta (x,z)\nabla \Psi$ with $v_s(x,z)=a_0x+a_1$ is linearly unstable when the conditions $\delta(x,z)|_{(x_0,z_0)}&gt;0$ and $(f+\alpha_0)\leq 0$ are simultaneously satisfied. This instability under the condition $\delta(x,z)|_{(x_0,z_0)}&gt;0$ corresponds to the well-known Rayleigh-Taylor instability. Third, although the inherent Rayleigh-Taylor instability could potentially amplify the velocity around unstable steady-state solutions (heavier density over lighter one), we rigorously demonstrate that for any sufficiently smooth initial data, the solutions of the system asymptotically converge to a neighborhood of a steady-state solution in which both the zonal and vertical velocity components vanish. Finally, under a moderate additional assumption, we demonstrate that the system converges to a specific steady-state solution. In this state, the density profile is given by $\rho=-\gamma \Psi+\beta$, where $\gamma$ and $\beta$ are positive constants, and the meridional velocity $v$ depends solely and linearly on $x$ variable.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Diffusion Equations on Graphs: Global Well-Posedness, Blow-Up Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a nonlinear diffusion equation on graphs whose nonlinearity violates the Lipschitz condition, we prove short-time solution existence and characterize global well-posedness by establishing sufficient criteria for blow-up phenomena and quantifying blow-up rates. These theoretical results are then applied to model complex dynamical networks, with supporting numerical experiments. This work mainly makes two contributions: (i) generalization of existing results for diffusion equations on graphs to cases with nontrivial potentials, producing richer analytical results; (ii) a new PDE approach to model complex dynamical networks, with preliminary numerical experiments confirming its validity.</description>

      <title>Maximum principles and spectral analysis for the superposition of operators of fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a "superposition operator" obtained through the continuous superposition of operators of mixed fractional order, modulated by a signed Borel finite measure defined over the set $[0, 1]$. The relevance of this operator is rooted in the fact that it incorporates special and significant cases of interest, like the mixed operator $-\Delta + (-\Delta)^s$, the (possibly) infinite sum of fractional Laplacians and allows to consider operators carrying a "wrong sign".
  We first outline weak and strong maximum principles for this type of operators. Then, we complete the spectral analysis for the related Dirichlet eigenvalue problem started in [DPLSV25b].</description>

      <title>Convergence rate for a semidiscrete approximation of scalar conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a semidiscrete scheme for approximation of entropy solutions of one-dimensional scalar conservation laws with nonnegative initial data. The scheme is based on the concept of particle paths for conservation laws and can be interpreted as a finite-particle discretization. A convergence rate of order $1/2$ with respect to initial particle spacing is proved. As a special case, this covers the convergence of the Follow--the--Leader model to the Lighthill--Whitham--Richards model for traffic flow.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of mild solutions for 2d-heat equations with singular initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent article by the authors [15] it was shown that wide classes of semilinear elliptic equations with exponential type nonlinearities admit singular radial solutions $U$ on the punctured disc in $\mathbb R^2$ which are also distributional solutions on the whole disc. We show here that these solutions, taken as initial data of the associated heat equation, give rise to non-uniqueness of mild solutions: ${u_s}(t,x) \equiv U(x)$ is a stationary solution, and there exists also a solution ${u_r}(t,x)$ departing from $U$ which is bounded for $t &gt; 0$. While such non-uniqueness results have been known in higher dimensions by Ni--Sacks [33], Terraneo [40] and Galaktionov--Vazquez [16], only two very specific results have recently been obtained in two dimensions by Ioku--Ruf--Terraneo [22] and Ibrahim--Kikuchi--Nakanishi--Wei [21].</description>

      <title>Mountain pass solution to the Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem with logarithmic perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we give a positive answer to the conjecture raised by Hajaiej et al. (J. Geom. Anal., 2024, 34(6): No. 182, 44 pp) on the existence of a mountain pass solution at positive energy level to the Br\'{e}zis-Nirenberg problem with logarithmic perturbation. To be a little more precise, by taking full advantage of the local minimum solution and some very delicate estimates on the logarithmic term and the critical term, we prove that the following problem \begin{eqnarray*} \begin{cases} -\Delta u= \lambda u+\mu|u|^2u+\theta u\log u^2, &amp;x\in\Omega,\\ u=0, &amp;x\in\partial\Omega \end{cases} \end{eqnarray*} possesses a positive mountain pass solution at positive energy level, where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^4$ is a bounded domain with smooth boundary $\partial\Omega$, $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$, $\mu&gt;0$ and $\theta&lt;0$. A key step in the proof is to control the mountain pass level around the local minimum solution from above by a proper constant to ensure the local compactness. Moreover, this result is also extended to three-dimensional and five-dimensional cases.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an analytical framework for the partial differential equation underlying the consensus-based optimization model. The main challenge arises from the nonlinear, nonlocal nature of the consensus point, coupled with a diffusion term that is both singular and degenerate. By employing a regularization procedure in combination with a compactness argument, we establish the global existence and uniqueness of weak solutions in $L^\infty(0,T;L^1\cap L^\infty(\mathbb{R}^d))$. Furthermore, we show that the weak solutions exhibit improved $H^2$-regularity when the initial data is regular.</description>

      <title>Infinite Prandtl number convection with Navier-slip boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with infinite Prandtl number Rayleigh--B\'enard convection with Navier-slip boundary conditions. The goal of this work is to estimate the average upward heat flux measured by the nondimensional Nusselt number $Nu$ in terms of the Rayleigh number $Ra$, which is a nondimensional quantity measuring the imposed temperature gradient. We derive bounds on the Nusselt number that coincide for relatively small slip lengths with the optimal Nusselt number scaling for no-slip boundaries, $Nu\lesssim Ra^{1/3}$; for relatively large slip lengths, we recover scaling estimates for free-slip boundaries, $Nu\lesssim Ra^{5/12}$.</description>

      <title>Magnetic uniform resolvent estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish uniform $L^{p}-L^{q}$ resolvent estimates for magnetic Schr\"odinger operators $H=(i\partial+A(x))^2+V(x)$ in dimension $n \geq 3$. Under suitable decay conditions on the electromagnetic potentials, we prove that for all $z \in \mathbb{C}\setminus[0,+\infty)$ with $|\Im z| \leq 1$, the resolvent satisfies \begin{equation*} \|(H-z)^{-1}\phi\|_{L^{q}}\lesssim|z|^{\theta(p,q)} (1+|z|^{\frac 12 \frac{n-1}{n+1}}) \|\phi\|_{L^{p}} \end{equation*} where $\theta(p,q)=\frac{n}{2}(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{q})-1$. This extends previous results by providing estimates valid for all frequencies with explicit dependence on $z$, covering the same optimal range of indices as the free Laplacian case, and including weak endpoint estimates. We also derive a variant with less stringent decay assumptions when restricted to a smaller parameter range. As an application, we establish the first $L^p-L^{p'}$ bounds for the spectral measure of magnetic Schr\"odinger operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the Maslov index to obtain a lower bound on the number of unstable eigenvalues associated with standing pulse solutions in skew-gradient systems. Based on this, we establish an instability criterion for the standing pulse. As an application, the results are applied to FitzHugh-Nagumo type systems, in which the activator and inhibitor reaction terms exhibit inherent nonlinear structures.</description>

      <title>Global asymptotic behavior of solutions to the generalized derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the global asymptotic behavior for the generalized derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger (gDNLS) equation. When the nonlinear effect is not strong, we show pointwise-in-time dispersive decay for solutions to the gDNLS equation with small initial data in $H^{\frac{1}{2}+}(\mathbb{R})$ utilizing crucially Lorentz-space improvements of the traditional Strichartz inequality. When the nonlinear effect is especially dominant, there exists a sequence of solitary waves that are arbitrary small in the energy space, which means the small data scattering is not true. However, there is evidence that it is not possible for the solitons to be localized in $L^{2}(\mathbb{R})$ and small in $H^{1}(\mathbb{R})$. With small and localized data assumption, we obtain global asymptotic behavior for solutions to the gDNLS equation by using vector field methods combined with the testing by wave packets method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the large-time behavior of finite-energy weak solutions for the Vlasov-Navier-Stokes equations in a two-dimensional torus. We focus first on the homogeneous case where the ambient (incompressible and viscous) fluid carrying the particles has a constant density, and then on the variable-density case. In both cases, large-time convergence to a monokinetic final state is demonstrated. For any finite energy initial data, we exhibit an algebraic convergence rate that deteriorates as the initial particle distribution increases. When the initial particle distribution is suitably small, then the convergence rate becomes exponential, a result consistent with the work of Han-Kwan et al. [17] dedicated to the homogeneous, three-dimensional case, where an additional smallness condition on the velocity was required. In the non-homogeneous case, we establish similar stability results, allowing a piecewise constant fluid density with jumps.</description>

      <title>Rate-form equilibrium for an isotropic Cauchy-elastic formulation: Part I: modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the rate-form spatial equilibrium system for a nonlinear Cauchy elastic formulation in isotropic finite-strain elasticity. For a given explicit Cauchy stress-strain constitutive equation, we determine those properties that pertain to the appearing fourth-order stiffness tensor. Notably, we show that this stiffness tensor $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}(\sigma)$ acting on the Zaremba-Jaumann stress rate is uniformly positive definite. We suggest a mathematical treatment of the ensuing spatial PDE-system which may ultimately lead to a local existence result, to be presented in part II of this work. As a preparatory step, we show existence and uniqueness of a subproblem based on Korn's first inequality and the positive definiteness of this stiffness tensor. The procedure is not confined to Cauchy elasticity, however in the Cauchy elastic case, most theoretical statements can be made explicit.
  Our development suggests that looking at the rate-form equations of given Cauchy-elastic models may provide additional insight to the modeling of nonlinear isotropic elasticity. This especially concerns constitutive requirements emanating from the rate-formulation, here being reflected by the positive definiteness of $\mathbb{H}^{\text{ZJ}}(\sigma)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On real metric manifolds admitting a co-dimension one foliation, sectorial operators are introduced that interpolate between the generalized Laplacian and the d'Alembertian. This is used to construct a one-parameter family of analytic semigroups that remains well-defined into the near Lorentzian regime. In the strict Lorentzian limit we identify a sense in which a well-defined Schr\"{o}dinger evolution group arises. For the analytic semigroups we show in addition that: (i) they act as integral operators with kernels that are jointly smooth in the semigroup time and both spacetime arguments. (ii) the diagonal of the kernels admits an asymptotic expansion in (shifted) powers of the semigroup time whose coefficients are the Seeley-DeWitt coefficients evaluated on the complex metrics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Allard's Interior $\varepsilon$-Regularity Theorem for $m$-dimensional varifolds with generalized mean curvature in $L^p_{loc}$, for $p&gt;m$, in Alexandrov spaces of dimension $n$ with double-sided bounded intrinsic sectional curvature. We first give an intrinsic proof of this theorem in the case of varifolds in Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$ whose metric tensor is at least of class $\mathcal{C}^2$, without using Nash's Isometric Embedding Theorem. This approach provides explicitly computable constants that depend only on $n$, $m$, the injectivity radius and bounds on the sectional curvature, which is essential for proving our main theorem, as we establish it through a density argument in the topological space of Riemannian manifolds with positive lower bounds on the injectivity radius and double-sided bounds on sectional curvature, equipped with the $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ topology, for every $\alpha \in ]0,1[$ (in fact, it is enough with the $W^{2,q}$ topology for some suitable $q$ large enough).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10779v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a conformally invariant equation involving the Dirac operator and a non-linearity of convolution type. This non-linearity is inspired from the conformal Einstein-Dirac problem in dimension 4. We first investigate the compactness, bubbling and energy quantization of the associated energy functional then we characterize the ground state solutions of the problem on the standard sphere. As a consequence, we prove an Aubin-type inequality that assures the existence of solutions to our problem and in particular the conformal Einstein-Dirac problem in dimension 4. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a linear perturbation to our problem, leading us to a Brezis-Nirenberg type result.</description>

      <title>Hessian stability and convergence rates for entropic and Sinkhorn potentials via semiconcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we determine quantitative stability bounds for the Hessian of entropic potentials, i.e., the dual solution to the entropic optimal transport problem. Up to authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this second-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our proof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on the representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward diffusion processes, known as Schr\"odinger bridges. Moreover, our approach allows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability entropic estimates and integrated gradient estimates as well. Finally, as a direct consequence of these stability bounds, we deduce exponential convergence rates for gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a problem that was still open in unbounded settings. Our rates have a polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.14477v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work is dedicated to foundational aspects of general (nonlinear second order) potential theories and fully nonlinear elliptic PDEs. In particular, we systematically develop the fundamental role played by semiconvex functions as a bridge between the classical and viscosity theory of generalized subharmonics determined by a given subequation constraint set in the bundle of $2$-jets over open subsets of Euclidian spaces.
  The first part is dedicated to four fundamental and complementary aspects of semiconvex analysis for the viscosity theory of subharmonic functions in general potential theories: differentiability properties of first and second order for locally semiconvex functions; a detailed analysis of their upper contact jets and upper contact points; the deep analytical results which ensure the existence of sets of contact points with positive measure; the well-known device of semiconvex approximation of upper semicontinuous functions.
  The second part is dedicated to general potential theories. The fundamental roles of duality and monotonicity are discussed, along with the main tools in the viscosity theory of subharmonics and the essential role that semiconvex functions play in that theory. The validity of the comparison principle is examined in two distinct regimes of sufficient monotonicity and minimal monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate minimizers of non-differentiable functionals epitomizing the degenerate quenching problem. The main result establishes the finiteness of the $(n-1)-$dimensional Hausdorff measure of the free boundary. Our approach hinges on optimal gradient decay estimates, derived via an intrinsic Harnack-type inequality, combined with a fine analysis in a flatness regime, where minimizers exhibit enhanced regularity. While the results are formulated for the degenerate setting, they also provide insights applicable to the singular case. Additionally, the findings offer an alternative proof of classical results by Phillips, further demonstrating their robustness and potential for broader applicability in the analysis of free boundary problems.</description>

Abstract: These notes review the theory of Fisher information, especially its use in kinetic theory of gases and plasmas. The recent monotonicity theorem by Guillen--Silvestre for the Landau--Coulomb equation is put in perspective and generalised. Following my joint work with Imbert and Silvestre, it is proven that Fisher information is decaying along the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation, for all relevant interactions, and from this the once longstanding problem of regularity estimates for very singular collision kernels (very soft potentials) is solved.</description>

      <title>Separation of the initial conditions in the inverse problem for 1D non-linear tsunami wave run-up theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse tsunami wave problem within the framework of the 1D nonlinear shallow water equations (SWE). Specifically, we focus on determining the initial displacement $\eta_0(x)$ and velocity $u_0(x)$ of the wave, given the known motion of the shoreline $R(t)$ (the wet/dry free boundary). We demonstrate that for power-shaped inclined bathymetries, this problem admits a complete solution for any $\eta_0$ and $u_0$, provided the wave does not break. In particular, we show that the knowledge of $R(t)$ enables the unique recovery of both $\eta_0(x$) and $u_0(x)$ in terms of the Abel transform.
  It is important to note that, in contrast to the direct problem (also known as the tsunami wave run-up problem), where $R(t)$ can be computed exactly only for $u_0(x)=0$, our algorithm can recover $\eta_0$ and $u_0$ exactly for any non-zero $u_0$. This highlights an interesting asymmetry between the direct and inverse problems. Our results extend the work presented in \cite{Rybkin23,Rybkin24}, where the inverse problem was solved for $u_0(x)=0$. As in previous work, our approach utilizes the Carrier-Greenspan transformation, which linearizes the SWE for inclined bathymetries. Extensive numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Structure stability of steady supersonic shear flow with inflow boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence and zero viscous limit of smooth solutions to steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations near plane shear flow between two moving parallel walls. Under the assumption $0&lt;L\ll1$, we prove that for any plane supersonic shear flow $\mathbf{U}^0=(\mu(x_2),0)$, there exist smooth solutions near $\mathbf{U}^0$ to steady compressible Navier-Stokes equations in a 2-dimension domain $\Omega=(0,L)\times (0,2)$. Moreover, based on the uniform-in-$\varepsilon$ estimates, we establish the zero viscosity limit of the solutions obtained above to the solutions of the steady Euler equations.</description>

      <title>Stability threshold for two-dimensional Boussinesq systems near-Couette shear flow in a finite channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the stability threshold problem of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes Boussinesq(NSB) equations in a finite channel $ \T \times [-1,1]$, focusing on the stability around the near Couette shear flow $ (U(y), 0)$, assuming the Navier slip boundary conditions are satisfied. In particular, when the initial data for the vorticity resides in an anisotropic Sobolev space of size $ O(\min \{ \mu^{\frac{1}{2}}, \nu^{\frac{1}{2}}\})$, and the initial perturbation of the temperature resides in an anisotropic Sobolev space of size $ O(\min \{ \mu, \nu\})$, we derive the nonlinear enhanced dissipation effect and the inviscid damping effect for the NSB system.</description>

      <title>A Policy Iteration Method for Inverse Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a policy iteration method to solve an inverse problem for a mean-field game (MFG) model, specifically to reconstruct the obstacle function in the game from the partial observation data of value functions, which represent the optimal costs for agents. The proposed approach decouples this complex inverse problem, which is an optimization problem constrained by a coupled nonlinear forward and backward PDE system in the MFG, into several iterations of solving linear PDEs and linear inverse problems. This method can also be viewed as a fixed-point iteration that simultaneously solves the MFG system and inversion. We prove its linear rate of convergence. In addition, numerical examples in 1D and 2D, along with performance comparisons to a direct least-squares method, demonstrate the superior efficiency and accuracy of the proposed method for solving inverse MFGs.</description>

      <title>Aggregation-diffusion in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10147v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aggregation-diffusion equations are foundational tools for modelling biological aggregations. Their principal use is to link the collective movement mechanisms of organisms to their emergent space use patterns in a concrete mathematical way. However, most existing studies do not account for the effect of the underlying environment on organism movement. In reality, the environment is often a key determinant of emergent space use patterns, albeit in combination with collective aspects of motion. This work studies aggregation-diffusion equations in a heterogeneous environment in one spatial dimension. Under certain assumptions, it is possible to find exact analytic expressions for the steady-state solutions when diffusion is quadratic. Minimising the associated energy functional across these solutions provides a rapid way of determining the likely emergent space use pattern, which can be verified via numerical simulations. This energy-minimisation procedure is applied to a simple test case, where the environment consists of a single clump of attractive resources. Here, self-attraction and resource-attraction combine to shape the emergent aggregation. Two counter-intuitive findings emerge from these analytic results: (a) a non-monotonic dependence of clump width on the aggregation width, (b) a positive correlation between self-attraction strength and aggregation width when the resource attraction is strong. These are verified through numerical simulations. Overall, the study shows rigorously how environment and collective behaviour combine to shape organism space use, sometimes in counter-intuitive ways.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20373v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and N\'eel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Stability of Infinite-Dimensional Systems Under Monotone Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness and stability of an impedance passive infinite-dimensional linear system under nonlinear feedback of the form $u(t)=\phi(v(t)-y(t))$, where $\phi$ is a monotone function. Our first main result introduces conditions guaranteeing the existence of classical and generalised solutions in a situation where the original linear system is well-posed. In the absence of the external input $v$ we establish the existence of strong and generalised solutions under strictly weaker conditions. Finally, we introduce conditions guaranteeing that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Motivated by the analysis of partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, we use our results to investigate the well-posedness and stablility of abstract boundary control systems, port-Hamiltonian systems, a Timoshenko beam model, and a two-dimensional boundary controlled heat equation.</description>
