      <title>Paradigm Shift in Infrastructure Inspection Technology: Leveraging High-performance Imaging and Advanced AI Analytics to Inspect Road Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective road infrastructure management is crucial for modern society. Traditional manual inspection techniques remain constrained by cost, efficiency, and scalability, while camera and laser imaging methods fail to capture subsurface defects critical for long-term structural integrity. This paper introduces ROVAI, an end-to-end framework that integrates high-resolution X-ray computed tomography imaging and advanced AI-driven analytics, aiming to transform road infrastructure inspection technologies. By leveraging the computational power of world-leading supercomputers, Fugaku and Frontier, and SoTA synchrotron facility (Spring-8), ROVAI enables scalable and high-throughput processing of massive 3D tomographic datasets. Our approach overcomes key challenges, such as the high memory requirements of vision models, the lack of labeled training data, and storage I/O bottlenecks. This seamless integration of imaging and AI analytics facilitates automated defect detection, material composition analysis, and lifespan prediction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of ROVAI in real-world scenarios, setting a new standard for intelligent, data-driven infrastructure management.</description>

      <title>Prime Collective Communications Library -- Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This report presents the Prime Collective Communications Library (PCCL), a novel fault-tolerant collective communication library designed for distributed ML workloads over the public internet. PCCL introduces a new programming model that enables dynamic peer joining and failure recovery. The library implements efficient collective operations like all-reduce while providing robust fault tolerance mechanisms that allow the system to continue operating even when peers fail or join during ongoing operations. We demonstrate that PCCL's design enables practical solutions to dynamic membership challenges in workloads with repeated operations and deterministic state advancement. Our implementation passes extensive stress tests across all major operating systems, showing reliable operation even under rapid peer churn and concurrent collective operations. By dispatching to multiple connections, we can efficiently utilize cross-continental long-fat-pipe TCP WAN links, in our experiments achieving up to 45 Gbit/s of bandwidth utilization across Europe and 25 Gbit/s across North America and Europe. PCCL's architecture enables easy implementation of distributed low-communication optimization strategies like DiLoCo, which significantly reduce communication frequency. Combined with quantization, this leads to a significant reduction in the bandwidth required for distributed training workloads. PCCL also allows for concurrent collective operations, which enables optimization strategies like async DiLoCo, which can completely hide communication overhead by implementing one-step delayed parameter updates. PCCL can facilitate exact bit-parity of the shared state across peers in all cases induced by graceful or abrupt peer churn. While PCCL exposes a C99 API, Python bindings are available which are compatible with PyTorch alongside FSDP. PCCL is available under the open source MIT license.</description>

      <title>SkyMemory: A LEO Edge Cache for Transformer Inference Optimization and Scale Out</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We expand the scope of cache memory to include LEO constellations, which are highly distributed systems with thousands of satellites connected with free-space optics inter-satellite links (ISL) always only one hop from any point on earth. We show how to increase the number of cache hits and improve the speed of inference for the important use case of LLMs. These benefits apply not only to LLMs, both terrestrially hosted and on satellites, but also generalize to any cache distributed over multiple locations that needs to be accessed in a timely manner. We show the benefit of our key value cache (KVC) protocol in simulations and present a proof-of-concept implementation of the protocol for KVCs on a testbed comprising 5 Intel NUC Linux mini PCs hosting a 19x5 constellation, with an NVIDIA Jetson Nano 8GB GPU hosting the LLM.</description>

      <title>Federated prediction for scalable and privacy-preserved knowledge-based planning in radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Deep learning has potential to improve the efficiency and consistency of radiation therapy planning, but clinical adoption is hindered by the limited model generalizability due to data scarcity and heterogeneity among institutions. Although aggregating data from different institutions could alleviate this problem, data sharing is a practical challenge due to concerns about patient data privacy and other technical obstacles. Purpose: This work aims to address this dilemma by developing FedKBP+, a comprehensive federated learning (FL) platform for predictive tasks in real-world applications in radiotherapy treatment planning. Methods: We implemented a unified communication stack based on Google Remote Procedure Call (gRPC) to support communication between participants whether located on the same workstation or distributed across multiple workstations. In addition to supporting the centralized FL strategies commonly available in existing open-source frameworks, FedKBP+ also provides a fully decentralized FL model where participants directly exchange model weights to each other through Peer-to-Peer communication. We evaluated FedKBP+ on three predictive tasks using scale-attention network (SA-Net) as the predictive model. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that FedKBP+ is highly effective, efficient and robust, showing great potential as a federated learning platform for radiation therapy.</description>

      <title>Eudoxia: a FaaS scheduling simulator for the composable lakehouse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the variety of its target use cases and the large API surface area to cover, a data lakehouse (DLH) is a natural candidate for a composable data system. Bauplan is a composable DLH built on "spare data parts" and a unified Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) runtime for SQL queries and Python pipelines. While FaaS simplifies both building and using the system, it introduces novel challenges in scheduling and optimization of data workloads. In this work, starting from the programming model of the composable DLH, we characterize the underlying scheduling problem and motivate simulations as an effective tools to iterate on the DLH. We then introduce and release to the community Eudoxia, a deterministic simulator for scheduling data workloads as cloud functions. We show that Eudoxia can simulate a wide range of workloads and enables highly customizable user implementations of scheduling algorithms, providing a cheap mechanism for developers to evaluate different scheduling algorithms against their infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Impact Of Spatial Features Of Mobility Data and Index Choice On Database Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing number of moving Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to a surge in moving object data, powering applications such as traffic routing, hotspot detection, or weather forecasting. When managing such data, spatial database systems offer various index options and data formats, e.g., point-based or trajectory-based. Likewise, dataset characteristics such as geographic overlap and skew can vary significantly. All three significantly affect database performance. While this has been studied in existing papers, none of them explore the effects and trade-offs resulting from a combination of all three aspects. In this paper, we evaluate the performance impact of index choice, data format, and dataset characteristics on a popular spatial database system, PostGIS. We focus on two aspects of dataset characteristics, the degree of overlap and the degree of skew, and propose novel approximation methods to determine these features. We design a benchmark that compares a variety of spatial indexing strategies and data formats, while also considering the impact of dataset characteristics on database performance. We include a variety of real-world and synthetic datasets, write operations, and read queries to cover a broad range of scenarios that might occur during application runtime. Our results offer practical guidance for developers looking to optimize spatial storage and querying, while also providing insights into dataset characteristics and their impact on database performance.</description>

      <title>ServerlessLoRA: Minimizing Latency and Cost in Serverless Inference for LoRA-Based LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Serverless computing has grown rapidly for serving Large Language Model (LLM) inference due to its pay-as-you-go pricing, fine-grained GPU usage, and rapid scaling. However, our analysis reveals that current serverless can effectively serve general LLM but fail with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) inference due to three key limitations: 1) massive parameter redundancy among functions where 99% of weights are unnecessarily duplicated, 2) costly artifact loading latency beyond LLM loading, and 3) magnified resource contention when serving multiple LoRA LLMs. These inefficiencies lead to massive GPU wastage, increased Time-To-First-Token (TTFT), and high monetary costs.
  We propose ServerlessLoRA, a novel serverless inference system designed for faster and cheaper LoRA LLM serving. ServerlessLoRA enables secure backbone LLM sharing across isolated LoRA functions to reduce redundancy. We design a pre-loading method that pre-loads comprehensive LoRA artifacts to minimize cold-start latency. Furthermore, ServerlessLoRA employs contention aware batching and offloading to mitigate GPU resource conflicts during bursty workloads. Experiment on industrial workloads demonstrates that ServerlessLoRA reduces TTFT by up to 86% and cuts monetary costs by up to 89% compared to state-of-the-art LLM inference solutions.</description>

      <title>Distributed quantum computing with black-box subroutines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a general protocol for distributed quantum computing that accommodates arbitrary unknown subroutines. It can be applied to scale up quantum computing through multi-chip interconnection, as well as to tasks such as estimating unknown parameters or processes for circuit depth reduction and constructing secure quantum cryptographic protocols. Our protocol builds upon a few techniques we develop, such as the oblivious quantum teleportation and control, which can circumvent quantum no-go theorems on the manipulation of unknown objects. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this protocol can be physically implemented using currently available quantum computing platforms. These results suggest that our framework could provide a foundation for developing more advanced quantum algorithms and protocols in the future.</description>

      <title>PSMOA: Policy Support Multi-Objective Optimization Algorithm for Decentralized Data Replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14574v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient data replication in decentralized storage systems must account for diverse policies, especially in multi-organizational, data-intensive environments. This work proposes PSMOA, a novel Policy Support Multi-objective Optimization Algorithm for decentralized data replication that dynamically adapts to varying organizational requirements such as minimization or maximization of replication time, storage cost, replication based on content popularity, and load balancing while respecting policy constraints. PSMOA outperforms NSGA-II and NSGA-III in both Generational Distance (20.29 vs 148.74 and 67.74) and Inverted Generational Distance (0.78 vs 3.76 and 5.61), indicating better convergence and solution distribution. These results validate PSMOA's novelty in optimizing data replication in multi-organizational environments.</description>

      <title>FedEx: Expediting Federated Learning over Heterogeneous Mobile Devices by Overlapping and Participant Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Training latency is critical for the success of numerous intrigued applications ignited by federated learning (FL) over heterogeneous mobile devices. By revolutionarily overlapping local gradient transmission with continuous local computing, FL can remarkably reduce its training latency over homogeneous clients, yet encounter severe model staleness, model drifts, memory cost and straggler issues in heterogeneous environments. To unleash the full potential of overlapping, we propose, FedEx, a novel \underline{fed}erated learning approach to \underline{ex}pedite FL training over mobile devices under data, computing and wireless heterogeneity. FedEx redefines the overlapping procedure with staleness ceilings to constrain memory consumption and make overlapping compatible with participation selection (PS) designs. Then, FedEx characterizes the PS utility function by considering the latency reduced by overlapping, and provides a holistic PS solution to address the straggler issue. FedEx also introduces a simple but effective metric to trigger overlapping, in order to avoid model drifts. Experimental results show that compared with its peer designs, FedEx demonstrates substantial reductions in FL training latency over heterogeneous mobile devices with limited memory cost.</description>

      <title>KunServe: Efficient Parameter-centric Memory Management for LLM Serving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18169v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Serving LLMs with a cluster of GPUs is common nowadays, where the serving system must meet strict latency SLOs required by applications. However, the stateful nature of LLM serving requires maintaining huge states (i.e., KVCache) in limited GPU memory. Under spikes in real-world workloads, GPU memory can be easily throttled, leading to orders of magnitude higher response latency due to queuing introduced by waiting for KVCache to be reclaimed. Prior KVCache-centric approaches handle load throttling by dropping, migrating, or swapping KVCache. These methods fail to release sufficient memory quickly with requests still queued.
  This paper proposes the first parameter-centric approach to handling throttling by selectively dropping replicated parameters to instantly free memory for requests, based on an unnoticed observation that model parameters are commonly replicated across GPUs for serving LLMs. With additional memory, all requests can be served with a larger batch without queuing. To make the parameter-centric approach correct and efficient, we cooperatively execute requests on GPUs with a complete copy of parameters using pipeline parallelism, and derive an appropriate drop plan without unnecessary cooperation. We also design techniques to minimize the performance overhead due to pipeline parallelism with the execution patterns of requests under drop. Evaluations show that {\sys} reduces the tail TTFT of requests under throttling by up to 72.2 times compared to the state-of-the-art systems including Llumnix, vLLM and InferCept.</description>

      <title>Federated Hybrid Model Pruning through Loss Landscape Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the era of connectivity and unprecedented data generation expands, collaborative intelligence emerges as a key driver for machine learning, encouraging global-scale model development. Federated learning (FL) stands at the heart of this transformation, enabling distributed systems to work collectively on complex tasks while respecting strict constraints on privacy and security. Despite its vast potential, specially in the age of complex models, FL encounters challenges such as elevated communication costs, computational constraints, and the heterogeneous data distributions. In this context, we present AutoFLIP, a novel framework that optimizes FL through an adaptive hybrid pruning approach, grounded in a federated loss exploration phase. By jointly analyzing diverse non-IID client loss landscapes, AutoFLIP efficiently identifies model substructures for pruning both at structured and unstructured levels. This targeted optimization fosters a symbiotic intelligence loop, reducing computational burdens and boosting model performance on resource-limited devices for a more inclusive and democratized model usage. Our extensive experiments across multiple datasets and FL tasks show that AutoFLIP delivers quantifiable benefits: a 48.8% reduction in computational overhead, a 35.5% decrease in communication costs, and a notable improvement in global accuracy. By significantly reducing these overheads, AutoFLIP offer the way for efficient FL deployment in real-world applications for a scalable and broad applicability.</description>

      <title>SVAFD: A Secure and Verifiable Co-Aggregation Protocol for Federated Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Secure Aggregation (SA) is an indispensable component of Federated Learning (FL) that concentrates on privacy preservation while allowing for robust aggregation. However, most SA designs rely heavily on the unrealistic assumption of homogeneous model architectures. Federated Distillation (FD), which aggregates locally computed logits instead of model parameters, introduces a promising alternative for cooperative training in heterogeneous model settings. Nevertheless, we recognize two major challenges in implementing SA for FD. (i) Prior SA designs encourage a dominant server, who is solely responsible for collecting, aggregating and distributing. Such central authority facilitates server to forge aggregation proofs or collude to bypass the claimed security guarantees; (ii) Existing SA, tailored for FL models, overlook the intrinsic properties of logits, making them unsuitable for FD.
  To address these challenges, we propose SVAFD, the first SA protocol that is specifically designed for FD. At a high level, SVAFD incorporates two innovations: (i) a multilateral co-aggregation method tha redefines the responsibilities of clients and server. Clients autonomously evaluate and aggregate logits shares locally with a lightweight coding scheme, while the server handles ciphertext decoding and performs the task of generating verification proofs; (ii) a quality-aware knowledge filtration method that facilitates biased logits exclusion against poisoning attacks. Moreover, SVAFD is resilient to stragglers and colluding clients, making it well-suited for dynamic networks in real-world applications. We have implemented the SVAFD prototype over four emerging FD architectures and evaluated it against poisoning and inference attacks. Results demonstrate that SVAFD improves model accuracy, making it a significant step forward in secure and verifiable aggregation for heterogeneous FL systems.</description>
