      <title>Secondary electron topographical contrast formation in scanning transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Secondary electron (SE) imaging offers a powerful complementary capabilities to conventional scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) by providing surface-sensitive, pseudo-3D topographic information. However, contrast interpretation of such images remains empirical due to complex interactions of emitted SE with the magnetic field in the objective field of TEM. Here, we propose an analytical physical model that takes into account the physics of SE emission and interaction of the emitted SEs with magnetic field. This enables more reliable image interpretation and potentially lay the foundation for novel 3D surface reconstruction algorithms.</description>

      <title>Current-driven switching of topological spin chirality in a van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic topology is central to modern quantum magnet, where spin chirality governs exotic spin winding, real-space Berry phase, and topological Hall effect. A key unresolved challenge is how to electrically switch topological spin chirality and its associated gauge flux, an essential requirement for manipulating its topological quantum properties. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the concept of current-switching spin chirality. We identify the new vdW antiferromagnet Co1/3TaS2 as an ideal platform, hosting a topological 3Q state with a minimum chirality cell, an ultrahigh skyrmion density, a non-centrosymmetric geometry, and a strong Berry curvature. Using a Co1/3TaS2/Pt heterostructure, we achieve the nonvolatile and reversible switching by current via current-driven spin-orbit torque based on Pts spin Hall effect. Beyond this conventional route, we further discover intrinsic self-torque-induced chirality switching within Co1/3TaS2, driven purely by current, without a magnetic field, and with high energy efficiency. These complementary pathways establish a unified framework for electrically creating and controlling spin chirality. Our results demonstrate a practical route toward chiral spintronics. They can be naturally generalised to other skyrmion systems, offering new opportunities in symmetry control, topological manipulation, and spin-chirality-based quantum functionalities.</description>

      <title>Empirical Quantum Advantage in Constrained Optimization from Encoded Unitary Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Constraint-Enhanced Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (CE-QAOA), a shallow, constraint-aware ansatz that operates inside the one-hot product space of size [n]^m, where m is the number of blocks and each block is initialized with an n-qubit W_n state. We give an ancilla-free, depth-optimal encoder that prepares a W_n state using n-1 two-qubit rotations per block, and a two-local XY mixer restricted to the same block of n qubits with a constant spectral gap. Algorithmically, we wrap constant-depth sampling with a deterministic classical checker to obtain a polynomial-time hybrid quantum-classical solver (PHQC) that returns the best observed feasible solution in O(S n^2) time, where S is the number of shots. We obtain two advantages. First, when CE-QAOA fixes r &gt;= 1 locations different from the start city, we achieve a Theta(n^r) reduction in shot complexity even against a classical sampler that draws uniformly from the feasible set. Second, against a classical baseline restricted to raw bitstring sampling, we show an exp(Theta(n^2)) separation in the minimax sense. In noiseless circuit simulations of TSP instances ranging from 4 to 10 locations from the QOPTLib benchmark library, we recover the global optimum at depth p = 1 using polynomial shot budgets and coarse parameter grids defined by the problem sizes.</description>

      <title>Measuring Reactive-Load Impedance with Transmission-Line Resonators Beyond the Perturbative Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14621v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytic framework to extract circuit parameters and loss tangent from superconducting transmission-line resonators terminated by reactive loads, extending analysis beyond the perturbative regime. The formulation yields closed-form relations between resonant frequency, participation ratio, and internal quality factor, removing the need for full-wave simulations. We validate the framework through circuit simulations, finite-element modeling, and experimental measurements of van der Waals parallel-plate capacitors, using it to extract the dielectric constant and loss tangent of hexagonal boron nitride. Statistical analysis across multiple reference resonators, together with multimode self-calibration, demonstrates consistent and reproducible extraction of both capacitance and loss tangent in close agreement with literature values. In addition to parameter extraction, the analytic relations provide practical design guidelines for maximizing energy participation ratio in the load and improving the precision of resonator-based material metrology.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved 3D imaging opportunities with XMPI at ForMAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-rays are commonly used in imaging experiments due to their penetration power, which enables non-destructive resolution of internal structures in samples that are opaque to visible light. Time-resolved X-ray tomography is the state-of-the-art method for obtaining volumetric 4D (3D + time) information by rotating the sample and acquiring projections from different angular viewpoints over time. This method enables studies to address a plethora of research questions across various scientific disciplines. However, it faces several limitations, such as incompatibility with single-shot experiments, challenges in rotating complex sample environments that restrict the achievable rotation speed or range, and the introduction of centrifugal forces that can affect the sample's dynamics. These limitations can hinder and even preclude the study of certain dynamics. Here, we present an implementation of an alternative approach, X-ray Multi-Projection Imaging (XMPI), which eliminates the need for sample rotation. Instead, the direct incident X-ray beam is split into beamlets using beam splitting X-ray optics. These beamlets intersect at the sample position from different angular viewpoints, allowing multiple projections to be acquired simultaneously. We commissioned this setup at the ForMAX beamline at MAX IV. We present projections acquired from two different sample systems - fibers under mechanical load and particle suspension in multi-phase flow - with distinct spatial and temporal resolution requirements. We demonstrate the capabilities of the ForMAX XMPI setup using the detector's full dynamical range for the relevant sample-driven spatiotemporal resolutions: i) at least 12.5 kHz framerates with 4 micrometer pixel sizes (fibers) and ii) 40 Hz acquisitions with 1.3 micrometer pixel sizes (multi-phase flows), setting the basis for a permanent XMPI endstation at ForMAX.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Channel performance in ULEO Satellite-to-Ground Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12769v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential growth in satellite data traffic demands communication systems exceeding current microwave capacity limitations, while the terahertz (THz) frequency band (0.1-10 THz) offers unprecedented bandwidth potential with superior weather resilience compared to optical systems, particularly when combined with ultra low Earth orbit (ULEO) satellite deployments below 300 km altitude. This article presents a comprehensive performance evaluation for ULEO-THz satellite to ground communications, analyzing three distinct transmission architectures direct satellite to ground (S2G), satellite relay ground (SRG) forwarding, and satellite-to-high altitude base station (S2H) with fiber backhaul. Our analysis leverages altitude-resolved atmospheric propagation models validated using year long meteorological data from four high-altitude stations in Tibet and Qinghai, China. It incorporates frequency-dependent atmospheric absorption using ITU-R standards, free space path loss with curved atmospheric modeling, and regional atmospheric variations to derive total channel path loss, available bandwidth capacity, and bit error rate (BER) performance under both AWGN and Weibull fading conditions across multiple THz frequencies. Results demonstrate that direct S2G transmission at lower THz frequencies achieves optimal practical performance with maximum available bandwidth under QPSK modulation, while SRG suffers prohibitive cumulative losses from multiple hops, and S2H is rendered impractical for long-haul links by substantial electro-optical conversion and fiber transmission losses.</description>

      <title>Phase-field modeling of cyclic behavior in quasi-brittle materials: a micromechanics-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the micromechanics-based phase-field modeling of fatigue fracture to capture cyclic plasticity with ratcheting. This mechanism is particularly important for low-cycle fatigue, where the accumulation of inelastic strains plays an important role in the progression to final failure. The ratcheting contribution is formulated through the evolution of ratcheting strain, which accumulates over loading cycles and captures the inelastic strain growth characteristic of cyclic plasticity in a thermodynamically consistent manner. The extended plastic potential allows independent control over deviatoric and volumetric ratcheting components. Numerical simulations are performed to evaluate the model under both monotonic and cyclic loading and to assess the influence of ratcheting on material response.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.01$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.009$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.01$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking and Mie-tronic Supermodes in Nonlocal Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Breaking symmetry in Mie-resonant metasurfaces challenges the conventional view that it weakens optical confinement. Within the Mie-tronics framework, we show that symmetry breaking can instead enhance light trapping by strengthening in-plane nonlocal coupling pathways. Through diffraction and multiple-scattering analyses, we demonstrate that diffractive bands and Mie-tronic supermodes originate from the same underlying Mie resonances but differ fundamentally in physical nature. Finite arrays exhibit Q-factor enhancement driven by redistributed radiation channels, reversing the trend predicted by infinite-lattice theory. We further show that controlled symmetry breaking opens new electromagnetic coupling channels, enabling polarization conversion in nonlocal metasurfaces. These findings establish a unified wave picture linking scattering and diffraction theories and outline design principles for multifunctional metasurfaces that exploit nonlocality for advanced light manipulation, computation, and emission control.</description>
