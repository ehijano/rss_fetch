      <title>ALS Storage Ring RF Control System Upgrade Plan and Status</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Advanced Light Source (ALS) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a third-generation synchrotron light source operational since 1992, is undergoing a comprehensive upgrade of its storage ring RF control system. The legacy Horner PLC controllers and remote I/O modules, now at end-of-life, are being replaced with an Allen-Bradley PLC platform to improve maintainability, reliability, and long-term support. This paper presents the planning, design, and current status of the upgrade project.</description>

      <title>Modeling of van-der-Meer scan at NICA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van-der-Meer method is used in hadron colliders for absolute luminosity calibration. In the letter the applicability of the method is discussed when particles desnsity is distorted by hour-glass effect next to interaction point. The study is motivated by close commisioning of Nuclotron based Ion Collider fAcility where hour-glass effected is significant by design. The theoretical van-der-Meer formalism is revised for this case. Importance of hour-glass effect for luminosity measurements and calibration is demonstrated. Also, the general approach to the estimation of van-der-Meer method bias when it is used for non-factorizable beams is proposed.</description>

      <title>High-OAM Deep Ultraviolet Twisted Light Generation for RF-Photoinjector Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08442v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the generation and characterization of ultraviolet (wavelength 266 nm) twisted light with high orbital angular momentum (OAM) using three types of fabricated diffractive optical elements (DOEs): a reflective fork grating, a high-charge spiral phase plate (SPP), and binary axicons. All elements were integrated into a drive-laser beamline of an electron RF-photoinjector, enabling direct evaluation under accelerator-relevant conditions. The SPP produced a high-purity Laguerre-Gaussian mode with OAM l = 64 and a measured conversion efficiency of approximately 80%. Binary axicons generated quasi-Bessel twisted light with topological charges up to m = 10, exhibiting low divergence and stable multi-lobe ring structures. The fork grating reliably produced lower-order modes, l = 2-8, with good agreement between simulations and cylindrical-lens diagnostics. These results constitute, to our knowledge, the first comprehensive experimental demonstration of deep-UV high-OAM beams generated with fabricated DOEs and validated through mode-conversion measurements. The demonstrated techniques are compatible with high-power UV laser systems used in RF-photoinjectors and offer a practical route toward structured photocathode illumination and the generation of relativistic vortex electrons at a particle accelerator facility.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Model in the Book</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of a RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing model in the Book, interpret it and provide understanding of it. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>
