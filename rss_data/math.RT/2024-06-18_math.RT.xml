      <title>Tilting mutations as generalized Kauer moves for (skew) Brauer graph algebras with multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Kauer moves are local moves of multiple edges in a Brauer graph that yield derived equivalences between Brauer graph algebras of multiplicity identically 1. Moreover, these derived equivalences are given by a tilting mutation. The goal of this paper is to generalize this result first for Brauer graph algebras with arbitrary multiplicity and second for a generalization of Brauer graph algebras called skew Brauer graph algebras. In these contexts, we prove that the generalized Kauer moves induce derived equivalences via tilting mutations. We also show that skew Brauer graph algebras of multiplicity identically 1 can be seen as the trivial extension of skew gentle algebras.</description>

      <title>Integer quadratic forms and extensions of subsets of linearly independent roots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider subsets of linearly independent roots in a certain root system $\varPhi$. Let $S'$ be such a subset, and let $S'$ be associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$. The main question of the paper: what root $\gamma \in \varPhi$ can be added to $S'$ so that $S' \cup \gamma$ is also a subset of linearly independent roots? This extra root $\gamma$ is called the linkage root. The vector $\gamma^{\nabla}$ of inner products $\{(\gamma,\tau'_i)\mid \tau'_i \in S'\}$ is called the linkage label vector. Let $B_{\Gamma'}$ be the Cartan matrix associated with $\Gamma'$. It is shown that $\gamma$ is a linkage root if and only if $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}(\gamma^{\nabla}) &lt; 2$, where $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$ is a quadratic form with the matrix inverse to $B_{\Gamma'}$. The set of all linkage roots for $\Gamma'$ is called a linkage system and is denoted by $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$. The Cartan matrix associated with any Carter diagram $\Gamma'$ is conjugate to the Cartan matrix associated with some Dynkin diagram $\Gamma$, [St23]. The sizes of $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma')$ and $\mathscr{L}(\Gamma)$ are the same. Let $W^{\vee}$ be the Weyl group of the quadratic form $\mathscr{B}^{\vee}_{\Gamma'}$. This group acts on the linkage system and forms several orbits. The sizes and structure of orbits for linkage systems $\mathscr{L}(D_l)$ and $\mathscr{L}(D_l(a_k))$ are presented.</description>

      <title>A Representation Theoretic Approach to Toeplitz Quantization on Flag Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Toeplitz operators on generalized flag manifolds of compact Lie groups using a representation-theoretic point of view. We prove several basic properties of these Toeplitz operators, including an abstract formula for their matrix coefficients in terms of the decomposition of certain tensor product representations. We also show how to identify large commuting families of Toeplitz operators based on invariance of their symbols under certain subgroups. Finally, we realize the Berezin transform as a convolution with certain functions that form an approximate identity on the generalized flag manifold, which allows us to prove a Szeg\"o Limit Theorem using certain results due to Hirschman, Liang, and Wilson.</description>

      <title>Exact dg categories II : The embedding theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an exact dg category $\mathcal A$, we introduce its bounded dg derived category $\mathcal{D}^b_{dg}(\mathcal A)$ and establish the universal exact morphism from $\mathcal A$ to $\mathcal{D}^b_{dg}(\mathcal A)$. We prove that the dg quotient of an exact dg category by a subcategory of projective-injectives carries a canonical exact structure. We show that exact dg categories reproduce under tensor products and functor dg categories. We apply our results to 0-Auslander extriangulated categories and confirm a conjecture by Fang-Gorsky-Palu-Plamondon-Pressland for the algebraic case.</description>

      <title>Explicit Hilbert spaces for the unitary dual of rank one orthogonal groups and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We realize all irreducible unitary representations of the group $\mathrm{SO}_0(n+1,1)$ on explicit Hilbert spaces of vector-valued $L^2$-functions on $\mathbb{R}^n\setminus\{0\}$. The key ingredient in our construction is an explicit expression for the standard Knapp-Stein intertwining operators between arbitrary principal series representations in terms of the Euclidean Fourier transform on a maximal unipotent subgroup isomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^n$.
  As an application, we describe the space of Whittaker vectors on all irreducible Casselman-Wallach representations. Moreover, the new realizations of the irreducible unitary representations immediately reveal their decomposition into irreducible representations of a parabolic subgroup, thus providing a simple proof of a recent result of Liu-Oshima-Yu.</description>

      <title>Fractional Brauer configuration algebras I: definitions and examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2017, Green and Schroll introduced a generalization of Brauer graph algebras which they call Brauer configuration algebras. In the present paper, we further generalize Brauer configuration algebras to fractional Brauer configuration algebras by generalizing Brauer configurations to fractional Brauer configurations. The fractional Brauer configuration algebras are locally bounded but neither finite-dimensional nor symmetric in general. We show that if the fractional Brauer configuration is of type S (resp. of type MS), then the corresponding fractional Brauer configuration algebra is a locally bounded Frobenius algebra (resp. a locally bounded special multiserial Frobenius algebra). Moreover, we show that over an algebraically closed field, the class of finite-dimensional indecomposable representation-finite fractional Brauer configuration algebras in type S coincides with the class of basic indecomposable finite-dimensional standard representation-finite self-injective algebras.</description>

      <title>The codegree isomorphism problem for finite simple groups II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a nonabelian finite simple group. Huppert's conjecture asserts that if $G$ is a finite group with the same set of complex character degrees as $H$, then $G\cong H\times A$ for some abelian group $A$. Over the past two decades, several specific cases of this conjecture have been addressed. Recently, attention has shifted to the analogous conjecture for character codegrees: if $G$ has the same set of character codegrees as $H$, then $G\cong H$. Unfortunately, both problems have primarily been examined on a case-by-case basis. In this paper and the companion [HM22], we present a more unified approach to the codegree conjecture and confirm it for several families of simple groups.</description>

Abstract: We particularise the construction of generalised Kac-Moody algebras associated to compact real manifolds to the case of the two-torus $\mathbb T_2$ and the two-sphere ${\mathbb S}^2$. It is shown that these algebras, as well as a Virasoro algebra associated to the two-torus and the two-sphere, can also be derived considering the usual Kac-Moody and Virasoro algebras.</description>

      <title>Modularity of admissible-level $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ minimal models with denominator $2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the newly developed technique of inverse quantum hamiltonian reduction to investigate the representation theory of the simple affine vertex algebra $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$ associated to $\mathfrak{sl}_{3}$ at level $\mathsf{k} = -3+\frac{\mathsf{u}}{2}$, for $\mathsf{u}\ge3$ odd. Starting from the irreducible modules of the corresponding simple Bershadsky-Polyakov vertex operator algebras, we show that inverse reduction constructs all irreducible lower-bounded weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules. This proceeds by first constructing a complete set of coherent families of fully relaxed highest-weight $\mathsf{A}_{2}(\mathsf{u},2)$-modules and then noting that the reducible members of these families degenerate to give all remaining irreducibles. Using this fully relaxed construction and the degenerations, we deduce modular S-transforms for certain natural generalised characters of these irreducibles and their spectral flows. With this modular data in hand, we verify that the (conjectural) standard Verlinde formula predicts Grothendieck fusion rules with nonnegative-integer multiplicities.</description>

      <title>Decomposition of commutative semisimple finite group algebras using the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $G$ be a finite abelian group with order coprime to $q$. We present a full decomposition of the semisimple group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[G]$. This was achieved by studying algebraic properties of coordinate rings of the form $\mathbb{F}_q[X_1, \ldots ,X_n] / ( X_1^{m_1} - 1, \ldots, X_n^{m_n} - 1 )$, which omits the use of finding primitive idempotents and character theory. We discuss some properties of this decomposition, like providing a formula for the number of simple components. Moreover, we discuss some applications in cryptography, and the classification of all irreducible representations of $G$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ up to isomorphism.</description>

      <title>On the Finkelberg-Ginzburg Mirabolic Monodromy Conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.13648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the monodromy of the mirabolic Harish-Chandra D-module for all values of the parameters (theta,c) in rank 1, and outside an explicit codimension 2 set of values in ranks 2 and higher. This shows in particular that the Finkelberg-Ginzburg conjecture, which is known to hold for generic values of (theta,c), fails at special values even in rank 1. Our main tools are Opdam's shift operators and intertwiners for the extended affine Weyl group, which allow for the resolution of resonances outside the codimension two set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an embedding of the Arthamonov-Shakirov algebra of genus 2 knot operators into the quantized coordinate ring of the cluster Poisson variety of exceptional finite mutation type $X_7$. The embedding is equivariant with respect to the action of the mapping class group of the closed surface of genus 2. The cluster realization of the mapping class group action leads to a formula for the coefficient of each monomial in the genus 2 Macdonald polynomial of type $A_1$ as sum over lattice points in a convex polyhedron in 7-dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Interval Replacements of Persistence Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define two notions. The first one is a $compression\ system$ $\xi$ for a finite poset $\mathbf{P}$, which assigns each interval subposet $I$ to a poset morphism $\xi_I \colon Q_I \to \mathbf{P}$ satisfying some conditions, where $Q_I$ is a connected finite poset. An example is given by the $total$ compression system that assigns each $I$ to the inclusion of $I$ into $\mathbf{P}$. The second one is an $I$-$rank$ of a persistence module $M$ under $\xi$, the family of which is called the $interval\ rank\ invariant$ of $M$ under $\xi$. A compression system $\xi$ makes it possible to define the $interval\ replacement$ (also called the interval-decomposable approximation) not only for 2D persistence modules but also for any persistence modules over any finite poset. We will show that the forming of the interval replacement preserves the interval rank invariant, which is a stronger property than the preservation of the usual rank invariant. Moreover, to know what is preserved explicitly, we will give a formula of the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ in terms of the structure linear maps of $M$ for any compression system $\xi$, and give a sufficient condition for the $I$-rank of $M$ under $\xi$ to coincide with that under the total compression system, the value of which is equal to the generalized rank invariant introduced by Kim--M\'emoli.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.17025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One definition of key polynomials is as the weight generating functions of key tableaux. Assaf and Schilling introduced a crystal structure on key tableaux and related it to Morse--Schilling crystals on reduced factorizations for permutations via weak Edelman--Greene insertion. In this paper, we consider generalizations of both crystals depending on a flag. We extend weak EG insertion to a bijection between our flagged objects and show that the recording tableau gives a crystal isomorphism. As an application, we show that flagged key tableaux have a natural Demazure crystal structure, whose characters recover Reiner and Shimozono's flagged key polynomials.</description>

Abstract: The complex and unpredictable nature of deep neural networks prevents their safe use in many high-stakes applications. There have been many techniques developed to interpret deep neural networks, but all have substantial limitations. Algorithmic tasks have proven to be a fruitful test ground for interpreting a neural network end-to-end. Building on previous work, we completely reverse engineer fully connected one-hidden layer networks that have ``grokked'' the arithmetic of the permutation groups $S_5$ and $S_6$. The models discover the true subgroup structure of the full group and converge on neural circuits that decompose the group arithmetic using the permutation group's subgroups. We relate how we reverse engineered the model's mechanisms and confirmed our theory was a faithful description of the circuit's functionality. We also draw attention to current challenges in conducting interpretability research by comparing our work to Chughtai et al. [4] which alleges to find a different algorithm for this same problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a description of the Halln\"as--Ruijsenaars eigenfunctions of the 2-particle hyperbolic Ruijsenaars system as matrix coefficients for the order 4 element $S\in SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ acting on the Hilbert space of $GL(2)$ quantum Teichm\"uller theory on the punctured torus. The $GL(2)$ Macdonald polynomials are then obtained as special values of the analytic continuation of these matrix coefficients. The main tool used in the proof is the cluster structure on the moduli space of framed $GL(2)$-local systems on the punctured torus, and an $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$-equivariant embedding of the $GL(2)$ spherical DAHA into the quantized coordinate ring of the corresponding cluster Poisson variety.</description>

Abstract: The transition measure is a foundational concept introduced by Sergey Kerov to represent the shape of a Young diagram as a centered probability measure on the real line. Over a period of decades the transition measure turned out to be an invaluable tool for many problems of the asymptotic representation theory of the symmetric groups. Kerov also showed how to expand this notion for a wider class of continual diagrams so that the transition measure provides a homeomorphism between a subclass of continual diagrams (having a specific support) and a class of centered probability measures with a support contained in a specific interval. We quantify the modulus of continuity of this homeomorphism. More specifically, we study the dependence of the cumulative distribution function of Kerov transition measure on the profile of a diagram at the locations where the profile is not too steep.</description>

Abstract: Let $A$ be any commutative unital ring and let $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ be the general linear group scheme on $A$ of rank $2$. We study the representation theory of $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ and the symmetric powers $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$, where $(V, \Delta)$ is the standard right comodule on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. We prove a refined Weyl character formula for $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$. There is for any integer $d \geq 1$ a (canonical) refined weight space decomposition $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V) \cong \oplus_i \operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ where each direct summand $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)^i$ is a comodule on $N \subseteq \operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. Here $N$ is the schematic normalizer of the diagonal torus $T \subseteq \operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$. We prove a character formula for the direct summands of $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V)$ for any integer $d \geq 1$. This refined Weyl character formula implies the classical Weyl character formula. As a Corollary we get a refined Weyl character formula for the pull back $\operatorname{Sym}^d(V \otimes K)$ as a comodule on $\operatorname{GL}_{2,K}$ where $K$ is any field. We also calculate explicit examples involving the symmetric powers, symmetric tensors and their duals. The refined weight space decomposition exists in general for group schemes such as $\operatorname{GL}_{2,A}$ and $\operatorname{SL}_{2,A}$. The study may have applications to the study of groups $G$ such as $\operatorname{SL}(n,k)$ and $\operatorname{GL}(n,k)$ and quotients $G/H$ where $k$ is an arbitrary field (or a Dedekind domain) and $H \subseteq G$ is a closed subgroup. The refined weight space decomposition of $S_{\lambda}(V)$ has a relation with irreducible module over a field of positiv characteristic. In an example I prove it recovers the irreducible module $V(\lambda) \subsetneq S_{\lambda}(V)$.</description>
