      <title>Tidally driven inertial waves enhance eccentricity damping and spin evolution in planets and stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal interactions influence the orbital motions of binary star systems and extrasolar planets alike. Tides also affect stellar and planetary rotation rates. We demonstrate that in addition to altering spin synchronization and pseudosynchronization, tidally driven inertial waves in the convective envelopes of low-mass stars and gas giant planets can enhance tidal eccentricity damping. Analytically, we find that eccentricity damping by inertial waves can be orders of magnitude faster than equilibrium tides, independent of any eddy viscosity prescription. We use simplified numerical experiments to demonstrate this enhancement, and to explore the effects of different mixing length treatments of convective turbulence, as well as a spin-down torque from magnetic braking. These calculations demonstrate that tidally driven inertial waves can produce an extended cool core of nearly circular binaries, helping to reconcile a longstanding discrepancy between observed and predicted main-sequence binary circularization. Our calculations additionally suggest that tidally driven inertial waves may leave identifiable signatures in the ratios of orbital to rotation periods for stellar binaries, including synchronous and sub-synchronous rotation periods reminiscent of populations identified in Kepler, TESS, and Gaia data.</description>

      <title>WOCS XCIII: NGC 7789: the Evolution of Li, Stellar Rotation, and Extended Main Sequence Turnoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision UBVRI photometry of NGC 7789 is combined with Gaia data to map reddening variations across the cluster face. HYDRA spectra, Gaia astrometry, and isochrone fitting constrain the absolute reddening, apparent modulus, and age to E(B-V) = 0.30 +/- 0.02, (m-M)=12.51 +/- 0.06, and 1.46 +/- 0.02 Gyr for [Fe/H] between -0.2 and solar; the spectroscopic [Fe/H] = -0.13 +/- 0.068 (MAD) from 156 single-star members. Corrections for variable reddening reduce the scatter in the unevolved main sequence below the turnoff. A(Li) is derived for only single star members from the G-dwarf Li-Plateau to the tip of the red giant branch. Giants separate into two distinct groups, probable first-ascent giants with detectable Li that declines with evolution toward the red giant tip and stars within the clump and the asymptotic giant branch which only exhibit upper limits. A(Li) structure from the turnoff to the unevolved main sequence, including the Li-Dip, and the presence of an extended color spread among the upper main sequence stars are attributed to the V_ROT distribution, indicating the wall of the Li-Dip as the true hot boundary of the Kraft break. Differences in the color-magnitude diagram topology of NGC 7789 and NGC 752 are explored and attributed to differences in the individual cluster V_ROT distributions. Prior indications that main sequence stars more massive than the Li-Dip evolve redward across the Li-Wall, undergoing rotational spindown and Li depletion like stars within the Li-Dip, are confirmed.</description>

      <title>New Pipeline for Efficient Analysis of Large Spectroscopic Samples of OB Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new spectroscopic pipeline designed to analyse large numbers of hot massive stars homogeneously. The pipeline has been developed to utilise large grids of FASTWIND non-LTE, line blanketed models in which spherical geometry is adopted, and uniquely incorporates model errors. The pipeline has been applied to three contemporary datasets involving Very Large Telescope spectroscopy of OB stars in the Magellanic Clouds, namely the VLT FLAMES Tarantula Survey (VFTS), XShooting-ULLYSES (XShootU) and Binaries at Low Metallicity (BLOeM). We find satisfactory agreement with previous detailed temperatures and surface gravities, although strong nebular contamination, binarity and disk emission from OBe stars are problematic for automatic pipelines, requiring visual inspection of fits. The tool has been incorporated into the pipeline for the VISTA/4MOST pipeline.</description>

      <title>A new particle-based code for Lagrangian stochastic models applied to stellar turbulent convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inclusion of convection in stellar evolution models lacks realism, especially near convective-radiative interfaces. Furthermore, the interaction of convection with oscillations prevent us from accurately predicting seismic frequencies, and therefore from fully exploiting the asteroseismic data of low-mass stars. We aim to develop a new formalism to model the one-point statistics of stellar convection, to implement it in a new numerical code, and to validate this implementation against benchmark cases. This new formalism is based on Lagrangian Probability Density Function (PDF) methods, where a Fokker-Planck equation for the PDF of particle-based turbulent properties is integrated in time. We then develop a Monte-Carlo implementation of this method, where the flow is represented by a large number of notional particles acting as realisations of the PDF. Notional particles interact with each other through the time- and space-dependent mean flow, which is estimated from the particle realisations through a scheme similar to Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics. We establish a model for the evolution of turbulent properties along Lagrangian trajectories applicable to stellar turbulent convection, with only a minimal number of physical assumptions necessary to close the system. In particular, no closure is needed for the non-linear advection terms, which are included exactly through the Lagrangian nature of formalism. The numerical implementation of this new formalism allows us to extract time-dependent maps of the statistical properties of turbulent convection in a way which is not possible in grid-based large-eddy simulations, in particular the turbulent pressure, Reynolds stress tensor, internal energy variance and convective flux.</description>

      <title>Stellar Parameters and Evolutionary Pathways of the Subgiant system HIP 72217</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we applied Al-Wardat's method to analyze the subgiant system HIP72217 for which we obtained accurate parameters including stellar masses, effective temperatures ($T_{\text{eff}}$) and system age.For the primary component we determined a stellar mass of $M_A = 1.14 \pm 0.15\,M_{\odot}$ and effective temperature $T_{\text{eff,A}} = 6125 \pm 50$\,K while for the secondary component we obtained the values of $M_B = 1.12 \pm 0.14\,M_{\odot}$ and $T_{\text{eff,2}} = 5950 \pm 50$\,K. The system's age was estimated to be $3.548 Gyr$, which is consistent with the predicted evolutionary period of a subgiant binary. The evolutionary timeline of HIP\,72217 becomes clearer through our study, which also demonstrates Al-Wardat's approach as an effective approach for binary star system characterization. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the physical mechanisms that control subgiant binary evolution and their broader role in stellar evolutionary processes.</description>

      <title>Theoretical models for the Late Thermal Pulse in post-AGB stars: the case of DY Cen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present theoretical predictions of the born-again scenario for post-asymptotic giant-branch stars. An extensive model grid for born-again objects has been constructed, particularly including models for the Very Late Thermal Pulse with and without convective overshooting, and also including models for the Late Thermal Pulse. We constructed a large parameter space to analyze the dependencies of the born-again model on core mass, hydrogen-envelope mass, and overshoot parameters, and we analyzed how changes in these parameters affect the models' evolution. We applied our grid of models to interpret observations of DY\,Cen, a star exhibiting characteristics similar to confirmed born-again stars. We compared DY\,Cen with models from multiple aspects, including heating rate, evolutionary tracks, and surface abundances. Ultimately, we concluded that none of our born-again models could match all of the observed properties of DY\,Cen, especially its surface chemistry; DY\,Cen is therefore an unlikely born-again star.</description>

      <title>Apsidal Motion in O-Star Binaries: GENEC rotating binary models put to the k2-test</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unveiling massive stars' internal structure and the physical origin and efficiency of the internal mixing processes? It is now possible using the apsidal motion rate in close eccentric binaries! The apsidal motion rate depends on the tidal interactions occurring between the stars and is proportional to k2, a measure of the star's inner density profile. Confronting standard stellar models with observations reveals the famous k2-discrepancy: models predict too high a k2 for the stars, that is to say, stars with too low a density contrast between their core and envelope. We built bespoke GENEC stellar evolution models including tidal mixing for the twin massive binary HD 152248. The models reveal the instabilities allowing to reproduce the stellar density profiles: advecto-diffusive models better reproduce k2 than magnetic models. A large overshooting is necessary to converge towards the observed k2, yet alone is not sufficient. While a change in metallicity or mass-loss rate has no significant impact on k2, a larger initial helium abundance allows us to better reproduce the k2. Yet, a super-solar helium abundance is not observationally supported. Our analyses highlight the need for a process in the stars that slows down the radial expansion.</description>

      <title>The light curve model fitting of LMC Cepheids: MESA-RSP versus Stellingwerf's code predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major challenge in modeling classical Cepheids is the treatment of convection, particularly its complex interplay with pulsation. This inherently three-dimensional process is typically approximated in one-dimensional hydrocodes using dimensionless turbulent convection (TC) free parameters. Calibrating these parameters is essential for reproducing key observational features such as light-curve amplitudes, secondary bumps, and the red edge of the instability strip. In this work, we calibrate TC parameters adopted in the publicly available MESA-RSP code through comparison with both observational data of classical Cepheids and stellar parameter constraints from the Stellingwerf code. We compute multi-band (V, I, and Ks) MESA-RSP light curves for 18 observed Large Magellanic Cloud Cepheids, using stellar parameters determined from the Stellingwerf code. By fine-tuning the mixing-length and eddy viscosity parameters, we calibrate the TC treatment in MESA-RSP. We then compare the resulting period-luminosity (PL), period-radius (PR), and period-mass-radius (PMR) relations with predictions from the Stellingwerf models. We successfully reproduce multi-band light curves and obtain PL, PR, and PMR relations consistent with Ragosta et al. (2019). While in broad agreement with previous work, we explicitly identify distinct mass-luminosity (ML) relations for fundamental-mode and first-overtone Cepheids for the first time. This suggests that the macroscopic processes affecting the ML relation depend on stellar mass and/or effective temperature range. Although our study focuses on the calibration of TC parameters, we do not find a single set of parameter values that reproduces all light curves. No statistically significant correlation is found between stellar properties and convection parameters, although subtle trends with period and effective temperature may be present.</description>

      <title>The dance of dust: Investigating young stellar object dipper variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dipper subclass of YSOs are characterised by frequent dips in their light curves. Irregular dippers do not show periodic signatures and have dips accounting for significant proportions of their photospheric flux. Given the short timescales on which these dips occur, their driving mechanisms are linked to the inner circumstellar disc dynamics. We present the first multi-epoch analysis of 16 irregular dippers observed with X-Shooter. Investigating the properties of their dips, and in particular the analysis of the dust characteristics, we aim to understand the root of their variability, and get a glimpse of the inner disc behaviour. We employed a novel approach to measure the properties of the dips, by combining class III templates with Gaia photometry to construct the intrinsic photospheres. We measured several dip properties including the depth of the dips, near-infrared (NIR) excesses, and their optical depths as a function of wavelength. We record 20 significant dips that range in their dip properties and show no relation to one another. In almost all cases, the low optical depths and small NIR excesses are observed. Comparison of their optical depths with grain opacity models show that the dips can be explained by the presence of dust substructures containing processed grains obscuring their photospheres and/or their discs. These grain distributions can have maximum sizes as large as 20$\mu m$ and in many cases have almost grey-like extinction, while some require a strong scattering component. The findings highlight the extent of the irregularity of dippers, but also link it to the dust dynamics in the inner regions of circumstellar discs. The dust substructures causing the variability require processed dust grains to be lifted above the disc into the line of sight. Possible lifting mechanisms including disc winds, unstable accretion columns, and disc warps are discussed.</description>

      <title>Investigating episodic mass loss in evolved massive stars IV. Comprehensive analysis of dusty red supergiants in NGC 6822, IC 10, and WLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass loss shapes the fate of massive stars; however, the physical mechanism causing it remains uncertain. We present a comprehensive analysis of seven red supergiants, for which we searched evidence of episodic mass loss, in three low-metallicity galaxies: NGC~6822, IC~10, and WLM. Initially, the spectral classification of their optical spectra was refined and compared to previous reported classifications, finding four sources that display spectral variability. We derived the physical properties of five of them using the \textsc{marcs} atmospheric models corrected for nonlocal thermal equilibrium effects to measure stellar properties from our new near-infrared spectra, such as the effective temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and microturbulent velocity. Additional empirical and theoretical methods were employed to calculate effective temperatures, finding consistent results. We constructed optical and infrared light curves, discovering two targets in NGC~6822 with photometric variability between 1 and 2.5 mag in amplitude in r and ~ 0.5 mag in the mid-infrared. Furthermore, we discovered a candidate-dimming event in one of these sources. Periods for three red supergiants were determined using epoch photometry, which were consistent with the empirical estimations from literature period-luminosity relations. Our comprehensive analysis of all the available data for each target provides evidence for episodic mass loss in four red supergiants.</description>

      <title>An extremely fast fading population II dwarf nova candidate: caught spectroscopically on the rise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present AT2022kak, a rapidly evolving optical transient discovered by the KiloNova and Transients Program (KNTraP). This interesting burst exhibited extremely fast evolution, with a large amplitude blue outburst of m &gt; 3.3 in a single night, and a rapid fade back to quiescence in the following two nights. We deployed a multi-wavelength follow-up campaign, monitoring the object for the next two months, but saw no recurrent burst. Three years later, while observing to get spectroscopy of the object in quiescence, there was a new outburst, enabling the collection of time-resolved spectra of the rise and fade of the outburst. The light curve properties of the first burst and spectra of the second burst are consistent with a dwarf nova. Its fast evolving behaviour makes it one of the fastest and faintest dwarf novae observed. The estimated distance of AT2022kak from the Galactic centre is ~6.6 kpc, with a scale height of ~2 kpc. This scale height places it in the Galactic thick disk, where only very few dwarf novae have been found, and is therefore a potential Population II dwarf novae system.</description>

      <title>The ODYSSEUS Survey. Spatial correlation of magnetospheric inclinations points to parsec-scale star-cloud connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of stars and planets are shaped by the initial conditions of their natal clouds. However, the spatial scales over which the initial conditions can exert a significant influence are not well constrained. We report the first evidence for parsec-scale spatial correlations of stellar magnetospheric inclinations ($i_{\rm mag}$), observed in the Lupus low-mass star forming region. Applying consensus clustering with a hierarchical density-based clustering algorithm, we demonstrate that the detected spatial dependencies are stable against perturbations by measurement uncertainties. The $i_{\rm mag}$ correlation scales are on the order of ~3 pc, which aligns with the typical scales of the Lupus molecular cloud filaments. Our results reveal a connection between large-scale forces -- in the form of expanding shells from the Upper Scorpius and Upper-Centaurus-Lupus regions -- and sub-au scale system configurations. We find that Lupus has a non-uniform $i_{\rm mag}$ distribution and suggest that this results from the preferential elongation of protostellar cores along filamentary axes. Non-uniformity would have significant implications for exoplanet occurrence rate calculations, so future work should explore the longevity of these biases driven by the star-cloud connection.</description>

      <title>Ensuring Outcome-Based Curriculum Coherence through Systematic CLO-PLO Alignment and Feedback Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a quantitative framework to enhance curriculum coherence through the systematic alignment of Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and Program Learning Outcomes (PLOs), contributing to continuous improvement in outcome-based education. Grounded in accreditation standards such as ABET and NCAAA, the model introduces mathematical tools that map exercises, assessment questions, teaching units (TUs), and student assessment components (SACs) to CLOs and PLOs. This dual-layer approach-combining micro-level analysis of assessment elements with macro-level curriculum evaluation-enables detailed tracking of learning outcomes and helps identify misalignments between instructional delivery, assessment strategies, and program objectives. The framework incorporates alignment matrices, weighted relationships, and practical indicators to quantify coherence and evaluate course or program performance. Application of this model reveals gaps in outcome coverage and underscores the importance of realignment, especially when specific PLOs are underrepresented or CLOs are not adequately supported by assessments. The proposed model is practical, adaptable, and scalable, making it suitable for academic programs. Its systematic structure supports institutions in implementing evidence-based curriculum improvements and provides a reliable mechanism for aligning teaching practices with desired learning outcomes. Ultimately, this framework offers a valuable tool for closing the feedback loop between instructional design, assessment execution, and learning outcomes, thus promoting greater transparency, accountability, and educational effectiveness. Institutions that adopt this model can expect to strengthen their quality assurance processes and help ensure that students graduate with the competencies required by academic standards and professional expectations.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiter Origin and Tidal Evolution Constrained by a Broken Age-Frequency Relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of hot Jupiters has challenged the classical planet formation theory. Although various formation mechanisms have been proposed, the dominant channel and relative contributions remain unclear. Furthermore, hot Jupiters offer a unique opportunity to test tidal theory and measure the fundamental tidal quality factor, which is yet to be well-constrained. In this work, based on a hot Jupiter sample around single Sun-like stars with kinematic properties, {we find that the declining trend of their frequency is broken with a ridge at about 2 Gyr, providing direct evidence that hot Jupiters are formed with multiple origins of different timescales. By fitting with the theoretical expectations, we provide a constraint of tidal factor for Sun-like stars, which aligns well with the detected number of hot Jupiters with orbital decay. Moreover, we simultaneously constrain the relative importance of different channels: although the majority of hot Jupiters are formed early, within several tenths of Gyr via 'Early' models (e.g., in-situ formation, disk migration, planet-planet scattering and Kozai-Lidov interaction), a significant portion (about 40%) should be formed late on a relatively long timescale extending up to several Gyr mainly via the secular chaos mechanism, further supported by the obliquity distribution of 'late-arrived' hot Jupiters. Our findings provide a unified framework that reconciles hot Jupiter demographics and long-term evolution with multichannel formation.</description>

      <title>{\sc ampere}: A tool to fit heterogeneous observations consistently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As astronomy advances and data becomes more complex, models and inference also become more expensive and complex. In this paper we present {\sc ampere}, which aims to solve this problem using modern inference techniques such as flexible likelihood functions and likelihood-free inference. {\sc ampere}\ can be used to do Bayesian inference even with very expensive models (hours of CPU time per model) that do not include all the features of the observations (e.g. missing lines, incomplete descriptions of PSFs, etc). We demonstrate the power of \ampere\ using a number of simple models, including inferring the posterior mineralogy of circumstellar dust using a Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer model. {\sc ampere}\ reproduces the input parameters well in all cases, and shows that some past studies have tended to underestimate the uncertainties that should be attached to the parameters. {\sc ampere}\ can be applied to a wide range of problems, and is particularly well-suited to using expensive models to interpret data.</description>

      <title>Neon is an inhibitor of CO hydrogenation in pre-stellar core conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neon (Ne) is the fifth most abundant element in the Universe. Because it is chemically inert, it has never been considered in astrochemical models that studied molecular evolution. In the cold dark environments of pre-stellar cores, where the temperatures are below 10 K, Ne can condense onto the surface of interstellar grains. We investigated the effect of Ne on the production of formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) and methanol (CH$_3$OH) through carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation on different cold surfaces. We highlight its role in conditions corresponding to pre-stellar cores. In an ultra-high vacuum system, we conducted two types of experiments. The first experiment involved the co-deposition of CO and H atoms with or without Ne. The second experiment involved depositing a monolayer of CO and separately a monolayer of Ne (or vice versa), followed by bombarding the layers with hydrogen atoms. Additionally, we used a gas-grain chemical code to simulate a pre-stellar core and determine where Ne can affect the chemistry. The presence of Ne on the surface significantly inhibits CO hydrogenation at temperatures below 12 K. In the co-deposition experiments, we observed a 38% decrease in the H$_2$CO production at 11 K when the quantity of Ne in the mixture was lower than a monolayer. At 10 K and with one monolayer in the mixture, the production decreased to 77%, and it reached 91% for a few monolayers of Ne in the mixture at 9 K. While the decrease in CH$_3$OH formation is still notable, it is less pronounced: 43% at 11 K, 61% at 10 K, and 77% at 9 K. Experiments with stacked layers revealed that the CO layer decay varies slightly when the Ne layer is positioned above or below it. This observation indicates that Ne and CO create a mixture in which Ne can diffuse and stabilize at the surface, which isolates CO molecules from the accreting H atoms.</description>

      <title>The second data release of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array: Investigating the Effect of Coronal Mass Ejection on PSR J1022+1001 and a Possible Mode Change of PSR J2145-0750</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Indian Pulsar Timing Array (InPTA) has recently published its second data release (DR2), comprising the timing analysis of seven years of data on 27 millisecond pulsars (MSPs), observed simultaneously in the 300-500 MHz (band 3) and 1260-1460 MHz (band 5), using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The low-frequency data, particularly in band 3, is highly sensitive to propagation effects such as dispersion measure (DM) fluctuations, which can be imprints of some astrophysical phenomena (scientific outliers). Here, we analyze the two outliers of possible astrophysical origin coming from the band 3 DM time series of two pulsars: PSR J1022+1001, with an ecliptic latitude of -0.06 degree , and PSR J2145-0750, one of the brightest MSPs, with multi-component profile morphology. Our study reveals compelling evidence for a coronal mass ejection (CME) event traced in the data of PSR J1022+1001, and reports evidence for a potential mode-changing event in PSR J2145-0750. Extending the analyses presented here to the full sample of InPTA-DR2 pulsars is expected to reveal additional CME events, and possible mode-changing events. Such detections will not only improve our understanding of solar and pulsar magnetospheric plasma interactions but will also enable more accurate modelling of DM variations, leading to improved pulsar timing solutions, which are crucial for high-precision Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) science.</description>

      <title>The chemical DNA of the Magellanic Clouds IV. Unveiling extreme element production: the Eu abundance in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study we investigate the chemical enrichment of the rapid neutron-capture process in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We measure [Eu/Fe] abundance ratios in 209 giant stars that are confirmed members of the SMC, providing the first extensive dataset of Eu abundances in this galaxy across its full metallicity range, spanning more than 1.5 dex. We compare Eu abundances with those of Mg and Ba to evaluate the efficiency of the r-process relative to $\alpha$-capture and s-process nucleosynthesis. The SMC shows enhanced [Eu/Fe] values at all metallicities (comparable with the values measured in the Milky Way), with a clear decline as [Fe/H] increases (from $\sim$ -1.75 dex to $\sim$ -0.5 dex), consistent with the onset of Type Ia supernovae. In contrast, [Eu/Mg] is enhanced by about +0.5 dex at all [Fe/H], significantly above the values observed in Milky Way stars, where [Eu/Mg] remains close to solar, reflecting comparable production of r-process and $\alpha$-capture elements. Moreover, [Ba/Eu] increases with metallicity, beginning at [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1.5 dex, namely at a lower metallicity with respect to the Milky Way, where [Ba/Eu] starts to increase around [Fe/H] $\approx$ -1 dex. Our findings suggest the SMC has a higher production of Eu (with respect to the $\alpha$-elements) than the Milky Way but in line with what observed in other dwarf systems within the Local Group. We confirm that galaxies with star formation efficiencies lower than the Milky Way have high [Eu/$\alpha$], probably indicating a stronger efficiency of the delayed sources of r-process at low metallicities.</description>

      <title>The 2024 July 16 Solar Event: A Challenge To The Coronal Mass Ejection Origin Of Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-spacecraft analysis of the 2024 July 16 Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Flare (LDGRF) detected by the Large Area Telescope on the Fermi satellite. The measured &gt;100 MeV $\gamma$-ray emission persisted for over seven hours after the flare impulsive phase, and was characterized by photon energies exceeding 1 GeV and a remarkably-hard parent-proton spectrum. In contrast, the phenomena related to the coronal mass ejection (CME)-driven shock linked to this eruption were modest, suggesting an inefficient proton acceleration unlikely to achieve the energies well-above the 300 MeV pion-production threshold to account for the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Specifically, the CME was relatively slow (~600 km/s) and the accompanying interplanetary type-II/III radio bursts were faint and short-duration, unlike those typically detected during large events. In particular, the type-II emission did not extend to kHz frequencies and disappeared ~5.5 hours prior to the LDGRF end time. Furthermore, the associated solar energetic particle (SEP) event was very weak, short-duration, and limited to a few tens of MeV, even at magnetically well-connected spacecraft. These findings demonstrate that a very-fast CME resulting in a high-energy SEP event is not a necessary condition for the occurrence of LDGRFs, challenging the idea that the high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission is produced by the back-precipitation of shock-accelerated ions into the solar surface. The alternative origin scenario based on local particle trapping and acceleration in large-scale coronal loops is instead favored by the observation of giant arch-like structures of hot plasma over the source region persisting for the entire duration of this LDGRF.</description>

      <title>What Determines the Brightness of the Magnetically Open Solar Corona?: Insights from Three-dimensional Radiative Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations and Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship between solar coronal holes and open-field regions using three-dimensional radiative magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations combined with remote-sensing observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our numerical simulations reveal that magnetically open regions in the corona can exhibit brightness comparable to quiet regions, challenging the conventional view that open-field regions are inherently dark coronal holes. We find that the coronal brightness is primarily determined by the total energy input from photospheric magnetic activities, such as the small-scale dynamo, rather than differences in dissipative processes within the corona. Using synthesized EUV intensity maps, we show that brightness thresholds commonly used to identify coronal holes may overlook open-field regions, especially at lower spatial resolutions. Observational analysis utilizing SDO/HMI and AIA synoptic maps supports our simulation results, demonstrating that magnetic field extrapolation techniques, such as the Potential Field Source Surface (PFSS) model, are sensitive to the chosen parameters, including the source surface height. We suggest that discrepancies in estimates of open magnetic flux (the ``open flux problem'') arise both from the modeling assumptions in coronal magnetic field extrapolation and systematic biases in solar surface magnetic field observations. Our findings indicate the need for reconsidering criteria used to identify coronal holes as indicators of open-field regions to better characterize the solar open magnetic flux.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulations of oscillations for axisymmetric solar backgrounds with differential rotation and gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19386v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Local helioseismology comprises of imaging and inversion techniques employed to reconstruct the dynamic and interior of the Sun from correlations of oscillations observed on the surface, all of which require modeling solar oscillations and computing Green's kernels. In this context, we implement and investigate the robustness of the Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method in solving the equation modeling stellar oscillations for realistic solar backgrounds containing gravity and differential rotation. While a common choice for modeling stellar oscillations is the Galbrun's equation, our working equations are derived from an equivalent variant, involving less regularity in its coefficients, working with Lagrangian displacement and pressure perturbation as unknowns. Under differential rotation and axisymmetric assumption, the system is solved in azimuthal decomposition with the HDG method. Compared to no-gravity approximations, the mathematical nature of the wave operator is now linked to the profile of the solar buoyancy frequency N which encodes gravity, and leads to distinction into regions of elliptic or hyperbolic behavior of the wave operator at zero attenuation. While small attenuation is systematically included to guarantee theoretical well-posedness, the above phenomenon affects the numerical solutions in terms of amplitude and oscillation pattern, and requires a judicious choice of stabilization. We investigate the stabilization of the HDG discretization scheme, and demonstrate its importance to ensure the accuracy of numerical results, which is shown to depend on frequencies relative to N, and on the position of the Dirac source. As validations, the numerical power spectra reproduce accurately the observed effects of the solar rotation on acoustic waves.</description>

      <title>SPYGLASS. VII-A. The Demographics and Ages of Small Nearby Young Associations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent Gaia-based young stellar association surveys have revealed dozens of low-mass populations that have, until recently, been too small or sparse to detect. These populations represent a largely unstudied demographic with unknown origins, and their relative isolation may minimize gravitational disruptions that impact traceback, making them compelling targets for dynamical studies. In this paper, we survey 15 of these isolated young associations for the first time: Andromeda South (SCYA-97), Aquila East, Aries South (SCYA-104), Cassiopeia East (SCYA-43), Canis Major North, Leo Central (SCYA-2), Leo East (SCYA-3), Theia 72, Ophiuchus Southeast, Scutum North (SCYA-70), Taurus-Orion 1 (TOR1), Theia 78, Vulpecula East (UPK 88), SCYA-54, and SCYA-79. By combining Gaia astrometry and photometry with new ground-based spectroscopic measurements, we assess the membership of each population, search for substructure, analyze their demographics, and compute ages. We find that the smallest populations in our sample contain $&lt;20$ $M_{\odot}$ of stellar mass, making them the smallest associations ever detected. Four host substantial substructure, including TOR1, where we discover TOR1B, a new 9 $M_{\odot}$ association with radial velocities inconsistent with an origin in the parent complex. Using PARSEC isochrones, we produce self-consistent ages for all populations supported by dynamical and lithium depletion ages, which range from 6.9 $\pm$ 0.5 Myr in TOR1 to 42.8 $\pm$ 2.4 in AndS. Our results provide the first detailed overview of the properties of these populations, characterizing a largely unknown category of young associations that may have an important role in tracing the processes that guide local star formation.</description>

      <title>Probing the Physical and Chemical Characteristics of an Extremely Early Class 0 Protostar in G204.4-11.3A2-NE</title>

Abstract: We have observed the low-mass molecular cloud core G204.4-11.3A2-NE (G204NE) in the direction of Orion B giant molecular cloud with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Band 6. The $\rm 1.3\ mm$ continuum images and visibilities unveil a compact central structure with a radius of $\sim$12 au, while showing no signature of binarity down to 18 au. The bolometric temperature and luminosity of this source are derived to be ${\sim}$33 K and $\sim$1.15 $~L_{\odot}$, respectively. Chemical stratification is observed in dense gas tracers, with C$^{18}$O emission peaking at the continuum position surrounded by the spatially extended emission of N$_2$D$^+$ and DCO$^+$. This implies that the core is in a very early evolutionary stage in which $\rm CO$ depletion occurs in most regions except for a small area heated by the central source. The envelope kinematics indicates a rotating and infalling structure with a central protostar mass of 0.08-0.1 $M_{\odot}$. The protostar drives a collimated outflow traced by CO, SiO, SO, and H$_2$CO, with misaligned blueshifted and redshifted lobes exhibiting a pair of bow-like patterns. High-velocity jets, extending up to 720 au, are detected in CO, SiO, and SO lines. The jet launching region is likely within twice of the dust sublimation zone. The absence of a binary signature suggests the outflows and jets are driven by a single protostar, although a close binary cannot be ruled out. The observed deflection of the outflows and jet is likely due to turbulent accretion in a moderately magnetized core.</description>

      <title>Planetary Obliquity Excitation Through Pre-Main Sequence Stellar Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A planet's axial tilt ("obliquity") substantially affects its atmosphere and habitability. It is thus essential to comprehend the various mechanisms that can excite planetary obliquities, particularly at the primordial stage. Here, we explore planetary obliquity excitation induced by the early evolution of the host star. A young, distended star spins rapidly, resulting in a large gravitational quadrupole moment that induces nodal recession of the planet's orbit. As the star contracts and spins down, the nodal recession frequency decreases and can cross the planet's spin axis precession frequency. An adiabatic encounter results in the planet's capture into a secular spin-orbit resonance and excites the obliquity to large values. We find planets within $a \lesssim 1 \ \mathrm{AU}$ are most affected, but adiabatic capture depends on the initial stellar radius and spin rate. The overall picture is complicated by other sources of perturbation, including the disk, multiple planets, and tidal dissipation. Tides make it such that stellar oblateness-induced obliquity excitation is transient since tidal perturbations cause the resonance to break once high obliquities are reached. However, this early transient excitation is important because it can prime planets for long-term capture in a secular spin-orbit resonance induced by planet-planet interactions. Thus, although stellar oblateness-induced resonances are short-lived, they facilitate the prevalence of long-lived non-zero obliquities in exoplanets.</description>

      <title>SN 2024gy: Multi-epoch Spectroscopic Features Suggestive of Delayed Detonation in a Type Ia Supernova</title>

Abstract: We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2024gy, a Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) exhibiting high-velocity features (HVFs) in its early-time spectra. This SN reaches a peak $B$-band magnitude of $-19.25 \pm 0.29$ mag and subsequently declines by $\Delta m_{15}(B) \approx 1.12$ mag, consistent with the luminosity-width relation characteristic of normal SNe Ia. Based on the peak thermal luminosity of $(1.2 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, we estimate that $0.57 \pm 0.14~\rm M_{\odot}$ of $^{56}$Ni was synthesized during the explosion. Our dense early spectral monitoring revealed significant velocity disparities within the ejecta. Notably, absorption features from the Ca II near-infrared triplet were observed at velocities exceeding 25,000 km s$^{-1}$, while the Si II $\lambda$6355 line velocity at the same epoch was significantly lower at $\sim$ 16,000 km s$^{-1}$. This velocity disparity likely reflects distinct ionization states of intermediate-mass elements in the outermost layers. The prominent Ca II HVFs may originate from ionization suppression within the highest-velocity ejecta, potentially indicative of minimal hydrogen mixing in a delayed-detonation explosion scenario. Additionally, the Ni/Fe ratio derived from the nebular spectrum of SN 2024gy provides further support for this model.</description>

      <title>Binary-lens Microlensing Degeneracy: Impact on Planetary Sensitivity and Mass-ratio Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\sim10\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We also discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for future applications.</description>

      <title>Filamentary accretion flows in high-mass star-forming clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We quantify the gas flows from a scale of up to several parsecs down to the sub-parsec scale along filamentary structures in the three high-mass star-forming regions G75.78, IRAS21078+5211 and NGC7538 with data obtained from the IRAM 30 m telescope. The analysis is carried out using the surface density derived from 1.2 mm continuum emission and velocity differences estimated from HCO$^+$ and H$^{13}$CO$^+$ molecular line data.</description>
