      <title>The 2.5-meter Wide Field Survey Telescope Real-time Data Processing Pipeline I: From raw data to alert distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Wide Field Survey Telescope (WFST) is a dedicated photometric surveying facility built jointly by the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) and the Purple Mountain Observatory (PMO). Since many of its scientific objectives rely on near-real-time data for effective analysis, prompt processing of WFST images is of great significance. To meet this need, we adapted the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) science pipelines to handle the data collected by WFST. This paper presents the complete data processing workflow, from ingestion of raw images to the distribution of alerts, and details the primary data products generated by our pipeline. Researchers using data processed by this pipeline can refer to this document to fully understand the data processing procedures.</description>

      <title>Mapping Galaxy Images Across Ultraviolet, Visible and Infrared Bands Using Generative Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that generative deep learning can translate galaxy observations across ultraviolet, visible, and infrared photometric bands. Leveraging mock observations from the Illustris simulations, we develop and validate a supervised image-to-image model capable of performing both band interpolation and extrapolation. The resulting trained models exhibit high fidelity in generating outputs, as verified by both general image comparison metrics (MAE, SSIM, PSNR) and specialized astronomical metrics (GINI coefficient, M20). Moreover, we show that our model can be used to predict real-world observations, using data from the DECaLS survey as a case study. These findings highlight the potential of generative learning to augment astronomical datasets, enabling efficient exploration of multi-band information in regions where observations are incomplete. This work opens new pathways for optimizing mission planning, guiding high-resolution follow-ups, and enhancing our understanding of galaxy morphology and evolution.</description>

      <title>Novel SIMEX algorithm for autoregressive models to estimate AGN variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the variability in accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) is still unknown, but its behavior can be characterized by modeling the time series of optical wavelength fluxes coming from the accretion disks with damped random walk (DRW) being the most popular model for this purpose. The DRW is modeled by a characteristic fluctuation amplitude and damping timescale {\tau}, with the latter being potentially related to the mass and accretion rate onto the massive black hole. The estimation of {\tau} is challenging, with commonly used methods such as the maximum likelihood (ML) and the least square error (LSE) resulting in biased estimators. This problem arises most commonly for three reasons: i) the light curve has been observed with additive noise; ii) some cadence scheme; iii) when the autocorrelation parameter is close to one. The latter is called the unit root problem. In order to improve these parameter estimation procedures for estimating {\tau}, we developed a simulation-extrapolation (SIMEX) methodology in the context of time series analysis. We consider both the standard class of autoregressive processes observed at regular intervals and a recently developed class of irregularly autoregressive processes (iAR). The performance of the SIMEX estimation method was evaluated under conditions of near-unit-root behavior and additive noise through extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Monte Carlo experiments confirm that the SIMEX approach outperforms MLE and LSE methods, offering a reduction in estimation bias ranging from 30% to 90%. Real-data applications further validate the methodology, yielding better model fits and lower mean squared errors (MSE). The more accurate estimation of the damping timescale parameter can help to better understand the currently tentative links between DRW and physical parameters in AGN.</description>

      <title>Stratospheric Balloon Payloads for Astronomy: the challenge of coping with rising complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stratospheric balloons offer cost-effective access to space and grant the opportunity for fast scientific innovation cycles and higher-risk explorations. In addition to science pathfinders, they serve as platforms for technology advancement, and offer a unique opportunity to train future instrument scientists and PIs. However, the increase in complexity of some projects (sub-arcsecond pointing, numerous degrees of freedom, advanced cooling systems, real-time communication and data transfer, low readiness level technologies, etc.) elevates the scale of challenges. This paper discusses the challenges brought by the increase of instrument complexity in the constrained area of ballooning projects. We use the example of the multi-object slit UV spectrograph FIREBall-2 but also discuss other ambitious payloads to expose some lessons learned. We will then propose strategies for future balloon projects and potential interesting adaptations for funding agencies to accommodate these emerging complexities. The objective being to foster the added value of more ambitious balloon-borne projects, and to initiate discussion about how to generate more robust strategies for handling high-complexity undertakings. Although this paper is enriched by answers from a survey sent to balloon-borne payload PIs, it remains influenced by my personal experience on FIREBall-2. As such, it does not necessarily represent the perspectives of other members of the project, let alone the broader balloon community.</description>

      <title>Breaking the degeneracy in stellar spectral classification from single wide-band images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectral energy distribution (SED) of observed stars in wide-field images is crucial for chromatic point spread function (PSF) modelling methods, which use unresolved stars as integrated spectral samples of the PSF across the field of view. This is particularly important for weak gravitational lensing studies, where precise PSF modelling is essential to get accurate shear measurements. Previous research has demonstrated that the SED of stars can be inferred from low-resolution observations using machine-learning classification algorithms. However, a degeneracy exists between the PSF size, which can vary significantly across the field of view, and the spectral type of stars, leading to strong limitations of such methods. We propose a new SED classification method that incorporates stellar spectral information by using a preliminary PSF model, thereby breaking this degeneracy and enhancing the classification accuracy. Our method involves calculating a set of similarity features between an observed star and a preliminary PSF model at different wavelengths and applying a support vector machine to these similarity features to classify the observed star into a specific stellar class. The proposed approach achieves a 91\% top-two accuracy, surpassing machine-learning methods that do not consider the spectral variation of the PSF. Additionally, we examined the impact of PSF modelling errors on the spectral classification accuracy.</description>

      <title>A causal learning approach to in-orbit inertial parameter estimation for multi-payload deployers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses an approach to inertial parameter estimation for the case of cargo carrying spacecraft that is based on causal learning, i.e. learning from the responses of the spacecraft, under actuation. Different spacecraft configurations (inertial parameter sets) are simulated under different actuation profiles, in order to produce an optimised time-series clustering classifier that can be used to distinguish between them. The actuation is comprised of finite sequences of constant inputs that are applied in order, based on typical actuators available. By learning from the system's responses across multiple input sequences, and then applying measures of time-series similarity and F1-score, an optimal actuation sequence can be chosen either for one specific system configuration or for the overall set of possible configurations. This allows for both estimation of the inertial parameter set without any prior knowledge of state, as well as validation of transitions between different configurations after a deployment event. The optimisation of the actuation sequence is handled by a reinforcement learning model that uses the proximal policy optimisation (PPO) algorithm, by repeatedly trying different sequences and evaluating the impact on classifier performance according to a multi-objective metric.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo post-processing for radiation hydro simulations of accreting planets in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is part of a series investigating the observational appearance of planets accreting from their nascent protoplanetary disk (PPD). We evaluate the differences between gas temperature distributions determined in our radiation hydrodynamical (RHD) simulations and those recalculated via post-processing with a Monte Carlo (MC) radiative transport (RT) scheme. Our MCRT simulations were performed for global PPD models, each composed of a local 3D high-resolution RHD model embedded in an axisymmetric global disk simulation. We report the level of agreement between the two approaches and point out several caveats that prevent a perfect match between the temperature distributions with our respective methods of choice. Overall, the level of agreement is high, with a typical discrepancy between the RHD and MCRT temperatures of the high-resolution region of only about 10 percent. The largest differences were found close to the disk photosphere, at the transition layer between optically dense and thin regions, as well as in the far-out regions of the PPD, occasionally exceeding values of 40 percent. We identify several reasons for these discrepancies, which are mostly related to general features of typical radiative transfer solvers used in hydrodynamical simulations (angle- and frequency-averaging and ignored scattering) and MCRT methods (ignored internal energy advection and compression and expansion work). This provides a clear pathway to reduce systematic temperature inaccuracies in future works. Based on MCRT simulations, we finally determined the expected error in flux estimates, both for the entire PPD and for planets accreting gas from their ambient disk, independently of the amount of gas piling up in the Hill sphere and the used model resolution.</description>

      <title>Comparing Methods for Calculating Solar Energetic Particle Intensities: Re-binning versus Spectral Binning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar energetic particle (SEP) events have been observed for decades in the interplanetary medium by spacecraft measuring the intensity of energetic ions and electrons. These intensities provide valuable information about particle acceleration, the effects of bulk plasma dynamics on particle transport, and the anisotropy of particle distributions. Since measured intensities are typically reported in narrow energy bins, it is common to re-bin intensities over a wider energy range to improve counting statistics. We investigate two methods for calculating intensities across multiple energy bins: a) \textit{re-binned intensity} (\(\overline{j}_{\rm linlin}\)), which is calculated by integrating the intensity over energy space and corresponds to the intensity at an effective energy that depends on the time-varying spectral index, and b) \textit{spectral binned intensity} (\(\overline{j}_{\rm loglog}\)), calculated by integrating the log-intensity in log-energy space, yielding the intensity at the log-centered energy that is independent of the spectral index and remains constant over time. We compare these methods using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) IS\(\odot\)IS measurements of energetic protons, and we prescribe criteria for selecting the appropriate method for different scenarios. Our results show that the re-binned intensity is consistently larger (up to a factor of 5) than the spectral binned intensity for two SEP events observed by PSP, although the time series of the two methods are strongly correlated. Overall, both measures are important for SEP spectral analysis, and the selection of the appropriate measure depends on whether a physical (spectral binned intensity) or a statistical (re-binned intensity) representation is needed for a given analysis.</description>

      <title>SPOCK 2.0: Update to the FeatureClassifier in the Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Stability of Planetary Orbital Configurations Klassifier (SPOCK) package collects machine learning models for predicting the stability and collisional evolution of compact planetary systems. In this paper we explore improvements to SPOCK's binary stability classifier (FeatureClassifier), which predicts orbital stability by collecting data over a short N-body integration of a system. We find that by using a system-specific timescale (rather than a fixed $10^4$ orbits) for the integration, and by using this timescale as an additional feature, we modestly improve the model's AUC metric from 0.943 to 0.950 (AUC=1 for a perfect model). We additionally discovered that $\approx 10\%$ of N-body integrations in SPOCK's original training dataset were duplicated by accident, and that $&lt;1\%$ were misclassified as stable when they in fact led to ejections. We provide a cleaned dataset of 100,000+ unique integrations, release a newly trained stability classification model, and make minor updates to the API.</description>

      <title>Explainable autoencoder for neutron star dense matter parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed autoencoder designed to encode the equation of state of neutron stars into an interpretable latent space. In particular the input will be encoded in the mass, radius, and tidal deformability values of a neutron star. Unlike traditional black-box models, our approach incorporates additional loss functions to enforce explainability in the encoded representations. This method enhances the transparency of machine learning models in physics, providing a robust proof-of-concept tool to study compact stars data. Our results demonstrate that the proposed autoencoder not only accurately estimates the EoS parameters and central density/pressure but also offers insights into the physical connection between equation of state and observable physical quantities. This framework conceptualizes the physical differential equations themselves as the ``encoders", allowing interpretability of the latent space.</description>

      <title>Novel Dark Matter Signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Celestial observations often exhibit inexplicable planetary dependencies when the timing of an observable is projected onto planetary heliocentric positions. This is possible only for incident, non-relativistic streams. Notably, the celebrated dark matter (DM) in the Universe can form streams in our vicinity with speeds of about 240 km/s. Since gravitational impact scales with $1/(\text{velocity})^2$, all solar system objects, including the Sun and the Moon, act as strong gravitational lenses, with their focal planes located within the solar system. Even the Moon can focus penetrating particles toward the Earth at speeds of up to approximately 400 km/s, covering a large portion of the phase space of DM constituents. Consequently, the unexpected planetary dependencies of solar system observables may provide an alternative to Zwicky's tension regarding the overestimated visible cosmic mass. In this work, an overlooked but unexpected planetary dependency of any local observable serves as an analogue to Zwicky's cosmic measurements, particularly if a similar mysterious behavior has been previously noted. Thus, a persistent, unexpected planetary dependency represents a new tension between observation and expectation. The primary argument supporting DM in line with Zwicky's paradigm is this planetary dependency, which, on a local scale, constitutes the novel tension between observation and expectation. In particular, the recurrent planetary dependency of diverse observables mirrors Zwicky's cosmic tension with the overestimated visible mass. No other approach accounts for so many otherwise striking and mysterious observations in physics and medicine.</description>

      <title>Automatic Machine Learning Framework to Study Morphological Parameters of AGN Host Galaxies within $z &lt; 1.4$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a composite machine learning framework to estimate posterior probability distributions of bulge-to-total light ratio, half-light radius, and flux for Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) host galaxies within $z&lt;1.4$ and $m&lt;23$ in the Hyper Supreme-Cam Wide survey. We divide the data into five redshift bins: low ($0&lt;z&lt;0.25$), mid ($0.25&lt;z&lt;0.5$), high ($0.5&lt;z&lt;0.9$), extra ($0.9&lt;z&lt;1.1$) and extreme ($1.1&lt;z&lt;1.4$), and train our models independently in each bin. We use PSFGAN to decompose the AGN point source light from its host galaxy, and invoke the Galaxy Morphology Posterior Estimation Network (GaMPEN) to estimate morphological parameters of the recovered host galaxy. We first trained our models on simulated data, and then fine-tuned our algorithm via transfer learning using labeled real data. To create training labels for transfer learning, we used GALFIT to fit $\sim 20,000$ real HSC galaxies in each redshift bin. We comprehensively examined that the predicted values from our final models agree well with the GALFIT values for the vast majority of cases. Our PSFGAN + GaMPEN framework runs at least three orders of magnitude faster than traditional light-profile fitting methods, and can be easily retrained for other morphological parameters or on other datasets with diverse ranges of resolutions, seeing conditions, and signal-to-noise ratios, making it an ideal tool for analyzing AGN host galaxies from large surveys coming soon from the Rubin-LSST, Euclid, and Roman telescopes.</description>

Abstract: During its most recent return, comet 12P/Pons-Brooks experienced 14 well-documented outbursts, observed between June 13, 2023, and April 2024, at heliocentric distances ranging from $4.26\,$au to $0.85\,$au. After perihelion, the comet experienced two additional outbursts between June and August 31, 2024, at heliocentric distances of $1.20\,$au and $2.26\,$au, respectively. Using observational data, we developed a numerical model to estimate the mass ejected during these events, focusing on the sublimation of ice through the porous cometary nucleus. The key factors affecting ejected mass estimates are the outburst amplitude and the active surface area during both quiet sublimation and the outburst phases. Pogson's law was used to express outburst magnitude, incorporating scattering cross-sections of cometary agglomerates. The model iteratively determined the mass ejected in observed outbursts, considering various ice types (H$_{2}$O and CO$_{2}$) controlling sublimation activity. Our results indicate that the mass ejected during these outbursts ranges from 10$^{10}$ to 10$^{13}$ kg. Our findings highlight the significant role of surface morphology and thermodynamic conditions in cometary outbursts, providing insights into the mechanisms driving these phenomena and their implications for cometary evolution and dust trail formation. Based on the analysis of observational data, we propose a six-level classification system for cometary outbursts.</description>

      <title>\texttt{BrahMap}: A scalable and modular map-making framework for the CMB experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments have reached an era of unprecedented precision and complexity. Aiming to detect the primordial B-mode polarization signal, these experiments will soon be equipped with $10^{4}$ to $10^{5}$ detectors. Consequently, future CMB missions will face the substantial challenge of efficiently processing vast amounts of raw data to produce the initial scientific outputs - the sky maps - within a reasonable time frame and with available computational resources. To address this, we introduce \texttt{BrahMap}, a new map-making framework that will be scalable across both CPU and GPU platforms. Implemented in C++ with a user-friendly Python interface for handling sparse linear systems, \texttt{BrahMap} employs advanced numerical analysis and high-performance computing techniques to maximize the use of super-computing infrastructure. This work features an overview of the \texttt{BrahMap}'s capabilities and preliminary performance scaling results, with application to a generic CMB polarization experiment.</description>

      <title>PRINCESS: Prediction of compact binaries observations with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present PRINCESS, a computational tool designed to predict gravitational wave observations from compact binary coalescences (CBCs) in current and future detector networks. PRINCESS uniquely combines predictions of both individual gravitational wave events and the associated astrophysical background, leveraging user-provided CBC catalogs. With the anticipated improvements in detector sensitivity from second-generation (2G) to third-generation (3G) observatories like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, the tool aims to constrain models of stellar formation and compact object evolution. PRINCESS calculates the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for individual events and predicts the stochastic background arising from unresolved sources. We detail the code structure, installation, and usage, providing examples of predictions for different astrophysical models and detector configurations. Results include forecasts for binary black hole detections and background spectra, highlighting the potential of future networks to resolve nearly all CBC events. We also discuss ongoing developments to expand PRINCESS's capabilities, including accounting for additional sources such as extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) and incorporating more advanced detector models.</description>

      <title>Will nanodust reappear in STEREO/WAVES data?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanodust particles produced near the Sun by collisional breakup of larger grains are accelerated in the magnetised solar wind and reach high speeds outwards of 1 AU. Vaporisation and ionisation of fast dust grains impacting a spacecraft produce voltage pulses on wave instruments that enable them to act as dust detectors. Wave instruments on STEREO and on Cassini during its cruise phase detected a highly variable flux of fast nanodust. Both detections took place when the orientation of the solar magnetic dipole produced an interplanetary electric field that focused nanoparticles towards the heliospheric current sheet (HCS) - a geometry that is recurring because of the periodicity of solar activity.</description>

      <title>Dissecting stellar populations with manifold learning I. Validation of the method on a synthetic Milky Way-like galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different stellar populations may be identified through differences in chemical, kinematic, and chronological properties, suggesting the interplay of various physical mechanisms that led to their origin and subsequent evolution. As such, the identification of stellar populations is key for gaining insight into the evolutionary history of the Milky Way galaxy. This task is complicated by the fact that stellar populations share significant overlap in their chrono-chemo-kinematic properties, hindering efforts to identify and define stellar populations. Our goal is to offer a novel and effective methodology that can provide deeper insight into the nonlinear and nonparametric properties of the multidimensional physical parameters that define stellar populations. For this purpose we explore the ability of manifold learning to differentiate stellar populations with minimal assumptions about their number and nature. Manifold learning is an unsupervised machine learning technique that seeks to intelligently identify and disentangle manifolds hidden within the input data. To test this method, we make use of Gaia DR3-like synthetic stellar samples generated from the FIRE-2 cosmological simulations. These represent red-giant stars constrained by asteroseismic data from TESS. We reduce the 5-dimensional input chrono-chemo-kinematic parameter space into 2-dimensional latent space embeddings generated by manifold learning. We then study these embeddings to assess how accurately they represent the original data and whether they contain meaningful information that can be used to discern stellar populations. We conclude that manifold learning possesses promising abilities to differentiate stellar populations when considering realistic observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Disentangling transients and their host galaxies with Scarlet2: A framework to forward model multi-epoch imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15427v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many science cases for wide-field time-domain surveys rely on accurate identification and characterization of the galaxies hosting transient and variable objects. In the era of the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory the number of known transient and variable sources will grow by orders of magnitude, and many of these sources will be blended with their host galaxies and neighboring galaxies. A diverse range of applications - including the classification of nuclear and non-nuclear sources, identification of potential host galaxies, extraction of host galaxy SEDs without requiring a transient-free reference image, and combined analysis of photometry from multiple surveys - will benefit from a flexible framework to model time-domain imaging of transients. We describe a time-domain extension of the Scarlet2 scene modeling code for multi-epoch, multi-band, and multi-resolution imaging data to extract simultaneous transient and host galaxy models. Scarlet2 leverages the benefits of data-driven priors on galaxy morphology, is fully GPU compatible, and can jointly model multi-resolution data from ground and space-based surveys. We demonstrate the method on simulated LSST-like supernova imaging, low-resolution Zwicky Transient Facility imaging of tidal disruption events, and Hyper Suprime Cam imaging of variable AGN out to z = 4 in the COSMOS fields. We show that Scarlet2 models provide accurate transient and host galaxy models as well as accurate measurement of host-transient spatial offsets, and demonstrate future applications to the search for 'wandering' massive black holes.</description>

      <title>Tilt-To-Length Coupling in LISA -- Uncertainty and Biases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16475v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coupling of the angular jitter of the spacecraft and their sub-assemblies with the optical bench and the telescope into the interferometric length readout will be a major noise source in the LISA mission. We refer to this noise as tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling. It will be reduced directly by realignments, and the residual noise will then be subtracted in post-processing. The success of these mitigation strategies depends on an accurate computation of the TTL coupling coefficients. We present here a thorough analysis of the accuracy of the coefficient estimation under different jitter characteristics, angular readout noise levels, and gravitational wave sources. We analyze in which cases the estimates degrade using two estimators, the common least squares estimator and the instrumental variables estimator. Our investigations show that angular readout noise leads to a systematic bias of the least squares estimator, depending on the TTL coupling coefficients, jitter and readout noise level, while the instrumental variable estimator converges to an unbiased result as the data set length increases. We present an equation that predicts the estimation bias of the least squares method due to angular readout noise.</description>

      <title>Learning to See: Applying Inverse Recurrent Inference Machines to See through Refractive Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) has produced horizon-resolving images of Sagittarius A* (Sgr A$^*$). Scattering in the turbulent plasma of the interstellar medium distorts the appearance of Sgr A$^*$ on scales only marginally smaller than the fiducial resolution of EHT. Therefore, this process both diffractive blurs and adds stochastic refractive substructures that limits the practical angular resolution of EHT images of Sgr A$^*$. We utilized a novel recurrent neural network machine learning framework to demonstrate that it is possible to mitigate interstellar scattering at wavelengths of $1.3\,{\rm mm}$ near the galactic center up to structures at the scale of $5\mu{as}$ well below the nominal instrumental resolution of EHT, $24\,\mu{\rm as}$.</description>

      <title>The JWST Early Release Science Program for Direct Observations of Exoplanetary Systems III: Aperture Masking Interferometric Observations of the star HIP 65426 at 3.8 um</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present aperture masking interferometry (AMI) observations of the star HIP 65426 at $3.8\,\rm{\mu m}$ as a part of the JWST Direct Imaging Early Release Science (ERS) program obtained using the Near Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph (NIRISS) instrument. This mode provides access to very small inner working angles (even separations slightly below the Michelson limit of $0.5\lambda/D$ for an interferometer), which are inaccessible with the classical inner working angles of the JWST coronagraphs. When combined with JWST's unprecedented infrared sensitivity, this mode has the potential to probe a new portion of parameter space across a wide array of astronomical observations. Using this mode, we are able to achieve a $5\sigma$ contrast of $\Delta m{\sim}7.62{\pm}0.13$ mag relative to the host star at separations ${\gtrsim}0.07{"}$, and the contrast deteriorates steeply at separations ${\lesssim}0.07{"}$. However, we detect no additional companions interior to the known companion HIP 65426 b (at separation ${\sim}0.82{"}$ or, $87^{+108}_{-31}\,\rm{au}$). Our observations thus rule out companions more massive than $10{-}12\,\rm{M_{Jup}}$ at separations ${\sim}10{-}20\,\rm{au}$ from HIP 65426, a region out of reach of ground or space-based coronagraphic imaging. These observations confirm that the AMI mode on JWST is sensitive to planetary mass companions at close-in separations (${\gtrsim}0.07{"}$), even for thousands of more distant stars at $\sim$100 pc, in addition to the stars in the nearby young moving groups as stated in previous works. This result will allow the planning and successful execution of future observations to probe the inner regions of nearby stellar systems, opening an essentially unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>Accelerating lensed quasar discovery and modeling with physics-informed variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed quasars provide valuable insights into the rate of cosmic expansion, the distribution of dark matter in foreground deflectors, and the characteristics of quasar hosts. However, detecting them in astronomical images is difficult due to the prevalence of non-lensing objects. To address this challenge, we developed a generative deep learning model called VariLens, built upon a physics-informed variational autoencoder. This model seamlessly integrates three essential modules: image reconstruction, object classification, and lens modeling, offering a fast and comprehensive approach to strong lens analysis. VariLens is capable of rapidly determining both (1) the probability that an object is a lens system and (2) key parameters of a singular isothermal ellipsoid (SIE) mass model -- including the Einstein radius ($\theta_\mathrm{E}$), lens center, and ellipticity -- in just milliseconds using a single CPU. A direct comparison of VariLens estimates with traditional lens modeling for 20 known lensed quasars within the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) footprint shows good agreement, with both results consistent within $2\sigma$ for systems with $\theta_\mathrm{E}&lt;3$ arcsecs. To identify new lensed quasar candidates, we begin with an initial sample of approximately 80 million sources, combining HSC data with multiwavelength information from various surveys. After applying a photometric preselection aimed at locating $z&gt;1.5$ sources, the number of candidates was reduced to 710,966. Subsequently, VariLens highlights 13,831 sources, each showing a high likelihood of being a lens. A visual assessment of these objects results in 42 promising candidates that await spectroscopic confirmation. These results underscore the potential of automated deep learning pipelines to efficiently detect and model strong lenses in large datasets.</description>
