      <title>A Velocity Coupled Radial Acceleration Ansatz for Disk-Galaxy Rotation Curves: Fits to SPARC, Bayesian Inference, and Parameter Identifiability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observed rotation curves of disk galaxies remain a sharp empirical probe of the relationship between baryons and dynamics. We study a minimal, explicitly \emph{phenomenological} alternative to standard halo parameterizations: an additional inward \emph{radial} acceleration proportional to the local \emph{tangential} speed, $a_{\vca}(r)=\gamma(r)\,v(r)$, with a saturating coupling $\gamma(r)=\vinf/(r+\rzero)$. Combining this ansatz with the circular-motion condition yields a quadratic equation for $v(r)$ with a closed-form physical branch.We fit this ``velocity-coupled acceleration'' (\vca) model to $N_\mathrm{gal}=171$ rotation curves from the SPARC sample using the published baryonic decompositions (gas, disk, bulge), and we compare to two commonly used two-parameter halo models (NFW and Burkert) using an identical optimization pipeline and error model.For a fiducial systematic error floor $\sigma_0=5~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, the \vca model is typically competitive with an NFW halo and performs comparably (though not uniformly better) than a Burkert halo in information-criterion comparisons.We further perform MCMC inference for \vca parameters, quantify posterior predictive coverage, and show that parameter posteriors exhibit a strong $\vinf$--$\rzero$ degeneracy for many galaxies; only $47/171$ galaxies yield well-identified posteriors under simple width-based criteria. We also perform a simple radial holdout cross-validation (outer 30\% of radii) and find predictive RMSE comparable to NFW and Burkert under this protocol.Finally..</description>

      <title>Can A Kinematically Hot and Thick Disk Form A Bar? : Role of Highly Spinning Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent JWST observations claim the existence of a significant fraction of bars in the kinematically hotter and thicker disk at high redshift Universe. These observations challenge the current understanding of disk stability in galaxies similar to the Milky Way. The analytical work and N-body simulations suggest that the kinematically hot (dispersion-dominated) and thick disk are stable against bar formation. In this work, we perform the controlled N-body simulations of a kinematically hot and thick disk, which is residing in a non-rotating and spinning dark matter halo. We report that the disk, which is classically stable against bar instability in the live and non-rotating halo, leads to bar formation in a spinning halo environment. The spinning halo model is 8 times more efficient in transporting angular momentum from the disk to the halo compared to the non-spinning halo. We claim that Ostriker-Peebles and ELN bar formation criteria do not predict bar formation for both the non-roating and spinning halo. The recent criteria from Jang-Kim successfully predict the bar stability for the non-rotating halo model, but not for the spinning halo model. These results provide an important insight into the bar formation processes for thick and hot disks at high redshift.</description>

      <title>A systematic study on the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon emission features of nearby galaxies using AKARI near-IR spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar hydrocarbon dust containing aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), is believed to be processed by various factors including UV radiation fields and mechanical shocks in the galactic environments. We systematically investigate the processing of hydrocarbon dust, especially the likely causes for the variations of the luminosity ratio of aliphatic to aromatic hydrocarbon emission features, using the near-infrared (IR) spectral features at wavelengths 3.3 um and 3.4-3.6 um observed with AKARI/IRC. We analyzed 243 near-IR spectra of 240 star-forming (U)LIRGs (the total IR luminosity, $L_\rm{IR}&gt;10^{11}\ L_\odot$), 119 spectra of 105 star-forming IRGs ($10^{10}\ L_\odot&lt;L_\rm{IR}&lt;10^{11}\ L_\odot$), and 94 spectra of 65 sub-IRGs ($L_\rm{IR}&lt;10^{10}\ L_\odot$), in addition to 232 spectra of 36 Galactic HII regions as a reference sample. We performed near-IR spectral model fitting to estimate the luminosities of the aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbon features and the HI recombination line Br$\rm{\alpha}$. The result indicates that the luminosity ratios of the aliphatic to the aromatic hydrocarbons ($L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$) in the sample galaxies show considerably large variations, compared to those in the Galactic HII regions, $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$ systematically decreasing with $L_\rm{IR}$ and $L_\rm{Br\alpha}$. We find that (sub-)IRGs with continuum colors bluer at 4 um tend to have higher $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to reflect the intrinsic nature of PAHs outside the HII region where the PAHs remain non-processed by strong UV radiation fields. We also find that some ULIRGs with continuum colors redder at 4 um show extremely low $L_\rm{ali}/L_\rm{aro}$, which is likely to be caused by blending aliphatic emission and absorption features due to the presence of an obscured galactic nucleus in merger systems.</description>

      <title>The rotation curve of the Milky Way measured by Classical Cepheids from Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the rotation curve (RC) of the Milky Way in the range 6 &lt; R &lt; 18 kpc using a sample of 903 carefully selected classical Cepheids with precise proper motions and high-quality radial velocities from \emph{Gaia} DR3. Their distances can be accurately measured from the well-known Period-Wesenheit relations. The RC is computed from the three-dimensional velocity components of these Cepheids. Generally, the RC shows a slight decline with distance from the Galactic center. On top of this general trend, the newly constructed RC shows a dip around R ~ 10-11 kpc, followed by a bump around R ~ 13-14 kpc. This feature has also been reported in other RC measurements, mostly in RCs traced by young tracers like Cepheids. To better constrain the Milky Way mass, an averaged RC is then constructed by combining measurements from this work and previous efforts. Due to the ambiguous nature of the dip-and-bump feature, this averaged RC is constructed only within the radial range where the RC appears to be less influenced by this feature. By using this averaged RC, we determine the circular velocity at solar position and also build a parameterized mass model of our Milky Way. The result for the circular velocity at the solar position is $V_c(R_0) = 236.8 \pm 0.8\ \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, which is in good agreement with previous measurements. The local dark matter density and the enclosed dark matter halo mass within 18 kpc are estimated from the averaged RC under different baryonic models, yielding a series of consistent results: a local density of $0.33-0.40\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$ and an enclosed mass of $1.19-1.45 \times 10^{11}\ M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>A large, long-lived, slowly-expanding superbubble across the Perseus Arm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar feedback is a crucial mechanism in galactic evolution, as demonstrated by the widespread bubbles observed with JWST. In this study, we combine data from Gaia and LAMOST to obtain a sample of young O-B2 stars with full three-dimensional velocity information. Focusing on the largest known superbubble in the Milky Way, we identify groups of O-B2 stars at its periphery, exhibiting a transverse velocity of 25.8 km/s and an expansion velocity of 6.2 km/s. Using these velocities, we calculate a crossing time t_cross ~ 20 Myr and an expansion timescale t_expansion ~ 80 Myr. We estimate a survival timescale t_survival ~ 250 Myr and a supernova interval t_SN ~ 0.1 Myr. Together with the Galactic shear timescale t_shear ~ 30 Myr, these values satisfy t_SN &lt; t_shear &lt; t_survival. The energy and momentum from supernovae are sufficient to sustain the bubble's growth against ambient pressure. This indicates that repeated supernovae replenish energy faster than shear and turbulent distort the cavity. Our analysis classifies the Giant Oval Cavity as a large, quasi-stationary superbubble, similar to the Phantom Bubble observed by JWST, stabilised by the interplay between stellar feedback and Galactic disk dynamics.</description>

      <title>ESO Expanding Horizons White Paper: Electromagnetic counterparts of massive BH mergers with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), adopted by ESA and scheduled for the second half of the next decade, will drive a new revolution in the rapidly growing field of gravitational-wave astronomy, by extending GW observations into the hiterto unexplored millihertz regime. One of the key source classes of LISA is merging massive black hole binaries in the 1e4-1e7 Msun mass range detectable to very high redshifts $z\sim 15$. MBHBs lighter than 1e6 Msun can potentially be identified during their inspiral weeks before coalescence, allowing for complementary electromagnetic observations before, during, and after the two MBHs merge. This white paper aims at defining the optimal strategy to maximize the number of detected EM counterparts of LISA MBHB events.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). XIX. Structures of molecular outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As part of the ALMA Large Program "Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks" (eDisk), 12CO (2 - 1) was observed towards 19 nearby low-mass protostars. Of these objects, 15 sources are found to show molecular outflow emission. Based on their morphological and kinematical structures, the CO outflows are classified into three types: a wind-driven shell, where ambient material is swept up by a wide-angle wind from the star, a bow shock, and a slow disk wind, which is a conical or parabolic flow with onion-like velocity structure. We categorize 11 outflows as a slow disk wind, 7 as a wind-driven shell, and 1 as a bow shock. Four of these outflows were found to show signs of both slow disk wind and wind-driven shell characteristics. Five objects show misalignment between the red- and blue-shifted outflows. Seven objects show significant misalignment between the outflow axis (either or both of the red- and blue-shifted outflows) and the minor axis of the dust continuum emission around the protostar. For the objects showing wind-driven shell emission, we compare simple parametrized models with the observations to derive physical properties of the observed shells, such as their dynamical ages. This shows evidence of a time variability in the outflows, such as changes in their direction. In some objects, large differences are seen between the properties of the red- and blue-shifted outflows, possibly indicating differences in the properties of the ambient medium with which the outflow interacts.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulations of the Circularized Accretion Flow in Population III Star Tidal Disruption Events. I. The Accretion Flow and the Wind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs) have recently been proposed as potential probes for Population III stars. However, the properties of the accretion flow and the wind from the Pop III star TDE system are not clear. By performing radiative hydrodynamic simulations, we study the 'circularized' accretion flow of the Pop III star TDE system. The masses of the black hole (BH) and the disrupted star are $10^6$ and $300$ solar masses, respectively. We focus on the properties of the wind. We find that the black hole accretion rate is highly super-Eddington. A strong wind is driven by radiation pressure. Due to the presence of a strong wind, only $25\%$--$35\%$ of the fallback debris is accreted by the BH. The remaining part is taken away by the wind. The kinetic power of the wind can be as high as $10^{46} {\rm \ erg \ s^{-1}}$. The properties of the wind obtained in this paper may be useful for understanding the radiation properties of Pop III star TDEs in the context of the wind 'reprocessing' model.</description>

      <title>From emission to absorption: the FAST observation of the OH 18-cm lines from the Comet C2025/A6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observed comet C/2025 A6 with FAST telescope equipped with the ultra-wideband receiver from 23$^{\rm rd}$ October to 8$^{\rm th}$ November 2025 and detected the OH 18-cm lines for the first time. The OH lines underwent a reversal from emission to absorption from 23$^{\rm rd}$ October to 5$^{\rm th}$ November, which is mainly caused by variations in the heliocentric velocity. Through trapezoidal fitting of the OH line profiles, we derive expansion velocities of the water that rise as the heliocentric distance decreases. Based on these results, we estimated the OH production rates of C/2025 A6 for 23$^{\rm rd}$ October, 26$^{\rm th}$ October, 4$^{\rm th}$ November, and 5$^{\rm th}$ November and it presents a significant upward trend.</description>

      <title>Impact of neglecting center-of-mass acceleration in parameter estimation of stellar-mass black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A tertiary body near a coalescing binary can imprint its influence on the gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by that binary in the form of center-of-mass (CoM) acceleration. An example of such a scenario is a binary black hole (BBH) merging near a supermassive black hole, which is touted to occur frequently. The limited low-frequency sensitivity of current GW detectors makes it challenging to detect these effects, as the associated waveform phase remains elusive. However, next-generation (3G) detectors such as Cosmic Explorer (CE) and Einstein Telescope (ET), with improved sensitivity at lower frequencies, are expected to be capable of capturing such signatures. In our study, we focus on the stellar-mass BBHs and explore the parameter space where the CoM acceleration will play a dominant role affecting parameter inference of the binary. We demonstrate that an unaccounted CoM acceleration of a low-mass binary with a total mass of $5\, \rm{M}_{\odot} $ can lead to significant systematic biases, exceeding statistical errors in the estimation of the chirp mass and symmetric mass ratio when the CoM parameter $\alpha$ is as small as $\sim 10^{-9}$ and $10^{-10}$ $\rm{s}^{-1}$ for CE and ET, respectively. We also find that asymmetric binaries are more susceptible to systematic bias when CoM acceleration is neglected. When the effect of CoM acceleration is included in the GW phase, then $\alpha = 10^{-7} \rm s^{-1}$ can be constrained with a bound of $10^{-9} (10^{-11})\, \rm s^{-1}$ for CE (ET). Our study thus highlights the crucial implications of considering the presence of a tertiary body in the GW emitted by a stellar-mass BBH when observed in 3G detectors.</description>

      <title>Multiband optical variability on diverse timescales of the blazar Ton 599 from 2011 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (Shortened)Context: We analyze the optical variability of the FSRQ Ton 599 using BVRI photometry from the WEBT collaboration (2011-2023), complemented by photometric and spectroscopic data from the Steward Observatory.\\ Aims: To characterize short- and long-term optical variability -- including flux distributions, intranight changes, color evolution, and spectra -- to constrain physical parameters and processes in the central engine.\\ Methods: We tested flux distributions in each filter against normal and log-normal, explored the RMS-flux relation and derived PSDs. We quantified intranight variability using a $\chi^2$ test and fractional variability. From variability timescales, we estimated the emitting region size and magnetic field. Long-term variability was studied by segmenting the light curve into 12 intervals and analyzing flux statistics. For multi-filter flares, we computed spectral slopes, redshift-corrected fluxes, monochromatic luminosities and generated Color-magnitude and color-time diagrams. From low-flux spectra, we measured Mg II line and estimated the black hole mass.\\ Results: Ton 599 showed strong optical variability. Log-normal distributions fit the fluxes better, and all bands show a positive RMS-flux relation with red-noise PSDs.Intranight variability is detected, and used in constraining the emission region and magnetic field.The R band reaches a peak flux of 23.5 mJy, corresponding to a monochromatic luminosity of $log({\nu}L{\nu})= 48.48 [erg/s]$. We found a redder-when-brighter trend at low fluxes (thermal), achromatic behavior at intermediate levels (possibly due to jet orientation changes), and a bluer-when-brighter trend at high fluxes (synchrotron). Long-term color changes are modest, short-term are significant, with a negative correlation between the amplitude of color changes and the average flux. The estimated SMBH mass is order of $10^8 M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>HI Content of Group Galaxies from the FAST All Sky HI Survey</title>

Abstract: We investigate the atomic gas (HI) content of galaxies in groups using early data from the FAST All Sky HI survey (FASHI). Taking advantage of FAST's blind, wide-area coverage and uniform sensitivity, we assemble a sample of $230$ group galaxies belonging to $182$ groups at $z\leq0.03$. These groups were identified using a halo-based group finder, and they have an median membership of $4$ galaxies. We also derived a matched control sample of isolated systems, and apply censored-data modeling to include both detections and non-detections. At fixed stellar mass and color, we find that the global median HI fraction of group galaxies differs from that of controls by only $-0.04$ dex ($95\%$ CI [$-0.18,\ 0.16$]), indicating at most a mild average offset. The signal is not uniform across populations: satellites are HI-poor (median $\Delta f_{\mathrm{HI}}=-0.12$ dex), whereas centrals are not HI-deficient (median $\Delta f_{\mathrm{HI}}=0.13$ dex). Group galaxies located within $0.5R_{180}$ and in denser systems (richness $&gt;10$ or local density $\Sigma&gt;10\ \mathrm{gal\ Mpc^{-2}}$) show stronger negative offsets, whereas galaxies in the outskirts are statistically indistinguishable from the controls. These results refine earlier reports of global group HI deficiency: with deeper blind data and uniform treatment of upper limits, we show that HI depletion is primarily confined to satellites and compact cores rather than being ubiquitous across groups.</description>

      <title>High-energy astrochemistry in the molecular interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past decade, there has been a significant shift in astrochemistry with a renewed focus on the role of non-thermal processes on the molecular interstellar medium, in particular energetic particles (such as cosmic ray particles and fast electrons) and X-ray radiation. This has been brought about in large part due to new observations of interstellar complex organic molecules (iCOMS) in environments that would inhibit their formation, such as cold, dense gas in prestellar cores or in the highly energetic environments in galactic centers. In parallel, there has been a plethora of new laboratory investigations on the role of high-energy radiation and electrons on the chemistry of astrophysical ices, demonstrating the ability of this radiation to induce complex chemistry. In recent years, theoretical models have also begun to include newer cosmic-ray-driven processes in both the gas and ice phases. In this review, we unify aspects of the chemistry driven by X-ray radiation and energetic particles into a ``high-energy astrochemistry'', defining this term and reviewing the underlying chemical processes. We conclude by examining various laboratories where high-energy astrochemistry is at play and identify future issues to be tackled.</description>

      <title>The Extended Baryonic Tully-Fisher Relation for SDSS MaNGA Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The baryonic Tully-Fisher relation (BTFR), a relationship between rotational velocity and baryonic mass in spiral galaxies, probes the relative content of baryonic and dark matter in galaxies and thus provides a good test of Lambda CDM. Using H-alpha kinematics to model the rotation curves of spiral galaxies, we construct the BTFR for 5743 SDSS MaNGA DR17 galaxies. To extend the BTFR to higher masses using elliptical galaxies, we estimate their total masses from their stellar velocity dispersions using the virial theorem and define the effective rotational velocity as the velocity a rotation-supported galaxy would exhibit given this mass. The baryonic mass of spiral galaxies is composed of stellar, HI, H2, and He mass, while only the stellar mass is used for the baryonic content of ellipticals. We construct and fit the BTFR for a matched subsample of spiral and elliptical MaNGA and IllustrisTNG 100-1 (TNG100) galaxies, finding BTFR slopes between 3.2 and 4.0. We fit a joint BTFR for the 5743 MaNGA spiral and elliptical galaxies and find a BTFR slope of 3.54 (+0.65/-0.48), which is in good agreement with TNG100 galaxies with baryonic masses greater than 10^9 Msun for which we find a BTFR slope of 3.57 (+0.48/-0.37). Within this mass range, the MaNGA galaxies are consistent with both the Lambda CDM simulation and the prediction from MOND; a sample of lower mass galaxies is necessary to differentiate between the two models.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Matter with Mass Segregation: A Unified Explanation of Dwarf Cores and Small-Scale Lenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14898v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In two-component self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with inter-species interactions, mass segregation arises naturally from collisional relaxation, enhancing central densities and gravothermal evolution. We demonstrate that models with velocity-dependent interactions, both within and between species, can connect several small-scale observations while remaining consistent with cluster-scale constraints. This combination enables core formation in dwarf halos, where the presence of baryons increases the inner densities and enhances the predicted strong lensing signatures. Using cosmological and controlled simulations alongside an accurate parametric model, we show that this framework explains the structure of dark perturbers observed in strong lensing systems, and significantly increases the efficiency of small-scale lenses by a factor of $\sim 5$, consistent with the galaxy-galaxy strong lensing excess reported in clusters. Importantly, mass segregation can enhance the Einstein radii of SIDM halos relative to their CDM counterparts, overcoming a key challenge in one-component SIDM scenarios. Our results establish mass segregation in two-component SIDM as a self-consistent and testable model capable of simultaneously addressing multiple small-scale challenges in structure formation.</description>
