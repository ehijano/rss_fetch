      <title>Delay Neural Networks (DeNN) for exploiting temporal information in event-based datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Deep Neural Networks (DNN) and Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), the information of a neuron is computed based on the sum of the amplitudes (weights) of the electrical potentials received in input from other neurons. We propose here a new class of neural networks, namely Delay Neural Networks (DeNN), where the information of a neuron is computed based on the sum of its input synaptic delays and on the spike times of the electrical potentials received from other neurons. This way, DeNN are designed to explicitly use exact continuous temporal information of spikes in both forward and backward passes, without approximation. (Deep) DeNN are applied here to images and event-based (audio and visual) data sets. Good performances are obtained, especially for datasets where temporal information is important, with much less parameters and less energy than other models.</description>

      <title>Solving Sparse Finite Element Problems on Neuromorphic Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that scalable neuromorphic hardware can implement the finite element method, which is a critical numerical method for engineering and scientific discovery. Our approach maps the sparse interactions between neighboring finite elements to small populations of neurons that dynamically update according to the governing physics of a desired problem description. We show that for the Poisson equation, which describes many physical systems such as gravitational and electrostatic fields, this cortical-inspired neural circuit can achieve comparable levels of numerical accuracy and scaling while enabling the use of inherently parallel and energy-efficient neuromorphic hardware. We demonstrate that this approach can be used on the Intel Loihi 2 platform and illustrate how this approach can be extended to nontrivial mesh geometries and dynamics.</description>

      <title>The working principles of model-based GAs fall within the PAC framework: A mathematical theory of problem decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concepts of linkage, building blocks, and problem decomposition have long existed in the genetic algorithm (GA) field and have guided the development of model-based GAs for decades. However, their definitions are usually vague, making it difficult to develop theoretical support. This paper provides an algorithm-independent definition to describe the concept of linkage. With this definition, the paper proves that any problems with a bounded degree of linkage are decomposable and that proper problem decomposition is possible via linkage learning. The way of decomposition given in this paper also offers a new perspective on nearly decomposable problems with bounded difficulty and building blocks from the theoretical aspect. Finally, this paper relates problem decomposition to PAC learning and proves that the global optima of these problems and the minimum decomposition blocks are PAC learnable under certain conditions.</description>

      <title>A Truly Sparse and General Implementation of Gradient-Based Synaptic Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online synaptic plasticity rules derived from gradient descent achieve high accuracy on a wide range of practical tasks. However, their software implementation often requires tediously hand-derived gradients or using gradient backpropagation which sacrifices the online capability of the rules. In this work, we present a custom automatic differentiation (AD) pipeline for sparse and online implementation of gradient-based synaptic plasticity rules that generalizes to arbitrary neuron models. Our work combines the programming ease of backpropagation-type methods for forward AD while being memory-efficient. To achieve this, we exploit the advantageous compute and memory scaling of online synaptic plasticity by providing an inherently sparse implementation of AD where expensive tensor contractions are replaced with simple element-wise multiplications if the tensors are diagonal. Gradient-based synaptic plasticity rules such as eligibility propagation (e-prop) have exactly this property and thus profit immensely from this feature. We demonstrate the alignment of our gradients with respect to gradient backpropagation on an synthetic task where e-prop gradients are exact, as well as audio speech classification benchmarks. We demonstrate how memory utilization scales with network size without dependence on the sequence length, as expected from forward AD methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Hype: Benchmarking LLM-Evolved Heuristics for Bin Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling Large Language Models (LLMs) with Evolutionary Algorithms has recently shown significant promise as a technique to design new heuristics that outperform existing methods, particularly in the field of combinatorial optimisation. An escalating arms race is both rapidly producing new heuristics and improving the efficiency of the processes evolving them. However, driven by the desire to quickly demonstrate the superiority of new approaches, evaluation of the new heuristics produced for a specific domain is often cursory: testing on very few datasets in which instances all belong to a specific class from the domain, and on few instances per class. Taking bin-packing as an example, to the best of our knowledge we conduct the first rigorous benchmarking study of new LLM-generated heuristics, comparing them to well-known existing heuristics across a large suite of benchmark instances using three performance metrics. For each heuristic, we then evolve new instances won by the heuristic and perform an instance space analysis to understand where in the feature space each heuristic performs well. We show that most of the LLM heuristics do not generalise well when evaluated across a broad range of benchmarks in contrast to existing simple heuristics, and suggest that any gains from generating very specialist heuristics that only work in small areas of the instance space need to be weighed carefully against the considerable cost of generating these heuristics.</description>

      <title>QGAIC: Quantum Inspired Genetic Algorithm for Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study uses two meta-heuristics methodologies to introduce two novel quantum-inspired meta heuristic approaches: quantum-inspired genetic algorithm (QIGA1) and quantum-inspired genetic algorithm with dynamic approach (QIGA2). The two suggested methods combine a classical and quantum genetic algorithm approach. Both approaches use The correlation coefficient as an assessment function to identify the best (optimal) values for binary image. In quantum computing, they use simple ideas like qubits and state superposition. Due to these characteristics, parallelism which uses the time discreteness of quantum mechanical systems, is exhibited. For five distinct MNIST datasets, the performance of all participating algorithms has been assessed by comparing the suggested approaches first with their traditional approach counterparts and then with the proposed methods QIGA1 and QIGA2. Each method's ideal threshold value, associated fitness value (best and average), loss, and accuracy for each MNIST dataset have all been published. The outcomes demonstrate the superior efficiency of the suggested approaches over their traditional equivalents.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present HyperCam, an energy-efficient image classification pipeline that enables computer vision tasks onboard low-power IoT camera systems. HyperCam leverages hyperdimensional computing to perform training and inference efficiently on low-power microcontrollers. We implement a low-power wireless camera platform using off-the-shelf hardware and demonstrate that HyperCam can achieve an accuracy of 93.60%, 84.06%, 92.98%, and 72.79% for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, Face Detection, and Face Identification tasks, respectively, while significantly outperforming other classifiers in resource efficiency. Specifically, it delivers inference latency of 0.08-0.27s while using 42.91-63.00KB flash memory and 22.25KB RAM at peak. Among other machine learning classifiers such as SVM, xgBoost, MicroNets, MobileNetV3, and MCUNetV3, HyperCam is the only classifier that achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining competitive memory footprint and inference latency that meets the resource requirements of low-power camera systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid-Quantum Neural Architecture Search for The Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies in quantum machine learning advocated the use of hybrid models to assist with the limitations of the currently existing Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, but what was missing from most of them was the explanations and interpretations of the choices that were made to pick those exact architectures and the differentiation between good and bad hybrid architectures, this research attempts to tackle that gap in the literature by using the Regularized Evolution algorithm to search for the optimal hybrid classical-quantum architecture for the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, ultimately the classical models dominated the leaderboard with the best hybrid model coming in eleventh place among all unique models, while we also try to explain the factors that contributed to such results,and for some models to behave better than others in hope to grasp a better intuition about what we should consider good practices for designing an efficient hybrid architecture.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Running Time of Time-dependent Ant Colony Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) is a well-known method inspired by the foraging behavior of ants and is extensively used to solve combinatorial optimization problems. In this paper, we first consider a general framework based on the concept of a construction graph - a graph associated with an instance of the optimization problem under study, where feasible solutions are represented by walks. We analyze the running time of this ACO variant, known as the Graph-based Ant System with time-dependent evaporation rate (GBAS/tdev), and prove that the algorithm's solution converges to the optimal solution of the problem with probability 1 for a slightly stronger evaporation rate function than was previously known. We then consider two time-dependent adaptations of Attiratanasunthron and Fakcharoenphol's $n$-ANT algorithm: $n$-ANT with time-dependent evaporation rate ($n$-ANT/tdev) and $n$-ANT with time-dependent lower pheromone bound ($n$-ANT/tdlb). We analyze both variants on the single destination shortest path problem (SDSP). Our results show that $n$-ANT/tdev has a super-polynomial time lower bound on the SDSP. In contrast, we show that $n$-ANT/tdlb achieves a polynomial time upper bound on this problem.</description>

      <title>Modelling of automotive steel fatigue lifetime by machine learning method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the current study, the fatigue life of QSTE340TM steel was modelled using a machine learning method, namely, a neural network. This problem was solved by a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network with a 3-75-1 architecture, which allows the prediction of the crack length based on the number of load cycles N, the stress ratio R, and the overload ratio Rol. The proposed model showed high accuracy, with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) ranging from 0.02% to 4.59% for different R and Rol. The neural network effectively reveals the nonlinear relationships between input parameters and fatigue crack growth, providing reliable predictions for different loading conditions.</description>

      <title>Algorithm Selection with Probing Trajectories: Benchmarking the Choice of Classifier Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent approaches to training algorithm selectors in the black-box optimisation domain have advocated for the use of training data that is algorithm-centric in order to encapsulate information about how an algorithm performs on an instance, rather than relying on information derived from features of the instance itself. Probing-trajectories that consist of a sequence of objective performance per function evaluation obtained from a short run of an algorithm have recently shown particular promise in training accurate selectors. However, training models on this type of data requires an appropriately chosen classifier given the sequential nature of the data. There are currently no clear guidelines for choosing the most appropriate classifier for algorithm selection using time-series data from the plethora of models available. To address this, we conduct a large benchmark study using 17 different classifiers and three types of trajectory on a classification task using the BBOB benchmark suite using both leave-one-instance out and leave-one-problem out cross-validation. In contrast to previous studies using tabular data, we find that the choice of classifier has a significant impact, showing that feature-based and interval-based models are the best choices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrate-and-Fire (IF) is an idealized model of the spike-triggering mechanism of a biological neuron. It is used to realize the bio-inspired event-based principle of information processing in neuromorphic computing. We show that IF is closely related to the concept of Send-on-Delta (SOD) as used in threshold-based sampling. It turns out that the IF model can be adjusted in a way that SOD can be understood as differential version of IF. As a result, we gain insight into the underlying metric structure based on the Alexiewicz norm with consequences for clarifying the underlying signal space including bounded integrable signals with superpositions of finitely many Dirac impulses, the identification of a maximum sparsity property, error bounds for signal reconstruction and a characterization in terms of sparse regularization.</description>

      <title>Test-time regression: a unifying framework for designing sequence models with associative memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sequences provide a remarkably general way to represent and process information. This powerful abstraction has placed sequence modeling at the center of modern deep learning applications, inspiring numerous architectures from transformers to recurrent networks. While this fragmented development has yielded powerful models, it has left us without a unified framework to understand their fundamental similarities and explain their effectiveness. We present a unifying framework motivated by an empirical observation: effective sequence models must be able to perform associative recall. Our key insight is that memorizing input tokens through an associative memory is equivalent to performing regression at test-time. This regression-memory correspondence provides a framework for deriving sequence models that can perform associative recall, offering a systematic lens to understand seemingly ad-hoc architectural choices. We show numerous recent architectures -- including linear attention models, their gated variants, state-space models, online learners, and softmax attention -- emerge naturally as specific approaches to test-time regression. Each architecture corresponds to three design choices: the relative importance of each association, the regressor function class, and the optimization algorithm. This connection leads to new understanding: we provide theoretical justification for QKNorm in softmax attention, and we motivate higher-order generalizations of softmax attention. Beyond unification, our work unlocks decades of rich statistical tools that can guide future development of more powerful yet principled sequence models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00976v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we comprehensively study the inductive biases of two major approaches to augmenting Transformers with a recurrent mechanism: (1) the approach of incorporating a depth-wise recurrence similar to Universal Transformers; and (2) the approach of incorporating a chunk-wise temporal recurrence like Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Furthermore, we propose and investigate novel ways to extend and combine the above methods - for example, we propose a global mean-based dynamic halting mechanism for Universal Transformers and an augmentation of Temporal Latent Bottleneck with elements from Universal Transformer. We compare the models and probe their inductive biases in several diagnostic tasks, such as Long Range Arena (LRA), flip-flop language modeling, ListOps, and Logical Inference.

      <title>QF-tuner: Breaking Tradition in Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16562v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning algorithms refers to choosing the optimal parameters that may increase the algorithm's performance. Manual or random hyperparameter tuning methods can be problematic, as even slight variations in their values can result in significantly different outcomes in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a new method, QF-tuner, for automatic hyperparameter tuning in the Q-learning algorithm using the FOX optimization algorithm (FOX). A new objective function has been proposed for the FOX, prioritizing reward over learning error and time. QF-tuner starts by running the FOX and tries to minimize the fitness value derived from observations at each iteration by executing the Q-learning algorithm. The proposed method has been evaluated using two control tasks from the OpenAI Gym: CartPole and FrozenLake. The empirical results of the QF-tuner on the CartPole control task show a reward of 499, and on the FrozenLake control task, a reward of 1. These results indicate that the QF-tuner outperforms other optimization algorithms. On the FrozenLake control task, there was a 36\% increase in reward with a 26\% reduction in learning time; on the CartPole control task, there was a 57\% increase in reward with a 20\% decrease in learning time. Thus, the QF-tuner is an essential method for hyperparameter tuning in reinforcement learning algorithms, enabling more effective solutions to control task problems.</description>

      <title>UDC: A Unified Neural Divide-and-Conquer Framework for Large-Scale Combinatorial Optimization Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00312</link>

Abstract: Single-stage neural combinatorial optimization solvers have achieved near-optimal results on various small-scale combinatorial optimization (CO) problems without requiring expert knowledge. However, these solvers exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to large-scale CO problems. Recently, two-stage neural methods motivated by divide-and-conquer strategies have shown efficiency in addressing large-scale CO problems. Nevertheless, the performance of these methods highly relies on problem-specific heuristics in either the dividing or the conquering procedure, which limits their applicability to general CO problems. Moreover, these methods employ separate training schemes and ignore the interdependencies between the dividing and conquering strategies, often leading to sub-optimal solutions. To tackle these drawbacks, this article develops a unified neural divide-and-conquer framework (i.e., UDC) for solving general large-scale CO problems. UDC offers a Divide-Conquer-Reunion (DCR) training method to eliminate the negative impact of a sub-optimal dividing policy. Employing a high-efficiency Graph Neural Network (GNN) for global instance dividing and a fixed-length sub-path solver for conquering divided sub-problems, the proposed UDC framework demonstrates extensive applicability, achieving superior performance in 10 representative large-scale CO problems. The code is available at https://github.com/CIAM-Group/NCO_code/tree/main/single_objective/UDC-Large-scale-CO-master.</description>

      <title>Back to the Continuous Attractor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00109v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous attractors offer a unique class of solutions for storing continuous-valued variables in recurrent system states for indefinitely long time intervals. Unfortunately, continuous attractors suffer from severe structural instability in general--they are destroyed by most infinitesimal changes of the dynamical law that defines them. This fragility limits their utility especially in biological systems as their recurrent dynamics are subject to constant perturbations. We observe that the bifurcations from continuous attractors in theoretical neuroscience models display various structurally stable forms. Although their asymptotic behaviors to maintain memory are categorically distinct, their finite-time behaviors are similar. We build on the persistent manifold theory to explain the commonalities between bifurcations from and approximations of continuous attractors. Fast-slow decomposition analysis uncovers the persistent manifold that survives the seemingly destructive bifurcation. Moreover, recurrent neural networks trained on analog memory tasks display approximate continuous attractors with predicted slow manifold structures. Therefore, continuous attractors are functionally robust and remain useful as a universal analogy for understanding analog memory.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking a wide range of optimisers for solving the Fermi-Hubbard model using the variational quantum eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We numerically benchmark 30 optimisers on 372 instances of the variational quantum eigensolver for solving the Fermi-Hubbard system with the Hamiltonian variational ansatz. We rank the optimisers with respect to metrics such as final energy achieved and function calls needed to get within a certain tolerance level, and find that the best performing optimisers are variants of gradient descent such as Momentum and ADAM (using finite difference), SPSA, CMAES, and BayesMGD. We also perform gradient analysis and observe that the step size for finite difference has a very significant impact. We also consider using simultaneous perturbation (inspired by SPSA) as a gradient subroutine: here finite difference can lead to a more precise estimate of the ground state but uses more calls, whereas simultaneous perturbation can converge quicker but may be less precise in the later stages. Finally, we also study the quantum natural gradient algorithm: we implement this method for 1-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard systems, and find that whilst it can reach a lower energy with fewer iterations, this improvement is typically lost when taking total function calls into account. Our method involves performing careful hyperparameter sweeping on 4 instances. We present a variety of analysis and figures, detailed optimiser notes, and discuss future directions.</description>

      <title>What should a neuron aim for? Designing local objective functions based on information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02482v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.</description>
