      <title>New unlikely intersections on elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a Jacobian elliptic surface $E \to C$ with a section $P$ of infinite order. Previous work of the first author and Urz\'ua over the complex numbers gives a bound on the number of tangencies between $P$ and a torsion section of $E$ (an ``unlikely intersection''), and more precisely, an exact formula for the weighted number of tangencies between $P$ and elements of the ``Betti foliation''. This work used analytic techniques that apparently do not generalize to positive characteristic. In this paper, we extend their work to characteristic $p$, and we develop a second approach to tangency properties of algebraic curves on a complex elliptic surface, yielding a new family of unlikely intersections with a strong connection to a famous homomorphism of Manin. We also correct inaccuracies in the literature about this homomorphism.</description>

      <title>A version of Kapranov's Chow quotient and smooth moduli space of point configurations in $\PP^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new moduli space for configurations of $n$ ordered points in a projective plane, which is a version of Kapranov's "Chow quotient of Grassmanians" is introduced. The new construction is a Chow quotient as well but with additional lines connecting pairs of marked points (inspired by the idea of blow up). Both Kapranov's construction and the new construction provide an algebraic variety which is a compactification for the space of generic configurations of $n$ distinct points in projective plane. The difference is, that in Kapranov's construction, the space for configurations of 6 points in two-dimensional plane is not smooth; while with the new construction, the space for configuration of 6 points in plane is smooth.</description>

      <title>Relative mirror symmetry, theta functions and the Gamma conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a Fano variety, and $D\subset X$ be an snc anticanonical divisor. We study relative mirror symmetry for the log Calabi--Yau pair $(X,D)$. (1) We prove a relative mirror theorem for snc pairs without assuming the divisors are nef. (2) We study theta functions associated with the pair $(X,D)$. (3) We introduce functions on the mirror that are obtained from the higher-degree part of the big relative quantum cohomology. As an application, we use these new ingredients in relative mirror symmetry to prove a version of the mirror symmetric Gamma conjecture for $X$ for $\mathcal O_X$ and $\mathcal O_{\operatorname{pt}}$ in this setting, where the Landau--Ginzburg potential is defined as a sum of theta functions.</description>

      <title>Stability conditions on surfaces and contractions of curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Bridgeland stability conditions on smooth surfaces arising from birational morphisms $S \to T$ to a singular surface. Assuming that $T$ has only ADE singularities or certain cyclic quotient singularities, we produce pre-stability conditions on $S$ whose central charges depend on the pullback of an ample divisor on $T$. Moreover, we prove the support property for the cyclic quotient case (including the $A_n$ singularities). These stability conditions arise as limits of the Arcara-Bertram stability conditions on $S$.
  In a complementary direction, we study birational maps $S \to T$ for which a stability condition $S$ can be obtained using the pullback of an ample class on $T$. We prove that the morphism cannot contract smooth curves of positive genus.</description>

      <title>Descent problem for certificate of non-negativity on semi-algebraic sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a subfield of $\mathbb R$ and let $K$ be a basic closed semi-algebraic set in $\mathbb R$ with $\partial K\subset F$. Let $\mathcal N$ be the natural choice of generators of $K$. We show that if $f\in F[x]$ is $\geq 0$ on $K$, then $f$ can be written as $$f=\sum_{e\in\{0,1\}^s } a_e\sigma_e g^e $$ where $a_e\in F_{\geq 0}$, $\sigma_e\in \sum F[x]^2$ and $g^{e}=g_1^{e_1} \cdots g_s^{e_s}$. In other words, the preordering $T_{\mathcal N}$ of $F[x]$ is saturated. In case $F=\mathbb R$, this result is due to Kuhlmann and Marshall. As an application, we prove that if $K$ is compact, then $M_{\mathcal N}=T_{\mathcal N}=Pos(K)$. In other words, the quadratic module $M_{\mathcal N}$ of $F[x]$ is saturated.</description>

      <title>Hermitian K-theory of Lagrangian Grassmannians via reducible Gorenstein models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of moduli spaces, called generalized Lagrangian flag schemes, that are reducible Gorenstein (hence singular), and that admit well-behaved pushforward and pullback operations in Hermitian $K$-theory. These schemes arise naturally in our computations. Using them, we prove that the Hermitian $K$-theory of a Lagrangian Grassmannian over a regular base splits as a direct sum of copies of the base's (Hermitian) $K$-theory, indexed by certain shifted Young diagrams. The isomorphism is realized via pullback to each generalized Lagrangian flag scheme followed by pushforward to the Lagrangian Grassmannian. This yields an unusual example in which both the base and the target are regular schemes, while the intermediate reducible Gorenstein models remain sufficient to allow explicit computations in Hermitian K-theory of regular schemes.</description>

      <title>Holomorphic field theories and higher algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aimed at complex geometers and representation theorists, this survey explores higher dimensional analogues of the rich interplay between Riemann surfaces, Virasoro and Kac-Moody Lie algebras, and conformal blocks. We introduce a panoply of examples from physics -- field theories that are holomorphic in nature, such as holomorphic Chern-Simons theory -- and interpret them as (derived) moduli spaces in complex geometry; no comfort with physics is presumed. We then describe frameworks for quantizing such moduli spaces, offering a systematic generalization of vertex algebras and conformal blocks via factorization algebras, and we explain how holomorphic field theories generate examples of these higher algebraic structures. We finish by describing how the conjecture of Seiberg duality predicts a surprising relationship between holomorphic gauge theories on algebraic surfaces and how it suggests analogues of the Hori-Tong dualities already studied by algebraic geometers.</description>

      <title>Remarks on GW/PT under del Pezzo transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A projective threefold transition $Y \xrightarrow{\phi} \bar{Y} \rightsquigarrow X$ is del Pezzo if $\phi$ contracts a smooth del Pezzo surface to a point. We show that the GW/PT correspondence holds on $Y$ implies that it holds on $X$. In particular, a hypersurface of degree $6$ in $\mathbb{P} (3, 2, 1, 1, 1)$ gives a new example to the correspondence. The main tools are (i) the double point degeneration constructed in arXiv:2508.01374 and (ii) deformations of del Pezzo surfaces into toric surfaces (Proposition 3.12). Applications of the degeneration formulas in GW and PT then reduce the problem to known cases.</description>

      <title>Wall-crossing formulas via spectral networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a self-contained proof of the Kontsevich-Soibelman wall-crossing formula entirely in the scope of quadratic differentials without relying on input from DT theory. Our approach is based on path-lifting rules for spectral networks introduced by Gaiotto, Moore and Neitzke. We provide a framework to justify the convergence of the path liftings, including the cases with spiral domains. In particular, we define path lifting rules for spectral networks associated to holomorphic quadratic differentials. As an intermediate step in the proof of the wall-crossing formula, we show that upon extending the path lifting rules to $\mathcal{A}_0$-laminations we generate the hat-homology lattice.</description>

Abstract: An additive action on an algebraic variety is an effective action of the vector group with an open orbit. We describe projective surfaces with du Val singularities that admit an additive action with a finite number of orbits. In particular, we provide examples of projective surfaces with 1-parameter families of pairwise non-isomorphic additive actions, which answers the question by Hassett and Tschinkel.</description>

      <title>Linearization of finite subgroups of Cremona groups over non-closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study linearizability properties of finite subgroups of the Cremona group ${\mathrm{Cr}}_n(k)$ in the case where $k$ is a global field, with the focus on the local-global principle. For every global field $k$ of characteristic different from 2 and every $n \ge 3$ we give an example of a birational involution of $\mathbb P^n_k$ (=an element $g$ of order $2$ in ${\mathrm{Cr}}_n(k)$) such that $g$ is not $k$-linearizable but $g$ is $k_v$-linearizable in ${\mathrm{Cr}}_n(k_v)$ for all places $v$ of $k$. The main tool is a new birational invariant generalizing those introduced by Manin and Voskresenski\u\i\ in the arithmetic case and by Bogomolov--Prokhorov in the geometric case. We also apply it to the study of birational involutions in real plane.</description>

      <title>Envelopes and evolutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of evolutes of plane curves goes back at least to Huygens, and was continued and extended to space curves by Monge, Darboux, and others. Salmon studied projective curves and surfaces and their evolutes and gave many enumerative formulas for their degrees and number of singularities.
  We define envelopes of families of linear spaces in projective space. In order to define evolutes we impose a notion of perpendicularity, which allows us to consider the normal spaces to a projective variety. The evolute of a projective hypersurface is the envelope of the family of normal spaces. For a variety of dimension $r$ in $n$-space, the evolute is defined as the $(n-r)$th iterated cuspidal locus of the map from the total space of the normal spaces to projective space. Thus the envelope can be interpreted as a $(n-r)$th order Thom-Boardman singularity. Further higher order Thom-Boardman singularities correspond, for a curve in the plane or in 3-space, to classical objects like the vertices of the curve; for a surface in 3-space, they give the cuspidal curve - and its cusps - on the evolute. Using known formulas for Thom polynomials we are able to verify and generalize many of Salmon's formulas and find new ones.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Quot spaces, boundedness, and K-tropicalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Logarithmic Hilbert and Quot spaces are generalizations of their traditional versions adapted to study pairs and degenerations. The logarithmic Quot spaces of $(X,D)$ parameterize "algebraically transverse" (logarithmically flat) quotient sheaves on degenerations of $X$. We prove boundedness and deduce properness of logarithmic Quot spaces. The results complete the basic foundations of logarithmic Quot spaces and specialize to work of Li-Wu and Maulik and the second author in special cases. Boundedness relies on two results of independent interest. First, we show that for a simple normal crossing pair $(X, D)$ and a subscheme $Z$, there is a smallest logarithmic space ${X}^\flat$ modifying $X$ such that the strict transform of $Z$ is algebraically transverse. Precisely, given $Z$ in $X$, there is a canonical logarithmic space $X^\flat$ over $X$ with the following universal property - an snc logarithmic blowup $X'\to X$ makes the strict transform of $Z$ algebraically transverse if and only if $X'$ is a modification of $X^\flat$. Parallel results hold for arbitrary coherent sheaves. This proves boundedness for logarithmic quotients with fixed tropicalization. A logarithmic quotient sheaf defines a K-tropicalization, an enhancement of tropicalization that is sensitive to scheme structures. The K-tropicalization has the same relationship to K-theory as traditional tropicalization has to Chow, and is related to Gr\"obner theory and convex geometry via state and secondary polytopes. Using the K-theory of toric bundles, we derive a balancing condition for K-tropicalizations that imposes strong finiteness properties. The second key result is that K-tropicalizations with fixed numerics are parametrized by a finite-dimensional polyhedral complex.</description>

      <title>Tropical fans supporting a reduced 0-dimensional complete intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An affine tropical fan is called regular if it supports a reduced 0-dimensional complete intersection. For some cases the classification of regular fans is already complete. It was proved by Fink that tropical varieties of degree 1 are exactly Bergman fans, and later Esterov and Gusev classified all lattice polytopes whose mixed volume equals 1. We introduce the notion of a gallery for tropical fans and use it to classify all one-dimensional regular fans, thereby obtaining a minimal model programme for such fans. In dimension 2 we prove a finiteness theorem: every regular fan that satisfies the given upper bound condition is precisely the support of a finite covering by two-dimensional galleries, and only finitely many such fans exist.</description>

      <title>A decomposition of graph a-numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.06855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $a$-sequence $(a_0(G), a_1(G), \cdots)$ of a finite simple graph $G$, defined recursively through a combinatorial rule and known to coincide with the sequence of rational Betti numbers of the real toric variety associated with $G$.
  In this paper, we establish a combinatorial and topological decomposition formula for the $a$-sequence. As an application, we show that the $a$-sequence is monotone under graph inclusion; that is, $a_i(G) \geq a_i(H)$ for all $i \geq 0$ whenever $H$ is a subgraph of $G$. We also prove that the $a$-sequence is unimodal in $i$ for a broad class of graphs $G$, including those with a Hamiltonian circuit or a universal vertex. These results provide a new class of topological spaces whose Betti number sequences are unimodal but not necessarily log concave, contributing to the study of real loci in algebraic geometry.</description>

Abstract: We derive an exact residue formula for the elliptic genera of 2d $\mathcal{N}=(0,1)$ gauge theories. We find a new residue prescription which recovers the Jeffery-Kirwan residue prescription for $\mathcal{N}=(0,2)$ theories. We apply the formula to the Gukov-Pei-Putrov model and analyze the phase structure of the theory.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathbb{P}^{1}_{an}$ be the Berkovich projective line over a complete, algebraically closed, non-Archimedean field of characteristic $0$. Let $\phi$ be a degree $\geq 2$ rational map with potential good reduction, acting on $\mathbb{P}^{1}_{an}$. In this article, we give an easily verifiable equivalent criterion for the fixed point locus of $\phi$ to be connected. We also give an equivalent criterion for the fixed point locus of $\phi$ to be finite. Moreover, we provide a sharp upper bound for the number of connected components of the fixed point locus of a rational map with potential good reduction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce the concept of momentumly closed forms. A nondegenerate momentumly closed two-form defines a moment map that generalizes the classical notion associated with symplectic forms. We then develop an extended theory of moment maps within this broader framework. More specifically, we establish the convexity property of the generalized moment map, construct the corresponding reduction space, and analyze the Kirwan-Ness stratification. Additionally, we prove a variant of the Darboux-Weinstein theorem for momentumly closed two-forms.</description>

      <title>On classification of rank two theories with eight supercharges Part III: Seiberg-Witten geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Seiberg-Witten (SW) geometries for rank-two theories, encompassing 4D field theories as well as 5D and 6D Kaluza-Klein (KK) theories. The singular model for each SW geometry is derived from a one-parameter family of algebraic curves $y^2 = f(x,t)$, where $t$ parametrizes one dimension of Coulomb branch moduli space. The functional form of $f(x,t)$ is systematically determined through analysis of singular fibers at $t=\infty$. Two powerful computational methods enable this determination: a): Liu's algorithm for determining singular fibers from local equation; b): The canonical resolution method for fiber degeneration. Our construction provides not only a complete description of known solutions but also establishes a robust framework for generating new theories. This methodology proves particularly valuable for the systematic exploration of 5D and 6D theories.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the specialization map in Scholzes theory of diamonds. We consider v-sheaves that behave like formal schemes and call them kimberlites. We attach to them: a reduced special fiber, an analytic locus, a specialization map, a Zariski site, and an etale site. When the kimberlite comes from a formal scheme, our sites recover the classical ones. We prove that unramified p-adic Beilinson--Drinfeld Grassmannians are kimberlites with finiteness and normality properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.03579v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study topological properties of moduli spaces of p-adic shtukas and local Shimura varieties. On one hand, we construct and study the specialization map for moduli spaces of p-adic shtukas at parahoric level whose target is an affine Deligne-Lusztig variety. On the other hand, given a p-adic shtuka datum $(G, b, \mu)$, with $G$ unramified over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ and such that $(b, \mu)$ is HN-irreducible, we determine the set of geometric connected components of infinite level moduli spaces of p-adic shtukas. In other words, we understand $\pi_0(\mathrm{Sht}_{(G,b,\mu,\infty)} \times \mathrm{Spd} \mathbb{C}_p)$ with its right $G(\mathbb{Q}_p) \times G_b (\mathbb{Q}p ) \times W_E$ -action. As a corollary, we prove new cases of a conjecture of Rapoport and Viehmann.</description>

Abstract: We show that the v-sheaf local models of moduli spaces of $p$-adic shtukas are unibranch. In particular, this proves that the scheme-theoretic local models defined in our joint work with Ansch\"{u}tz and Richarz are always normal with reduced special fiber, thereby establishing the remaining cases of the geometric part of the Scholze$-$Weinstein conjecture when $p \leq 3$. Our methods are general, topological, and simplify Zhu's proof of the coherence conjecture. As a technical input, we generalize a comparison theorem of nearby cycles of Huber to the v-sheaf setup.</description>

      <title>Refinement of the Infinitesimal Variation of Hodge Structure: the case of canonical curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11442v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth complex projective curve with canonical divisor $K_C$ very ample. We explore the relation between the cup-product $$ H^1 (\Theta_C ) \longrightarrow (H^0({\cal O}_C (K_C))^{\ast} \otimes H^1 ({\cal O}_C) $$ where $\Theta_C ={\cal O}_C (-K_C)$ is the holomorphic tangent bundle of $C$, and the geometry of the canonical embedding of $C$. The cup-product, following Griffiths, stratifies ${\mathbb P}(H^1 (\Theta_C ))$ by the subvarieties $\Sigma_r$, according to the rank $r$ of $\xi \in H^1 (\Theta_C )$ viewed as the linear map $$ \xi:H^0({\cal O}_C (K_C)) \longrightarrow H^1 ({\cal O}_C) $$ or, equivalently, by the dimension of the kernel of $\xi$ $$ W_{\xi}=ker(\xi). $$ The refinement consists of the filtration of $W^{\bullet}_{\xi} ([\phi])$ of $W_{\xi}$, varying with $[\phi] \in {\mathbb P}(W_{\xi})$. This filtration has geometric meaning:
  1) it is related to special divisors on $C$,
  2) it `counts' certain rational normal curves in the canonical embedding of $C$.
  As an illustration, the results about the strata $\Sigma_0$ and $\Sigma_1$ are recovered and as corollaries one obtains the classical theorems of Max Noether on projective normality of the canonical embedding and Babbage-Enriques-Petri about the canonical curve being cut out by quadrics.
  The refinement brings out new aspects: quiver representations, Fano toric varieties with a distinguished anti-canonical divisor, dimer models. The quiver emerges from the construction and properties of the refinement; the Fano variety arises from the graph underlying the quiver and related to the Higgs structures. The graph underlying the refinement becomes an important part of the theory: it connects to topics such as the Topological Quantum field theory, moduli of elliptic curves with marked points, modular curves, higher categorical structures.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of surjective endomorphisms of projective bundles on elliptic curves and relate their dynamical properties to the geometry of the bundle. As an application we prove the Kawaguchi--Silverman conjecture for projective bundles on elliptic curves, thereby completing the conjecture for all projective bundles on curves. Our approach is to use the transition functions of the bundles. This allows us to further prove the conjecture for projective split bundles on a smooth projective variety with finitely generated Mori cone.</description>

Abstract: We answer a question posed independently by Fels-Huckleberry-Wolf and Looijenga concerning the geometric meaning of small deformations of twistor cycles in the K3 period domain. These are shown to induce complex-hyperk\"ahler metrics on members of the families via Penrose's Non-linear Graviton construction. On the way to proving this result, we construct a Hausdorff fine moduli space for families of marked K3 surfaces over smooth rational curves in the K3 period domain. Over an open subset containing all twistor cycles we construct a family of such families, which is a universal small deformation for every twistor family. Whenever possible, we extend the results to higher-dimensional irreducible holomorphic-symplectic manifolds.</description>

Abstract: For a tropical prevariety $V\subset \RR^n$ (being a finite union of rational polyhedra) we define a tropical Hilbert function $TH_V(k)$ to be the maximal number of tropically independent on $V$ among tropical monomials with degrees at most $k$. In case $\dim V=1$ we define the tropical degree as $$degT (V):=\lim_{k\to \infty} \frac{TH_V(k)}{k}$$ \noindent and prove existence of the limit. We calculate explicitly (a modification of) the tropical degree of $V$ when $V=\cup_l V_l$ is a star, i.e. the union of rays $V_l$ with a common apex.</description>

Abstract: Using Hilbert-Burch matrices, we give an explicit description of the Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cells on the Hilbert scheme of points on $\mathbb A ^2$ with isolated fixed points. If the fixed point locus is positive dimensional we obtain an \'etale rational map to the cell. We prove Conjecture 4.2 from arXiv:2309.06871 which we realize as a special case of our construction. We also show examples when the construction provides a rational \'etale map to the Hilbert scheme which is not contained in any Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cell. Finally, we give an explicit description of the formal deformations of any ideal in the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane.</description>

      <title>Lefschetz principle-type theorems for curves semistable Higgs sheaves and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00439v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I prove ``Lefschetz principle''-type theorems for semistable and curve semistable Higgs sheaves on smooth projective varieties defined over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. These theorems are applied to reduce a conjecture about curve semistable Higgs bundles from the previous general setting to the complex case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct pathological examples of MMP singularities in every positive characteristic using quotients by $\alpha_p$-actions. In particular, we obtain non-$S_3$ terminal singularities, as well as locally stable (respectively stable) families whose general fibers are smooth (respectively klt, Cohen--Macaulay and $F$-injective) and whose special fibers are non-$S_2$. The dimensions of these examples are bounded below by a linear function of the characteristic.</description>

      <title>On the classification of centralizers of ODOs: An effective differential algebra approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correspondence between commutative rings of ordinary differential operators and algebraic curves has been extensively and deeply studied since the seminal works of Burchnall-Chaundy in 1923. This paper is an overview of recent developments to make this correspondence computationally effective, by means of differential algebra and symbolic computation.
  The centralizer of an ordinary differential operator $L$ is a maximal commutative ring, the affine ring of a spectral curve $\Gamma$. The defining ideal of $\Gamma$ is described, assuming that a finite set of generators of the centralizer is known. In addition, the factorization problem of $L-\lambda$ over a new coefficient field, defined by the coefficient field of $L$ and $\Gamma$, allows the computation of spectral sheaves on $\Gamma$. The ultimate goal is to develop Picard-Vessiot theory for spectral problems $L(y)=\lambda y$, for a generic $\lambda$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize intermediate $\mathbb{R}$-algebras $A$ between the ring of semialgebraic functions ${\mathcal S}(X)$ and the ring ${\mathcal S}^*(X)$ of bounded semialgebraic functions on a semialgebraic set $X$ as rings of fractions of ${\mathcal S}(X)$. This allows us to compute the Krull dimension of $A$, the transcendence degree over $\mathbb{R}$ of the residue fields of $A$ and to obtain a \L ojasiewicz inequality and a Nullstellensatz for archimedean $\mathbb{R}$-algebras $A$. In addition we study intermediate $\mathbb{R}$-algebras generated by proper ideals and we prove an extension theorem for functions in such $\mathbb{R}$-algebras.</description>

Abstract: We study homotopy properties of regular mappings from spheres into a real retract rational variety $Y$. We show that the homotopy classes which are represented by such mappings form subgroups of the homotopy groups of $Y$, and that the groups are independent of the choice of the basepoint on $Y$ as long as $Y$ is connected. We also construct regular representatives of all the Whitehead products in all the homotopy groups of $Y$.</description>

      <title>Rational curves and the Hilbert Property on Jacobian Kummer varieties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2205.04364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A conjecture by Corvaja and Zannier predicts that smooth, projective, simply connected varieties over a number field with Zariski dense set of rational points have the Hilbert Property; this was proved by Demeio for Kummer surfaces which are associated to products of two elliptic curves.
  In this article, over a finitely generated field of characteristic zero, we establish the Hilbert Property for all Kummer surfaces associated to the Jacobian of a genus $2$ curve. In general we prove that all Jacobian Kummer varieties associated to a hyperelliptic curve of genus $\geq 2$ of odd degree also have the Hilbert Property.</description>

      <title>Lattices in $\mathbb F_q[[T]]^d$ and spiral shifting operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.10215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the algebra and combinatorics of an analogue of the Hermite normal form that classifies finite-index submodules of $\mathbb F_q[[T]]^d$. We identity both normal forms as instances of Gr\"obner basis theory under different monomial orders, where the Hermite normal form corresponds to the lex order, and the new normal form the hlex order. We note that the hlex normal form recovers the Smith normal form, a feature not enjoyed by the Hermite normal form. We also identify the combinatorial structure underlying the cell decomposition induced by the hlex normal form, which appears to be of independent interest. Notably, the statistics tracking the cell dimensions is compatible, in a certain way, with a collection of $d$ ``spiral shifting operators'' on $\mathbb N^d$, which pairwise commute and collectively act freely and transitively. Using these operators, we give direct proofs of some new combinatorial identities obtained by translating the results of Solomon and Petrogradsky in terms of the hlex normal form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06506v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the matrix-resolvent method and a formula of the second-named author on the $n$-point function for a KP tau-function, we show that the tau-function of an arbitrary solution to the Toda lattice hierarchy is a KP tau-function. We then generalize this result to tau-functions for the extended Toda hierarchy (ETH) by developing the matrix-resolvent method for the ETH. As an example the partition function of Gromov-Witten invariants of the complex projective line is a KP tau-function, and an application on irreducible representations of the symmetric group is obtained.</description>

      <title>Modular Symbols with Values in Beilinson-Kato Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For each integer $n\geq 1$, we construct a $\operatorname{GL}_n(\mathbb Q)$-invariant modular symbol $\bm\xi_n$ with coefficients in a space of distributions that takes values in the Milnor $K_n$-group of the modular function field.
  The Siegel distribution $\bm\mu$ on $\mathbb Q^2$, with values in the modular function field, serves as the building block for $\bm\xi_n$; we define $\bm\xi_n$ essentially by taking the $n$-Steinberg product of $\bm\mu$.
  The most non-trivial part of this construction is the cocycle property of $\bm\xi_n$; we prove it by using an induction on $n$ based on the first two cases $\bm\xi_1$ and $\bm\xi_2$; the first case is trivial, and the second case essentially follows from the fact that Beilinson-Kato elements in the Milnor $K_2$-group modulo torsion satisfy the Manin relations.</description>

      <title>On the $PGL_2(q)$-orbits of lines of $PG(3,q)$ and binary quartic forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07118v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of classifying the lines of the projective $3$-space $PG(3,q)$ over a finite field $GF(q)$ into orbits of the group $G=PGL(2,q)$ of linear symmetries of the twisted cubic $C$. A generic line neither intersects $C$ nor lies in any of its osculating planes. While the non-generic lines have been classified into $G$-orbits in literature, it has been an open problem to classify the generic lines into $G$-orbits. For a general field $F$ of characteristic different from $2$ and $3$, the twisted cubic determines a symplectic polarity on $\mathbb P^3$. In the Klein representation of lines of $\mathbb P^3$, the tangent lines of $C$ are represented by a degree $4$ rational normal curve in a hyperplane $\mathcal H$ of the second exterior power $\mathbb P^5$ of $\mathbb P^3$. Atiyah studied the lines of $\mathbb P^3$ with respect to $C$, in terms of the geometries of these two curves. Polar duality of lines on $\mathbb P^3$ corresponds to Hodge duality on $\mathbb P^5$, and $\mathcal H$ is the hyperplane of Hodge self-dual elements of $\mathbb P^5$. We show that $\mathcal H$ can be identified in a $PGL_2$-equivariant way with the space of binary quartic forms over $F$, and that pairs of polar dual lines of $\mathbb P^3$ correspond to binary quartic forms whose apolar invariant is a square. We first solve the open problem of classifying binary quartic forms over $GF(q)$ into $G$-orbits, and then use it to solve the main problem.</description>

      <title>Generic character sheaves on parahoric subgroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parabolic induction producing $\ell$-adic sheaves on a parahoric subgroup scheme in the loop group of a reductive group. Under a genericity assumption on the input data, we prove that it produces conjugation equivariant perverse sheaves on the parahoric subgroup; this is upgraded to a $t$-exact equivalence of categories of $\ell$-adic sheaves. An iterative version of the construction produces such a perverse sheaf starting from a geometric analogue of the data considered by J.-K. Yu and J. Kim. We prove, under a mild condition on $q$, that generic parabolic induction from a parahoric torus realizes the character of the representation arising from the associated parahoric Deligne--Lusztig induction, which is known to parametrize the Fintzen--Kaletha--Spice twist of types. In the simplest interesting setting, our construction produces a simple perverse sheaf associated to a sufficiently nontrivial multiplicative local system on a torus, resolving a conjecture of Lusztig.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the rational Betti numbers of real toric manifolds associated with chordal nestohedra. We consider the poset topology of a specific poset induced from a chordal building set, and show its EL-shellability. Based on this, we present an explicit description using alternating $\mathcal{B}$-permutations for a chordal building set $\mathcal{B}$, transforming the computing Betti numbers into a counting problem. This approach allows us to compute the $a$-number of a finite simple graph through permutation counting when the graph is chordal. In addition, we provide detailed computations for specific cases such as real Hochschild varieties corresponding to Hochschild polytopes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe and prove correctness of two practical algorithms for finding indecomposable summands of finitely generated modules over a finitely generated k-algebra R. The first algorithm applies in the (multi)graded case, which enables the computation of indecomposable summands of coherent sheaves on subvarieties of toric varieties (in particular, for varieties embedded in projective space); the second algorithm applies when R is local and k is a finite field, opening the door to computing decompositions in singularity theory. We also present multiple examples, including some which present previously unknown phenomena regarding the behavior of summands of Frobenius pushforwards (including in the non-graded case) and syzygies over Artinian rings.</description>

      <title>Hasse norm principle for metacyclic extensions with trivial Schur multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14365v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a global field, $K/k$ be a finite separable field extension and $L/k$ be the Galois closure of $K/k$ with Galois groups $G={\rm Gal}(L/k)$ and $H={\rm Gal}(L/K)\lneq G$. In 1931, Hasse proved that if $G$ is cyclic, then the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. We show that if $G$ is metacyclic with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$, then $H$ is cyclic and the Hasse norm principle holds for $K/k$. Some examples of metacyclic, dihedral, quasidihedral, modular, generalized quoternion, extraspecial groups and $Z$-groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$ are given. As a consequence, we get the Tamagawa number $\tau(T)=|G^{ab}|/|H|$ of the norm one tori $T=R^{(1)}_{K/k}(\mathbb{G}_m)$ of $K/k$ via Ono's formula $\tau(T)=|H^1(k,\widehat{T})|/|Sha(T)|$ where $G^{ab}$ is the abelianization of $G$, $\widehat{T}={\rm Hom}(T,\mathbb{G}_m)$ is the character module of $T$ and $Sha(T)$ is the Shafarevich-Tate group of $T$. As an appendix of this paper, we also give some examples of finite simple groups $G$ with trivial Schur multiplier $M(G)=0$. This provides examples which the Hasse norm principle holds for Galois extensions $K/k$ with $G={\rm Gal}(K/k)$ by Tate's theorem.</description>

Abstract: We define and study higher analogues of Rankin--Selberg integrals for GL_n*GL_n-1 over function fields and relate the integral values to higher derivatives of unramified Rankin--Selberg L-functions. Our method reveals some relation between special cycle classes on Shtukas and the geometric conjectures of Ben-Zvi--Sakellaridis--Venkatesh. It can be regarded as a first step towards a generalization of the higher Gross--Zagier formula of Yun--Zhang for higher-dimensional spherical varieties.</description>

      <title>Support bound for differential elimination in polynomial dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study an important special case of the differential elimination problem: given a polynomial parametric dynamical system $\mathbf{x}' = \mathbf{g}(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \mathbf{x})$ and a polynomial observation function $y = f(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \mathbf{x})$, find the minimal differential equation satisfied by $y$. In our previous work, for the case $y = x_1$, we established a bound on the support of such a differential equation for the non-parametric case and shown that it can be turned into an algorithm via the evaluation-interpolation approach. The main contribution of the present paper is a generalization of the aforementioned result in two directions: to allow any polynomial function $y = f(\mathbf{x})$, not just a single coordinate, and to allow $\mathbf{g}$ and $f$ depend on unknown symbolic parameters. We conduct computation experiments to evaluate the accuracy of our new bound and show that the approach allows to perform elimination for some cases out of reach for the state of the art software.</description>

Abstract: We classify the dualizable localizing ideals of rigidly-compactly generated tt-$\infty$-categories that are cohomologically stratified. By definition, these are the localizing ideals that are dualizable with respect to the Lurie tensor product. We prove that these ideals correspond to the convex subsets of the Balmer spectrum. More generally, we establish this classification for categories which are locally cohomologically stratified and whose Balmer spectrum is noetherian. The classification thus applies to many categories arising in algebra and topology, including derived categories of noetherian schemes. Our result generalizes, and is motivated by, a recent theorem of Efimov which establishes this classification for derived categories of commutative noetherian rings.</description>

      <title>Sandwiched singularities and nearly Lefschetz fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21293</link>

Abstract: We study Milnor fibers and symplectic fillings of links of sandwiched singularities, with the goal of contrasting their algebro-geometric deformation theory and symplectic topology. In the algebro-geometric setting, smoothings of sandwiched singularities are described by de Jong--van Straten's theory: all Milnor fibers are generated from deformations of a singular plane curve germ associated to the surface singularity. We develop an analog of this theory in the symplectic setting, showing that all minimal symplectic fillings of the links are generated by certain immersed disk arrangements resembling de Jong--van Straten's picture deformations. This paper continues our previous work for a special subclass of singularities; the general case has additional difficulties and new features. The key new ingredient in the present paper is given by spinal open books and nearly Lefschetz fibrations: we use recent work of Roy--Min--Wang to understand symplectic fillings and encode them via multisections of certain Lefschetz fibrations. As an application, we discuss arrangements that generate unexpected Stein fillings that are different from all Milnor fibers, showing that the links of a large class of sandwiched singularities admit unexpected fillings.</description>
