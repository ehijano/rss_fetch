Abstract: Flow Gym is a toolkit for research and deployment of flow-field quantification methods inspired by OpenAI Gym and Stable-Baselines3. It uses SynthPix as synthetic image generation engine and provides a unified interface for the testing, deployment and training of (learning-based) algorithms for flow-field quantification from a number of consecutive images of tracer particles. It also contains a growing number of integrations of existing algorithms and stable (re-)implementations in JAX.</description>

      <title>Forecasting N-Body Dynamics: A Comparative Study of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations and Universal Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The n body problem, fundamental to astrophysics, simulates the motion of n bodies acting under the effect of their own mutual gravitational interactions. Traditional machine learning models that are used for predicting and forecasting trajectories are often data intensive black box models, which ignore the physical laws, thereby lacking interpretability. Whereas Scientific Machine Learning ( Scientific ML ) directly embeds the known physical laws into the machine learning framework. Through robust modelling in the Julia programming language, our method uses the Scientific ML frameworks: Neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) and Universal differential equations (UDEs) to predict and forecast the system dynamics. In addition, an essential component of our analysis involves determining the forecasting breakdown point, which is the smallest possible amount of training data our models need to predict future, unseen data accurately. We employ synthetically created noisy data to simulate real-world observational limitations. Our findings indicate that the UDE model is much more data efficient, needing only 20% of data for a correct forecast, whereas the Neural ODE requires 90%.</description>

      <title>Ab initio Approach to Collective Excitations in Excitonic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An ab initio approach is presented for studying the collective excitations in excitonic insulators, charge/spin density waves and superconductors. We derive the Bethe-Salpeter-Equation for the particle-hole excitations in the quasiparticle representation, from which the collective excited states are solved and the corresponding order parameter fluctuations are computed. This method is demonstrated numerically for the excitonic insulating phases of the biased WSe2-MoSe2 bilayer. It reveals the gapless phase-mode, the subgap Bardasis-Schrieffer modes and the above-gap scattering states. Our work paves the way for quantitative predictions of excited state phenomena from first-principles calculations in electronic systems with spontaneous symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Velocity dip in turbulent mixed convection of an open Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of a velocity-dip phenomenon in turbulent mixed convection in open Poiseuille-Rayleigh-B\'enard (PRB) channels with a free-slip upper boundary. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulations (DNS) are performed for Rayleigh numbers in the range $10^5 \leq Ra \leq 10^8$, at a fixed Prandtl number $Pr = 0.71$ and a bulk Reynolds number $Re_b = 2850$. In the shear-dominated regime, the flow is characterised by small-scale structures such as near-wall streaks. As buoyancy becomes comparable to shear, streamwise-oriented large-scale rolls emerge and span the full channel height. At higher Rayleigh numbers, buoyancy dominates and the rolls fragment, giving rise to a convection-cell-dominated regime. Short-time-averaged flow fields show that streamwise rolls transport low-speed fluid from the bottom wall towards the upper boundary, forming laterally extended low-speed regions, while roll fragmentation induces upstream low-speed regions near the upper boundary. Both mechanisms locally reduce the near-surface mean velocity, leading to a velocity dip in which the maximum mean streamwise velocity is located below the upper boundary. Consistent with the mean momentum budget, the near-surface region exhibits a large-scale Reynolds shear stress that exceeds the local total shear stress, implying a negative viscous contribution and a reversal of the mean velocity gradient. To model this behaviour, we propose a model based on a balance between buoyancy and shear production with dissipation, incorporating a linear wall-normal profile for the Reynolds shear stress, a wall-normal-independent buoyancy-production term, and a decomposition of the dissipation into shear-induced and buoyancy-induced contributions. Our model accurately reproduces the DNS mean velocity profiles across the explored $Ra$ range.</description>

      <title>Formal O(N3) scaling GW calculations by block tensor decomposition for large molecule systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of many-body perturbation theory based on Green's functions, the $GW$ approximation has emerged as a pivotal method for computing quasiparticle energies and excitation spectra. However, its high computational cost and steep scaling present significant challenges for applications to large molecular systems. In this work, we extend the block tensor decomposition (BTD) algorithm, recently developed in our previous work [J. Chem. Phys. 163, 174109 (2025)] for low-rank tensor compression, to enable a formally $O(N^3)$-scaling $GW$ algorithm. By integrating BTD with an imaginary-time $GW$ formalism and introducing a real space screening strategy for the polarizability, we achieve an observed scaling of approximately $O(N^2)$ in test systems. Key parameters of the algorithm are optimized on the S66 dataset using the JADE algorithm, ensuring a balanced compromise between accuracy and efficiency. Our BTD-based random phase approximation also exhibits $O(N^2)$ scaling, and eigenvalue-self-consistent $GW$ calculations become feasible for systems with over 3000 basis functions. This work establishes BTD as an efficient and scalable approach for large-scale $GW$ calculations in molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Homotopy Algorithm for Solving Nonlinear PDEs and Flow Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum algorithms to integrate nonlinear PDEs governing flow problems are challenging to discover but critical to enhancing the practical usefulness of quantum computing. We present here a near-optimal, robust, and end-to-end quantum algorithm to solve time-dependent, dissipative, and nonlinear PDEs. We embed the PDEs in a truncated, high dimensional linear space on the basis of quantum homotopy analysis. The linearized system is discretized and integrated using finite-difference methods that use a compact quantum algorithm. The present approach can adapt its input to the nature of nonlinearity and underlying physics. The complexity estimates improve existing approaches in terms of scaling of matrix operator norms, condition number, simulation time, and accuracy. We provide a general embedding strategy, bounds on stability criteria, accuracy, gate counts and query complexity. A physically motivated measure of nonlinearity is connected to a parameter that is similar to the flow Reynolds number $Re_{\textrm{H}}$, whose inverse marks the allowed integration window, for given accuracy and complexity. We illustrate the embedding scheme with numerical simulations of a one-dimensional Burgers problem. This work shows the potential of the hybrid quantum algorithm for simulating practical and nonlinear phenomena on near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: This document explores the potential of quantum computing in Thermal Science. Conceived as a living document, it will be continuously updated with experimental findings and insights for the research community in Thermal Science. By experiments, we refer both to the search for the most effective algorithms and to the performance of real quantum hardware. Those are fields that are evolving rapidly, driving a technological race to define the best architectures. The development of novel algorithms for engineering problems aims at harnessing the unique strengths of quantum computing. Expectations are high, as users seek concrete evidence of quantum supremacy - a true game changer for engineering applications. Among all heat transfer mechanisms (conduction, convection, radiation), we start with conduction as a paradigmatic test case in the field being characterized by a rich mathematical foundation for our investigations.</description>

      <title>Learning Enhanced Ensemble Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17836v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The filtering distribution in hidden Markov models evolves according to the law of a mean-field model in state-observation space. The ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) approximates this mean-field model with an ensemble of interacting particles, employing a Gaussian ansatz for the joint distribution of the state and observation at each observation time. These methods are robust, but the Gaussian ansatz limits accuracy. Here this shortcoming is addressed by using machine learning to map the joint predicted state and observation to the updated state estimate. The derivation of methods from a mean field formulation of the true filtering distribution suggests a single parametrization of the algorithm that can be deployed at different ensemble sizes. And we use a mean field formulation of the ensemble Kalman filter as an inductive bias for our architecture.
  To develop this perspective, in which the mean-field limit of the algorithm and finite interacting ensemble particle approximations share a common set of parameters, a novel form of neural operator is introduced, taking probability distributions as input: a measure neural mapping (MNM). A MNM is used to design a novel approach to filtering, the MNM-enhanced ensemble filter (MNMEF), which is defined in both the mean-field limit and for interacting ensemble particle approximations. The ensemble approach uses empirical measures as input to the MNM and is implemented using the set transformer, which is invariant to ensemble permutation and allows for different ensemble sizes. In practice fine-tuning of a small number of parameters, for specific ensemble sizes, further enhances the accuracy of the scheme. The promise of the approach is demonstrated by its superior root-mean-square-error performance relative to leading methods in filtering the Lorenz '96 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky models.</description>

      <title>GEARS H: Accurate machine-learned Hamiltonians for next-generation device-scale modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce GEARS H, a state-of-the-art machine-learning Hamiltonian framework for large-scale electronic structure simulations. Using GEARS H, we present a statistical analysis of the hole concentration induced in defective $\mathrm{WSe}_2$ interfaced with Ni-doped amorphous $\mathrm{HfO}_2$ as a function of the Ni doping rate, system density, and Se vacancy rate in 72 systems ranging from 3326 to 4160 atoms-a quantity and scale of interface electronic structure calculation beyond the reach of conventional density functional theory codes and other machine-learning-based methods. We further demonstrate the versatility of our architecture by training models for a molecular system, 2D materials with and without defects, solid solution crystals, and bulk amorphous systems with covalent and ionic bonds. The mean absolute error of the inferred Hamiltonian matrix elements from the validation set is below 2.4 meV for all of these models. GEARS H outperforms other proposed machine-learning Hamiltonian frameworks, and our results indicate that machine-learning Hamiltonian methods, starting with GEARS H, are now production-ready techniques for DFT-accuracy device-scale simulation.</description>

      <title>Shallow quantum circuit for generating extremely low-entangled approximate state designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17871v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Random quantum states have various applications in quantum information science. We discover a new ensemble of quantum states that serve as an $\epsilon$-approximate state $t$-design while possessing extremely low entanglement, magic, and coherence. These resources can reach their theoretical lower bounds, $\Omega(\log (t/\epsilon))$, which are also proven in this work. This implies that for fixed $t$ and $\epsilon$, entanglement, magic, and coherence do not scale with the system size, i.e., $O(1)$ with respect to the total number of qubits $n$. Moreover, we explicitly construct an ancilla-free shallow quantum circuit for generating such states by transforming $k$-qubit approximate state designs into $n$-qubit ones without increasing the support size. The depth of such a quantum circuit, $O(t [\log t]^3 \log n \log(1/\epsilon))$, is the most efficient among existing algorithms without ancilla qubits. A class of quantum circuits proposed in our work offers reduced cost for classical simulation of random quantum states, leading to potential applications in quantum information processing. As a concrete example, we propose classical shadow tomography using an estimator with superpositions between only two states, from which almost all quantum states can be efficiently certified by requiring only $O(1)$ measurements and classical post-processing time.</description>

      <title>When Energy and Information Revolutions Meet 2D Janus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The depletion of energy sources, worsening environmental issues, and the quantum limitations of integrated circuits for information storage in the post-Moore era, are pressing global concerns. Fortunately, two-dimensional (2D) Janus materials, possessing broken spatial symmetry, with emerging pressure-dependent and non-linear optical response, piezoelectricity, valley polarization, Rashba spin splitting and more, have established a substantial platform for exploring and applying modifiable physical, chemical and biological properties in material science and offered a promising solution for these energy and information issues. To furnish researchers with a comprehensive repository of 2D Janus family, this review systematically summarizes their theoretical predictions, experimental preparations, and modulation strategies. It also retrospectively outlines the recent advances in modifiable properties, applications, and inherent mechanisms in optics, catalysis, piezoelectricity, electrochemistry, thermoelectricity, magnetism, and electronics, with a focus on experimentally realized hexagonal and trigonal Janus structures. Additionally, their current research state is summarized, and potential opportunities and challenges that may arise are highlighted. Overall, this review aims to serve as a valuable resource for designing, fabricating, regulating, and applying 2D Janus systems, both theoretically and experimentally. This review will strongly promote the advanced academic investigations and industrial applications of 2D Janus materials in energy and information fields.</description>

      <title>GeoTransolver: Learning Physics on Irregular Domains Using Multi-scale Geometry Aware Physics Attention Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present GeoTransolver, a Multiscale Geometry-Aware Physics Attention Transformer for CAE that replaces standard attention with GALE, coupling physics-aware self-attention on learned state slices with cross-attention to a shared geometry/global/boundary-condition context computed from multi-scale ball queries (inspired by DoMINO) and reused in every block. Implemented and released in NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo, GeoTransolver persistently projects geometry, global and boundary condition parameters into physical state spaces to anchor latent computations to domain structure and operating regimes. We benchmark GeoTransolver on DrivAerML, Luminary SHIFT-SUV, and Luminary SHIFT-Wing, comparing against Domino, Transolver (as released in PhysicsNeMo), and literature-reported AB-UPT, and evaluate drag/lift R2 and Relative L1 errors for field variables. GeoTransolver delivers better accuracy, improved robustness to geometry/regime shifts, and favorable data efficiency; we include ablations on DrivAerML and qualitative results such as contour plots and design trends for the best GeoTransolver models. By unifying multiscale geometry-aware context with physics-based attention in a scalable transformer, GeoTransolver advances operator learning for high-fidelity surrogate modeling across complex, irregular domains and non-linear physical regimes.</description>
