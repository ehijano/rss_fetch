      <title>Physical Reservoir Computing in Hook-Shaped Rover Wheel Spokes for Real-Time Terrain Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective terrain detection in unknown environments is crucial for safe and efficient robotic navigation. Traditional methods often rely on computationally intensive data processing, requiring extensive onboard computational capacity and limiting real-time performance for rovers. This study presents a novel approach that combines physical reservoir computing with piezoelectric sensors embedded in rover wheel spokes for real-time terrain identification. By leveraging wheel dynamics, terrain-induced vibrations are transformed into high-dimensional features for machine learning-based classification. Experimental results show that strategically placing three sensors on the wheel spokes achieves 90$\%$ classification accuracy, which demonstrates the accuracy and feasibility of the proposed method. The experiment results also showed that the system can effectively distinguish known terrains and identify unknown terrains by analyzing their similarity to learned categories. This method provides a robust, low-power framework for real-time terrain classification and roughness estimation in unstructured environments, enhancing rover autonomy and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Chain-of-Modality: Learning Manipulation Programs from Multimodal Human Videos with Vision-Language-Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning to perform manipulation tasks from human videos is a promising approach for teaching robots. However, many manipulation tasks require changing control parameters during task execution, such as force, which visual data alone cannot capture. In this work, we leverage sensing devices such as armbands that measure human muscle activities and microphones that record sound, to capture the details in the human manipulation process, and enable robots to extract task plans and control parameters to perform the same task. To achieve this, we introduce Chain-of-Modality (CoM), a prompting strategy that enables Vision Language Models to reason about multimodal human demonstration data -- videos coupled with muscle or audio signals. By progressively integrating information from each modality, CoM refines a task plan and generates detailed control parameters, enabling robots to perform manipulation tasks based on a single multimodal human video prompt. Our experiments show that CoM delivers a threefold improvement in accuracy for extracting task plans and control parameters compared to baselines, with strong generalization to new task setups and objects in real-world robot experiments.

      <title>Multi-Sensor Fusion-Based Mobile Manipulator Remote Control for Intelligent Smart Home Assistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a wearable-controlled mobile manipulator system for intelligent smart home assistance, integrating MEMS capacitive microphones, IMU sensors, vibration motors, and pressure feedback to enhance human-robot interaction. The wearable device captures forearm muscle activity and converts it into real-time control signals for mobile manipulation. The wearable device achieves an offline classification accuracy of 88.33\%\ across six distinct movement-force classes for hand gestures by using a CNN-LSTM model, while real-world experiments involving five participants yield a practical accuracy of 83.33\%\ with an average system response time of 1.2 seconds. In Human-Robot synergy in navigation and grasping tasks, the robot achieved a 98\%\ task success rate with an average trajectory deviation of only 3.6 cm. Finally, the wearable-controlled mobile manipulator system achieved a 93.3\%\ gripping success rate, a transfer success of 95.6\%\, and a full-task success rate of 91.1\%\ during object grasping and transfer tests, in which a total of 9 object-texture combinations were evaluated. These three experiments' results validate the effectiveness of MEMS-based wearable sensing combined with multi-sensor fusion for reliable and intuitive control of assistive robots in smart home scenarios.</description>

      <title>LangCoop: Collaborative Driving with Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13406v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent collaboration holds great promise for enhancing the safety, reliability, and mobility of autonomous driving systems by enabling information sharing among multiple connected agents. However, existing multi-agent communication approaches are hindered by limitations of existing communication media, including high bandwidth demands, agent heterogeneity, and information loss. To address these challenges, we introduce LangCoop, a new paradigm for collaborative autonomous driving that leverages natural language as a compact yet expressive medium for inter-agent communication. LangCoop features two key innovations: Mixture Model Modular Chain-of-thought (M$^3$CoT) for structured zero-shot vision-language reasoning and Natural Language Information Packaging (LangPack) for efficiently packaging information into concise, language-based messages. Through extensive experiments conducted in the CARLA simulations, we demonstrate that LangCoop achieves a remarkable 96\% reduction in communication bandwidth (&lt; 2KB per message) compared to image-based communication, while maintaining competitive driving performance in the closed-loop evaluation. Our project page and code are at https://xiangbogaobarry.github.io/LangCoop/.</description>

      <title>Testing the Fault-Tolerance of Multi-Sensor Fusion Perception in Autonomous Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-level Autonomous Driving Systems (ADSs), such as Google Waymo and Baidu Apollo, typically rely on multi-sensor fusion (MSF) based approaches to perceive their surroundings. This strategy increases perception robustness by combining the respective strengths of the camera and LiDAR and directly affects the safety-critical driving decisions of autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, in real-world autonomous driving scenarios, cameras and LiDAR are subject to various faults, which can probably significantly impact the decision-making and behaviors of ADSs. Existing MSF testing approaches only discovered corner cases that the MSF-based perception cannot accurately detected by MSF-based perception, while lacking research on how sensor faults affect the system-level behaviors of ADSs.
  To address this gap, we conduct the first exploration of the fault tolerance of MSF perception-based ADS for sensor faults. In this paper, we systematically and comprehensively build fault models for cameras and LiDAR in AVs and inject them into the MSF perception-based ADS to test its behaviors in test scenarios. To effectively and efficiently explore the parameter spaces of sensor fault models, we design a feedback-guided differential fuzzer to discover the safety violations of MSF perception-based ADS caused by the injected sensor faults. We evaluate FADE on the representative and practical industrial ADS, Baidu Apollo. Our evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FADE, and we conclude some useful findings from the experimental results. To validate the findings in the physical world, we use a real Baidu Apollo 6.0 EDU autonomous vehicle to conduct the physical experiments, and the results show the practical significance of our findings.</description>

      <title>An Addendum to NeBula: Towards Extending TEAM CoSTAR's Solution to Larger Scale Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an appendix to the original NeBula autonomy solution developed by the TEAM CoSTAR (Collaborative SubTerranean Autonomous Robots), participating in the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. Specifically, this paper presents extensions to NeBula's hardware, software, and algorithmic components that focus on increasing the range and scale of the exploration environment. From the algorithmic perspective, we discuss the following extensions to the original NeBula framework: (i) large-scale geometric and semantic environment mapping; (ii) an adaptive positioning system; (iii) probabilistic traversability analysis and local planning; (iv) large-scale POMDP-based global motion planning and exploration behavior; (v) large-scale networking and decentralized reasoning; (vi) communication-aware mission planning; and (vii) multi-modal ground-aerial exploration solutions. We demonstrate the application and deployment of the presented systems and solutions in various large-scale underground environments, including limestone mine exploration scenarios as well as deployment in the DARPA Subterranean challenge.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis-Aware Neural Network Modeling and Whole-Body Reinforcement Learning Control of Soft Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robots exhibit inherent compliance and safety, which makes them particularly suitable for applications requiring direct physical interaction with humans, such as surgical procedures. However, their nonlinear and hysteretic behavior, resulting from the properties of soft materials, presents substantial challenges for accurate modeling and control. In this study, we present a soft robotic system designed for surgical applications and propose a hysteresis-aware whole-body neural network model that accurately captures and predicts the soft robot's whole-body motion, including its hysteretic behavior. Building upon the high-precision dynamic model, we construct a highly parallel simulation environment for soft robot control and apply an on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm to efficiently train whole-body motion control strategies. Based on the trained control policy, we developed a soft robotic system for surgical applications and validated it through phantom-based laser ablation experiments in a physical environment. The results demonstrate that the hysteresis-aware modeling reduces the Mean Squared Error (MSE) by 84.95 percent compared to traditional modeling methods. The deployed control algorithm achieved a trajectory tracking error ranging from 0.126 to 0.250 mm on the real soft robot, highlighting its precision in real-world conditions. The proposed method showed strong performance in phantom-based surgical experiments and demonstrates its potential for complex scenarios, including future real-world clinical applications.</description>

      <title>On the Importance of Tactile Sensing for Imitation Learning: A Case Study on Robotic Match Lighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of robotic manipulation has advanced significantly in the last years. At the sensing level, several novel tactile sensors have been developed, capable of providing accurate contact information. On a methodological level, learning from demonstrations has proven an efficient paradigm to obtain performant robotic manipulation policies. The combination of both holds the promise to extract crucial contact-related information from the demonstration data and actively exploit it during policy rollouts. However, despite its potential, it remains an underexplored direction. This work therefore proposes a multimodal, visuotactile imitation learning framework capable of efficiently learning fast and dexterous manipulation policies. We evaluate our framework on the dynamic, contact-rich task of robotic match lighting - a task in which tactile feedback influences human manipulation performance. The experimental results show that adding tactile information into the policies significantly improves performance by over 40%, thereby underlining the importance of tactile sensing for contact-rich manipulation tasks.

      <title>Robust Humanoid Walking on Compliant and Uneven Terrain with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the deployment of legged robots in real-world environments, it is essential to develop robust locomotion control methods for challenging terrains that may exhibit unexpected deformability and irregularity. In this paper, we explore the application of sim-to-real deep reinforcement learning (RL) for the design of bipedal locomotion controllers for humanoid robots on compliant and uneven terrains. Our key contribution is to show that a simple training curriculum for exposing the RL agent to randomized terrains in simulation can achieve robust walking on a real humanoid robot using only proprioceptive feedback. We train an end-to-end bipedal locomotion policy using the proposed approach, and show extensive real-robot demonstration on the HRP-5P humanoid over several difficult terrains inside and outside the lab environment. Further, we argue that the robustness of a bipedal walking policy can be improved if the robot is allowed to exhibit aperiodic motion with variable stepping frequency. We propose a new control policy to enable modification of the observed clock signal, leading to adaptive gait frequencies depending on the terrain and command velocity. Through simulation experiments, we show the effectiveness of this policy specifically for walking over challenging terrains by controlling swing and stance durations. The code for training and evaluation is available online at https://github.com/rohanpsingh/LearningHumanoidWalking.

      <title>Robot Navigation in Dynamic Environments using Acceleration Obstacles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the issue of motion planning in dynamic environments by extending the concept of Velocity Obstacle and Nonlinear Velocity Obstacle to Acceleration Obstacle AO and Nonlinear Acceleration Obstacle NAO. Similarly to VO and NLVO, the AO and NAO represent the set of colliding constant accelerations of the maneuvering robot with obstacles moving along linear and nonlinear trajectories, respectively. Contrary to prior works, we derive analytically the exact boundaries of AO and NAO. To enhance an intuitive understanding of these representations, we first derive the AO in several steps: first extending the VO to the Basic Acceleration Obstacle BAO that consists of the set of constant accelerations of the robot that would collide with an obstacle moving at constant accelerations, while assuming zero initial velocities of the robot and obstacle. This is then extended to the AO while assuming arbitrary initial velocities of the robot and obstacle. And finally, we derive the NAO that in addition to the prior assumptions, accounts for obstacles moving along arbitrary trajectories. The introduction of NAO allows the generation of safe avoidance maneuvers that directly account for the robot's second-order dynamics, with acceleration as its control input. The AO and NAO are demonstrated in several examples of selecting avoidance maneuvers in challenging road traffic. It is shown that the use of NAO drastically reduces the adjustment rate of the maneuvering robot's acceleration while moving in complex road traffic scenarios. The presented approach enables reactive and efficient navigation for multiple robots, with potential application for autonomous vehicles operating in complex dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Lightweight LiDAR-Camera 3D Dynamic Object Detection and Multi-Class Trajectory Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service mobile robots are often required to avoid dynamic objects while performing their tasks, but they usually have only limited computational resources. So we present a lightweight multi-modal framework for 3D object detection and trajectory prediction. Our system synergistically integrates LiDAR and camera inputs to achieve real-time perception of pedestrians, vehicles, and riders in 3D space. The framework proposes two novel modules: 1) a Cross-Modal Deformable Transformer (CMDT) for object detection with high accuracy and acceptable amount of computation, and 2) a Reference Trajectory-based Multi-Class Transformer (RTMCT) for efficient and diverse trajectory prediction of mult-class objects with flexible trajectory lengths. Evaluations on the CODa benchmark demonstrate superior performance over existing methods across detection (+2.03% in mAP) and trajectory prediction (-0.408m in minADE5 of pedestrians) metrics. Remarkably, the system exhibits exceptional deployability - when implemented on a wheelchair robot with an entry-level NVIDIA 3060 GPU, it achieves real-time inference at 13.2 fps. To facilitate reproducibility and practical deployment, we release the related code of the method at https://github.com/TossherO/3D_Perception and its ROS inference version at https://github.com/TossherO/ros_packages.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The modelling of Deformable Linear Objects (DLOs) such as cables, wires, and strings presents significant challenges due to their flexible and deformable nature. In robotics, accurately simulating the dynamic behavior of DLOs is essential for automating tasks like wire handling and assembly. The presented study is a preliminary analysis aimed at force data collection through domain randomization (DR) for training a robot in simulation, using a Mass-Spring-Damper (MSD) system as the reference model. The study aims to assess the impact of model parameter variations on DLO dynamics, using Isaac Sim and Gazebo to validate the applicability of DR technique in these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Magnecko: Design and Control of a Quadrupedal Magnetic Climbing Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climbing robots hold significant promise for applications such as industrial inspection and maintenance, particularly in hazardous or hard-to-reach environments. This paper describes the quadrupedal climbing robot Magnecko, developed with the major goal of providing a research platform for legged climbing locomotion. With its 12 actuated degrees of freedom arranged in an insect-style joint configuration, Magnecko's high manipulability and high range of motion allow it to handle challenging environments like overcoming concave 90 degree corners. A model predictive controller enables Magnecko to crawl on the ground on horizontal overhangs and on vertical walls. Thanks to the custom actuators and the electro-permanent magnets that are used for adhesion on ferrous surfaces, the system is powerful enough to carry additional payloads of at least 65 percent of its own weight in all orientations. The Magnecko platform serves as a foundation for climbing locomotion in complex three-dimensional environments.</description>

      <title>Green Robotic Mixed Reality with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing green communication in robotic mixed reality (RoboMR) systems presents a challenge, due to the necessity of uploading high-resolution images at high frequencies through wireless channels. This paper proposes Gaussian splatting (GS) RoboMR (GSRMR), which achieves a lower energy consumption and makes a concrete step towards green RoboMR. The crux to GSRMR is to build a GS model which enables the simulator to opportunistically render a photo-realistic view from the robot's pose, thereby reducing the need for excessive image uploads. Since the GS model may involve discrepancies compared to the actual environments, a GS cross-layer optimization (GSCLO) framework is further proposed, which jointly optimizes content switching (i.e., deciding whether to upload image or not) and power allocation across different frames. The GSCLO problem is solved by an accelerated penalty optimization (APO) algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed GSRMR reduces the communication energy by over 10x compared with RoboMR. Furthermore, the proposed GSRMR with APO outperforms extensive baseline schemes, in terms of peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM).</description>

      <title>Self-Mixing Laser Interferometry: In Search of an Ambient Noise-Resilient Alternative to Acoustic Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-mixing interferometry (SMI) has been lauded for its sensitivity in detecting microvibrations, while requiring no physical contact with its target. Microvibrations, i.e., sounds, have recently been used as a salient indicator of extrinsic contact in robotic manipulation. In previous work, we presented a robotic fingertip using SMI for extrinsic contact sensing as an ambient-noise-resilient alternative to acoustic sensing. Here, we extend the validation experiments to the frequency domain. We find that for broadband ambient noise, SMI still outperforms acoustic sensing, but the difference is less pronounced than in time-domain analyses. For targeted noise disturbances, analogous to multiple robots simultaneously collecting data for the same task, SMI is still the clear winner. Lastly, we show how motor noise affects SMI sensing more so than acoustic sensing, and that a higher SMI readout frequency is important for future work. Design and data files are available at https://github.com/RemkoPr/icra2025-SMI-tactile-sensing.</description>

      <title>SLAM&amp;Render: A Benchmark for the Intersection Between Neural Rendering, Gaussian Splatting and SLAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13713v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Models and methods originally developed for novel view synthesis and scene rendering, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly being adopted as representations in Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). However, existing datasets fail to include the specific challenges of both fields, such as multimodality and sequentiality in SLAM or generalization across viewpoints and illumination conditions in neural rendering. To bridge this gap, we introduce SLAM&amp;Render, a novel dataset designed to benchmark methods in the intersection between SLAM and novel view rendering. It consists of 40 sequences with synchronized RGB, depth, IMU, robot kinematic data, and ground-truth pose streams. By releasing robot kinematic data, the dataset also enables the assessment of novel SLAM strategies when applied to robot manipulators. The dataset sequences span five different setups featuring consumer and industrial objects under four different lighting conditions, with separate training and test trajectories per scene, as well as object rearrangements. Our experimental results, obtained with several baselines from the literature, validate SLAM&amp;Render as a relevant benchmark for this emerging research area.</description>

      <title>Learning Through Retrospection: Improving Trajectory Prediction for Automated Driving with Error Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In automated driving, predicting trajectories of surrounding vehicles supports reasoning about scene dynamics and enables safe planning for the ego vehicle. However, existing models handle predictions as an instantaneous task of forecasting future trajectories based on observed information. As time proceeds, the next prediction is made independently of the previous one, which means that the model cannot correct its errors during inference and will repeat them. To alleviate this problem and better leverage temporal data, we propose a novel retrospection technique. Through training on closed-loop rollouts the model learns to use aggregated feedback. Given new observations it reflects on previous predictions and analyzes its errors to improve the quality of subsequent predictions. Thus, the model can learn to correct systematic errors during inference. Comprehensive experiments on nuScenes and Argoverse demonstrate a considerable decrease in minimum Average Displacement Error of up to 31.9% compared to the state-of-the-art baseline without retrospection. We further showcase the robustness of our technique by demonstrating a better handling of out-of-distribution scenarios with undetected road-users.</description>

      <title>Unified Manipulability and Compliance Analysis of Modular Soft-Rigid Hybrid Fingers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework to analyze the manipulability and compliance of modular soft-rigid hybrid robotic fingers. The approach applies to both hydraulic and pneumatic actuation systems. A Jacobian-based formulation maps actuator inputs to joint and task-space responses. Hydraulic actuators are modeled under incompressible assumptions, while pneumatic actuators are described using nonlinear pressure-volume relations. The framework enables consistent evaluation of manipulability ellipsoids and compliance matrices across actuation modes. We validate the analysis using two representative hands: DexCo (hydraulic) and Edgy-2 (pneumatic). Results highlight actuation-dependent trade-offs in dexterity and passive stiffness. These findings provide insights for structure-aware design and actuator selection in soft-rigid robotic fingers.</description>

      <title>Imitation Learning with Precisely Labeled Human Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the imitation learning paradigm, training generalist robots requires large-scale datasets obtainable only through diverse curation. Due to the relative ease to collect, human demonstrations constitute a valuable addition when incorporated appropriately. However, existing methods utilizing human demonstrations face challenges in inferring precise actions, ameliorating embodiment gaps, and fusing with frontier generalist robot training pipelines. In this work, building on prior studies that demonstrate the viability of using hand-held grippers for efficient data collection, we leverage the user's control over the gripper's appearance--specifically by assigning it a unique, easily segmentable color--to enable simple and reliable application of the RANSAC and ICP registration method for precise end-effector pose estimation. We show in simulation that precisely labeled human demonstrations on their own allow policies to reach on average 88.1% of the performance of using robot demonstrations, and boost policy performance when combined with robot demonstrations, despite the inherent embodiment gap.</description>

      <title>DiffOG: Differentiable Policy Trajectory Optimization with Generalizability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.13807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imitation learning-based visuomotor policies excel at manipulation tasks but often produce suboptimal action trajectories compared to model-based methods. Directly mapping camera data to actions via neural networks can result in jerky motions and difficulties in meeting critical constraints, compromising safety and robustness in real-world deployment. For tasks that require high robustness or strict adherence to constraints, ensuring trajectory quality is crucial. However, the lack of interpretability in neural networks makes it challenging to generate constraint-compliant actions in a controlled manner. This paper introduces differentiable policy trajectory optimization with generalizability (DiffOG), a learning-based trajectory optimization framework designed to enhance visuomotor policies. By leveraging the proposed differentiable formulation of trajectory optimization with transformer, DiffOG seamlessly integrates policies with a generalizable optimization layer. Visuomotor policies enhanced by DiffOG generate smoother, constraint-compliant action trajectories in a more interpretable way. DiffOG exhibits strong generalization capabilities and high flexibility. We evaluated DiffOG across 11 simulated tasks and 2 real-world tasks. The results demonstrate that DiffOG significantly enhances the trajectory quality of visuomotor policies while having minimal impact on policy performance, outperforming trajectory processing baselines such as greedy constraint clipping and penalty-based trajectory optimization. Furthermore, DiffOG achieves superior performance compared to existing constrained visuomotor policy.</description>

      <title>BEV-GS: Feed-forward Gaussian Splatting in Bird's-Eye-View for Road Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Road surface is the sole contact medium for wheels or robot feet. Reconstructing road surface is crucial for unmanned vehicles and mobile robots. Recent studies on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have achieved remarkable results in scene reconstruction. However, they typically rely on multi-view image inputs and require prolonged optimization times. In this paper, we propose BEV-GS, a real-time single-frame road surface reconstruction method based on feed-forward Gaussian splatting. BEV-GS consists of a prediction module and a rendering module. The prediction module introduces separate geometry and texture networks following Bird's-Eye-View paradigm. Geometric and texture parameters are directly estimated from a single frame, avoiding per-scene optimization. In the rendering module, we utilize grid Gaussian for road surface representation and novel view synthesis, which better aligns with road surface characteristics. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on the real-world dataset RSRD. The road elevation error reduces to 1.73 cm, and the PSNR of novel view synthesis reaches 28.36 dB. The prediction and rendering FPS is 26, and 2061, respectively, enabling high-accuracy and real-time applications.

      <title>Integration of a Graph-Based Path Planner and Mixed-Integer MPC for Robot Navigation in Cluttered Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to update a path plan is a required capability for autonomous mobile robots navigating through uncertain environments. This paper proposes a re-planning strategy using a multilayer planning and control framework for cases where the robot's environment is partially known. A medial axis graph-based planner defines a global path plan based on known obstacles where each edge in the graph corresponds to a unique corridor. A mixed-integer model predictive control (MPC) method detects if a terminal constraint derived from the global plan is infeasible, subject to a non-convex description of the local environment. Infeasibility detection is used to trigger efficient global re-planning via medial axis graph edge deletion. The proposed re-planning strategy is demonstrated experimentally.</description>

Abstract: Imitation learning is a widely used approach for training agents to replicate expert behavior in complex decision-making tasks. However, existing methods often struggle with compounding errors and limited generalization, due to the inherent challenge of error correction and the distribution shift between training and deployment. In this paper, we present a novel model-based imitation learning framework inspired by model predictive control, which addresses these limitations by integrating predictive modeling through multi-step state predictions. Our method outperforms traditional behavior cloning numerical benchmarks, demonstrating superior robustness to distribution shift and measurement noise both in available data and during execution. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees on the sample complexity and error bounds of our method, offering insights into its convergence properties.</description>

      <title>SwitchMT: An Adaptive Context Switching Methodology for Scalable Multi-Task Learning in Intelligent Autonomous Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to train intelligent autonomous agents (such as mobile robots) on multiple tasks is crucial for adapting to dynamic real-world environments. However, state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods only excel in single-task settings, and still struggle to generalize across multiple tasks due to task interference. Moreover, real-world environments also demand the agents to have data stream processing capabilities. Toward this, a state-of-the-art work employs Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to improve multi-task learning by exploiting temporal information in data stream, while enabling lowpower/energy event-based operations. However, it relies on fixed context/task-switching intervals during its training, hence limiting the scalability and effectiveness of multi-task learning. To address these limitations, we propose SwitchMT, a novel adaptive task-switching methodology for RL-based multi-task learning in autonomous agents. Specifically, SwitchMT employs the following key ideas: (1) a Deep Spiking Q-Network with active dendrites and dueling structure, that utilizes task-specific context signals to create specialized sub-networks; and (2) an adaptive task-switching policy that leverages both rewards and internal dynamics of the network parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that SwitchMT achieves superior performance in multi-task learning compared to state-of-the-art methods. It achieves competitive scores in multiple Atari games (i.e., Pong: -8.8, Breakout: 5.6, and Enduro: 355.2) compared to the state-of-the-art, showing its better generalized learning capability. These results highlight the effectiveness of our SwitchMT methodology in addressing task interference while enabling multi-task learning automation through adaptive task switching, thereby paving the way for more efficient generalist agents with scalable multi-task learning capabilities.</description>

      <title>Task Assignment and Exploration Optimization for Low Altitude UAV Rescue via Generative AI Enhanced Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven convolutional neural networks enhance rescue, inspection, and surveillance tasks performed by low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and ground computing nodes (GCNs) in unknown environments. However, their high computational demands often exceed a single UAV's capacity, leading to system instability, further exacerbated by the limited and dynamic resources of GCNs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel cooperation framework involving UAVs, ground-embedded robots (GERs), and high-altitude platforms (HAPs), which enable resource pooling through UAV-to-GER (U2G) and UAV-to-HAP (U2H) communications to provide computing services for UAV offloaded tasks. Specifically, we formulate the multi-objective optimization problem of task assignment and exploration optimization in UAVs as a dynamic long-term optimization problem. Our objective is to minimize task completion time and energy consumption while ensuring system stability over time. To achieve this, we first employ the Lyapunov optimization technique to transform the original problem, with stability constraints, into a per-slot deterministic problem. We then propose an algorithm named HG-MADDPG, which combines the Hungarian algorithm with a generative diffusion model (GDM)-based multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach. We first introduce the Hungarian algorithm as a method for exploration area selection, enhancing UAV efficiency in interacting with the environment. We then innovatively integrate the GDM and multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to optimize task assignment decisions, such as task offloading and resource allocation. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, with significant improvements in task offloading efficiency, latency reduction, and system stability compared to baseline methods.</description>

      <title>LMPOcc: 3D Semantic Occupancy Prediction Utilizing Long-Term Memory Prior from Historical Traversals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction is critical for autonomous driving, enabling unified modeling of static infrastructure and dynamic agents. In practice, autonomous vehicles may repeatedly traverse identical geographic locations under varying environmental conditions, such as weather fluctuations and illumination changes. Existing methods in 3D occupancy prediction predominantly integrate adjacent temporal contexts. However, these works neglect to leverage perceptual information, which is acquired from historical traversals of identical geographic locations. In this paper, we propose Longterm Memory Prior Occupancy (LMPOcc), the first 3D occupancy prediction methodology that exploits long-term memory priors derived from historical traversal perceptual outputs. We introduce a plug-and-play architecture that integrates long-term memory priors to enhance local perception while simultaneously constructing global occupancy representations. To adaptively aggregate prior features and current features, we develop an efficient lightweight Current-Prior Fusion module. Moreover, we propose a model-agnostic prior format to ensure compatibility across diverse occupancy prediction baselines. LMPOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance validated on the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, especially on static semantic categories. Additionally, experimental results demonstrate LMPOcc's ability to construct global occupancy through multi-vehicle crowdsourcing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a crucial method for robots to acquire new skills. However, when given suboptimal task trajectory demonstrations with shape characteristics reflecting human preferences but subpar dynamic attributes such as slow motion, robots not only need to mimic the behaviors but also optimize the dynamic performance. In this work, we leverage optimization-based methods to search for a superior-performing trajectory whose shape is similar to that of the demonstrated trajectory. Specifically, we use Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to quantify the difference between two trajectories and combine it with additional performance metrics, such as collision cost, to construct the cost function. Moreover, we develop a multi-policy version of the Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning (STOMP), called MSTOMP, which is more stable and robust to parameter changes. To deal with the jitter in the demonstrated trajectory, we further utilize the gain-controlling method in the frequency domain to denoise the demonstration and propose a computationally more efficient metric, called Mean Square Error in the Spectrum (MSES), that measures the trajectories' differences in the frequency domain. We also theoretically highlight the connections between the time domain and the frequency domain methods. Finally, we verify our method in both simulation experiments and real-world experiments, showcasing its improved optimization performance and stability compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Dynamic Safety Shield for Safe and Efficient Reinforcement Learning of Navigation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been successfully applied to a variety of robotics applications, where it outperforms classical methods. However, the safety aspect of RL and the transfer to the real world remain an open challenge. A prominent field for tackling this challenge and ensuring the safety of the agents during training and execution is safe reinforcement learning. Safe RL can be achieved through constrained RL and safe exploration approaches. The former learns the safety constraints over the course of training to achieve a safe behavior by the end of training, at the cost of high number of collisions at earlier stages of the training. The latter offers robust safety by enforcing the safety constraints as hard constraints, which prevents collisions but hinders the exploration of the RL agent, resulting in lower rewards and poor performance. To overcome those drawbacks, we propose a novel safety shield, that combines the robustness of the optimization-based controllers with the long prediction capabilities of the RL agents, allowing the RL agent to adaptively tune the parameters of the controller. Our approach is able to improve the exploration of the RL agents for navigation tasks, while minimizing the number of collisions. Experiments in simulation show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in the reached goals-to-collisions ratio in different challenging environments. The goals-to-collisions ratio metrics emphasizes the importance of minimizing the number of collisions, while learning to accomplish the task. Our approach achieves a higher number of reached goals compared to the classic safety shields and fewer collisions compared to constrained RL approaches. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in a real-world experiment.</description>

      <title>Training-free Task-oriented Grasp Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a training-free pipeline for task-oriented grasp generation that combines pre-trained grasp generation models with vision-language models (VLMs). Unlike traditional approaches that focus solely on stable grasps, our method incorporates task-specific requirements by leveraging the semantic reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate five querying strategies, each utilizing different visual representations of candidate grasps, and demonstrate significant improvements over a baseline method in both grasp success and task compliance rates, with absolute gains of up to 36.9\% in overall success rate. Our results underline the potential of VLMs to enhance task-oriented manipulation, providing insights for future research in robotic grasping and human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Demonstrating CavePI: Autonomous Exploration of Underwater Caves by Semantic Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Enabling autonomous robots to safely and efficiently navigate, explore, and map underwater caves is of significant importance to water resource management, hydrogeology, archaeology, and marine robotics. In this work, we demonstrate the system design and algorithmic integration of a visual servoing framework for semantically guided autonomous underwater cave exploration. We present the hardware and edge-AI design considerations to deploy this framework on a novel AUV (Autonomous Underwater Vehicle) named CavePI. The guided navigation is driven by a computationally light yet robust deep visual perception module, delivering a rich semantic understanding of the environment. Subsequently, a robust control mechanism enables CavePI to track the semantic guides and navigate within complex cave structures. We evaluate the system through field experiments in natural underwater caves and spring-water sites and further validate its ROS (Robot Operating System)-based digital twin in a simulation environment. Our results highlight how these integrated design choices facilitate reliable navigation under feature-deprived, GPS-denied, and low-visibility conditions.</description>

      <title>Haptic Perception via the Dynamics of Flexible Body Inspired by an Ostrich's Neck</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In biological systems, both skin sensitivity and body flexibility play crucial roles in haptic perception. Fully soft robots often suffer from structural fragility and delayed sensory processing, limiting their practical functionality. The musculoskeletal system combines the adaptability of soft materials with the durability of rigid-body robots. It also leverages morphological computation, where the morphological structures contribute to information processing, for dynamic and adaptive behaviors. This study focuses on the pecking behaviors of birds, which enables precise haptic perception through the musculoskeletal system of their flexible neck. Physical reservoir computing is applied to flexible structures inspired by an ostrich neck to analyze the relationship between haptic perception and physical characteristics. Experiments with both a physical robot and simulations reveal that, with appropriate viscoelasticity, the flexible structure can discriminate object softness and retain that information through behavior. Drawing on these findings and anatomical insights from the ostrich neck, a haptic perception system is proposed that exhibits both separability and behavioral memory in flexible structures, enabling rapid learning and real-time inference. The results demonstrate that through the dynamics of flexible structures, diverse functions can emerge beyond their original design as manipulators.</description>

      <title>Doppler-SLAM: Doppler-Aided Radar-Inertial and LiDAR-Inertial Simultaneous Localization and Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11634v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is a critical capability for autonomous systems. Traditional SLAM approaches, which often rely on visual or LiDAR sensors, face significant challenges in adverse conditions such as low light or featureless environments. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel Doppler-aided radar-inertial and LiDAR-inertial SLAM framework that leverages the complementary strengths of 4D radar, FMCW LiDAR, and inertial measurement units. Our system integrates Doppler velocity measurements and spatial data into a tightly-coupled front-end and graph optimization back-end to provide enhanced ego velocity estimation, accurate odometry, and robust mapping. We also introduce a Doppler-based scan-matching technique to improve front-end odometry in dynamic environments. In addition, our framework incorporates an innovative online extrinsic calibration mechanism, utilizing Doppler velocity and loop closure to dynamically maintain sensor alignment. Extensive evaluations on both public and proprietary datasets show that our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art radar-SLAM and LiDAR-SLAM frameworks in terms of accuracy and robustness. To encourage further research, the code of our Doppler-SLAM and our dataset are available at: https://github.com/Wayne-DWA/Doppler-SLAM.</description>

      <title>Force and Speed in a Soft Stewart Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many soft robots struggle to produce dynamic motions with fast, large displacements. We develop a parallel 6 degree-of-freedom (DoF) Stewart-Gough mechanism using Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) actuators. By using soft actuators, we are able to use one third as many mechatronic components as a rigid Stewart platform, while retaining a working payload of 2kg and an open-loop bandwidth greater than 16Hz. We show that the platform is capable of both precise tracing and dynamic disturbance rejection when controlling a ball and sliding puck using a Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller. We develop a machine-learning-based kinematics model and demonstrate a functional workspace of roughly 10cm in each translation direction and 28 degrees in each orientation. This 6DoF device has many of the characteristics associated with rigid components - power, speed, and total workspace - while capturing the advantages of soft mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Cross-cultural Deployment of Autonomous Vehicles Using Data-light Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11506v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: More than the adherence to specific traffic regulations, driving culture touches upon a more implicit part - an informal, conventional, collective behavioral pattern followed by drivers - that varies across countries, regions, and even cities. Such cultural divergence has become one of the biggest challenges in deploying autonomous vehicles (AVs) across diverse regions today. The current emergence of data-driven methods has shown a potential solution to enable culture-compatible driving through learning from data, but what if some underdeveloped regions cannot provide sufficient local data to inform driving culture? This issue is particularly significant for a broader global AV market. Here, we propose a cross-cultural deployment scheme for AVs, called data-light inverse reinforcement learning, designed to re-calibrate culture-specific AVs and assimilate them into other cultures. First, we report the divergence in driving cultures through a comprehensive comparative analysis of naturalistic driving datasets on highways from three countries: Germany, China, and the USA. Then, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by testing the expeditious cross-cultural deployment across these three countries, with cumulative testing mileage of over 56084 km. The performance is particularly advantageous when cross-cultural deployment is carried out without affluent local data. Results show that we can reduce the dependence on local data by a margin of 98.67% at best. This study is expected to bring a broader, fairer AV global market, particularly in those regions that lack enough local data to develop culture-compatible AVs.</description>
