      <title>Practical Considerations for Measuring Global Spin Density Matrix Elements of Vector Mesons in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The STAR Collaboration has reported a significant $\phi$-meson global spin alignment ($\rho_{00}$) signal in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}\leq62$ GeV by measuring the polar angle distribution of $\phi$-meson daughters with respect to the orbital angular momentum (OAM) direction of the collision system. In this paper, a new method is explored for studying vector-meson global spin alignment in heavy-ion collisions by examining the two dimensional polar and azimuthal angle distribution. This method allows simultaneous extraction of $\rho_{00}$ and off-diagonal spin density matrix elements (SDMEs), providing unique access to local quark-antiquark spin correlations and spin hydrodynamics in quark-gluon plasma (QGP). The new 2D method also removes potential biases from non-zero off-diagonal SDMEs on $\rho_{00}$ with the 1D method. A detailed procedure to correct for detector acceptance and resolution effects is also presented and validated by simulation studies.</description>

      <title>Engineering the shapes of quark-gluon plasma droplets by comparing anisotropic flow in small symmetric and asymmetric collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of collective flow phenomena in small collision systems challenges our understanding of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation and evolution. This complexity lies in the initial geometries, which are influenced by both nucleon configuration and subnucleonic fluctuations, introducing uncertainties in interpreting flow patterns. We disentangle these contributions through comparative measurements of elliptic ($v_2$) and triangular ($v_3$) flow in asymmetric $d$+Au and symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=200$ GeV, which produce medium of comparable sizes but with vastly different initial geometries. The larger $v_2$ in $d$+Au reflects its dominant elliptic geometry, while the similar $v_3$ in both systems is better explained by considering subnucleonic fluctuations. These contrasting flow patterns are quantitatively described by a state-of-the-art hydrodynamic model tuned to large-system Au+Au data, indicating efficient transformation of initial geometries to final-state anisotropies. These results provide evidence for droplet formation in small systems with transport properties that are similar to those observed in large collision systems, consistent with QGP-like behavior.</description>

      <title>Beta-decay Half Lives beyond $^{54}$Ca: A Systematic Survey of Decay Properties approaching the Neutron Dripline</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an experiment performed at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB) using the FRIB Decay Station initiator (FDSi), 15 new half lives of isotopes near $^{54}$Ca were measured. A new method of extracting lifetimes from experimental data, taking into account the unknown $\beta$-delayed neutron emission branches of very neutron-rich nuclei, was developed to enable systematic uncertainty analysis. The experiment observed a dramatic change in the half-life systematics for the isotopes with neutron number N =34. Beyond N =34, the decline of nuclear lifetime is much slower, leading to longer than anticipated lifetimes for near-dripline nuclei. State-of-the-art shell-model calculations can explain the experimental results for Z$&gt;$19 nuclei, revealing the imprint of shell effects and the need for modification of single-particle neutron states. The results from a newly developed QRPA model with potential for making global predictions were also tested against the experimental results and good agreement was found.</description>

      <title>The strong coupling from the IR to the UV extremes: Determination of $\alpha_s$ and prospects from EIC and JLab at 22 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss how the Bjorken sum rule allows access to the QCD running coupling $\alpha_s$ at any scale, including in the deep infrared IR domain. The Bjorken sum data from Jefferson Lab, together with the world data on $\alpha_s$ reported by the Particle Data Group, allow us to determine the running of $\alpha_s(Q)$ over five orders of magnitude in four-momentum $Q$. We present two possible future measurements of the running of $\alpha_s(Q)$ using the Bjorken sum rule: the first at the EIC, covering the range $1.5 &lt; Q &lt; 8.7$ GeV, and the second at Jefferson Lab at 22 GeV, covering the range $1.0 &lt; Q &lt; 4.7$ GeV.</description>

      <title>The Regulated GeAs Cycles with the New $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As Reaction Rates and Their Impact on the GS 1826$-$24 Clocked Bursts and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 Photospheric Radius Expansion Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As thermonuclear reactions connect the ZnGa and GeAs cycles by diverting the flow of the rapid proton capture process from $^{63}$Ga to $^{65}$As. Changes in these two reaction rates regulate the ZnGa and GeAs cycles and may affect the modeled properties matching with the observed counterparts of a type I X-ray burster. We implement the latest $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates to the state-of-the-art self-consistent one-dimensional multi-zone thermo-hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to study the influence of these new reaction rates on the models of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster and SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster. Both new reaction rates obtained by Lu et al. [Phys. Rev. C 110, 065804 (2024)] are determined from complementing the experimental input with the nuclear spectroscopic information deduced from the full pf-shell space configuration-interaction shell-model calculations. By constraining the models on reproducing the observed burst peak, light-curve profile, fluence, and recurrence time, we find that the impact of the newly measured proton thresholds and respective proton-capture reactions on the burst light-curve profile of the GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster is, in fact, not as significant as claimed by Zhou et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 1091 (2023)]. With or without the inclusion of the newly determined reaction rate of the highly influential $^{22}$Mg($\alpha$,p)$^{25}$Al reaction, the impact of the new $^{63}$Ga(p,$\gamma$)$^{64}$Ge and $^{64}$Ge(p,$\gamma$)$^{65}$As reaction rates on SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion bursts is evident. Our finding indicates that the models reproducing the 2002 October epoch of SAX J1808.4$-$3658 photospheric radius expansion burster is more sensitive to the uncertainties of thermonuclear reaction rates.</description>

      <title>Improving Optics Control and Measurement at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In order to aid in luminosity maximization at the interaction point (IP), the collision location $s_{IP}$ must be equivalent to the location of the minimum value of the beta function $s^*$. Accurate optics measurements and $s^*$ movements are therefore essential to luminosity optimization. However, according to current Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) operations measurements, average horizontal beta beat measurements between operating IPs are around $20\%$ along with significant variation in $s^*$ measurements. A sensitivity matrix was shown to successfully move $s^*$ and the linear optics to their desired values using power supply currents at the 8 o'clock interaction region (IR8). A method to measure the linear optics using the one-turn map within IRs was explored and compared with other mature methods. An error analysis was also included for all optics measurements methods. Through these methods, a $10\%$ beat reduction was consistently achieved while moving $s^*_x$ as well significant improvement to variations in $s^*$ measurements. These methods used at the RHIC control room will be updated for future linear optics analysis and control.</description>

      <title>Probing New Forces with Nuclear Clocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02932v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clocks based on nuclear isomer transitions promise exceptional stability and precision. The low transition energy of the thorium-229 isomer makes it an ideal candidate, as it has been excited by a vacuum-ultraviolet laser and is highly sensitive to subtle interactions. This enables the development of powerful tools for probing new forces, which we call {\it quintessometers}. In this work, we demonstrate the potential of nuclear clocks, particularly solid-state variants, to surpass existing limits on scalar field couplings, exceeding the sensitivity of current fifth-force searches at submicron distances and significantly improving equivalence-principle tests at kilometer scales and beyond. Additionally, we highlight the capability of transportable nuclear clocks to detect scalar interactions at distances beyond $10\,$km, complementing space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Identified Hadron Production at Hadron Colliders in Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11489v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to identified hadron production at hadron colliders. The inclusion of the NNLO correction has an important impact on all observables considered in this work. Higher order corrections reduce scale uncertainty and in almost all cases are moderate. Overall, good perturbative convergence is observed across kinematics and observables. The uncertainty due to missing higher orders is relatively small and, in many cases, smaller than the experimental uncertainty. The largest source of theoretical uncertainty at present is from the knowledge of the non-perturbative parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FF), which dwarfs the scale uncertainty in most kinematic ranges. The inclusion of NNLO corrections demonstrates the precision studies potential of this class of observables. To fully realize this potential, however, a new generation of improved fragmentation functions may be needed. The results of the present work will enable global fits of FF with NNLO precision.</description>

      <title>Search for high energy 5.5 MeV solar axions with the complete Borexino dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A search for solar axions and axion-like particles produced in the $p+d\rightarrow\rm{^3He}+A~(5.5\rm{ ~MeV})$ reaction was performed using the complete dataset of the Borexino detector (3995 days of measurement live-time). The following interaction processes have been considered: axion decay into two photons $({\rm A}\rightarrow2\gamma)$, inverse Primakoff conversion on nuclei $({\rm A}+Z\rightarrow\gamma+Z$), the Compton conversion of axions to photons $({\rm A}+e\rightarrow e+\gamma)$ and the axio-electric effect $({\rm A}+e+Z\rightarrow e+Z$). Model-independent limits on axion-photon ($g_{A\gamma}$), axion-electron ($g_{Ae}$), and isovector axion-nucleon ($g_{3AN}$) couplings are obtained: $|g_{A\gamma}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 2.3\times 10^{-11} \rm{GeV}^{-1}$ and $|g_{Ae}\times g_{3AN}| \leq 1.9\times 10^{-13}$ at $m_A &lt;$ 1 MeV (90\% c.l.). The Borexino results exclude new large regions of $g_{A\gamma}$, and $g_{Ae}$ coupling constants and axion masses $m_A$, and leads to constraints on the products $|g_{A\gamma}\times m_A|$ and $|g_{Ae}\times m_A|$ for the KSVZ- and the DFSZ-axion models.</description>

      <title>Lattice QCD Benchmark of Proton Helicity and Flavor-Dependent Unpolarized TMDPDFs at Physical Quark Masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first lattice QCD calculations of the isovector helicity transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) and the flavor-dependent unpolarized TMDPDFs for up and down quarks in the proton. Our computations utilize domain-wall fermion discretization with physical quark masses. Employing Coulomb-gauge-fixed quark correlation functions within the large-momentum effective theory framework, we access nonperturbative transverse quark separations $b_T$ up to approximately 1 fm, corresponding to transverse momenta as low as 200 MeV. Based on the quasi-TMD factorization theorem, we construct renormalization-group-invariant ratios that are equal to the corresponding light-cone TMDPDF ratios. At moderate $x$, our results reveal that the isovector helicity and unpolarized TMDPDFs exhibit nearly identical transverse structure up to a normalization factor, and the unpolarized distributions display only mild flavor dependence. These findings not only support key trends observed in recent global analyses but also provide robust, nonperturbative constraints that can distinguish between different parameterizations. This work establishes a first-principles benchmark for TMDPDFs, offering valuable input for ongoing and future experimental efforts to map the proton's three-dimensional structure.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies of the isovector reorientation effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The isovector reorientation (IVR) effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target provides a novel means to probe the nuclear isovector potential, which gives rise to the nuclear symmetry energy. The simulation studies on the experimental measurement of IVR effect using the SAMURAI terminal at RIKEN Nishina center have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment. By introducing a well-designed polarimeter to detect the $\mathrm{p}(\vec{\mathrm{d}}, \mathrm{d})\mathrm{p}$ elastic scattering, monitoring of the tensor polarization of the deuteron beam can be implemented. The protons and neutrons produced by the breakup of polarized deuterons scattering off heavy targets are designed to be measured by proton drift chamber (PDC) combined with the SAMURAI magnet and NEBULA detector, respectively. The detector responses are simulated using Geant4 framework, where the events of the deuteron elastic breakup are generated by an Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. The results of reconstructing the deuteron breakup events demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the IVR effect at SAMURAI with both longitudinal and transverse tensor polarized deuteron beams with a polarization degree of approximately 80\%.</description>

Abstract: Observing $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states requires that the $\eta'$-nuclear potential is both sufficiently attractive and weakly absorptive, as confirmed by the CBELSA/TAPS collaboration analysis of inclusive $\eta'$ production experiments on nuclear targets, including liquid hydrogen (LH$_2$). Here we present an alternative derivation of the $\eta'$-nuclear potential, constrained by near-threshold $pp\to pp\eta'$ and $\gamma p\to\eta' p$ production experiments on a free proton. The resulting $\eta'$-nuclear potential is weakly attractive and strongly absorptive, to the extent that observation of clear signals of $\eta'$-nuclear quasibound states is unlikely. Possible exceptions resulting from the dynamics of the nearby $I=\frac{1}{2}$ $J=({\frac{1}{2}})^-$ nucleon resonance $N^{\ast}$(1895) are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Symmetric-asymmetric collision comparison: disentangling nuclear structure and subnucleonic structure effects for small system flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16162v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous flow measurements in small collision systems were mostly based on highly asymmetric collisions ($p$+Pb, $p$+Au, $d$+Au, $^{3}$He+Au), where both nuclear structure and subnucleonic fluctuations are important. Comparing these asymmetric systems with the newly available symmetric $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions at RHIC and LHC provides a unique opportunity to disentangle these two contributions. Using Glauber models incorporating both nucleon and quark-level substructure, we analyze multiplicity distributions and initial-state estimators: eccentricities $\varepsilon_n$ for anisotropic flow $v_n$ and inverse transverse size $d_{\perp}$ for radial flow. We find that subnucleonic fluctuations impact O+O collisions differently from asymmetric systems, creating specific patterns in flow observables that enable disentangling the competing contributions. Such experimental comparisons will reduce uncertainties in the initial conditions and improve our understanding of the properties of the QGP-like medium produced in small systems.</description>

      <title>Response of wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers to ionizing radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.15913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results of characterizing the response and light transport of wavelength-shifting (WLS) and scintillating-wavelength-shifting (Sci-WLS) fibers under irradiation by radioactive $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ sources. Light yield and light transmission were measured for the WLS fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain and for a new Sci-WLS fiber EJ-160 from Eljen Technology.
  The two variants with different fluor mixtures, EJ-160I and EJ-160II, exhibited approximately five and seven times higher light yield than BCF-91A, respectively, while their attenuation lengths were 3.80\,m for BCF-91A, 4.00\,m for EJ-160I, and 2.50\,m for EJ-160II.</description>
