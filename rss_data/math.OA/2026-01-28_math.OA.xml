      <title>Pureness and stable rank one for reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of certain group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to prove two results. First, we observe that discrete groups with property $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PHP}}$ in the sense of Ozawa give rise to completely selfless reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras, thereby extending a theorem of Ozawa from the untwisted to the twisted case. Second, we show that reduced (twisted) $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of some group extensions of the form finite-by-$G$, with $G$ having the property $\mathrm{P}_{\mathrm{PHP}}$, have stable rank one and are pure, which implies strict comparison. Our results do not assume rapid decay, and extend a theorem of Raum-Thiel-Vilalta. Examples covered by our results include reduced twisted group $\mathrm{C}^\ast$-algebras of all acylindrically hyperbolic groups and all lattices in ${\rm SL}(n,\mathbb R)$ for $n\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Geometric obstructions to fully ellipticity for families of manifolds with corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we study index theory for families of manifold with corners. In particular the K-theoretical obstruction for an elliptic operator to have a family (Fredholm) index. For codimension 1 corners (families with boundary) it gives an expected condition on indices associated to codimension 1 faces. The main theorem of this paper concern the codimension 2 case: in addition to the expected condition on indices associated to codimension 2 faces, there is an extra combinatoric condition implying the topology of the family base. This new condition is expressed in terms of conormal homology cycles with K-theoretical coefficients.</description>

      <title>Phase Group Categories of Bimodule Quantum Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the quantum channel on a von Neuamnn algebra $\mathcal{M}$ preserving a von Neumann subalgebra $\mathcal{N}$, namely an $\mathcal{N}$-$\mathcal{N}$-bimodule unital completely positive map. By introducing the relative irreducibility of a bimodule quantum channel, we show that its eigenvalues with modulus 1 form a finite cyclic group, called its phase group. Moreover, the corresponding eigenspaces are invertible $\mathcal{N}$-$\mathcal{N}$-bimodules, which encode a categorification of the phase group. When $\mathcal{N}\subset \mathcal{M}$ is a finite-index irreducible subfactor of type II$_1$, we prove that any bimodule quantum channel is relatively irreducible for the intermediate subfactor of its fixed points. In addition, we can reformulate and prove these results intrinsically in subfactor planar algebras without referring to the subfactor using the methods of quantum Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Categories of abstract and noncommutative measurable spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gelfand duality is a fundamental result that justifies thinking of general unital $C^*$-algebras as noncommutative versions of compact Hausdorff spaces. Inspired by this perspective, we investigate what noncommutative measurable spaces should be. This leads us to consider categories of monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras as well as categories of Boolean $\sigma$-algebras, which can be thought of as abstract measurable spaces. Motivated by the search for a good notion of noncommutative measurable space, we provide a unified overview of these categories, alongside those of measurable spaces, and formalize their relationships through functors, adjunctions and equivalences. This includes an equivalence between Boolean $\sigma$-algebras and commutative monotone $\sigma$-complete $C^*$-algebras, as well as a Gelfand-type duality adjunction between the latter category and the category of measurable spaces. This duality restricts to two equivalences: one involving standard Borel spaces, which are widely used in probability theory, and another involving the more general Baire measurable spaces. Moreover, this result admits a probabilistic version, where the morphisms are $\sigma$-normal cpu maps and Markov kernels, respectively. We hope that these developments can also contribute to the ongoing search for a well-behaved Markov category for measure-theoretic probability beyond the standard Borel setting - an open problem in the current state of the art.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy in CFT and Modular Nuclearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.09074v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the framework of Algebraic Quantum Field Theory, several operator algebraic notions of entanglement entropy can be associated with any pair of causally disjoint spacetime regions $\mathcal{S}_A$ and $\mathcal{S}_B$ with positive relative distance. Among them, the canonical entanglement entropy is defined as the von Neumann entropy of a canonical intermediate type I factor. In this work, we show that the canonical entanglement entropy of the vacuum state is finite for a broad class of conformal nets including the $U(1)$-current model and the $SU(n)$-loop group models. Since previous studies suggest that this finiteness property is related to nuclearity properties of the system, we show that the mutual information is finite in any local QFT satisfying a modular $p$-nuclearity condition for some $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$. A similar finiteness result is established for another notion of entanglement entropy introduced in this paper. We conclude with remarks for future work in this direction.</description>

      <title>Involutive Markov categories and the quantum de Finetti theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09666v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Markov categories have recently emerged as a powerful high-level framework for probability theory and theoretical statistics. Here we study a quantum version of this concept, called involutive Markov categories. These are equivalent to Parzygnat's quantum Markov categories, but we argue that they offer a simpler and more practical approach. Our main examples of involutive Markov categories have pre-C*-algebras, including infinite-dimensional ones, as objects, together with completely positive unital maps as morphisms in the picture of interest. In this context, we prove a quantum de Finetti theorem for both the minimal and the maximal C*-tensor norms, and we develop a categorical description of such quantum de Finetti theorems which amounts to a universal property of state spaces.</description>

      <title>Quantum graphs of homomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a category $\mathsf{qGph}$ of quantum graphs, whose definition is motivated entirely from noncommutative geometry. For all quantum graphs $G$ and $H$ in $\mathsf{qGph}$, we then construct a quantum graph $[G,H]$ of homomorphisms from $G$ to $H$, making $\mathsf{qGph}$ a closed symmetric monoidal category. We prove that for all finite graphs $G$ and $H$, the quantum graph $[G,H]$ is nonempty iff the $(G,H)$-homomorphism game has a winning quantum strategy, directly generalizing the classical case.
  The finite quantum graphs in $\mathsf{qGph}$ are tracial, real, and self-adjoint, and the morphisms between them are CP morphisms that are adjoint to a unital $*$-homomorphism. We prove that Weaver's two notions of a CP morphism coincide in this context. We also include a short proof that every finite reflexive quantum graph is the confusability quantum graph of a quantum channel.</description>
