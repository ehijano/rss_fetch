      <title>JWST detections of amorphous and crystalline HDO ice toward massive protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims to utilize the increased sensitivity and resolution of the JWST to quantify the HDO/H$_{2}$O ratio in ices toward young stellar objects (YSOs) and to determine if the HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured in the gas phase toward massive YSOs (MYSOs) are representative of the ratios in their ice envelopes. Two protostars observed in the Investigating Protostellar Accretion (IPA) program using JWST NIRSpec were analyzed: HOPS 370, an intermediate-mass YSO (IMYSO), and IRAS 20126+4104, a MYSO. The HDO ice toward these sources was detected above the 3$\sigma$ level and quantified via its 4.1 $\mu$m band. The contributions from the CH$_{3}$OH combination modes to the observed optical depth in this spectral region were constrained via the CH$_{3}$OH 3.53 $\mu$m band to ensure that the integrated optical depth of the HDO feature was not overestimated. H$_{2}$O ice was quantified via its 3 $\mu$m band. From these fits, ice HDO/H$_{2}$O abundance ratios of 4.6$\pm$1.8$\times$10$^{-3}$ and 2.6$\pm$1.2$\times$10$^{-3}$ are obtained for HOPS 370 and IRAS 20126+4104, respectively. The simultaneous detections of both crystalline HDO and crystalline H$_{2}$O corroborate the assignment of the observed feature at 4.1 $\mu$m to HDO ice. The ice HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios are similar to the highest reported gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward MYSOs as well as the hot inner regions of isolated low-mass protostars, suggesting that at least some of the gas HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios measured toward massive hot cores are representative of the HDO/H$_{2}$O ratios in ices. The need for an H$_{2}$O-rich CH$_{3}$OH component in the CH$_{3}$OH ice analysis supports recent experimental and observational results that indicate that some CH$_{3}$OH ice may form prior to the CO freeze-out stage in H$_{2}$O-rich ice layers.</description>

      <title>Photometry of Saturated Stars with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a deep neural network (DNN) to obtain photometry of saturated stars in the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). The DNN can obtain unbiased photometry for stars from g=4 to 14 mag with a dispersion (15%-85% 1sigma range around median) of 0.12 mag for saturated (g&lt;11.5 mag) stars. More importantly, the light curve of a non-variable saturated star has a median dispersion of only 0.037 mag. The DNN light curves are, in many cases, spectacularly better than provided by the standard ASAS-SN pipelines. While the network was trained on g band data from only one of ASAS-SN's 20 cameras, initial experiments suggest that it can be used for any camera and the older ASAS-SN V band data as well. The dominant problems seem to be associated with correctable issues in the ASAS-SN data reduction pipeline for saturated stars more than the DNN itself. The method is publicly available as a light curve option on ASAS-SN Sky Patrol v1.0.</description>

      <title>Stellar atmospheric parameters of $\sim$ 11,000 RR Lyrae stars from LAMOST Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate determination of the stellar atmospheric parameters of RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) requires short individual exposures of the spectra to mitigate pulsation effects. We present improved template matching methods to determine the stellar atmospheric parameters of RRLs from single-epoch spectra of LAMOST (Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, also known as the Guoshoujing telescope). We determine the radial velocities and stellar atmospheric parameters (effective temperature: $T_\mathrm{eff}$, surface gravity: $\log{g}$, and metallicity: [M/H]) of 10,486 and 1,027 RRLs from 42,729 low-resolution spectra (LRS) and 7,064 medium-resolution spectra (MRS) of LAMOST, respectively. Our results are in good agreement with the parameters of other databases, where the external uncertainties of $T_\mathrm{eff}$, $\log{g}$, and [M/H] for LRS/MRS are estimated to be 314/274 K, 0.42/0.29 dex, and 0.39/0.31 dex, respectively. We conclude with the variation characteristics of the radial velocities ($RV$) and stellar atmospheric parameters for RRLs during the pulsation phase. There is a significant difference of $28\pm21$ km/s between the peak-to-peak amplitude ($A_\mathrm{ptp}$) of $RV$ from H$\alpha$ line ($RV_\mathrm{H\alpha}$) and from metal lines ($RV_\mathrm{metal}$) for RRab, whereas it is only $4\pm17$ km/s for RRc. The $A_\mathrm{ptp}$ of $T_\mathrm{eff}$ is $930\pm456$ and $409\pm375$ K for RRab and RRc, respectively. The $\log{g}$ of RRab show mild variation of approximately $0.23\pm0.42$ dex near the phase of $\varphi = 0.9$, while that of RRc almost remains constant. The [M/H] of RRab and RRc show a minor variation of about $0.25\pm0.50$ and $0.28\pm0.55$ dex, respectively, near the phase of $\varphi = 0.9$.</description>

      <title>Synthetic stellar spectra to study multiple populations in globular clusters: an extended grid and the effects on the integrated light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most Galactic Globular Clusters (GCs) harbour multiple populations of stars (MPs), composed of at least two generations: the first characterized by a "standard" $\alpha$-enhanced metal mixture, as observed in field halo stars of the Milky Way, and the second displaying anti-correlated CN--ONa chemical abundance pattern in combination with an enhanced helium fraction. Adequate collections of stellar spectra are needed to characterize the effect of such stellar abundance changes on the integrated light of GCs. We present a grid of synthetic stellar spectra covering the atmospheric parameters relevant to old stellar populations at four subsolar metallicities and two abundance patterns, representative of first- and second-generations of stars in GCs. Integrated spectra of populations were computed using our stellar grid and empirical stellar populations, namely, colour-magnitude diagrams from literature for Galactic GCs. The spectra range from 290 to 1000nm, where we measured the effect on several spectrophotometric indices due to the surface abundance variations attributed to MPs. We find non-negligible effects of the MPs on spectroscopic indices sensitive to C, N, Ca, or Na, and on Balmer indices; we also describe how MPs modify specific regions in the near-UV and near-IR that can be measured with narrow or medium photometric passbands. The effects vary with metallicity. A number of these changes remain detectable even when accounting for the stochastic fluctuations due to the finite nature of the stellar population cluster.</description>

      <title>Quasi-equilibrium chemical evolution in starless cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chemistry of H2O, CO and other small molecular species in an isolated pre-stellar core, L1544, has been assessed in the context of a comprehensive gas-grain chemical model, coupled to an empirically constrained physical/dynamical model. Our main findings are (i) that the chemical network remains in near equilibrium as the core evolves towards star formation and the molecular abundances change in response to the evolving physical conditions. The gas-phase abundances at any time can be calculated accurately with equilibrium chemistry, and the concept of chemical clocks is meaningless in molecular clouds with similar conditions and dynamical time scales, and (ii) A comparison of the results of complex and simple chemical networks indicates that the abundances of the dominant oxygen and carbon species, H2O, CO, C, and C+ are reasonably approximated by simple networks. In chemical equilibrium, the time-dependent differential terms vanish and a simple network reduces to a few algebraic equations. This allows rapid calculation of the abundances most responsible for spectral line radiative cooling in molecular clouds with long dynamical time scales. The dust ice mantles are highly structured and the ice layers retain a memory of the gas-phase abundances at the time of their deposition. A complex (gas-phase and gas-grain) chemical structure therefore exists, with cosmic-ray induced processes dominating in the inner regions. The inferred H2O abundance profiles for L1544 require that the outer parts of the core and also any medium exterior to the core are essentially transparent to the interstellar radiation field.</description>

      <title>Kepler main-sequence solar-like stars: surface rotation and magnetic-activity evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the mission's primary goal was focused on exoplanet detection and characterization, Kepler made and continues to make extraordinary advances in stellar physics. Stellar rotation and magnetic activity are no exceptions. Kepler allowed for these properties to be determined for tens of thousands of stars from the main sequence up to the red giant branch. From photometry, this can be achieved by investigating the brightness fluctuations due to active regions, which cause surface inhomogeneities, or through asteroseismology as oscillation modes are sensitive to rotation and magnetic fields. This review summarizes the rotation and magnetic activity properties of the single main-sequence solar-like stars within the Kepler field. We contextualize the Kepler sample by comparing it to known transitions in the stellar rotation and magnetic-activity evolution, such as the convergence to the rotation sequence (from the saturated to the unsaturated regime of magnetic activity) and the Vaughan-Preston gap. While reviewing the publicly available data, we also uncover one interesting finding related to the intermediate-rotation gap seen in Kepler and other surveys. We find evidence for this rotation gap in previous ground-based data for the X-ray luminosity. Understanding the complex evolution and interplay between rotation and magnetic activity in solar-like stars is crucial, as it sheds light on fundamental processes governing stellar evolution, including the evolution of our own Sun.</description>

      <title>Host Stars and How Their Compositions Influence Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has become a common practice within the exoplanet field to say that "to know the star is to know the planet." The properties of the host star have a strong, direct influence on the interior and surface conditions of the orbiting planet and oftentimes measurements of planetary properties are made relative to the star's properties. Not only are observational measurements of the star necessary to determine even the most basic aspects of the planet (such as mass and radius), but the stellar environment influences how the planet evolves. Therefore, in this chapter, we begin by discussing the basics of stars, providing an overview of stellar formation, structure, photon and particle emissions, and evolution. Next, we go over the possible ways to determine the age of a star. We then outline how different kinds of stars are distributed within the Milky Way galaxy. Afterwards, we explain how to measure the composition of stars and the underlying math inherent to those observations, including caveats that are important when using the data for research applications. Finally, we explain the underlying physics and observations that enable stellar composition to be used as a proxy for planetary composition. In addition, given that this chapter focuses more on astronomy/astrophysics and uses a variety of important terms that may not be familiar to all readers, we have defined many terms either within the text or as a footnote for better interdisciplinary comprehension.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets are formed inside disks around young stars. The gas, dust, and ice in these natal disks are the building materials of planets, and therefore their compositions fundamentally shape the final chemical compositions of planets. In this review, we summarize current observations of molecular lines in protoplanetary disks, from near-infrared to millimeter wavelengths. We discuss the basic types of chemical reactions in disks and the current development of chemical modeling. In particular, we highlight the progress made in understanding snowline locations, abundances of main carriers of carbon, oxygen, and nitrogen, and complex organic molecules in disks. Finally, we discuss efforts to trace planet formation history by combining the understanding of disk chemistry and planet formation processes.</description>

      <title>Meteorites and Planet Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meteorites are a remarkable resource. They capture the imagination of people worldwide with their spectacular entry through Earth's atmosphere as fireballs, and their exotic character of being pieces of other worlds. Scientifically, they are critical to interpreting the early stages of formation of the Solar System, as well as the geological evolution of asteroids, the Moon, and Mars, and they are vital to understanding planetary formation processes. With the burgeoning exploration of extrasolar planetary systems, knowledge of the fundamental process of planetary growth from protoplanetary disks has taken on a new significance. Meteorites provide essential and detailed insight into the formation of planetary systems, although we must bear in mind that they only represent one reference point (our own Solar System) in what is clearly a wide spectrum of possible chemical and physical parameters governing the diverse realm of extrasolar planets. This chapter summarises the nature of our meteorite collections, and the ways in which meteorites contribute to our understanding of the formation and evolution of our own Solar System, with broader implications for planetary systems in general.</description>

      <title>The chemistry of extra-solar materials from white dwarf planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf planetary systems provide a unique way to measure the bulk composition of exoplanetary material. Extrasolar asteroids/comets/moons which have survived the evolution of their host star can end up in the atmosphere of the white dwarf. Asteroids and boulders appear to be the most common pollutants, where we use the term "asteroids" to refer to the parent body that is polluting the atmosphere. The presence of the planetary material is detected via absorption lines of heavy elements. White dwarfs with these absorption features are called "polluted" white dwarfs. Polluted white dwarfs were expected to be rare objects because white dwarfs have high surface gravities, therefore, these heavy elements will settle out of the white dwarf's atmospheres in a short amount of time (Paquette et al. 1986). However, high-resolution spectroscopic surveys found that 25-50% of white dwarfs are polluted (Zuckerman et al. 2003, 2010; Koester et al. 2014). The mechanism responsible for making a polluted white dwarf must be common and efficient. There is strong theoretical and observational evidence that white dwarfs are accreting from planetary material. There are different mechanisms that can deliver exoplanetary material into the Roche lobe of the white dwarf. Debris disks, transits from disintegrating bodies, and intact planets have all been detected around white dwarfs (e.g., Jura et al. 2007; Vanderburg et al. 2015, 2020). This chapter will describe how the chemical autopsies are conducted, and what is learnt about exoplanetary material from polluted white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Mineralogy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter begins with some basic concepts regarding the structure and mineralogy of rocky planets, how to read and construct ternary diagrams, and why partial melting occurs when plate tectonics is operative. Partial melting is a key concept in that it governs crust and core formation, which in turn control mineralogy. These sections are for astronomers, or geologists new to the study of igneous petrology. From there, computational approaches for estimating planetary mineral assemblages will be introduced. These quantitative methods are simple, consonant with the level of information currently available on exoplanet compositions, and while largely intended for mineralogists, should be accessible to non-specialists as well. Such methods are followed by a study of error when plotting mineral abundances in ternary diagrams, for mineralogists and petrologists who construct such diagrams. The chapter concludes with caveats, and the ways in which exoplanets might surprise us.</description>

      <title>From stars to diverse mantles, melts, crusts and atmospheres of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This review is focused on describing the logic by which we make predictions of exoplanetary compositions and mineralogies, and how these processes could lead to compositional diversity among rocky exoplanets. We use these predictions to determine the sensitivity of present-day and future observations to detecting compositional differences between rocky exoplanets and the four terrestrial planets. First, we review data on stellar abundances and infer how changes in composition may manifest themselves in the expected bulk compositions of rocky exoplanets (section 2). Converting this information in mass-radius relationships requires calculation of the stable mineral assemblages at a given temperature-pressure-composition (T-P-X), an exercise we describe in section 3. Should the planet be hot enough to engender partial melting of the mantle, then these liquids are likely to rise to the surface and erupt to form planetary crusts; the possible compositional and mineralogical variability of which we examine in section 4. Finally, the expected spectroscopic responses of such crusts are examined in section 5.</description>

      <title>Some Tectonic Concepts Relevant to the Study of Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We'll examine plate tectonics on Earth -- its features and forces -- and examine some concepts that may allow astronomers to ask useful questions regarding numeric models that putatively predict tectonic activity. But exo-planetologists should be aware that geologists are still attempting to understand: why does Earth operates as it does, and so much differently than its neighbors? Has it always operated this way and have other planets of the inner Solar System ever mimicked Earth's behavior in their past? These problems are unsolved, though some interesting speculative notions have emerged. Studies by Foley et al. et al. (2012) and Weller and Lenardic (2018), for example, attempt to distill the essential planetary properties that may influence if not dictate possible tectonic states, while Yin et al. (2016) propose a model of planetary tectonic surface features that appears remarkably precise. These studies yield some compelling expedients for analyses of planetary objects both within and outside our Solar System.</description>

Abstract: Planetary magnetic fields are important indicators of planetary processes and evolution, from a planet's outer core to its surface (if it possesses one) to its atmosphere and near-space environment. Magnetic fields are most directly measured in situ, and determining whether distant planetary objects possess magnetic fields can be challenging. At present we have no unambiguous measurements of magnetic fields on exoplanets. Nevertheless, it would be surprising if at least some exoplanets did not generate a magnetic field, like many planetary bodies in the solar system. This chapter provides an overview of the current understanding of exoplanetary magnetic fields and their consequences. In the next section we review the current understanding of planetary dynamo generation as it applies to solar system objects and discuss the implications for exoplanetary magnetic field generation. Following this, we describe seven methods for determining the existence and strength of an exoplanetary magnetic field and discuss the near-term prospects for each method. We close by highlighting four main consequences of exoplanetary magnetic fields for a planet and its evolution.</description>

      <title>Transiting Exoplanet Atmospheres in the Era of JWST</title>

Abstract: The field of exoplanet atmospheric characterization has recently made considerable advances with the advent of high-resolution spectroscopy from large ground-based telescopes and the commissioning of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We have entered an era in which atmospheric compositions, aerosol properties, thermal structures, mass loss, and three-dimensional effects can be reliably constrained. While the challenges of remote sensing techniques imply that individual exoplanet atmospheres will likely never be characterized to the degree of detail that is possible for solar system bodies, exoplanets present an exciting opportunity to characterize a diverse array of worlds with properties that are not represented in our solar system. This review article summarizes the current state of exoplanet atmospheric studies for transiting planets. We focus on how observational results inform our understanding of exoplanet properties and ultimately address broad questions about planetary formation, evolution, and diversity. This review is meant to provide an overview of the exoplanet atmospheres field for planetary- and geo-scientists without astronomy backgrounds, and exoplanet specialists, alike. We give special attention to the first year of JWST data and recent results in high-resolution spectroscopy that have not been summarized by previous review articles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This chapter reviews proposed exoplanet biosignatures, including their biological origins, observable features, atmospheric sinks, and potentially confounding abiotic sources. Emphasis is placed on material published since past comprehensive reviews while providing a foundational understanding of each named biosignature. Topics include possible gaseous biosignatures (e.g., O$_2$, O$_3$, CH$_4$, N$_2$O, DMS, CH$_3$Cl, C$_5$H$_8$, NH$_3$, PH$_3$), surface biosignatures (e.g., vegetation red edge, other pigment features, polarization signatures), and temporal biosignatures (e.g., atmospheric seasonality). Potential frameworks for assessing remote biosignatures are described. Text and table summaries provide references to relevant original research articles.</description>

      <title>The early Earth as an analogue for exoplanetary biogeochemistry</title>

Abstract: Planet Earth has evolved from an entirely anoxic planet with possibly a different tectonic regime to the oxygenated world with horizontal plate tectonics that we know today. For most of this time, Earth has been inhabited by a purely microbial biosphere albeit with seemingly increasing complexity over time. A rich record of this geobiological evolution over most of Earth's history provides insights into the remote detectability of microbial life under a variety of planetary conditions. We leverage Earth's geobiological record with the aim of a) illustrating the current state of knowledge and key knowledge gaps about the early Earth as a reference point in exoplanet science research; b) compiling biotic and abiotic mechanisms that controlled the evolution of the atmosphere over time; and c) reviewing current constraints on the detectability of Earth's early biosphere with state-of-the-art telescope technology. We highlight that life may have originated on a planet with a different tectonic regime and strong hydrothermal activity, and under these conditions, biogenic CH$_4$ gas was perhaps the most detectable atmospheric biosignature. Oxygenic photosynthesis, which is responsible for essentially all O$_2$ gas in the modern atmosphere, appears to have emerged concurrently with the establishment of modern plate tectonics and the continental crust, but O$_2$ accumulation to modern levels only occurred late in Earth's history, perhaps tied to the rise of land plants. Nutrient limitation in anoxic oceans, promoted by hydrothermal Fe = fluxes, may have limited biological productivity and O$_2$ production. N$_2$O is an alternative biosignature that was perhaps significant on the redox-stratified Proterozoic Earth. We conclude that the detectability of atmospheric biosignatures on Earth was not only dependent on biological evolution but also strongly controlled by the evolving tectonic context.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Geology: What can we learn from current and future observations?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nearly 30 years after the discovery of the first exoplanet around a main sequence star, thousands of planets have now been confirmed. These discoveries have completely revolutionized our understanding of planetary systems, revealing types of planets that do not exist in our solar system but are common in extrasolar systems, and a wide range of system architectures. Our solar system is clearly not the default for planetary systems. The community is now moving beyond basic characterization of exoplanets (mass, radius, and orbits) towards a deeper characterization of their atmospheres and even surfaces. With improved observational capabilities there is potential to now probe the geology of rocky exoplanets; this raises the possibility of an analogous revolution in our understanding of rocky planet evolution. However, characterizing the geology or geological processes occurring on rocky exoplanets is a major challenge, even with next generation telescopes. This chapter reviews what we may be able to accomplish with these efforts in the near-term and long-term. In the near-term, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is revealing which rocky planets lose versus retain their atmospheres. This chapter discusses the implications of such discoveries, including how even planets with no or minimal atmospheres can still provide constraints on surface geology and long-term geological evolution. Longer-term possibilities are then reviewed, including whether the hypothesis of climate stabilization by the carbonate-silicate cycle can be tested by next generation telescopes. New modeling strategies sweeping through ranges of possibly evolutionary scenarios will be needed to use the current and future observations to constrain rocky exoplanet geology and evolution.</description>

      <title>The Gravity Collective: A Comprehensive Analysis of the Electromagnetic Search for the Binary Neutron Star Merger GW190425</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an ultraviolet-to-infrared search for the electromagnetic (EM) counterpart to GW190425, the second-ever binary neutron star (BNS) merger discovered by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration (LVK). GW190425 was more distant and had a larger localization area than GW170817, therefore we use a new tool teglon to redistribute the GW190425 localization probability in the context of galaxy catalogs within the final localization volume. We derive a 90th percentile area of 6,688 deg$^{2}$, a $\sim$1.5$\times$ improvement relative to the LIGO/Virgo map, and show how teglon provides an order of magnitude boost to the search efficiency of small ($\leq$1 deg$^{2}$) field-of-view instruments. We combine our data with all publicly reported imaging data, covering 9,078.59 deg$^2$ of unique area and 48.13% of the LIGO/Virgo-assigned localization probability, to calculate the most comprehensive kilonova, short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) afterglow, and model-independent constraints on the EM emission from a hypothetical counterpart to GW190425 to date under the assumption that no counterpart was found in these data. If the counterpart were similar to AT 2017gfo, there was a 28.4% chance that it would have been detected in the combined dataset. We are relatively insensitive to an on-axis sGRB, and rule out a generic transient with a similar peak luminosity and decline rate as AT 2017gfo to 30% confidence. Finally, across our new imaging and all publicly-reported data, we find 28 candidate optical counterparts that we cannot rule out as being associated with GW190425, finding that 4 such counterparts discovered within the localization volume and within 5 days of merger exhibit luminosities consistent with a kilonova.</description>

      <title>A New Parameterization for Finding Solutions for Microlensing Exoplanet Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gravitational microlensing method of discovering exoplanets and multi-star systems can produce degenerate solutions, some of which require in-depth analysis to uncover. We propose a new parameter space that can be used to sample potential solutions more efficiently and is more robust at finding all degenerate solutions. We identified two new parameters, k and h, that can be sampled in place of the mass ratios and separations of the systems under analysis to identify degenerate solutions. The parameter k is related to the size of the central caustic, $\Delta\xi_c$, while h is related to the distance of a point along the k contour from log(s)=0, where s is the projected planet-host separation. In this work, we present the characteristics of these parameters and the tests we conducted to prove their efficacy.</description>

      <title>NGC1856: Using machine learning techniques to uncover detailed stellar abundances from MUSE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of the novel approach based on data-driven machine learning methods applied to \textit{Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer} (MUSE) field data to derive stellar abundances of star clusters. MUSE has been used to target more than 10,000 fields, and it is unique in its ability to study dense stellar fields such as stellar clusters providing spectra for each individual star. We use MUSE data of the extragalactic young stellar cluster NGC 1856, located in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We present the individual stellar [Fe/H] abundance of 327 cluster members in addition to [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [C/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe] abundances of subsample sets. Our results match the LMC abundances obtained in the literature for [Mg/Fe], [Ti/Fe], [Ni/Fe], and [Cr/Fe]. This study is the first to derive [Si/Fe] and [C/Fe] abundances for this cluster. The revolutionary combination of integral-field spectroscopy and data-driven modeling will allow us to understand the chemical enrichment of star clusters and their host galaxies in greater detail expanding our understanding of galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>High Contrast, High Angular Resolution Optical Speckle Imaging: Uncovering Hidden Stellar Companions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility of detecting very faint, very close-in stellar companions using large aperture ground-based telescopes and the technique of optical speckle imaging. We examine the state of high angular resolution speckle imaging and contrast levels being achieved using current speckle cameras on the Gemini 8-m telescope. We then explore the use of the modern image reconstruction technique - Multi-Frame Blind Deconvolution (MFBD) - applied to speckle imaging from the Gemini 8-m telescope. We show that MFBD allows us to measure the flux ratio of the imaged stars to high accuracy and the reconstructed images yield higher precision astrometry. Both of these advances provide a large refinement in the derived astrophysical parameters compared with current Fourier techniques. MFBD image reconstructions reach contrast levels of $\sim$5$\times$10$^{-3}$, near the diffraction limit, to $\sim$10$^{-4}$ about 1.0 arcsec away. At these deep contrast levels with angular limits starting near the 8-m diffraction limit ($\sim$20 mas), most stellar companions to a solar-like stars can be imaged in the optical to near-IR bandpass (320-1000 nm).</description>

      <title>Planet formation -- observational constraints, physical processes, and compositional patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of planet formation as a field of study is not only to provide the understanding of how planets come into existence. It is also an interdisciplinary bridge which links astronomy to geology and mineralogy. Recent observations of young stars accompanied by their protoplanetary disks (Manara et al. 2022) provide direct insights into the conditions at which planets are forming. These astronomical observations can be taken as initial conditions for the models of planet formation. In this chapter, we first give an brief overview of key observational constraints for planet formation theory derived from both the solar system and from the exoplanet population. We then review physical mechanisms governing planetary system formation and discuss how they can be put together to form global planet formation models. Finally, we discuss how the compositional links from protoplanetary disks to planetary atmospheres put novel constraints on planet formation theory. In particular, we are currently gaining insights into the composition of the inner, planet-forming region within the disks thanks to observations from the James Webb Space Telescope (Grant et al. 2023; Perotti et al. 2023). The task for planet formation modelling is then to link these observational properties and compositional content to the physical properties, and also the elementary inventory of meteorites, the Moon, Earth, and the other planets. If successful, this global approach can provide useful constraints for geological studies.</description>

      <title>CAI formation in the early Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ca-Al-rich inclusions (CAIs) are the oldest dated solid materials in the solar system, found as light-coloured crystalline ingredients in meteorites. Their formation time is commonly associated with age zero of the Solar System. Yet, the physical and chemical processes that once led to the formation of these sub-millimetre to centimetre-sized mineral particles in the early solar nebula are still a matter of debate. This paper proposes a pathway to form such inclusions during the earliest phases of disc evolution. We combine 1D viscous disc evolutionary models with 2D radiative transfer, equilibrium condensation, and new dust opacity calculations. We show that the viscous heating associated with the high accretion rates in the earliest evolutionary phases causes the midplane inside of about 0.5 au to heat up to limiting temperatures of about 1500-1700 K, but no further. These high temperatures force all refractory material components of the inherited interstellar dust grains to sublimate - except for a few Al-Ca-Ti oxides such as Al2O3, Ca2Al2SiO7, and CaTiO3. Once the Mg-Fe silicates are gone, the dust becomes more transparent and the heat is more efficiently transported to the disc surface, which prevents any further warm-up. This thermostat mechanism keeps these minerals above their annealing temperature for hundreds of thousands of years, which creates large, pure and crystalline particles. These particles are dragged out by the viscously spreading disc. Beyond about 0.5 au, the silicates re-condense on the Ca-Al-rich particles, adding an amorphous silicate matrix. We estimate that this mechanism to produce CAIs works during the first 50000 years of disc evolution. These particles then continue to move outward and populate the entire disc up to radii of about 50 au, before, eventually, the accretion rate subsides, the disc cools, and the particles start to drift inwards.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent model for dust settling and the vertical shear instability in protoplanetary disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial distribution of dust particles in protoplanetary disks affects dust evolution and planetesimal formation processes. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is one of the candidate hydrodynamic mechanisms that can generate turbulence in the outer disk region and affect dust diffusion. Turbulence driven by the VSI has a predominant vertical motion that can prevent dust settling. On the other hand, the dust distribution controls the spatial distribution of the gas cooling rate, thereby affecting the strength of VSI-driven turbulence. Here, we present a semi-analytic model that determines the vertical dust distribution and the strength of VSI-driven turbulence in a self-consistent manner. The model uses an empirical formula for the vertical diffusion coefficient in VSI-driven turbulence obtained from our recent hydrodynamical simulations. The formula returns the vertical diffusion coefficient as a function of the vertical profile of the cooling rate, which is determined by the vertical dust distribution. We use this model to search for an equilibrium vertical dust profile where settling balances with turbulent diffusion for a given maximum grain size. We find that if the grains are sufficiently small, there exists a stable equilibrium dust distribution where VSI-driven turbulence is sustained at a level of alpha_z ~ 10^{-3}, where alpha_z is the dimensionless vertical diffusion coefficient. However, as the maximum grain size increases, the equilibrium solution vanishes because the VSI can no longer stop the settling of the grains. This runaway settling may explain highly settled dust rings found in the outer part of some protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>Thermal baroclinic instabilities in accretion disks I: Combined dispersion relation for Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke Instability and Convective Overstability in disks around young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the Goldreich-Schubert-Fricke instability (GSF) and the convective overstability (COS) in the context of baroclinic thermal instabilities in rotating disks around young stars. The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a global extension of the GSF that affects geometrically thin disks but follows the same stability criterion. The COS, on the other hand, also possesses a twin for stellar interiors, specifically, Shibahashi's vibrational stability of rotating stars. We derive a combined dispersion relation for GSF and COS with arbitrary cooling times for local perturbations and determine a new stability criterion beyond the Solberg-H{\o}iland\ criterion. The paper shows that in extension to the stability criterion for the vertically unstratified case ($N^2_R &gt; 0$), one also needs a barotropic disk structure to ensure stability towards COS modes. We demonstrate that a baroclinic disk atmosphere always has a buoyantly unstable direction, although not necessarily in the radial nor vertical direction. The paper predicts that for cooling times longer than the critical cooling time for VSI, GSF modes will always be accompanied by COS modes of similar growth rate. The numerical companion paper II tests the predictions of growth rates from this paper.</description>

      <title>Identification of the weak-to-strong transition in Alfv\'enic turbulence from space plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasma turbulence is a ubiquitous dynamical process that transfers energy across many spatial and temporal scales in astrophysical and space plasma systems. Although the theory of anisotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence has successfully described phenomena in nature, its core prediction of an Alfvenic transition from weak to strong MHD turbulence when energy cascades from large to small scales has not been observationally confirmed. Here we report the first observational evidence for the Alfvenic weak-to-strong transition in MHD turbulence in the terrestrial magnetosheath using the four Cluster spacecraft. The observed transition indicates the universal existence of strong turbulence regardless of the initial level of MHD fluctuations. Moreover, the observations demonstrate that the nonlinear interactions of MHD turbulence play a crucial role in the energy cascade, widening the directions of the energy cascade and broadening the fluctuating frequencies. Our work takes a critical step toward understanding the complete picture of turbulence cascade, connecting the weak and strong MHD turbulence systems. It will have broad implications in star formation, energetic particle transport, turbulent dynamo, and solar corona or solar wind heating.</description>

      <title>The SN 2023ixf Progenitor in M101: II. Properties</title>

Abstract: We follow our first paper with an analysis of the ensemble of the extensive pre-explosion ground- and space-based infrared observations of the red supergiant (RSG) progenitor candidate for the nearby core-collapse supernova SN 2023ixf in Messier 101, together with optical data prior to explosion obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We have confirmed the association of the progenitor candidate with the SN, as well as constrained the metallicity at the SN site, based on SN observations with instruments at Gemini-North. The internal host extinction to the SN has also been confirmed from a high-resolution Keck spectrum. We fit the observed spectral energy distribution (SED) for the star, accounting for its intrinsic variability, with dust radiative-transfer modeling, which assume a silicate-rich dust shell ahead of the underlying stellar photosphere. The star is heavily dust-obscured, likely the dustiest progenitor candidate yet encountered. We found median estimates of the star's effective temperature and luminosity of 2770 K and 9.0e4 L_Sun, with 68% credible intervals of 2340--3150 K and (7.5--10.9)e4 L_sun. The candidate may have a Galactic RSG analog, IRC -10414, with a strikingly similar SED and luminosity. Via comparison with single-star evolutionary models we have constrained the initial mass of the progenitor candidate from 12 M_sun to as high as 14 M_sun. We have had available to us an extraordinary view of the SN 2023ixf progenitor candidate, which should be further followed up in future years with HST and the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>Investigating Protostellar Accretion-Driven Outflows Across the Mass Spectrum: JWST NIRSpec IFU 3-5~$\mu$m Spectral Mapping of Five Young Protostars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03803</link>

Abstract: Investigating Protostellar Accretion is a Cycle 1 JWST program using the NIRSpec+MIRI integral field units to obtain 2.9--28 $\mu$m spectral cubes of five young protostars with luminosities of 0.2-10,000 L$_{\odot}$ in their primary accretion phase. This paper introduces the NIRSpec 2.9--5.3 $\mu$m data of the inner 840-9000 au with spatial resolutions from 28-300 au. The spectra show rising continuum emission; deep ice absorption; emission from H$_{2}$, H~I, and [Fe~II]; and the CO fundamental series in emission and absorption. Maps of the continuum emission show scattered light cavities for all five protostars. In the cavities, collimated jets are detected in [Fe~II] for the four $&lt; 320$~L$_{\odot}$ protostars, two of which are additionally traced in Br-$\alpha$. Knots of [Fe~II] emission are detected toward the most luminous protostar, and knots of [FeII] emission with dynamical times of $&lt; 30$~yrs are found in the jets of the others. While only one jet is traced in H$_2$, knots of H$_2$ and CO are detected in the jets of four protostars. H$_2$ is seen extending through the cavities, showing that they are filled by warm molecular gas. Bright H$_2$ emission is seen along the walls of a single cavity, while in three cavities narrow shells of H$_2$ emission are found, one of which has an [Fe~II] knot at its apex. These data show cavities containing collimated jets traced in atomic/ionic gas surrounded by warm molecular gas in a wide-angle wind and/or gas accelerated by bow shocks in the jets.</description>

      <title>Retrievals of Protoplanetary Disk Parameters using Thermochemical Models: I. Disk Gas Mass from Hydrogen Deuteride Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss statistical relationships between the mass of protoplanetary disks and the hydrogen deuteride (HD) line emission and the dust spectral energy distribution (SED) determined using 3000 ProDiMo disk models. The models have 15 free parameters describing disk physical properties, the central star, and the local radiation field. The sampling of physical parameters is done using a Monte Carlo approach to evaluate the probability density functions of observables as a function of physical parameters. We find that the HD fractional abundance is almost constant even though the UV flux varies by several orders of magnitude. Probing the statistical relation between the physical quantities and the HD flux, we find that low-mass (optically thin) disks display a tight correlation between the average disk gas temperature and HD line flux, while massive disks show no such correlation. We demonstrate that the central star luminosity, disk size, dust size distribution, and HD flux may be used to determine the disk gas mass to within a factor of three. We also find that the far-IR and sub-mm/mm SEDs and the HD flux may serve as strong constraints for determining the disk gas mass to within a factor of two. If the HD lines are fully spectrally resolved ($R\gtrsim 1.5\times10^6, \Delta v=0.2~\rm km\,s^{-1}$), the 56 $\mu$m and 112 $\mu$m HD line profiles alone may constrain the disk gas mass to within a factor of two.</description>

      <title>Dracula's Chivito: discovery of a large edge-on protoplanetary disk with Pan-STARRS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the serendipitous discovery of a large edge-on protoplanetary disk associated with the infrared source IRAS 23077+6707. The disk's apparent size in the Pan-STARRS (PS1) images is ~11", making this one of the largest known disks on the sky. It is likely a young system, still surrounded by the envelope which is very faint but still visible in the PS1 images in the northern part (alternatively this structure could be filaments from the disk itself). We use the PS1 magnitudes and other available photometric data to construct the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the disk. An optical spectrum indicates that the obscured star is hot, most likely late A. We adopt a distance of 300 pc for this object based on Gaia DR3 extinctions. We model the system using the HOCHUNK3D radiative transfer software and find that the system is consistent with a hot star of effective temperature 8000 K surrounded by a disk of size 1650 AU and mass 0.2 M_solar at inclination 82 degrees.</description>

      <title>Constraining stellar tidal quality factors from planet-induced stellar spin-up</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04047v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamical evolution of tight star-planet systems is influenced by tidal interactions between the star and the planet, as was shown recently. The rate at which spins and orbits in such a system evolve depends on the stellar and planetary tidal dissipation efficiency. Here, we present a method to constrain the modified tidal quality factor $Q'_*$ of a planet-hosting star whose rotational evolution has been altered by its planet through angular momentum transfer from the planetary orbital motion to the rotation of the stellar convective zone. The altered rotation is estimated from an observed discrepancy of magnetic activity of the planet-hosting star and a coeval companion star, i.e. this method is applicable to star-planet systems with wide stellar companions. We give an example of the planet-hosting wide binary system HD189733 and find that the planet host's modified tidal quality factor is constrained to be $Q'_* \leq 2.33 \times 10^7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.08767v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding stellar evolution and its effect on planetary systems is crucial for correctly interpreting the chemical constraints of exo-planetary material that can be given to us by white dwarfs. This article will describe how asteroids, moons, and comets, as well as boulders, pebbles and dust, evolve into eventual targets for chemical spectroscopy, and how planets and companion stars play a vital role in reshaping system architectures for this purpose.</description>

      <title>The Multilayer Nature of Molecular Gas toward the Cygnus Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00061v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the physical properties and 3D distribution of molecular clouds (MCs) toward the Cygnus region using the MWISP CO survey and Gaia DR3 data. Based on Gaussian decomposition and clustering for $\rm ^{13}CO$ lines, over 70% of the fluxes are recovered. With the identification result of $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures, two models are designed to measure the distances of the molecular gas in velocity crowding regions. The distances of more than 200 large $\rm ^{13}CO$ structures are obtained toward the 150 square degree region. Additionally, tens of the identified MC structures coincide well with masers and/or intense mid-IR emission. We find multiple gas layers toward the region: (1) the extensive gas structures composing the Cygnus Rift from 700 pc to 1 kpc across the whole region; (2) the $\sim$ 1.3 kpc gas layer mainly in the Cygnus X South region; and (3) the 1.5 kpc dense filament at the Cygnus X North region and many cometary clouds shaped by Cygnus OB2. We also note that the spatial distribution of YSO candidates is generally consistent with the molecular gas structures. The total molecular mass of the Cygnus region is estimated to be $\sim 2.7\times10^{6}~M_{\odot}$ assuming an X-factor ratio $X_{\rm CO} = 2 \times 10^{20} \rm cm^{-2} (K\cdot km\cdot s^{-1})^{-1}$. The foreground Cygnus Rift contributes $\sim$25% of the molecular mass in the whole region. Our work presents a new 3D view of the MCs' distribution toward the Cygnus X region, as well as the exact molecular gas mass distribution in the foreground Cygnus Rift.</description>

      <title>The 33 M$_\odot$ black hole Gaia BH3 is part of the disrupted ED-2 star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaia Collaboration has recently reported the detection of a 33 M$_\odot$ black hole in a wide binary system located in the Solar neighbourhood. Here we explore the relationship between this black hole, known as Gaia BH3, and the nearby ED-2 halo stellar stream. We study the orbital characteristics of the Gaia BH3 binary and present measurements of the chemical abundances of ED-2 member stars derived from high-resolution spectra obtained with the VLT. We find that the Galactic orbit of the Gaia BH3 system and its metallicity are entirely consistent with being part of the ED-2 stream. The characteristics of the stream, particularly its negligible spread in metallicity and in other chemical elements as well as its single stellar population, suggest that it originated from a disrupted star cluster of low mass. Its age is comparable to that of the globular cluster M92 that has been estimated to be as old as the Universe. This is the first black hole unambiguously associated with a disrupted star cluster. We infer a plausible mass range for the cluster to be relatively narrow, between $2\times 10^3M_\odot$ and $4.2\times 10^4M_\odot$. This implies that the black hole could have formed directly from the collapse of a massive very-metal-poor star, but that the alternative scenario of binary interactions inside the cluster environment also deserves to be explored.</description>
