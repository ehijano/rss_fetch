      <title>Equivariant Localization of $K$-homological Euler Class for almost connected Lie Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Witten deformation and localization algebra techniques, we compute the $G$-equivariant $K$-homology class of the de Rham operator on a proper cocompact $G$-spin manifold, where $G$ is an almost connected Lie group. By applying a $G$-invariant Morse-Bott perturbation, this class is localized near the zero set of the perturbation and can be identified explicitly with an element in the representation rings associated to some isotropy subgroups. The result yields an equivariant Poincar\'e-Hopf formula and supplies concise tools for equivariant index computations.</description>

      <title>Multiplier varieties and multiplier algebras of CNP Dirichlet series kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate isometric and algebraic isomorphism problems for multiplier algebras associated with Hilbert spaces of Dirichlet series whose kernels possess the complete Nevanlinna-Pick (CNP) property. We begin by providing a complete characterization of all normalized CNP Dirichlet series kernels in terms of weight and frequency data. A central aspect of our work is the explicit determination of the multiplier varieties associated with CNP Dirichlet series kernels. We show that these varieties are defined by explicit polynomial equations derived from the arithmetic structure of the weight and frequency data associated with the kernel. This explicit description of multiplier varieties enables us to classify when the multiplier algebras of certain CNP Dirichlet series kernels are (isometrically) isomorphic. As an application, we resolve an open question posed by McCarthy and Shalit ([18]) in the negative.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform higher-rank lattices are character rigid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish character rigidity for all non-uniform higher-rank irreducible lattices in semisimple groups of characteristic other than 2. This implies stabilizer rigidity for probability measure preserving actions and rigidity of invariant random subgroups, confirming a conjecture of Stuck and Zimmer for non-uniform lattices in full generality.</description>

      <title>Complete Classification of Directed Quantum Graphs on M2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15534v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2022, Gromada and Matsuda classified undirected quantum graphs on the matrix algebra $M_2$. Later, Wasilweski provided a solid theory of directed quantum graphs which was formerly only established for undirected quantum graphs. Using this framework we extend the results of Matsuda and Gromada, and present a complete classification of directed quantum graphs on $M_2$. Most prominently, we observe that there is a far bigger range of directed quantum graphs than of undirected quantum graphs on $M_2$. Moreover, for quantum graphs on a nontracial quantum set $(M_2, \psi)$ we illustrate the difference between GNS- and KMS-undirected quantum graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary vertex operator algebras (VOAs) and conformal nets are the two most prominent mathematical axiomatizations of two-dimensional unitary chiral conformal field theories. They are conjectured to be equivalent, but a rigorous comparison has proven challenging. We resolve one direction of the conjecture by showing that every conformal net has an associated unitary VOA.</description>

      <title>The free energy of matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12948v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study multi-matrix models whose potentials are perturbations of the quadratic potential associated with independent GUE random matrices. More precisely, we compute the free energy and the expectation of the trace of polynomials evaluated in those matrices. We prove an asymptotic expansion in the inverse of the matrix dimension to any order. Out of this result we deduce new formulas for map enumerations and the microstates free entropy. Our approach is based on the interpolation method between random matrices and free operators developed in [9, 31].</description>

      <title>Finite Free Convolution: Infinitesimal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finite-free additive and multiplicative convolutions are operations on the set of polynomials with real roots, introduced independently by Szeg\"{o} and Walsh in the 1920s. These operations have regained some interest, in the last decade, after being rediscovered by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava as the expected characteristic polynomial of randomly rotated matrices. They converge, as the degree $d$ of the polynomials increases, to the additive and multiplicative convolution of measures from free probability of Voiculescu. In this paper, we investigate the fluctuations of order $1/d$ -- also known as infinitesimal distributions -- related to these two operations and their limiting behavior, providing a detailed description of their convergence. Our approach relies on understanding the infinitesimal moment-cumulant formulas and the corresponding functional relations. We also establish several applications and examples, including instances related to the infinitesimal free convolution of Belinschi and Shlyakhtenko, as well as the computation of infinitesimal distributions after differentiation of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Critical points of random polynomials and finite free cumulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08910v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A result of Hoskins and Steinerberger [Int. Math. Res. Not., (13):9784-9809, 2022] states that repeatedly differentiating a random polynomials with independent and identically distributed mean zero and variance one roots will result, after an appropriate rescaling, in a Hermite polynomial. We use the theory of finite free probability to extend this result in two natural directions: (1) We prove central limit theorems for the fluctuations around these deterministic limits for the polynomials and their roots. (2) We consider a generalized version of the Hoskins and Steinerberger result by removing the finite second moment assumption from the roots. In this case the Hermite polynomials are replaced by a random Appell sequence conveniently described through finite free probability and an infinitely divisible distribution. We use finite free cumulants to provide compact proofs of our main results with little prerequisite knowledge of free probability required.</description>
