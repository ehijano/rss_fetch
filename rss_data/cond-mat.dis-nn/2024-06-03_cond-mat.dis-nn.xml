      <title>Fate of many-body localization in an Abelian lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the fate of many-body localization (MBL) of mid-spectrum eigenstates of a matter-free $U(1)$ quantum-link gauge theory Hamiltonian with random couplings on ladder geometries. We specifically consider an intensive estimator, $\mathcal{D} \in [0,1/4]$, that acts as a measure of elementary plaquettes on the lattice being active or inert in mid-spectrum eigenstates as well as the concentration of these eigenstates in Fock space, with $\mathcal{D}$ being equal to its maximum value of $1/4$ for Fock states in the electric flux basis. We calculate its distribution, $p(\mathcal{D})$, for $L_x \times L_y$ lattices, with $L_y=2$ and $4$, as a function of (a dimensionless) disorder strength $\alpha$ ($\alpha=0$ implies zero disorder) using exact diagonalization on many disorder realizations. Analyzing the skewness of $p(\mathcal{D})$ shows that the finite-size estimate of the critical disorder strength, beyond which MBL sets in for thin ladders with $L_y=2$, increases linearly with $L_x$ while the behavior of the full distribution with increasing $L_x$ at fixed $\alpha$ shows that $\alpha_c (L_y=2) &gt;40$, if at all finite, based on data for $L_x \leq 12$. $p(\mathcal{D})$ for wider ladders with $L_y=4$ show their lower tendency to localize, suggesting a lack of MBL in two dimensions. A remarkable observation is the resolution of the (monotonic) infinite temperature autocorrelation function of single plaquette diagonal operators in typical high-energy Fock states into a plethora of emergent timescales of increasing spatio-temporal heterogeneity as the disorder is increased even before MBL sets in. At intermediate and large $\alpha$, but below $\alpha_c (L_y)$, certain randomly selected initial Fock states display striking oscillatory temporal behavior of such plaquette operators dominated by only a few frequencies, reminiscent of oscillations induced by quantum many-body scars.</description>

      <title>Recurrent neural network wave functions for Rydberg atom arrays on kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atom array experiments have demonstrated the ability to act as powerful quantum simulators, preparing strongly-correlated phases of matter which are challenging to study for conventional computer simulations. A key direction has been the implementation of interactions on frustrated geometries, in an effort to prepare exotic many-body states such as spin liquids and glasses. In this paper, we apply two-dimensional recurrent neural network (RNN) wave functions to study the ground states of Rydberg atom arrays on the kagome lattice. We implement an annealing scheme to find the RNN variational parameters in regions of the phase diagram where exotic phases may occur, corresponding to rough optimization landscapes. For Rydberg atom array Hamiltonians studied previously on the kagome lattice, our RNN ground states show no evidence of exotic spin liquid or emergent glassy behavior. In the latter case, we argue that the presence of a non-zero Edwards-Anderson order parameter is an artifact of the long autocorrelations times experienced with quantum Monte Carlo simulations. This result emphasizes the utility of autoregressive models, such as RNNs, to explore Rydberg atom array physics on frustrated lattices and beyond.</description>

      <title>Unusual Diffusivity in Strongly Disordered Quantum Lattices: Random Dimer Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in transport properties measurements of disordered materials and lattice simulations, using superconducting qubits, have rekindled interest in Anderson localization, motivating our study of highly disordered quantum lattices. Initially, our statistical analysis of localized eigenstates reveals a distinct transition between weak and strong disorder regimes, suggesting a random distribution of dimers in highly disordered systems. Subsequently, the random dimer model predicts an oscillating diffusivity that decays as $t^{-1/2}$, is inversely proportional to the disorder strength, and maintains a constant frequency with an initial phase shift of $\pi/4$. The first peak exhibits a universal scaling of $\sigma^{-1}$ both in peak time and amplitude. Finally, we find that stochastic noise suppresses these oscillations and induces hopping between localized eigenstates, resulting in constant diffusion over long times. Our predictions challenge the conventional understanding of incoherent hopping under strong disorder. This offers new insights to optimize disordered systems for optoelectrical and quantum information technologies.</description>

      <title>Information limits and Thouless-Anderson-Palmer equations for spiked matrix models with structured noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a prototypical problem of Bayesian inference for a structured spiked model: a low-rank signal is corrupted by additive noise. While both information-theoretic and algorithmic limits are well understood when the noise is i.i.d. Gaussian, the more realistic case of structured noise still proves to be challenging. To capture the structure while maintaining mathematical tractability, a line of work has focused on rotationally invariant noise. However, existing studies either provide sub-optimal algorithms or they are limited to a special class of noise ensembles. In this paper, we establish the first characterization of the information-theoretic limits for a noise matrix drawn from a general trace ensemble. These limits are then achieved by an efficient algorithm inspired by the theory of adaptive Thouless-Anderson-Palmer (TAP) equations. Our approach leverages tools from statistical physics (replica method) and random matrix theory (generalized spherical integrals), and it unveils the equivalence between the rotationally invariant model and a surrogate Gaussian model.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional robust regression under heavy-tailed data: Asymptotics and Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the high-dimensional properties of robust regression estimators in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination of both the covariates and response functions. In particular, we provide a sharp asymptotic characterisation of M-estimators trained on a family of elliptical covariate and noise data distributions including cases where second and higher moments do not exist. We show that, despite being consistent, the Huber loss with optimally tuned location parameter $\delta$ is suboptimal in the high-dimensional regime in the presence of heavy-tailed noise, highlighting the necessity of further regularisation to achieve optimal performance. This result also uncovers the existence of a transition in $\delta$ as a function of the sample complexity and contamination. Moreover, we derive the decay rates for the excess risk of ridge regression. We show that, while it is both optimal and universal for covariate distributions with finite second moment, its decay rate can be considerably faster when the covariates' second moment does not exist. Finally, we show that our formulas readily generalise to a richer family of models and data distributions, such as generalised linear estimation with arbitrary convex regularisation trained on mixture models.</description>
