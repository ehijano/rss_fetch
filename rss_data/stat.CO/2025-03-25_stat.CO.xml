      <title>Use of Lambert W function in the simulation of Weibull and non-Weibull distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have taken up some distributions, mostly Weibull family, whose quantile functions could not be obtained using the traditional inversion method. We have solved the same quantile functions by using the inversion method only, with the additional help of transcendental functions like the Lambert W function. The usage of the Lambert W function has helped derive closed-form solutions for mathematical models in many fields, for which explicit or exact solutions were not available and approximation was the only known way of approaching it.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Low-Rank Structures in the Training and Adaptation of Large Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rise of deep learning has revolutionized data processing and prediction in signal processing and machine learning, yet the substantial computational demands of training and deploying modern large-scale deep models present significant challenges, including high computational costs and energy consumption. Recent research has uncovered a widespread phenomenon in deep networks: the emergence of low-rank structures in weight matrices and learned representations during training. These implicit low-dimensional patterns provide valuable insights for improving the efficiency of training and fine-tuning large-scale models. Practical techniques inspired by this phenomenon, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and training, enable significant reductions in computational cost while preserving model performance. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent advances in exploiting low-rank structures for deep learning and shed light on their mathematical foundations. Mathematically, we present two complementary perspectives on understanding the low-rankness in deep networks: (i) the emergence of low-rank structures throughout the whole optimization dynamics of gradient and (ii) the implicit regularization effects that induce such low-rank structures at convergence. From a practical standpoint, studying the low-rank learning dynamics of gradient descent offers a mathematical foundation for understanding the effectiveness of LoRA in fine-tuning large-scale models and inspires parameter-efficient low-rank training strategies. Furthermore, the implicit low-rank regularization effect helps explain the success of various masked training approaches in deep neural networks, ranging from dropout to masked self-supervised learning.</description>

      <title>Skewness of a randomized quasi-Monte Carlo estimate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some recent work on confidence intervals for randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (RQMC) sampling found a surprising result: ordinary Student $t$ 95% confidence intervals based on a modest number of replicates were seen to be very effective and even more reliable than some bootstrap $t$ intervals that were expected to be best. One potential explanation is that those RQMC estimates have small skewness. In this paper we give conditions under which the skewness is $O(n^\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon&gt;0$, so 'almost $O(1)$'. Under a random generator matrix model, we can improve this rate to $O(n^{-1/2+\epsilon})$ with very high probability. We also improve some probabilistic bounds on the distribution of the quality parameter $t$ for a digital net in a prime base under random sampling of generator matrices.</description>

      <title>Cheap Permutation Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07672v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Permutation tests are a popular choice for distinguishing distributions and testing independence, due to their exact, finite-sample control of false positives and their minimax optimality when paired with U-statistics. However, standard permutation tests are also expensive, requiring a test statistic to be computed hundreds or thousands of times to detect a separation between distributions. In this work, we offer a simple approach to accelerate testing: group your datapoints into bins and permute only those bins. For U and V-statistics, we prove that these cheap permutation tests have two remarkable properties. First, by storing appropriate sufficient statistics, a cheap test can be run in time comparable to evaluating a single test statistic. Second, cheap permutation power closely approximates standard permutation power. As a result, cheap tests inherit the exact false positive control and minimax optimality of standard permutation tests while running in a fraction of the time. We complement these findings with improved power guarantees for standard permutation testing and experiments demonstrating the benefits of cheap permutations over standard maximum mean discrepancy (MMD), Hilbert-Schmidt independence criterion (HSIC), random Fourier feature, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, cross-MMD, and cross-HSIC tests.</description>
