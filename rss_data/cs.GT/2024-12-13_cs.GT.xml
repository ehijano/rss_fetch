      <title>Equilibria of the Colonel Blotto Games with Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a generalized variant of the Colonel Blotto game, referred to as the Colonel Blotto game with costs. Unlike the classic Colonel Blotto game, which imposes the use-it-or-lose-it budget assumption, the Colonel Blotto game with costs captures the strategic importance of costs related both to obtaining resources and assigning them across battlefields. We show that every instance of the Colonel Blotto game with costs is strategically equivalent to an instance of the zero-sum Colonel Blotto game with one additional battlefield. This enables the computation of Nash equilibria of the Colonel Blotto game with costs in polynomial time with respect to the game parameters: the number of battlefields plus the number of resources available to the players.</description>

      <title>On the Tractability Landscape of Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the Conditional Approval Framework for elections involving multiple interdependent issues, specifically focusing on the Conditional Minisum Approval Voting Rule. We first conduct a detailed analysis of the computational complexity of this rule, demonstrating that no approach can significantly outperform the brute-force algorithm under common computational complexity assumptions and various natural input restrictions. In response, we propose two practical restrictions (the first in the literature) that make the problem computationally tractable and show that these restrictions are essentially tight. Overall, this work provides a clear picture of the tractability landscape of the problem, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the complications introduced by conditional ballots and indicating that conditional approval voting can be applied in practice, albeit under specific conditions.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Algorithms for Game-Theoretic Motion Planning and Control in Autonomous Racing using Near-Potential Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous racing extends beyond the challenge of controlling a racecar at its physical limits. Professional racers employ strategic maneuvers to outwit other competing opponents to secure victory. While modern control algorithms can achieve human-level performance by computing offline racing lines for single-car scenarios, research on real-time algorithms for multi-car autonomous racing is limited. To bridge this gap, we develop game-theoretic modeling framework that incorporates the competitive aspect of autonomous racing like overtaking and blocking through a novel policy parametrization, while operating the car at its limit. Furthermore, we propose an algorithmic approach to compute the (approximate) Nash equilibrium strategy, which represents the optimal approach in the presence of competing agents. Specifically, we introduce an algorithm inspired by recently introduced framework of dynamic near-potential function, enabling real-time computation of the Nash equilibrium. Our approach comprises two phases: offline and online. During the offline phase, we use simulated racing data to learn a near-potential function that approximates utility changes for agents. This function facilitates the online computation of approximate Nash equilibria by maximizing its value. We evaluate our method in a head-to-head 3-car racing scenario, demonstrating superior performance compared to several existing baselines.</description>

      <title>Entropy-Regularized Optimal Transport in Information Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore a scenario where a sender provides an information policy and a receiver, upon observing a realization of this policy, decides whether to take a particular action, such as making a purchase. The sender's objective is to maximize her utility derived from the receiver's action, and she achieves this by careful selection of the information policy. Building on the work of Kleiner et al., our focus lies specifically on information policies that are associated with power diagram partitions of the underlying domain. To address this problem, we employ entropy-regularized optimal transport, which enables us to develop an efficient algorithm for finding the optimal solution. We present experimental numerical results that highlight the qualitative properties of the optimal configurations, providing valuable insights into their structure. Furthermore, we extend our numerical investigation to derive optimal information policies for monopolists dealing with multiple products, where the sender discloses information about product qualities.</description>

      <title>Learning to be Indifferent in Complex Decisions: A Coarse Payoff-Assessment Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Coarse Payoff-Assessment Learning (CPAL) model, which captures reinforcement learning by boundedly rational decision-makers who focus on the aggregate outcomes of choosing among exogenously defined clusters of alternatives (similarity classes), rather than evaluating each alternative individually. Analyzing a smooth approximation of the model, we show that the learning dynamics exhibit steady-states corresponding to smooth Valuation Equilibria (Jehiel and Samet, 2007). We demonstrate the existence of multiple equilibria in decision trees with generic payoffs and establish the local asymptotic stability of pure equilibria when they occur. Conversely, when trivial choices featuring alternatives within the same similarity class yield sufficiently high payoffs, a unique mixed equilibrium emerges, characterized by indifferences between similarity classes, even under acute sensitivity to payoff differences. Finally, we prove that this unique mixed equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable under the CPAL dynamics.</description>

      <title>Distributed Nash Equilibrium Seeking over Time-Varying Directed Communication Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02323v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a distributed algorithm to find the Nash equilibrium in a class of non-cooperative convex games with partial-decision information. Our method employs a distributed projected gradient play approach alongside consensus dynamics, with individual agents minimizing their local costs through gradient steps and local information exchange with neighbors via a time-varying directed communication network. Addressing time-varying directed graphs presents significant challenges. Existing methods often circumvent this by focusing on static graphs or specific types of directed graphs or by requiring the stepsizes to scale with the Perron-Frobenius eigenvectors. In contrast, we establish novel results that provide a contraction property for the mixing terms associated with time-varying row-stochastic weight matrices. Our approach explicitly expresses the contraction coefficient based on the characteristics of the weight matrices and graph connectivity structures, rather than implicitly through the second-largest singular value of the weight matrix as in prior studies. The established results facilitate proving geometric convergence of the proposed algorithm and advance convergence analysis for distributed algorithms in time-varying directed communication networks. Numerical results on a Nash-Cournot game demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>VickreyFeedback: Cost-efficient Data Construction for Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the cost-efficiency aspect of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF). RLHF leverages datasets of human preferences over outputs of large language models (LLM)s to instill human expectations into LLMs. Although preference annotation comes with a monetized cost, the economic utility of a preference dataset has not been considered by far. What exacerbates this situation is that, given complex intransitive or cyclic relationships in preference datasets, existing algorithms for fine-tuning LLMs are still far from capturing comprehensive preferences. This raises severe cost-efficiency concerns in production environments, where preference data accumulate over time. In this paper, we discuss the fine-tuning of LLMs as a monetized economy and introduce an auction mechanism to improve the efficiency of preference data collection in dollar terms. We show that introducing an auction mechanism can play an essential role in enhancing the cost-efficiency of RLHF, while maintaining satisfactory model performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed auction-based protocol is cost-effective for fine-tuning LLMs concentrating on high-quality feedback.</description>

      <title>A Cardinality-Constrained Approach to Combinatorial Bilevel Congestion Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial bilevel congestion pricing (CBCP), a variant of the discrete network design problem, seeks to minimize the total travel time experienced by all travelers in a road network, by strategically selecting toll locations and determining the corresponding charges. Conventional wisdom suggests that these problems are intractable since they have to be formulated and solved with a significant number of integer variables. Here, we devise a scalable local algorithm for the CBCP problem that guarantees convergence to a Kuhn-Tucker-Karush point. Our approach is novel in that it eliminates the use of integer variables altogether, instead introducing a cardinality constraint that limits the number of toll locations to a user-specified upper bound. The resulting bilevel program with the cardinality constraint is then transformed into a block-separable, single-level optimization problem that can be solved efficiently after penalization and decomposition. We are able to apply the algorithm to solve, in about 20 minutes, a CBCP instance with up to 3,000 links, of which hundreds can be tolled. To the best of our knowledge, no existing algorithm can solve CBCP problems at such a scale while providing any assurance of convergence.</description>

      <title>Reasoning about Strategic Abilities in Stochastic Multi-agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reasoning about strategic abilities is key to AI systems comprising multiple agents, which provide a unified framework for formalizing various problems in game theory, social choice theory, etc. In this work, we propose a probabilistic extension of the alternating-time $\mu$-calculus (AMC), named PAMC, for reasoning about the strategic abilities of agents in stochastic multi-agent systems. We show that PAMC subsumes two existing logics AMC and P$\mu$TL (a probabilistic extension of the modal $\mu$-calculus), but is incomparable with the probabilistic alternating-time temporal logic (PATL). We study the problems of model checking and satisfiability checking for PAMC. We first give a model checking algorithm by leveraging algorithms for solving normal-form games and AMC model checking. We establish that the model checking problem of PAMC remains in UP$\cap$co-UP, the same complexity class as the model checking problem for AMC and P$\mu$TL. We also provide a new reduction from the satisfiability problem of PAMC to solving parity games, by which we obtain an EXPTIME decision procedure, as well as the small model property which allows us to construct a model for each satisfiable PAMC formula. Satisfiability in PAMC has the same complexity as in the modal $\mu$-calculus, unlike PCTL and PATL whose satisfiability checking problems remain open. We have implemented both the model checking and satisfiability checking algorithms as open-source tools. Experimental results are reported, showcasing the practical applications and effectiveness of our approaches.</description>
