      <title>Machine learning for hydrodynamic stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A machine-learning strategy for investigating the stability of fluid flow problems is proposed herein. The computational procedure is demonstrably robust and does not require parameter tuning. The essential feature of the strategy is that the computational solution of the Navier--Stokes equations is a reliable proxy for laboratory experiments investigating sensitivity to flow parameters. The applicability of our bifurcation detection strategy is demonstrated by an investigation of two classical examples of flow instability associated with thermal convection. The codes used to generate the numerical results are available online.</description>

      <title>Neural Operator-Based Proxy for Reservoir Simulations Considering Varying Well Settings, Locations, and Permeability Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating Darcy flows in porous media is fundamental to understand the future flow behavior of fluids in hydrocarbon and carbon storage reservoirs. Geological models of reservoirs are often associated with high uncertainly leading to many numerical simulations for history matching and production optimization. Machine learning models trained with simulation data can provide a faster alternative to traditional simulators. In this paper we present a single Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) surrogate that outperforms traditional reservoir simulators by the ability to predict pressures and saturations on varying permeability fields, well locations, well controls, and number of wells. The maximum-mean relative error of 95\% of pressure and saturation predictions is less than 5\%. This is achieved by employing a simple yet very effective data augmentation technique that reduces the dataset size by 75\% and reduces overfitting. Also, constructing the input tensor in a binary fashion enables predictions on unseen well locations, well controls, and number of wells. Such model can accelerate history matching and reservoir characterization procedures by several orders of magnitude. The ability to predict on new well locations, well controls, and number of wells enables highly efficient reservoir management and optimization.</description>

      <title>A Momentum Balance Correction to the Non-Conservative One-Fluid Formulation in Boiling Flows using Volume-of-Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A proven methodology to solve multiphase flows is based on the one-fluid formulation of the governing equations, which treats the phase transition across the interface as a single fluid with varying properties and adds additional source terms to satisfy interface jump conditions, e.g., surface tension and mass transfer. Used interchangeably in the limit of non-evaporative flows, recent literature has formalized the inconsistencies that arise in the momentum balance of the non-conservative one-fluid formulation compared to its conservative counterpart when phase change is involved. This translates into an increased sensitivity of the numerical solution to the choice of formulation. Motivated by the fact that many legacy codes using the non-conservative one-fluid formulation have been extended to phase-change simulations, the inclusion of two corrective forces at the interface and a modification of the pressure-velocity solver with an additional predictor-projection step are shown to recover the exact momentum balance in the evaporative non-conservative one-fluid framework for low-viscosity incompressible flows. This has direct implications for obtaining a physically meaningful pressure field and is seen to affect the dynamics of two-phase flows. In the high-viscosity domain, the discretization of the viscous term introduces a momentum imbalance which is highly dependent on the chosen method to model the phase transition. Lastly, the need to develop sub-models for heat and mass transfer and for surface tension becomes evident since typical grid resolutions defined as ``resolved" in the literature may not be enough to capture interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Statistical Dynamics and Subgrid Modelling of Turbulence: From Isotropic to Inhomogeneous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence is the most important, ubiquitous, and difficult problem of classical physics. Feynman viewed it as essentially unsolved, without a rigorous mathematical basis to describe the statistical dynamics of this most complex of fluid motion. However, the paradigm shift came in 1959, with the formulation of the Eulerian direct interaction approximation (DIA) closure by Kraichnan. It was again based on renormalized perturbation theory, like quantum electrodynamics, and is a bare vertex theory that is manifestly realizable. Here, we review some of the subsequent exciting achievements in closure theory. We also document in some detail the progress that has been made in extending statistical dynamical turbulence theory to the real world of interactions with mean flows, waves and inhomogeneities such as topography. This includes numerically efficient inhomogeneous closures, like the realizable quasi-diagonal direct interaction approximation (QDIA), and even more efficient Markovian inhomogeneous closures (MICs). Recent developments include the formulation and testing of an eddy damped Markovian anisotropic closure (EDMAC) that is realizable in interactions with transient waves but is as efficient as the eddy damped quasi-normal Markovian (EDQNM). As well a similarly efficient closure, the realizable eddy damped Markovian inhomogeneous closure (EDMIC) has been developed. Moreover, we present subgrid models that cater for the complex interactions that occur in geophysical flows. Recent progress includes the determination of complete sets of subgrid terms for skilful large eddy simulations of baroclinic inhomogeneous turbulent atmospheric and oceanic flows interacting with Rossby waves and topography. The success of these inhomogeneous closures has also led to further applications in data assimilation and ensemble prediction and generalization to quantum fields.</description>

      <title>Predictability of weakly turbulent systems from spatially sparse observations using data assimilation and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply two data assimilation (DA) methods, a smoother and a filter, and a model-free machine learning (ML) shallow network to forecast two weakly turbulent systems. We analyse the effect of the spatial sparsity of observations on accuracy of the predictions obtained from these data-driven methods. Based on the results, we divide the spatial sparsity levels in three zones. First is the good-predictions zone in which both DA and ML methods work. We find that in the good-predictions zone the observations remain dense enough to accurately capture the fractal manifold of the system's dynamics, which is measured using the correlation dimension. The accuracy of the DA methods in this zone remains almost as good as for full-resolution observations. Second is the reasonable-predictions zone in which the DA methods still work but at reduced prediction accuracy. Third is the bad-predictions zone in which even the DA methods fail. We find that the sparsity level up to which the DA methods work is almost the same up to which chaos synchronisation of these systems can be achieved. The main implications of these results are that they (i) firmly establish the spatial resolution up to which the data-driven methods can be utilised, (ii) provide measures to determine if adding more sensors will improve the predictions, and (iii) quantify the advantage (in terms of the required measurement resolution) of using the governing equations within data-driven methods. We also discuss the applicability of these results to fully developed turbulence.</description>

      <title>Non-uniform mesh based FDM simulation of lid-driven cavity problem governed by N-S equations in stream function-vorticity formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the driven cavity problem was solved using finite difference scheme in stream function-vorticity formulation. A variable grid is adopted to capture more details and information in the area nearby the wall. The Navier-Stokes equation is rewritten as a particular form suitable to the variable grids. In simulation, Reynolds number is set 100 as an example. The velocity, vorticity and streamline contour are produced by the CFD scheme developed in this paper and then are compared with those by Ghia et. al. (1982) to validate this numerical scheme. It shows that the numerical CFD scheme developed in this paper works very well for both uniform grids and variable grids. The numerical tests with different grids setting show that a) the variable grids have advantages in capturing the reversed flow and separation bubbles produced in the corners associated with a good efficiency, b) the numerical schemes with symmetric and dense grids gives a more accurate solution than those with non-symmetric and sparse grids, and c) both the vorticity and stream function have a better accuracy than velocity.</description>

      <title>Turbulence and Rossby Wave Dynamics with Realizable Eddy Damped Markovian Anisotropic Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theoretical basis for the Eddy Damped Markovian Anisotropic Closure (EDMAC) is formulated for two-dimensional anisotropic turbulence interacting with Rossby waves in the presence of advection by a large-scale mean flow. The EDMAC is as computationally efficient as the Eddy Damped Quasi Normal Markovian (EDQNM) closure but in contrast is realizable in the presence of transient waves. The EDMAC is arrived at through systematic simplification of a generalization of the non-Markovian Direct Interaction Approximation (DIA) closure that has its origin in renormalized perturbation theory. Markovian Anisotropic Closures (MACs) are obtained from the DIA by using three variants of the Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem (FDT) with the information in the time history integrals instead carried by Markovian differential equations for two relaxation functions. One of the MACs is simplified to the EDMAC with analytical relaxation functions and high numerical efficiency, like the EDQNM. Sufficient conditions for the EDMAC to be realizable in the presence of Rossby waves are determined. Examples of the numerical integration of the EDMAC compared with the EDQNM are presented for two-dimensional isotropic and anisotropic turbulence, at moderate Reynolds numbers, possibly interacting with Rossby waves and large-scale mean flow. The generalization of the EDMAC for the statistical dynamics of other physical systems, to higher dimension and higher order nonlinearity is considered.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of fluid-driven fractures across material heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fracture propagation is highly sensitive to the conditions at the crack tip. In heterogeneous materials, microscale obstacles can cause propagation instabilities. Macroscopic heterogeneities modify the stress field over scales larger than the tip region. Here, we experimentally investigate the propagation of fluid-driven fractures through multilayered materials. We focus on analyzing fracture profiles formed upon injection of a low-viscosity fluid into a two-layer hydrogel block. Experimental observations highlight the influence of the originating layer on fracture dynamics. Fractures that form in the softer layer are confined, with no penetration in the stiffer layer. Conversely, fractures initiated within the stiffer layer experience rapid fluid transfer into the softer layer when reaching the interface. We report the propagation dynamics and show that they are controlled by the toughness contrast between neighboring layers, which drives fluid flow. We model the coupling between elastic deformation, material toughness, and volume conservation. After a short transient regime, scaling arguments capture the dependence of the fracture geometry on material properties, injection parameters, and time. These results show that stiffness contrast can accelerate fracture propagation and demonstrate the importance of macroscopic scale heterogeneities on fracture dynamics. These results have implications for climate mitigation strategies involving the storage of heat and carbon dioxide in stratified underground rock formations.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric displacement flows in fluid-driven fractures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Displacement flows are common in hydraulic fracturing, as fracking fluids of different composition are injected sequentially in the fracture. The injection of an immiscible fluid at the center of a liquid-filled fracture results in the growth of the fracture and the outward displacement of the interface between the two liquids. We study the dynamics of the fluid-driven fracture which is controlled by the competition between viscous, elastic, and toughness-related stresses. We use a model experiment to characterize the dynamics of the fracture for a range of mechanical properties of the fractured material and fracturing fluids. We form the liquid-filled pre-fracture in an elastic brittle matrix of gelatin. The displacing liquid is then injected. We record the radius and aperture of the fracture, and the position of the interface between the two liquids. In a typical experiment, the axisymmetric radial viscous flow is accommodated by the elastic deformation and fracturing of the matrix. We model the coupling between elastic deformation, viscous dissipation, and fracture propagation and recover the two fracturing regimes identified for single fluid injection. For the viscous-dominated and toughness-dominated regimes, we derive scaling equations that describe the crack growth due to a displacement flow and show the influence of the pre-existing fracture on the crack dynamics through a finite initial volume and an average viscosity of the fluid in the fracture.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of fluid-driven fractures in the viscous-dominated regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During hydraulic fracturing, the injection of a pressurized fluid in a brittle elastic medium leads to the formation and growth of fluid-filled fractures. A disc-like or penny-shaped fracture grows radially from a point source during the injection of a viscous fluid at a constant flow rate. We report an experimental study on the dynamics of fractures propagating in the viscous regime. We measure the fracture aperture and radius over time for varying mechanical properties of the medium and fluid and different injection parameters. Our experiments show that the fracture continues to expand in an impermeable brittle matrix, even after the injection stops. {In the viscous regime, the fracture radius scales as $t^{4/9}$ during the injection. Post shut-in, the crack continues to propagate at a slower rate, which agrees well with the predictions of the scaling arguments, as the radius scales as $t^{1/9}$. The fracture finally reaches an equilibrium set by the toughness of the material.} The results provide insights into the propagation of hydraulic fractures in rocks.</description>

      <title>Large-eddy simulation of hydrodynamic noise from turbulent flows past an axisymmetric hull using high-order schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, wall-modeled large-eddy simulation (WMLES) is carried out with Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings (FW-H) acoustic analogy to investigate the turbulent flow and hydrodynamic noise of an axisymmetric body of revolution. We first develop the numerical model based on high-order schemes and validate it by benchmark test of the turbulent flow around a circular cylinder at Re=10000. It demonstrates the capability of the present scheme to capture the primary flow patterns and the acoustic noise in the far field. Then, we conduct the numerical simulation for the turbulent flows around the DARPA SUBOFF without appendages at the Reynolds number of Re=1.2*10^7. The numerical results such as pressure coefficients and velocity fluctuations, are accurately predicted by the present model, which shows closer agreement with the experimental data than available WMLES solutions in the literature. For the parallel midbody of the hull, the wall pressure fluctuation reveals a low-frequency broadband spectrum with the majority of signal energy. The surface fluctuating pressure spectrum scales to the power of Strouhal number at the different locations, which is consistent with those in the turbulent boundary layer of the plate flows and airfoils. Moreover, the acoustic signature in the far field is investigated where the lowest sound pressure level (SPL) occurs in the upstream and downstream directions while the highest is found in the mid-parallel plane. SPLs are relatively close in the region of high acoustic pressure at the transverse plane of x/D=0, which exhibits a maximum difference of 1.2 dB between locations at different angles. In the vertical plane at z/D=0, the directivity plot reveals a symmetrical dipole pattern with vertical fluctuations stronger than the streamwise fluctuations.</description>

      <title>Physics Based &amp; Machine Learning Methods For Uncertainty Estimation In Turbulence Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows play an important role in many scientific and technological design problems. Both Sub-Grid Scale (SGS) models in Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) based modeling will require turbulence models for computational research of turbulent flows in the future. Turbulence model-based simulations suffer from a multitude of causes of forecast uncertainty. For example, the simplifications and assumptions employed to make these turbulence models computationally tractable and economical lead to predictive uncertainty. For safety-critical engineering design applications, we need reliable estimates of this uncertainty. This article focuses on Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. We review recent advances in the estimate of many types of uncertainty components, including numerical, aleatoric, and epistemic. We go into further depth on the possible use of Machine Learning (ML) methods to quantify these uncertainties. Above all, we elaborate further on significant limitations in these techniques. These range from realizability constraints on the Eigenspace Perturbation Method (EPM) to the requirement for Monte Carlo (MC) approaches for mixed uncertainty. Based on this study, we pinpoint important problems that need to be addressed and offer focused solutions to move beyond these obstacles.</description>

      <title>Performance of the wetting and the pressure gradient implementations in the lattice Boltzmann color gradient model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An accurate implementation of wetting and pressure drop is crucial to correctly reproducing fluid displacement processes in porous media. Although several strategies have been proposed in the literature, a systematic comparison of them is needed to determine the most suitable for practical applications. Here, we carried out numerical simulations to investigate the performance of two widely used wettability schemes in the lattice Boltzmann color gradient model, namely the geometrical wetting scheme by Leclaire et al. (Scheme-I) and the modified direction of the color gradient scheme by Akai et al. (Scheme-II). We showed that Scheme-II was more accurate in simulating static contact angles of a fluid droplet on a solid surface. However, Scheme-I was more accurate in simulating a dynamic case of a binary fluid flow in a horizontal capillary tube described by the Washburn equation. Moreover, we investigated the performance of two popular pressure gradient implementation types. Type-I used the so-called Zou-He pressure boundary conditions at the inlet and the outlet of the domain, while Type-II used an external body force as a pressure gradient. We showed that the Type-I implementation was slightly more accurate in simulating a neutrally wetting fluid in a horizontal capillary tube described by the Washburn equation. We also investigated the differences between the two types of pressure gradient implementation in simulating two fluid displacement processes in a Bentheimer sandstone rock sample: the primary drainage and the imbibition displacement processes.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the forcing and sub-filter scale terms in the volume-filtering immersed boundary method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a characterization of the forcing and the sub-filter scale terms produced in the volume-filtering immersed boundary (VF-IB) method by Dave et al, JCP, 2023. The process of volume-filtering produces bodyforces in the form of surface integrals to describe the boundary conditions at the interface. Furthermore, the approach also produces unclosed subfilter scale (SFS) terms. The level of contribution from SFS terms on the numerical solution depends on the filter width. In order to understand these terms better, we take a 2 dimensional, varying coefficient hyperbolic equation shown by Brady &amp; Liverscu, JCP, 2021. This case is chosen for two reasons. First, the case involves 2 distinct regions seperated by an interface, making it an ideal case for the VF-IB method. Second, an existing analytical solution allows us to properly investigate the contribution from SFS term for varying filter sizes. The latter controls how well resolved the interface is. The smaller the filter size, the more resolved the interface will be. A thorough numerical analysis of the method is presented, as well as the effect of the SFS term on the numerical solution. In order to perform a direct comparison, the numerical solution is compared to the filtered analytical solution. Through this, we highlight three important points. First, we present a methodical approach to volume filtering a hyperbolic PDE. Second, we show that the VF-IB method exhibits second order convergence with respect to decreasing filter size (i.e. making the interface sharper). Finally, we show that the SFS term scales with square the filter size. Large filter sizes require modeling the SFS term. However, for sufficiently finer filters, the SFS term can be ignored without any significant reduction in the accuracy of solution.</description>

Abstract: The encapsulation of active particles, such as bacteria or active colloids, inside a droplet gives rise to nontrivial shape dynamics and droplet motility. To understand this behavior, we derive an asymptotic solution for the fluid flow about a deformable droplet containing an active particle, modeled as a Stokes-flow singularity, in the case of small shape distortions. Offsetting of the active particle from the center of the drop breaks symmetry and leads to excitation of large number of shape modes as well as particle and drop displacement. Flows due to common singularity representations of active particles, such as Stokeslets, rotlets, and stresslets, are computed and compared to results for non-deformable droplets enclosing active particles. The effect of interfacial properties is also investigated. Surfactants adsorbed at the droplet interface immobilize the interface and arrest the droplet motion. Our results highlight strategies to steer the flows of active particles and create autonomously navigating containers.</description>

      <title>Rigorous derivation of damped-driven wave turbulence theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a rigorous justification of various kinetic regimes exhibited by the nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation with an additive stochastic forcing and a viscous dissipation. The importance of such damped-driven models stems from their wide empirical use in studying turbulence for nonlinear wave systems. The force injects energy into the system at large scales, which is then transferred across scales, thanks to the nonlinear wave interactions, until it is eventually dissipated at smaller scales. The presence of such scale-separated forcing and dissipation allows for the constant flux of energy in the intermediate scales, known as the inertial range, which is the focus of the vast amount of numerical and physical literature on wave turbulence.
  Roughly speaking, our results provide a rigorous kinetic framework for this turbulent behavior by proving that the stochastic dynamics can be effectively described by a deterministic damped-driven kinetic equation, which carries the full picture of the turbulent energy dynamic across scales (like cascade spectra or other flux solutions). The analysis extends previous works in the unperturbed setting arXiv:1912.09518-arXiv:2301.07063 to the above empirically motivated damped driven setting. Here, in addition to the size $L$ of the system, and the strength $\lambda$ of the nonlinearity, an extra thermodynamic parameter has to be included in the kinetic limit ($L\to \infty, \lambda\to 0$), namely the strength $\nu$ of the forcing and dissipation. Various regimes emerge depending on the relative sizes of $L$, $\lambda$ and $\nu$, which give rise to different kinetic equations. Two major novelties of this work is the extension of the Feynman diagram analysis to additive stochastic objects, and the sharp asymptotic development of the leading terms in that expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of self-similarity is an indispensable tool for understanding and modelling physical phenomena. Unfortunately, this is not always possible to perform formally in highly complex problems. We propose a methodology to extract the similarity variables of a self-similar physical process directly from data, without prior knowledge of the governing equations or boundary conditions, based on an optimization problem and symbolic regression. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of our method in four problems which have been influential in fluid mechanics research: a laminar boundary layer, Burger's equation, a turbulent wake, and a collapsing cavity. Our analysis considers datasets acquired via both numerical and wind-tunnel experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We highlight the current state-of-the-art in modeling emulsion rheology, ranging from dilute to jammed dense systems. We focus on analytical and numerical methods developed for calculating, computing, and tracking drop deformation en route to developing constitutive models for flowing emulsions. We identify material properties and dimensionless parameters, collate the small deformation theories and resulting expressions for viscometric quantities, list theoretical and numerical methods, and take stock of challenges for capturing connections between drop deformation, morphology, and rheology of emulsions. We highlight the substantial progress in providing quantitative descriptions of the rheological response using analytical theories, dimensional analysis, and powerful computational fluid dynamics to determine how macroscopic rheological properties emerge from microscopic features, including deformation and dynamics of non-interacting or interacting drops and molecular aspects that control the interfacial properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13148v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a low-order dynamical system to describe thermal convection in an annular domain. The model derives systematically from a Fourier-Laurent truncation of the governing Navier-Stokes Boussinesq equations and accounts for spatial dependence of the flow and temperature fields. Comparison with fully-resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) shows that the model captures parameter bifurcations and reversals of the large-scale circulation (LSC), including states of (i) steady circulating flow, (ii) chaotic LSC reversals, and (iii) periodic LSC reversals. Casting the system in terms of the fluid's angular momentum and center of mass (CoM) reveals equivalence to a damped pendulum with forcing that raises the CoM above the fulcrum. This formulation offers a transparent mechanism for LSC reversals, namely the inertial overshoot of a forced pendulum, and it yields an explicit formula for the frequency $f^*$ of regular LSC reversals in the high Rayleigh-number limit. This formula is shown to be in excellent agreement with DNS and produces the scaling law $f^* \sim Ra^{0.5}$.</description>

      <title>Modelling turbulence in axisymmetric wakes: an application to wind turbine wakes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A novel fast-running model is developed to predict the three-dimensional (3D) distribution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) in axisymmetric wake flows. This is achieved by mathematically solving the partial differential equation of the TKE transport using the Green's function method. The developed solution reduces to a double integral that can be computed numerically for a wake prescribed by any arbitrary velocity profile. It is shown that the solution can be further simplified to a single integral for wakes with Gaussian-like velocity-deficit profiles. Wind tunnel experiments were performed to compare model results against detailed 3D laser Doppler anemometry data measured within the wake flow of a porous disk subject to a uniform freestream flow. Furthermore, the new model is used to estimate the TKE distribution at the hub-height level of the rotating non-axisymmetric wake of a model wind turbine immersed in a rough-wall boundary layer. Our results show the important impact of operating conditions on TKE generation in wake flows, an effect not fully captured by existing empirical models. The wind-tunnel data also provide insights into the evolution of important turbulent flow quantities such as turbulent viscosity, mixing length, and the TKE dissipation rate in wake flows. Both mixing length and turbulent viscosity are found to increase with the streamwise distance. The turbulent viscosity however reaches a plateau in the far-wake region. Consistent with the non-equilibrium theory, it is also observed that the normalised energy dissipation rate is not constant, and it increases with the streamwise distance.</description>

      <title>Transport of inertial spherical particles in compressible turbulent boundary layers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present study, we perform direct numerical simulations of compressible turbulent boundary layers at the free stream Mach number of 2 ~ 6 laden with dilute phase of spherical particles to investigate the Mach number effects on particle transport and dynamics. Most of the phenomena observed and well-recognized for inertia particles in incompressible wall-bounded turbulent flows, such as the near-wall preferential accumulation and clustering beneath the low-speed streaks, the flatter mean velocity profiles and the trend variation of the particle velocity fluctuations, are identified in the compressible turbulent boundary layer as well. However, we find that the compressibility effects are significant for large inertia particles. As the Mach number increases, the near-wall accumulation and the small-scale clustering are alleviated, which is probably caused by the variation of the fluid density and viscosity that are crucial to particle dynamics. This can be affected by the fact that the forces acting on the particles with the viscous Stokes number greater than 500 are modulated by the comparatively high particle Mach numbers in the near-wall region. This is also the reason for the abatement of the streamwise particle velocity fluctuation intensities with the Mach numbers.</description>

      <title>Approximation of sea surface velocity field by fitting surrogate two-dimensional flow to scattered measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12746v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a rapid approximation method is introduced to estimate the sea surface velocity field based on scattered measurements. The method uses a simplified two-dimensional flow model as a surrogate model, which mimics the real submesoscale flow. The proposed approach treats the interpolation of the flow velocities as an optimization problem, aiming to fit the flow model to the scattered measurements. To ensure consistency between the simulated velocity field and the measured values, the boundary conditions in the numerical simulations are adjusted during the optimization process. Additionally, the relevance of quantity and quality of the scattered measurements is assessed, emphasizing the importance of the measurement locations within the domain as well as explaining how these measurements contribute to the accuracy and reliability of the sea surface velocity field approximation. The proposed methodology has been successfully tested in both synthetic and real-world scenarios, leveraging measurements obtained from Global Positioning System (GPS) drifters and high-frequency (HF) radar systems. The adaptability of this approach for different domains, measurement types, and conditions implies that it is suitable for real-world submesoscale scenarios where only an approximation of the sea surface velocity field is sufficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06815v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastoinertial turbulence (EIT) is a chaotic flow resulting from the interplay between inertia and viscoelasticity in wall bounded shear flows. Understanding EIT is important because it is thought to set a limit on the effectiveness of turbulent drag reduction in polymer solutions. Here, we analyze simulations of two dimensional EIT in channel flow using Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD), discovering a family of traveling wave structures that capture the sheetlike stress fluctuations that characterize EIT. The frequency dependence of the leading SPOD mode contains distinct peaks and the mode structures corresponding to these peaks exhibit well defined traveling structures. The structure of the dominant traveling mode exhibits shift reflect symmetry similar to the viscoelasticity modified Tollmien Schlichting (TS) wave, where the velocity fluctuation in the traveling mode is characterized by large scale regular structures spanning the channel and the polymer stress field is characterized by thin, inclined sheets of high polymer stress localized at the critical layers near the channel walls. The traveling structures corresponding to the higher frequency modes have a very similar structure, but are nested in a region roughly bounded by the critical layer positions of the next lower frequency mode. A simple theory based on the idea that the critical layers of mode $\kappa$ form the "walls" for the structure of mode $\kappa+1$ yields quantitative agreement with the observed wave speeds and critical layer positions, indicating self similarity between the structures. The physical idea behind this theory is that the sheetlike localized stress fluctuations in the critical layer prevent velocity fluctuations from penetrating them.</description>

Abstract: We employ a lattice Boltzmann method to compute the acoustic radiation force produced by standing waves on a compressible object. Instead of simulating the fluid mechanics equations directly, the proposed method uses a lattice Boltzmann model that reproduces the wave equation, together with a kernel interpolation scheme, to compute the first order perturbations of the pressure and velocity fields on the object's surface and, from them, the acoustic radiation force. The procedure reproduces with excellent accuracy the theoretical expressions by Gor'kov and Wei for the sphere and the disk, respectively, even with a modest number of lattice Boltzmann cells. The proposed method shows to be a promising tool for simulating phenomena where the acoustic radiation force plays a relevant role, like acoustic tweezers or the acoustic manipulation of microswimmers, with applications in medicine and engineering.</description>

      <title>Large-scale semi-organized rolls in a sheared convective turbulence: Mean-field simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on a mean-field theory of a non-rotating turbulent convection (Phys. Rev. E {\bf 66}, 066305, 2002), we perform mean-field simulations (MFS) of sheared convection which takes into account an effect of modification of the turbulent heat flux by the non-uniform large-scale motions. As the result of this effect, there is an excitation of large-scale convective-shear instability, which causes the formation of large-scale semi-organized structures in the form of rolls. The life-times and spatial scales of these structures are much larger compared to the turbulent scales. By means of MFS performed for stress-free and no-slip vertical boundary conditions, we determine the spatial and temporal characteristics of these structures. Our study demonstrates that the modification of the turbulent heat flux by non-uniform flows leads to a strong reduction of the critical effective Rayleigh number (based on the eddy viscosity and turbulent temperature diffusivity) required for the formation of the large-scale rolls. During the nonlinear stage of the convective-shear instability, there is a transition from the two-layer vertical structure with two roles in the vertical direction before the system reaches steady-state to the one-layer vertical structure with one role after the system reaches steady-state. This effect is observed for all effective Rayleigh numbers. We find that inside the convective rolls, the spatial distribution of the mean potential temperature includes regions with a positive vertical gradient of the potential temperature caused by the mean heat flux of the convective rolls. This study might be useful for understanding of the origin of large-scale rolls observed in atmospheric convective boundary layers as well as in numerical simulations and laboratory experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this research, the effect of utilizing a micro plasma actuator on controlling the flow through a two-dimensional cylinder is investigated using an advanced electrostatic model. Within this model, by solving two elliptic equations, the potential distribution and plasma distribution in the solution domain are determined, leading to the generation of a volumetric force. This force is added to the momentum equations as a source term. The Reynolds number of the flow is set at 20,000, and the plasma actuator operates in a steady manner. Due to the high Reynolds number, the flow is turbulent, and its time-dependent nature is modeled as unsteady. Plasma actuators are symmetrically mounted at 45 and 90 degrees with respect to the free stream, both above and below the cylinder surfaces. The influence of the actuator placement angle on the flow quality downstream of the cylinder is examined. The results indicate an enhancement of flow quality by 8% to 15% downstream of the cylinder. Moreover, improvements of 40% to 55% in the variation of the lift coefficient and 75% to 90% in the drag coefficient are reported. The findings reveal superior performance of the actuator positioned at 90 degrees compared to the 45-degree orientation. This can be attributed to the proximity of the 90-degree actuator position to the point of boundary layer separation initiation. Furthermore, using the actuator positioned at 90 degrees and applying three different voltages of 10, 13, and 16 kV, the impact of flow control on the first cylinder in a tandem arrangement on the downstream flow of the second cylinder is examined. The results demonstrate an enhancement in downstream flow quality of 20% to 26%.</description>

Abstract: Finding the distribution of the velocities and pressures of a fluid by solving the Navier-Stokes equations is a principal task in the chemical, energy, and pharmaceutical industries, as well as in mechanical engineering and the design of pipeline systems. With existing solvers, such as OpenFOAM and Ansys, simulations of fluid dynamics in intricate geometries are computationally expensive and require re-simulation whenever the geometric parameters or the initial and boundary conditions are altered. Physics-informed neural networks are a promising tool for simulating fluid flows in complex geometries, as they can adapt to changes in the geometry and mesh definitions, allowing for generalization across fluid parameters and transfer learning across different shapes. We present a hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network that simulates laminar fluid flows in 3D Y-shaped mixers. Our approach combines the expressive power of a quantum model with the flexibility of a physics-informed neural network, resulting in a 21% higher accuracy compared to a purely classical neural network. Our findings highlight the potential of machine learning approaches, and in particular hybrid quantum physics-informed neural network, for complex shape optimization tasks in computational fluid dynamics. By improving the accuracy of fluid simulations in complex geometries, our research using hybrid quantum models contributes to the development of more efficient and reliable fluid dynamics solvers.</description>

Abstract: Sinusoidal undulation has long been considered the most successful swimming pattern for fish and bionic aquatic robots [1]. However, a swimming pattern generated by the hair clip mechanism (HCM, part iii, Figure 1A) [2]~[5] may challenge this knowledge. HCM is an in-plane prestressed bi-stable mechanism that stores elastic energy and releases the stored energy quickly via its snap-through buckling. When used for fish robots, the HCM functions as the fish body and creates unique swimming patterns that we term HCM undulation. With the same energy consumption [3], HCM fish outperforms the traditionally designed soft fish with a two-fold increase in cruising speed. We reproduce this phenomenon in a single-link simulation with Aquarium [6]. HCM undulation generates an average propulsion of 16.7 N/m, 2-3 times larger than the reference undulation (6.78 N/m), sine pattern (5.34 N/m/s), and cambering sine pattern (6.36 N/m), and achieves an efficiency close to the sine pattern. These results can aid in developing fish robots and faster swimming patterns.</description>
