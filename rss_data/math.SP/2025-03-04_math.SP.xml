      <title>Prescription of the Robin spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01451v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of prescribing the finite Robin spectrum. Let $M$ be a compact connected smooth manifold with smooth boundary, and let $\rho \in C_+(\partial M)$ be a positive continuous Robin parameter on the boundary. This paper addresses the spectral prescribing problem for Robin eigenvalues under two geometric constraints. First, we establish that for any finite sequence of positive numbers and any prescribed volume, there exists a Riemannian metric $g$ on $M$ whose Robin spectrum (with parameter $\rho$) begins with the given sequence. Subsequently, we restrict to metrics within a fixed conformal class. While exact spectral prescription becomes impossible in this constrained setting, we prove that the multiplicities of finitely many Robin eigenvalues can be arbitrarily assigned (when $\dim M \ge 3$). A pivotal step of our approach involves solving the analogous Dirichlet eigenvalue multiplicity problem in conformal classes. Consequently, we obtain as an intermediate result the prescription of Dirichlet eigenvalue multiplicities within given conformal classes.</description>

      <title>Surfaces with Commuting Boundary Laplacian and Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For $M\subset \mathbb{R}^{d\geq 3}$ a smooth, connected, compact $d$-dimensional submanifold with boundary, equipped with the standard metric, the Laplacian on $\partial M$ is known to commute with the corresponding Dirichlet-to-Neumann map if and only if $M$ is a ball. In this paper, we investigate the $d=2$ case and show that, surprisingly, there exists a one-parameter family of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^2$ as above for which the boundary Laplacian and the Dirichlet-to-Neumann map commute, thus answering an open problem posed by Girouard, Karpukhin, Levitin, and Polterovich. We then classify all such Riemannian surfaces of genus $0$ or whose boundary has $k\geq 3$ connected components.</description>

      <title>Inverse nodal problems for Dirac differential operators with jump condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper deals with an inverse nodal problem for the Dirac differential operator with the discontinuity conditions inside the interval. We obtain a new approach for asymptotic expressions of the solutions and prove that the coefficients of the Dirac system can be determined uniquely by a dense subset of the nodal points (zeros of the first component of the eigenfunction). We also provide an algorithm for constructing the solution of this inverse nodal problem.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Measures on Hyperbolic Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine semiclassical measures for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact hyperbolic $(n+1)$-manifolds. We prove their support must contain the cosphere bundle of a compact immersed totally geodesic submanifold. Our proof adapts the argument of Dyatlov and Jin to higher dimensions and classifies the closures of horocyclic orbits using Ratner theory. An important step in the proof is a generalization of the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen to Fourier integral operators, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Biquadratic Tensors: Eigenvalues and Structured Tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The covariance tensors in statistics{, elasticity tensor in solid mechanics, Riemann curvature tensor in relativity theory are all biquadratic tensors that are weakly symmetric, but not symmetric in general. Motivated by this, in this paper, we consider nonsymmetric biquadratic tensors, and study possible conditions and algorithms for identifying positive semi-definiteness and definiteness of such biquadratic tensors. We extend M-eigenvalues to nonsymmetric biquadratic tensors, prove that a general biquadratic tensor has at least one M-eigenvalue, and show that a general biquadratic tensor is positive semi-definite if and only if all of its M-eigenvalues are nonnegative, and a general biquadratic tensor is positive definite if and only if all of its M-eigenvalues are positive. We present a Gershgorin-type theorem for biquadratic tensors, and show that (strictly) diagonally dominated biquadratic tensors are positive semi-definite (definite). We introduce Z-biquadratic tensors, M-biquadratic tensors, strong M-biquadratic tensors, B$_0$-biquadratic tensors and B-biquadratic tensors. We show that M-biquadratic tensors and symmetric B$_0$-biquadratic tensors are positive semi-definite, and that strong M-biquadratic tensors and symmetric B-biquadratic tensors are positive definite. A Riemannian LBFGS method for computing the smallest M-eigenvalue of a general biquadratic tensor is presented. Numerical results are reported.</description>

      <title>Localization for Lipschitz monotone quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ via Rellich functions analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the Anderson localization and exponential dynamical localization for a class of quasi-periodic Schr\"odinger operators on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ with bounded or unbounded Lipschitz monotone potentials via multi-scale analysis based on Rellich function analysis in the perturbative regime. We show that at each scale, the resonant Rellich function uniformly inherits the Lipschitz monotonicity property of the potential via a novel Schur complement argument.</description>

      <title>Which subsets and when orbits of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems prefer to visit: operator renewal theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper addresses for the first time some basic questions in the theory of finite time dynamics and finite time predictions for slowly mixing non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. It is concerned with transport in phase spaces of such systems, and analyzes which subsets and when the orbits prefer to visit. An asymptotic expansion of the decay of polynomial escape rates is obtained, which also allows for finding asymptotics of the first hitting probabilities. Our approach is based on the construction of new operator renewal equations for open dynamical systems and on their spectral analysis. In order to do this, we generalize the Keller-Liverani perturbation technique. Applications to a large class of one-dimensional non-uniformly expanding systems are considered.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of L\'evy-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroups on $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of Markov semigroups associated with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes driven by L\'evy processes. These semigroups are generated by non-local, non-self-adjoint operators. In the special case where the driving L\'evy process is Brownian motion, one recovers the classical diffusion OU semigroup, whose spectral properties have been extensively studied over past few decades. Our main results establish that, under suitable conditions on the L\'evy process, the spectrum of the L\'evy-OU semigroup in the $L^p$-space weighted with the invariant distribution coincides with that of the diffusion OU semigroup. Furthermore, when the drift matrix $B$ is diagonalizable with real eigenvalues, we derive explicit formulas for eigenfunctions and co-eigenfunctions--an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not appeared in the literature. We also show that the multiplicities of the eigenvalues remain independent of the choice of the L\'evy process. A key ingredient in our approach is intertwining relationship: we prove that every L\'evy-OU semigroup is intertwined with a diffusion OU semigroup. Additionally, we examine the compactness properties of these semigroups and provide examples of non-compact L\'evy-OU semigroups.</description>
