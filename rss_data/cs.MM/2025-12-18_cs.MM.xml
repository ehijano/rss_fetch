      <title>A Preprocessing Framework for Video Machine Vision under Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There has been a growing trend in compressing and transmitting videos from terminals for machine vision tasks. Nevertheless, most video coding optimization method focus on minimizing distortion according to human perceptual metrics, overlooking the heightened demands posed by machine vision systems. In this paper, we propose a video preprocessing framework tailored for machine vision tasks to address this challenge. The proposed method incorporates a neural preprocessor which retaining crucial information for subsequent tasks, resulting in the boosting of rate-accuracy performance. We further introduce a differentiable virtual codec to provide constraints on rate and distortion during the training stage. We directly apply widely used standard codecs for testing. Therefore, our solution can be easily applied to real-world scenarios. We conducted extensive experiments evaluating our compression method on two typical downstream tasks with various backbone networks. The experimental results indicate that our approach can save over 15% of bitrate compared to using only the standard codec anchor version.</description>

      <title>One Size Doesn't Fit All: Age-Aware Gamification Mechanics for Multimedia Learning Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamification is widely used in digital learning. However, most systems neglect age-related differences. This paper investigates how gamification can be designed in an age-aware way to address learners' diverse motivational and cognitive needs. Based on a targeted literature review, we present a mapping of age groups, mechanics, and effects. Furthermore, we derive five design principles for age-specific gamification and identify three technical patterns for implementation in multimedia learning environments. The results indicate that gamification is not universally effective, but rather requires a differentiated design to support engagement and inclusivity across the lifespan.</description>

      <title>TalkVerse: Democratizing Minute-Long Audio-Driven Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce TalkVerse, a large-scale, open corpus for single-person, audio-driven talking video generation designed to enable fair, reproducible comparison across methods. While current state-of-the-art systems rely on closed data or compute-heavy models, TalkVerse offers 2.3 million high-resolution (720p/1080p) audio-video synchronized clips totaling 6.3k hours. These are curated from over 60k hours of video via a transparent pipeline that includes scene-cut detection, aesthetic assessment, strict audio-visual synchronization checks, and comprehensive annotations including 2D skeletons and structured visual/audio-style captions. Leveraging TalkVerse, we present a reproducible 5B DiT baseline built on Wan2.2-5B. By utilizing a video VAE with a high downsampling ratio and a sliding window mechanism with motion-frame context, our model achieves minute-long generation with low drift. It delivers comparable lip-sync and visual quality to the 14B Wan-S2V model but with 10$\times$ lower inference cost. To enhance storytelling in long videos, we integrate an MLLM director to rewrite prompts based on audio and visual cues. Furthermore, our model supports zero-shot video dubbing via controlled latent noise injection. We open-source the dataset, training recipes, and 5B checkpoints to lower barriers for research in audio-driven human video generation.

      <title>Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression for Generative Face Video Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative face video coding (GFVC) is vital for modern applications like video conferencing, yet existing methods primarily focus on video motion while neglecting the significant bitrate contribution of audio. Despite the well-established correlation between audio and lip movements, this cross-modal coherence has not been systematically exploited for compression. To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression (AVCC) framework that jointly compresses audio and video streams. Our framework extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process. This allows synchronized reconstruction of both modalities from a shared representation. In extremely low-rate scenarios, AVCC can even reconstruct one modality from the other. Experiments show that AVCC significantly outperforms the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard and state-of-the-art GFVC schemes in rate-distortion performance, paving the way for more efficient multimodal communication systems.</description>

      <title>Development of Immersive Virtual and Augmented Reality-Based Joint Attention Training Platform for Children with Autism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Joint Attention (JA), a crucial social skill for developing shared focus, is often impaired in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), affecting social communication and highlighting the need for early intervention. Addressing gaps in prior research, such as limited use of immersive technology and reliance on distracting peripherals, we developed a novel JA training platform using Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) devices. The platform integrates eye gaze-based interactions to ensure participants undivided attention. To validate the platform, we conducted experiments on ASD (N=19) and Neurotypical (NT) (N=13) participants under a trained pediatric neurologist's supervision. For quantitative analysis, we employed key measures such as the number of correct responses, the duration of establishing eye contact (s), and the duration of registering a response (s), along with correlations to CARS scores and age. Results from AR-based experiments showed NT participants registered responses significantly faster (&lt;0.00001) than ASD participants. A correlation (Spearman coefficient=0.57, p=0.03) was found between ASD participants response time and CARS scores. A similar trend was observed in VR-based experiments. When comparing response accuracy in ASD participants across platforms, AR yielded a higher correctness rate (92.30%) than VR (69.49%), indicating AR's greater effectiveness. These findings suggest that immersive technology can aid JA training in ASD. Future studies should explore long-term benefits and real-world applicability.</description>

      <title>Generative Preprocessing for Image Compression with Pre-trained Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15270v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Preprocessing is a well-established technique for optimizing compression, yet existing methods are predominantly Rate-Distortion (R-D) optimized and constrained by pixel-level fidelity. This work pioneers a shift towards Rate-Perception (R-P) optimization by, for the first time, adapting a large-scale pre-trained diffusion model for compression preprocessing. We propose a two-stage framework: first, we distill the multi-step Stable Diffusion 2.1 into a compact, one-step image-to-image model using Consistent Score Identity Distillation (CiD). Second, we perform a parameter-efficient fine-tuning of the distilled model's attention modules, guided by a Rate-Perception loss and a differentiable codec surrogate. Our method seamlessly integrates with standard codecs without any modification and leverages the model's powerful generative priors to enhance texture and mitigate artifacts. Experiments show substantial R-P gains, achieving up to a 30.13% BD-rate reduction in DISTS on the Kodak dataset and delivering superior subjective visual quality.</description>

      <title>Image Complexity-Aware Adaptive Retrieval for Efficient Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision transformers in vision-language models apply uniform computational effort across all images, expending 175.33 GFLOPs (ViT-L/14) whether analysing a straightforward product photograph or a complex street scene. We propose ICAR (Image Complexity-Aware Retrieval), which enables vision transformers to use less compute for simple images whilst processing complex images through their full network depth. The key challenge is maintaining cross-modal alignment: embeddings from different processing depths must remain compatible for text matching. ICAR solves this through dual-path training that produces compatible embeddings from both reduced-compute and full-compute processing. This maintains compatibility between image representations and text embeddings in the same semantic space, whether an image exits early or processes fully. Unlike existing two-stage approaches that require expensive reranking, ICAR enables direct image-text matching without additional overhead. To determine how much compute to use, we develop ConvNeXt-IC, which treats image complexity assessment as a classification task. By applying modern classifier backbones rather than specialised architectures, ConvNeXt-IC achieves state-of-the-art performance with 0.959 correlation with human judgement (Pearson) and 4.4x speedup. Evaluated on standard benchmarks augmented with real-world web data, ICAR achieves 20% practical speedup while maintaining category-level performance and 95% of instance-level performance, enabling sustainable scaling of vision-language systems.</description>

      <title>VAAS: Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring for Image Manipulation Detection in Digital Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-driven image generation have introduced new challenges for verifying the authenticity of digital evidence in forensic investigations. Modern generative models can produce visually consistent forgeries that evade traditional detectors based on pixel or compression artefacts. Most existing approaches also lack an explicit measure of anomaly intensity, which limits their ability to quantify the severity of manipulation. This paper introduces Vision-Attention Anomaly Scoring (VAAS), a novel dual-module framework that integrates global attention-based anomaly estimation using Vision Transformers (ViT) with patch-level self-consistency scoring derived from SegFormer embeddings. The hybrid formulation provides a continuous and interpretable anomaly score that reflects both the location and degree of manipulation. Evaluations on the DF2023 and CASIA v2.0 datasets demonstrate that VAAS achieves competitive F1 and IoU performance, while enhancing visual explainability through attention-guided anomaly maps. The framework bridges quantitative detection with human-understandable reasoning, supporting transparent and reliable image integrity assessment. The source code for all experiments and corresponding materials for reproducing the results are available open source.</description>

      <title>LaF-GRPO: In-Situ Navigation Instruction Generation for the Visually Impaired via GRPO with LLM-as-Follower Reward</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04070v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation instruction generation for visually impaired (VI) individuals (NIG-VI) is critical yet relatively underexplored. This study focuses on generating precise, in-situ, step-by-step navigation instructions that are practically usable for VI users. Specifically, we propose LaF-GRPO (LLM-as-Follower GRPO), where an LLM simulates VI user responses to navigation instructions, thereby providing feedback rewards to guide the post-training of a Vision-Language Model (VLM). This enhances instruction accuracy and usability while reducing costly real-world data collection needs. To address the scarcity of dedicated benchmarks in this field, we introduce NIG4VI, a 27k-sample open-source dataset to facilitate training and evaluation. It comprises diverse navigation scenarios with accurate spatial coordinates, supporting detailed and open-ended in-situ instruction generation. Experiments on NIG4VI demonstrate the effectiveness of LaF-GRPO through quantitative metrics (e.g., Zero-(LaF-GRPO) boosts BLEU 14\%; SFT+(LaF-GRPO) METEOR 0.542 vs. GPT-4o 0.323), and qualitative analysis further confirms that our method yields more intuitive and safer instructions.</description>

      <title>3D Software Synthesis Guided by Constraint-Expressive Intermediate Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18625v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphical user interface (UI) software has undergone a fundamental transformation from traditional two-dimensional (2D) desktop/web/mobile interfaces to spatial three-dimensional (3D) environments. While existing work has made remarkable success in automated 2D software generation, such as HTML/CSS and mobile app interface code synthesis, the generation of 3D software still remains under-explored. Current methods for 3D software generation usually generate the 3D environments as a whole and cannot modify or control specific elements in the software. Furthermore, these methods struggle to handle the complex spatial and semantic constraints inherent in the real world. To address the challenges, we present Scenethesis, a novel requirement-sensitive 3D software synthesis approach that maintains formal traceability between user specifications and generated 3D software. Scenethesis is built upon ScenethesisLang, a domain-specific language that serves as a granular constraint-aware intermediate representation (IR) to bridge natural language requirements and executable 3D software. It serves both as a comprehensive scene description language enabling fine-grained modification of 3D software elements and as a formal constraint-expressive specification language capable of expressing complex spatial constraints. By decomposing 3D software synthesis into stages operating on ScenethesisLang, Scenethesis enables independent verification, targeted modification, and systematic constraint satisfaction. Our evaluation demonstrates that Scenethesis accurately captures over 80% of user requirements and satisfies more than 90% of hard constraints while handling over 100 constraints simultaneously. Furthermore, Scenethesis achieves a 42.8% improvement in BLIP-2 visual evaluation scores compared to the state-of-the-art method.</description>

      <title>PP-Motion: Physical-Perceptual Fidelity Evaluation for Human Motion Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human motion generation has found widespread applications in AR/VR, film, sports, and medical rehabilitation, offering a cost-effective alternative to traditional motion capture systems. However, evaluating the fidelity of such generated motions is a crucial, multifaceted task. Although previous approaches have attempted at motion fidelity evaluation using human perception or physical constraints, there remains an inherent gap between human-perceived fidelity and physical feasibility. Moreover, the subjective and coarse binary labeling of human perception further undermines the development of a robust data-driven metric. We address these issues by introducing a physical labeling method. This method evaluates motion fidelity by calculating the minimum modifications needed for a motion to align with physical laws. With this approach, we are able to produce fine-grained, continuous physical alignment annotations that serve as objective ground truth. With these annotations, we propose PP-Motion, a novel data-driven metric to evaluate both physical and perceptual fidelity of human motion. To effectively capture underlying physical priors, we employ Pearson's correlation loss for the training of our metric. Additionally, by incorporating a human-based perceptual fidelity loss, our metric can capture fidelity that simultaneously considers both human perception and physical alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that our metric, PP-Motion, not only aligns with physical laws but also aligns better with human perception of motion fidelity than previous work.</description>

      <title>AdSum: Two-stream Audio-visual Summarization for Automated Video Advertisement Clipping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advertisers commonly need multiple versions of the same advertisement (ad) at varying durations for a single campaign. The traditional approach involves manually selecting and re-editing shots from longer video ads to create shorter versions, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce a framework for automated video ad clipping using video summarization techniques. We are the first to frame video clipping as a shot selection problem, tailored specifically for advertising. Unlike existing general video summarization methods that primarily focus on visual content, our approach emphasizes the critical role of audio in advertising. To achieve this, we develop a two-stream audio-visual fusion model that predicts the importance of video frames, where importance is defined as the likelihood of a frame being selected in the firm-produced short ad. To address the lack of ad-specific datasets, we present AdSum204, a novel dataset comprising 102 pairs of 30-second and 15-second ads from real advertising campaigns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various metrics, including Average Precision, Area Under Curve, Spearman, and Kendall. The dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ostadabbas/AdSum204.</description>

      <title>Memo2496: Expert-Annotated Dataset and Dual-View Adaptive Framework for Music Emotion Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13998v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Music Emotion Recogniser (MER) research faces challenges due to limited high-quality annotated datasets and difficulties in addressing cross-track feature drift. This work presents two primary contributions to address these issues. Memo2496, a large-scale dataset, offers 2496 instrumental music tracks with continuous valence arousal labels, annotated by 30 certified music specialists. Annotation quality is ensured through calibration with extreme emotion exemplars and a consistency threshold of 0.25, measured by Euclidean distance in the valence arousal space. Furthermore, the Dual-view Adaptive Music Emotion Recogniser (DAMER) is introduced. DAMER integrates three synergistic modules: Dual Stream Attention Fusion (DSAF) facilitates token-level bidirectional interaction between Mel spectrograms and cochleagrams via cross attention mechanisms; Progressive Confidence Labelling (PCL) generates reliable pseudo labels employing curriculum-based temperature scheduling and consistency quantification using Jensen Shannon divergence; and Style Anchored Memory Learning (SAML) maintains a contrastive memory queue to mitigate cross-track feature drift. Extensive experiments on the Memo2496, 1000songs, and PMEmo datasets demonstrate DAMER's state-of-the-art performance, improving arousal dimension accuracy by 3.43%, 2.25%, and 0.17%, respectively. Ablation studies and visualisation analyses validate each module's contribution. Both the dataset and source code are publicly available.</description>
