      <title>On certain properties of the Petty space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study some touching properties of the three-dimensional Petty space $X=(\ell_2^2 \oplus \mathbb{R})_1$. In particular we give an estimation of its Hadwiger number and also show that its equilateral subsets $A$ of maximum cardinality (i.e. $|A|=e(X)$) do not have a center.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Magnitude of Finite Positive Definite Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnitude of metric spaces does not to appear to possess a simple, convenient continuity property, and previous studies have presented affirmative results under additional constraints or weaker notions, as well as counterexamples. In this vein, we discuss the continuity of magnitude of finite positive definite metric spaces with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, but with a restriction of the domain based on a canonical partition of a sufficiently small neighborhood of a finite metric space. The main theorem of this article specifies the part of the partition for which, for a convergent sequence of finite metric spaces lying in the part, the magnitude converges to that of the limit. This study takes advantage of the geometric interpretation of magnitude as the circumradius of the corresponding finite Euclidean subset, called similarity embedding, as recently proposed by other studies. Such a transformation is especially useful for constructing counterexamples as we can depend on Euclidean geometric intuition.</description>

      <title>Pseudotangents to Lipschitz curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the result of arXiv:2409.13662 by showing that the set on which every pseudotangent is obtained on a Lipschitz curve can be any compact, uniformly disconnected set in Euclidean space which admits any Lipschitz capture. We do not obtain a characterization of such sets however, indeed we leave open the very strong question of whether or not a Lipschitz curve can obtain every pseudotangent at every point.</description>

      <title>Characterizations of infinite circle patterns and convex polyhedra in hyperbolic 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since Thurston pioneered the connection between circle packing (abbr. CP) and three-dimensional geometric topology, the characterization of CPs and hyperbolic polyhedra has become increasingly profound. Some milestones have been achieved, for example, Rodin-Sullivan \cite{Rodin-Sullivan} and Schramm \cite{schramm91} proved the rigidity of infinite CPs with the intersection angle $\Theta=0$. Rivin-Hodgson \cite{RH93} fully characterized the existence and rigidity of compact convex polyhedra in $\mathbb{H}^3$. He \cite{He} proved the rigidity and uniformization theorem for infinite CPs with $0\leq\Theta\leq \pi/2$. \cite{He} also envisioned that "in a future paper, the techniques of this paper will be extended to the case when $0\leq\Theta&lt;\pi$. In particular, we will show a rigidity property for a class of infinite convex polyhedra in the 3-dimentional hyperbolic space".
  The article aims to accomplish the work claimed in \cite{He} by proving the rigidity and uniformization theorem for infinite CPs with $0\leq\Theta&lt;\pi$, as well as infinite trivalent hyperbolic polyhedra. We will pay special attention to CPs whose contact graphs are disk triangulation graphs. Such CPs are called regular because they exclude some singular configurations and correspond well to hyperbolic polyhedra. We will establish the existence and the rigidity of infinite regular CPs. Moreover, we will prove a uniformization theorem for regular CPs, which solves the classification problem for regular CPs. Thereby, the existence and rigidity of infinite convex trivalent polyhedra are obtained.</description>

      <title>Connecting conformal dimension and Poincar\'e profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We strengthen the connection between the Ahlfors-regular (AR) conformal dimension Confdim$(Z)$ of a compact AR metric space $Z$ and a certain critical exponent of the Poincar\'e profiles $p_{\Lambda}$ of its hyperbolic cone $X$ in the sense of Bonk--Schramm. We prove that the two values are equal in two situations: firstly, when $Z$ is a product $C\times [0,1]$ where $C$ is a compact AR metric space; and secondly when $X$ is quasi-isometric to a Heintze manifold $\mathbb R^n\rtimes_A\mathbb R$ where $A\in\textrm{GL}(n,\mathbb R)$ is diagonalisable. A key tool is a lower bound for $p_{\Lambda}$ for combinatorial round trees which also applies to various random group models and families of Coxeter groups.
  We also show that for a torsion free hyperbolic group $G$, $p_{\Lambda}(G)&gt;1$ if and only if Benjamini--Schramm--Tim\'ar's separation profile grows faster than $r^\alpha$ for some $\alpha&gt;0$, if and only if Confdim$(\partial_\infty G)&gt;1$. On the other hand, we find new, non-virtually-Fuchsian examples of groups with the same separation profile as $\mathbb{H}^2$.
  All these results imply various obstructions to coarse and regular embeddings of such groups.</description>

      <title>Time-periodic branched transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for branched transport between probability measures which are allowed to vary in time. This framework can be used to model problems where the underlying transportation network displays a branched structure, but the source and target mass distributions can change cyclically over time, such as road networks or circulatory systems. We introduce the notion of time-dependent transport paths along with associated energies and distances, and prove existence of transport paths whose energy achieves the distance. We also show the time-dependent transport yields a metric structure on subsets of appropriately defined measure-valued Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>A volume correspondence between anti-de Sitter space and its boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.09034v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$ be the $(n+1)$-dimensional anti-de Sitter space (AdS), in this paper we propose to extend $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$ conformally to another copy of $\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$ by gluing them along the boundary at infinity, and denote the resulting space by \emph{double anti-de Sitter space} $\mathbb{DH}^{n+1}_1$. We propose to introduce a volume $V_{n+1}(P)$ (possibly complex valued) on polytopes $P$ in $\mathbb{DH}^{n+1}_1$ whose facets all have non-degenerate metrics (called \emph{good} polytopes), and show that it is well defined and invariant under isometry, including the case that $P$ contains a non-trivial portion of $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$. For $n$ even, $V_{n+1}(P)$ is shown to be completely determined by the intersection of $P$ and $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$, which leads to the following important applications: it induces a new intrinsic (conformal) \emph{volume} on good polytopes in $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$ that is invariant under conformal transformations of $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$, and establishes an AdS-CFT type correspondence between the volumes on $\mathbb{DH}^{n+1}_1$ and $\partial\mathbb{H}^{n+1}_1$.</description>

      <title>Variants of a theorem of Macbeath in finite dimensional normed spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical theorem of Macbeath states that for any integers $d \geq 2$, $n \geq d+1$, $d$-dimensional Euclidean balls are hardest to approximate, in terms of volume difference, by inscribed convex polytopes with $n$ vertices. In this paper we investigate normed variants of this problem: we intend to find the extremal values of the Busemann volume, Holmes-Thompson volume, Gromov's mass and Gromov's mass$^*$ of a largest volume convex polytope with $n$ vertices, inscribed in the unit ball of a $d$-dimensional normed space.</description>

      <title>On the Structure of Busemann Spaces with Non-Negative Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the structure theory of Burago--Gromov--Perelman for Alexandrov spaces with curvature bounded below, to the setting of Busemann spaces with non-negative curvature. We prove that any finite-dimensional Busemann space with non-negative curvature satisfying Ohta's $S$-concavity and local semi-convexity, admits a non-trivial integer-dimensional Hausdorff measure, and satisfies the measure contraction property. We also show that such spaces are rectifiable and that almost every point admits a unique tangent cone isometric to a finite-dimensional Banach space. In addition, under mild control of the uniform smoothness constant, we obtain refined estimates for the Hausdorff dimension of the singular strata. Our results not only enrich the theory of synthetic sectional curvature lower bound for metric spaces, but also provide some useful tools and examples to study Finslerian metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Triangle unions with maximal number of sides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22584v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an integer n&gt;=1. Suppose, a simple polygon is a union of n triangles. What is the maximal number of sides it can have? This is a sequence A375986, a recent entry into the OEIS. In this paper we prove that it starts as 3, 12, 22, 33, 44, 55, 67, 79, and satisfies simple linear lower and upper bounds. The proof of the latter is combinatoric and is valid for segments of pseudolines instead of lines, too. It is still unknown whether such optimal combinatoric configuration is stretchable for larger n.</description>
