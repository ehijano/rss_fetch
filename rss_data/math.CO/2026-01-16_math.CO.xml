      <title>Structure and Decomposition of Deltoids in Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deltoids provide a natural framework for studying defective (partial) matchings in abelian groups, and we develop both structure and existence results in this setting. Given finite subsets $A$ and $B$ of an abelian group $G$, a matching is a bijection $f:A\to B$ such that $af(a)\notin A$ for all $a\in A$, a definition motivated by the study of canonical forms for symmetric tensors. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a partial matching with any prescribed defect, and then describe the minimal unavoidable defect for a pair $(A,B)$. We also define and examine a defective version of Chowla sets in the matching context. We prove a structure theorem identifying obstructions to the existence of partial matchings with small defect. Finally, within the deltoid setup, we establish max-min results on the partitioning of $A$ and $B$ into left- and right-admissible sets. Our tools mix results from transversal theory with ideas from additive number theory.</description>

      <title>Cylinder type and $p$-divisible sets in $\mathbb{F}_p^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A set of points $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_p^n$ is called \emph{$p$-divisible} if every affine hyperplane in $\mathbb{F}_p^n$ intersects $S$ in $0 \pmod p$ points. The Strong Cylinder Conjecture of Ball asserts that if
  $S$ is a $p$-divisible set of $p^2$ points in $\mathbb{F}_p^3$, then $S$ is a cylinder. In this paper, we show that every $p$-divisible multiset $S$ is both a $\mathbb{F}_p$-linear and $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combination of characteristic functions of cylinders. In addition, the multisets of size $p^2$ are $\Z$-linear combinations of a plane and weighted differences of parallel lines.</description>

      <title>Convex combination of first and second eigenvalues of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $G$, let $\lambda_1(G)$ and $\lambda_2(G)$ denote the largest and the second largest adjacency eigenvalue of $G$. The sum $\lambda_1(G) + \lambda_2(G)$ is called the \emph{spectral sum} of $G$. We investigate the spectral sum of trees of order $n$ and determine the extremal trees that achieve maximum/minimum. Moreover, for any $\alpha \in [0,1]$, we determine the extremal trees which maximize the convex combination $\alpha \lambda_1 + (1-\alpha)\lambda_2$ in the class of $n$-vertex trees.</description>

      <title>Simplicial spheres with $g_k=1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $d\geq 4$, Kalai (1987) characterized all simplicial $(d-1)$-spheres with $g_2=0$, and for $k\geq 2$ and $d\geq 2k$, Murai and Nevo (2013) characterized all simplicial $(d-1)$-spheres with $g_k=0$. In addition, for $d\geq 4$, Nevo and Novinsky (2011) characterized all simplicial $(d-1)$-spheres with $g_2=1$. Motivated by these results, we characterize, for any $k\geq 2$ and $d\geq 2k+1$, all simplicial $(d-1)$-spheres with no missing faces of dimension larger than $d-k$ that satisfy $g_k=1$. When $d=2k$, we obtain a characterization of simplicial $(d-1)$-spheres with $g_k=1$ and no missing faces of dimension greater than $k$, under the additional assumption that there exists at least one missing face of dimension $k$. Finally, for $k=3$, we are able to remove this assumption and characterize all simplicial $5$-spheres with no missing faces of dimension larger than $3$ that satisfy $g_3=1$.</description>

      <title>Advances on two spectral conjectures regarding booksize of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{booksize} $ \mathrm{bk}(G) \) of a graph $ G $, introduced by Erd\H{o}s, refers to the maximum integer $ r $ for which $G$ contains the book $ B_r $ as a subgraph. This paper investigates two open problems in spectral graph theory related to the booksize of graphs.
  First, we prove that for any positive integer $r$ and any $ B_{r+1} $-free graph $ G $ with $ m \geq (9r)^2 $ edges, the spectral radius satisfies $ \rho(G) \leq \sqrt{m} $. Equality holds if and only if $ G $ is a complete bipartite graph. This result improves the lower bound on the booksize of Nosal graphs (i.e., graphs with $ \rho(G) &gt; \sqrt{m} $) from the previously established $ \mathrm{bk}(G) &gt; \frac{1}{144}\sqrt{m} $ to $ \mathrm{bk}(G) &gt; \frac{1}{9}\sqrt{m} $, presenting a significant advancement in the booksize conjecture proposed Li, Liu, and Zhang.
  Second, we show that for any positive integer $r$ and any non-bipartite $ B_{r+1} $-free graph $ G $ with $ m \geq (240r)^2 $ edges, the spectral radius $\rho$ satisfies $\rho^2&lt;m-1+\frac{2}{\rho-1}$, unless $G$ is isomorphic to $S^+_{m,s}$ for some $s\in\{1,\ldots,r\}$. This resolves Liu and Miao's conjecture and further reveals an interesting phenomenon: even with a weaker spectral condition, $\rho^2\geq m-1+\frac2{\rho-1}$, we can still derive the supersaturation of the booksize for non-bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>On 3-Connected Planar Graphs with Unique Orientable Circuit Double Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A circuit double cover of a bridgeless graph is a collection of even subgraphs such that every edge is contained in exactly two subgraphs of the given collection. Such a circuit double cover describes an embedding of the corresponding graph onto a surface. In this paper, we investigate the well-known Orientable Strong Embedding Conjecture. This conjecture proposes that every bridgeless graph has a circuit double cover describing an embedding on an orientable surface. In a recent paper, we have proved that a 3-connected cubic planar graph G has exactly one orientable circuit double cover if and only if G is the dual graph of an Apollonian network. In this paper, we extend this result by demonstrating that this characterisation applies to any 3-connected planar graph, regardless of whether it is cubic.</description>

      <title>Unrefinable Partitions into Distinct Parts and Numerical Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article investigates structural connections between unrefinable partitions into distinct parts and numerical semigroups. By analysing the hooksets of Young diagrams associated with numerical sets, new criteria for recognising unrefinable partitions are established.
  A correspondence between missing parts and the gaps of numerical semigroups is developed, extending previous classifications and enabling the characterisation of partitions with maximal numbers of missing parts. In particular, the results show that certain families of unrefinable partitions correspond precisely to symmetric numerical semigroups when the maximal part is prime. Further structural consequences, examples, and a decomposition of unrefinable partitions by minimal excludant are discussed, together with implications for the study of maximal unrefinable partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that for every $k$ and every graph $H$ with $m$ edges and no isolated vertices, the Ramsey number $R(C_k,H)$ is at most $2m+\lfloor \frac{k-1}{2} \rfloor$, provided $m$ is sufficiently large with respect to $k$. This settles a problem of Erd\H{o}s, Faudree, Rousseau and Schelp.</description>

      <title>On the characterization of geometric distance-regular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2010, Koolen and Bang proposed the following conjecture: For a fixed integer $m \geq 2$, any geometric distance-regular graph with smallest eigenvalue $-m$, diameter $D \geq 3$ and $c_2 \geq 2$ is either a Johnson graph, a Grassmann graph, a Hamming graph, a bilinear forms graph, or the number of vertices is bounded above by a function of $m$. In this paper, we obtain some partial results towards this conjecture.</description>

      <title>The inducibility of Tur\'an graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $I(F,n)$ denote the maximum number of induced copies of a graph $F$ in an $n$-vertex graph. The inducibility of $F$, defined as $i(F)=\lim_{n\to \infty} I(F,n)/\binom{n}{v(F)}$, is a central problem in extremal graph theory. In this work, we investigate the inducibility of Tur\'an graphs $F$. This topic has been extensively studied in the literature, including works of Pippenger--Golumbic, Brown--Sidorenko, Bollob\'as--Egawa--Harris--Jin, Mubayi, Reiher, and the first author, and Yuster. Broadly speaking, these results resolve or asymptotically resolve the problem when the part sizes of $F$ are either sufficiently large or sufficiently small (at most four).
  We complete this picture by proving that for every Tur\'an graph $F$ and sufficiently large $n$, the value $I(F,n)$ is attained uniquely by the $m$-partite Tur\'an graph on $n$ vertices, where $m$ is given explicitly in terms of the number of parts and vertices of $F$. This confirms a conjecture of Bollob\'as--Egawa--Harris--Jin from 1995, and we also establish the corresponding stability theorem. Moreover, we prove an asymptotic analogue for $I_{k+1}(F,n)$, the maximum number of induced copies of $F$ in an $n$-vertex $K_{k+1}$-free graph, thereby completely resolving a recent problem of Yuster. Finally, our results extend to a broader class of complete multipartite graphs in which the largest and smallest part sizes differ by at most on the order of the square root of the smallest part size.</description>

      <title>(a,b)-Fibonacci-Legendre Cordial Graphs and k-Pisano-Legendre Primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $F_i$ be the $i$th $(a,b)$-Fibonacci number with initial values $F_0=a$ and $F_1=b$. For a simple connected graph $G=(V,E)$, define a bijective function $f:V(G)\to \{0,1,\ldots,|V|-1\}$. If the induced function $f_p^*:E(G)\to \{0,1\}$, defined by $f_p^*(uv)=\frac{1+([F_{f(u)}+F_{f(v)}]/p)}{2}$ whenever $F_{f(u)}+F_{f(v)}\not\equiv 0\pmod{p}$ and $f_p^*(uv)=0$ whenever $F_{f(u)}+F_{f(v)}\equiv 0\pmod{p}$, satisfies the condition $|e_{f_p^*}(0)-e_{f_p^*}(1)|\leq 1$ where $e_{f_p^*}(i)$ is the number of edges labeled $i$ ($i=0,1$), then $f$ is called $(a,b)$-Fibonacci-Legendre cordial labeling modulo $p$. In this paper, the $(a,b)$-Fibonacci-Legendre cordial labeling of path graphs, star graphs, wheel graphs, and graphs under the operations join, corona, lexicographic product, cartesian product, tensor product, and strong product is explored in relation to $k$-Pisano-Legendre primes relative to $(a,b)$. We also present some properties of $k$-Pisano-Legendre primes relative to $(a,b)$ and numerical observations on its distribution, leading to several conjectures concerning their density and growth behavior.</description>

Abstract: We define a real-valued distance metric $wd$ on the space $\mathcal{C}$ of short combinatorial games in canonical form. We demonstrate the existence of Cauchy sequences informed by sidling sequences, find limit points, and investigate the closure $\overline{\mathcal{C}}$, which is shown to partition the set of loopy games in a non-trivial way. Stoppers, enders, and non-stopper-sided loopy games are explored, as well as the topological properties of $(\mathcal{C},wd)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relation to Kostant's problem for simple highest weight modules over the general linear Lie algebra, we prove a persistence result for Kostant negative consecutive patterns. Inspired by it, we introduce the notion of a Kostant cuspidal permutation as a minimal Kostant negative consecutive pattern. It is shown that Kostant cuspidality is an invariant of a Kazhdan-Lusztig left cell. We describe four infinite families of Kostant cuspidal involutions, including a complete classification of Kostant cuspidal fully commutative involutions. In particular, we show that the number of new Kostant cuspidal elements can be arbitrarily large, when the rank grows. This provides some potential explanation why Kostant's problem is hard.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Supercritical Bounds for Disconnection in Bernoulli Site Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For any infinite, connected, locally finite graph $G=(V,E)$, any parameter $p&gt;p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c}(G)$, and any (finite or infinite) set of vertices $S\subset V$, we derive explicit exponential-type upper bounds on the disconnection probability $\mathbb{P}_{p}(S\nleftrightarrow\infty)$. The estimates are expressed in terms of a packing profile of $S$, encoded by a $(p,\varepsilon,c)$--packing number, which counts how many well-separated vertices in $S$ exhibit controlled local-to-global connectivity. The proof combines a local functional characterization of $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c}$ from \cite{ZL24,ZL26} with a packing construction and an amplification-by-independence argument, in the direction of Problem~1.6 in \cite{DC20}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.09958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be an infinite, connected, locally finite planar graph and consider i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(p)$ site percolation. Write $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ and $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ for the critical and uniqueness thresholds. Using a well--separated Freudenthal embedding $G\hookrightarrow\mathbb S^2$, we introduce a cycle--separation equivalence on ends and associated ``directional'' thresholds $p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$.
  When the set of end--equivalence classes is countable, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)=\inf_F p^{\mathrm{site}}_{c,F}(G)$ and that for every $p\in\bigl(\tfrac12,\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$ there are almost surely infinitely many infinite open clusters. Combined with the $0/\infty$ theorem of Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for $p\le \tfrac12$, this yields non--uniqueness throughout the full coexistence interval $\bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G),\,1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\bigr)$, and hence $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)\ge 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$ in this setting. This resolves the extension problem posed by Glazman--Harel--Zelesko for the upper half of the coexistence regime under a natural countability hypothesis.
  In contrast, for graphs with uncountably many end--equivalence classes we give criteria guaranteeing infinitely many infinite clusters above criticality, and we construct an explicit locally finite planar graph of minimum degree at least $7$ for which $p_u^{\mathrm{site}}(G)&lt;1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}(G)$. Consequently, the Benjamini--Schramm conjecture (Conjecture 7 in \cite{bs96}) that planarity together with minimal vertex degree at least 7 forces infinitely many infinite clusters for all $p\in(p_c,1-p_c)$ does not hold in full generality.
  Our proofs combine a cutset characterization of $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}$ with a planar alternating--arm exploration organized by an end--adapted boundary decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine an infinite family of linear identities for the number $A_4(n)$ of partition pairs of $n$ with $4$-cores by employing elementary $q$-series techniques and certain $3$-dissection formulas. We then discover an infinite family of congruences for $A_4(n)$ as a consequence of these linear identities.</description>

      <title>Twisted Cherednik spectrum as a $q,t$-deformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The common eigenfunctions of the twisted Cherednik operators can be first analyzed in the limit of $q\longrightarrow 1$. Then, the polynomial eigenfunctions form a simple set originating from the symmetric ground state of non-vanishing degree and excitations over it, described by non-symmetric polynomials of higher degrees and enumerated by weak compositions. This pattern is inherited by the full spectrum at $q\neq 1$, which can be considered as a deformation. The whole story looks like a typical NP problem: the Cherednik equations are difficult to solve, but easy to check the solution once it is somehow found.</description>

      <title>Coarsening Causal DAG Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directed acyclic graphical (DAG) models are a powerful tool for representing causal relationships among jointly distributed random variables, especially concerning data from across different experimental settings. However, it is not always practical or desirable to estimate a causal model at the granularity of given features in a particular dataset. There is a growing body of research on causal abstraction to address such problems. We contribute to this line of research by (i) providing novel graphical identifiability results for practically-relevant interventional settings, (ii) proposing an efficient, provably consistent algorithm for directly learning abstract causal graphs from interventional data with unknown intervention targets, and (iii) uncovering theoretical insights about the lattice structure of the underlying search space, with connections to the field of causal discovery more generally. As proof of concept, we apply our algorithm on synthetic and real datasets with known ground truths, including measurements from a controlled physical system with interacting light intensity and polarization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of locating the source (starting vertex) of a simple random walk, given a snapshot of the set of edges (or vertices) visited in the first $n$ steps. Considering lattices $\mathbb{Z}^d$, in dimensions $d \geq 5$, we show that the source can be identified (a) with probability bounded away from $0$ using one guess, and (b) with probability arbitrarily close to $1$ using a constant number of guesses. On the other hand, for dimensions $d \leq 2$, we show that one cannot locate the source with positive constant probability. Our arguments apply more generally to strongly transient and recurrent simple random walks on vertex-transitive graphs.</description>

Abstract: We establish an extension of Viennot's geometric (shadow line) construction to the setting of oscillating tableaux. We then use this to give a new proof of the Type $C$ analogue of Schensted's theorem on longest decreasing subsequences. This pairs with our results from arXiv:2103.14997v1 [math.RT] on Type $C$ webs to give a direct proof of a result of Sundaram and Stanley: that the dimension of the space of invariant vectors in a $2k$-fold tensor product of the vector representation of $\mathfrak{sp}_{2n}$ equals the number of $(n+1)$-avoiding matchings of $2k$ points.</description>

Abstract: Witte Morris showed in [21] that every connected Cayley graph of a finite (generalized) dihedral group has a Hamiltonian path. The infinite dihedral group is defined as the free product with amalgamation $\mathbb Z_2 \ast \mathbb Z_2$. We show that every connected Cayley graph of the infinite dihedral group has both a Hamiltonian double ray, and extend this result to all two-ended generalized quasi-dihedral groups.</description>

      <title>Reuniting $\chi$-boundedness with polynomial $\chi$-boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11167v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(H)\le f(\omega(H))$ for all induced subgraphs $H$ of a graph in $\mathcal{F}$. If $f$ can be chosen to be a polynomial, we say that $\mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Esperet proposed a conjecture that every $\chi$-bounded class of graphs is polynomially $\chi$-bounded. This conjecture has been disproved; it has been shown that there are classes of graphs that are $\chi$-bounded but not polynomially $\chi$-bounded. Nevertheless, inspired by Esperet's conjecture, we introduce Pollyanna classes of graphs. A class $\mathcal{C}$ of graphs is Pollyanna if $\mathcal{C}\cap \mathcal{F}$ is polynomially $\chi$-bounded for every $\chi$-bounded class $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs. We prove that several classes of graphs are Pollyanna and also present some proper classes of graphs that are not Pollyanna.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a graph with a cut vertex whose deletion produces at least five connected components must be missing a connected partition of some type. We prove that this also holds if there are four connected components that each have at least two vertices. In particular, the chromatic symmetric function of such a graph cannot be $e$-positive. This brings us very close to the conjecture by Dahlberg, She, and van Willigenburg of non-$e$-positivity for all trees with a vertex of degree at least four. We also prove that spiders with four legs cannot have an $e$-positive chromatic symmetric function.</description>

      <title>Towards the classification of maximum scattered linear sets of $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Every maximum scattered linear set in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$ is the projection of an $\mathbb{F}_q$-subgeometry $\Sigma$ of $\mathrm{PG}(4,q^5)$ from a plane $\Gamma$ external to the secant variety to $\Sigma$. The pair $(\Gamma,\Sigma)$ will be called a projecting configuration for the linear set. The projecting configurations for the only known maximum scattered linear sets in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$, namely those of pseudoregulus and LP type, have been characterized in the literature by B. Csajb\'{o}k, C. Zanella in 2016 and by C. Zanella, F. Zullo in 2020. Let $(\Gamma,\Sigma)$ be a projecting configuration for a maximum scattered linear set in $\mathrm{PG}(1,q^5)$, let $\sigma$ be a generator of $\mathbb{G}=\mathrm{P}\Gamma \mathrm{L}(5,q^5)_\Sigma$, and $A=\Gamma\cap\Gamma^{\sigma^4}$, $B=\Gamma\cap\Gamma^{\sigma^3}$. If $A$ and $B$ are not both points, then the projected linear set is of pseudoregulus type. Then, suppose that they are points. The rank of a point $X$ is the vectorial dimension of the span of the orbit of $X$ under the action of $\mathbb{G}$. In this paper, by investigating the geometric properties of projecting configurations, it is proved that if at least one of the points $A$ and $B$ has rank 5, the associated maximum scattered linear set must be of LP type. Then, if a maximum scattered linear set of a new type exists, it must be such that $\mathrm{rk} A=\mathrm{rk} B=4$. In this paper we derive two possible polynomial forms that such a linear set must have. An exhaustive analysis by computer shows that for $q\leq 25$, no new maximum scattered linear set exists.</description>

      <title>The Greedy Algorithm for Dissociated Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07068v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set $\mathcal S\subset \mathbb N$ is said to be a subset-sum-distinct or dissociated if all of its finite subsets have different sums. Alternately, an equivalent classification is if any equality of the form $$\sum_{s\in \mathcal S} \varepsilon_s \cdot s =0$$ where $\varepsilon_s \in \{-1,0,+1\}$ implies that all the $\varepsilon_s$'s are $0$. For a dissociated set $\mathcal S$, we prove that for $c_\ast = \frac 12 \log_2 \left(\frac \pi 2\right)$ and any $c_\ast-1&lt;C&lt;c_\ast$, we have $$\mathcal S(n) \,:=\, \mathcal S\cap [1,n] \,\le\, \log_2 n +\frac 12 \log_2\log_2 n + C$$ for all $n\in \mathcal N_C$ with asymptotic density $\mathbf d\left(\mathcal N_C\right)=2-2^{c_\ast-C}$. Further, we consider the greedy algorithm for generating these sets and prove that this algorithm always eventually doubles. Finally, we also consider some generalizations of dissociated sets and prove similar results about them.</description>

      <title>The signless Laplacian spectral Tur\'an problems for hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08595v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{H}=(V, E)$ be an $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices. The signless Laplacian spectral radius of $\mathcal{H}$ is defined as the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of the tensor $\mathcal{Q}(\mathcal{H})=\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})+\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{H})$, where $\mathcal{D}(\mathcal{H})$ and $\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{H})$ are the degree diagonal tensor and the adjacency tensor of $\mathcal{H}$, respectively. In this paper, we establish a general theorem that extends the spectral Tur\'an result of Keevash, Lenz and Mubayi [SIAM J. Discrete Math., 28 (4) (2014)]
  to the setting of signless Laplacian spectral Tur\'an problems. We prove that if a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs is degree-stable with respect to a family $\mathcal{H}_n$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs and its extremal constructions satisfy certain natural assumptions, then the signless Laplacian spectral Tur\'an problem for $\mathcal{F}$ can be effectively reduced to the corresponding problem restricted to the family $\mathcal{H}_n$. As a concrete application, we completely determine the extremal hypergraph that maximizes the signless Laplacian spectral radius among all Fano plane-free $3$-uniform hypergraphs, showing that the unique extremal hypergraph is the balanced complete bipartite $3$-uniform hypergraph.</description>

Abstract: Banderier, Marchal, and Wallner considered Young tableaux with walls, which are similar to standard Young tableaux, except that local decreases are allowed at some walls. In this work, we prove a conjecture of Fuchs and Yu concerning the enumeration of two classes of three-row Young tableaux with walls. Combining with the work by Chang, Fuchs, Liu, Wallner, and Yu leads to the verification of a conjecture on tree-child networks proposed by Pons and Batle. This conjecture was regarded as a specific and challenging problem in the Phylogenetics community until it was finally resolved by the present work.</description>

      <title>Steenrod Lengths and a Problem of Vakil</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.01672v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give an explicit combinatorial description of the function $f(n)$ governing the Steenrod length of real projective spaces $\mathbb{RP}^n$. This function arises in stable homotopy theory through the action of Steenrod squares on mod-$2$ cohomology and is closely related to the ghost length, which measures the minimal number of spheres required to construct a space up to homotopy. Building on the directed graphs $T_n$ introduced by Vakil to encode degree constraints for Steenrod operations, we interpret $f(n)$ as the length of the longest directed path starting at $n$. Using this framework, we resolve a question posed by Vakil by deriving concrete combinatorial formulas for $f(n)$ in terms of binary classes and a distinguished family of integers, which we call Vakil numbers.</description>

      <title>Planar site percolation via tree embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00923v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that if $G$ is an infinite, connected, planar graph properly embedded in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with minimum degree at least $7$, then i.i.d.\ Bernoulli$(p)$ site percolation on $G$ almost surely has infinitely many infinite open (1-)clusters for every \[ p \in \bigl(p_c^{\mathrm{site}},\, 1-p_c^{\mathrm{site}}\bigr). \] Moreover, we show that $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}&lt;\tfrac12$, so this non-uniqueness interval is nonempty. This verifies Conjecture~7 of Benjamini and Schramm~\cite{bs96} for this class of properly embedded planar graphs.
  Our proof introduces a new construction of embedded trees in $G$. These trees yield infinitely many infinite clusters for percolation parameters near $\tfrac12$, and they also enable exponential decay of two-point connection probabilities by partitioning $G$ using infinitely many disjoint trees. Variants of this approach were later used in~\cite{ZL26} to construct a counterexample to Conjecture~7 of~\cite{bs96} for planar graphs with uncountably many ends.
  Finally, the methods developed here have further applications: in~\cite{perc24} they are used to prove a vertex-cut characterization of $p_c^{\mathrm{site}}$ (conjectured by Kahn in~\cite{JK03}) and to refute an edge-cut characterization proposed by Lyons and Peres~\cite{LP16} and Tang (\cite{Tang2023}).</description>

      <title>The five-color hypercube Adinkra and the Jacobian of a generalized Fermat curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adinkras are highly structured graphs developed to study 1-dimensional supersymmetry algebras. A cyclic ordering of the edge colors of an Adinkra, or rainbow, determines a Riemann surface and a height function on the vertices of the Adinkra determines a divisor on this surface. We study the induced map from height functions to divisors on the Jacobian of the Riemann surface. In the first nontrivial case, a 5-dimensional hypercube corresponding to a Jacobian given by a product of 5 elliptic curves each with $j$-invariant 2048, we develop and characterize a purely combinatorial algorithm to compute height function images. We show that when restricted to a single elliptic curve, every height function is a multiple of a specified generating divisor, and raising and lowering vertices corresponds to adding or subtracting this generator. We also give strict bounds on the coefficients of this generator that appear in the collection of all divisors of height functions.</description>

      <title>Information-theoretic coordinate subset and partition selection of multivariate Markov chains via submodular optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of optimally projecting the transition matrix of a finite ergodic multivariate Markov chain onto a lower-dimensional state space, as well as the problem of finding an optimal partition of coordinates such that the factorized Markov chain gives minimal information loss compared to the original multivariate chain. Specifically, we seek to construct a Markov chain that optimizes various information-theoretic criteria under cardinality constraints. These criteria include entropy rate, information-theoretic distance to factorizability, independence, and stationarity. We formulate these tasks as best subset or partition selection problems over multivariate Markov chains and leverage the (k-)submodular (or (k-)supermodular) structures of the objective functions to develop efficient greedy-based algorithms with theoretical guarantees. Along the way, we introduce a generalized version of the distorted greedy algorithm, which may be of independent interest. Finally, we illustrate the theory and algorithms through extensive numerical experiments with publicly available code on multivariate Markov chains associated with the Bernoulli--Laplace and Curie--Weiss models.</description>

      <title>Diameter and mixing time of the giant component in the percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13348v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider bond percolation on the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube with $p=c/d$ for fixed $c&gt;1$. We prove that the typical diameter of the giant component $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d)$, and the typical mixing time of the lazy random walk on $L_1$ is of order $\Theta(d^2)$. This resolves long-standing open problems of Bollob\'as, Kohayakawa and {\L}uczak from 1994, and of Benjamini and Mossel from 2003.
  A key component in our approach is a new tight large deviation estimate on the number of vertices in $L_1$ whose proof includes several novel ingredients: a structural description of the residue outside the giant component after sprinkling, a tight quantitative estimate on the spread of the giant in the hypercube, and a stability principle which rules out the disintegration of large connected sets under thinning. This toolkit further allows us to obtain optimal bounds on the expansion in $L_1$.</description>

      <title>Skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras from surfaces and symmetric quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study skew-symmetrizable cluster algebras $\mathcal{A}$ associated with unpunctured surfaces $\tilde{\mathbf{S}}$ endowed with an orientation-preserving involution $\sigma$. We give a geometric realization of such cluster algebras by showing that cluster variables of $\mathcal{A}$ correspond to $\sigma$-orbits of arcs of $\tilde{\mathbf{S}}$, while clusters are given by admissible $\sigma$-invariant triangulations. We establish a ring homomorphism from $\mathcal{A}$ to a skew-symmetric cluster algebra of the same rank, which is combinatorially derived from $\mathcal{A}$. We use this result to provide a cluster expansion formula for any $\sigma$-orbit $[\gamma]$ in terms of perfect matchings of some labeled modified snake graphs constructed from the arcs of $[\gamma]$. Then, we associate a symmetric finite-dimensional algebra $A$ to any seed of $\mathcal{A}$, such that non-initial cluster variables bijectively correspond to orthogonal indecomposable $A$-modules. Finally, we exhibit a purely representation-theoretic map from the category of orthogonal $A$-modules to $\mathcal{A}$, providing a Caldero-Chapoton map in this setting.</description>

      <title>Chamber zeta function and closed galleries in the standard non-uniform complex from $\operatorname{PGL}_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{chamber zeta function} for a complex of groups, defined via an Euler product over primitive tailless chamber galleries, extending the Ihara--Bass framework from weighted graphs to higher-rank settings. Let $\mathcal{B}$ be the Bruhat--Tits building of $\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(F)$ for a non-archimedean local field $F$ with residue field $\mathbb{F}_{q}$. For the standard arithmetic quotient $\Gamma\backslash\mathcal{B}$ with $\Gamma=\mathrm{PGL}_{3}(\mathbb{F}_{q}[t])$, we prove an Ihara--Bass type \emph{determinant formula} expressing the chamber zeta function as the reciprocal of a characteristic polynomial of a naturally defined chamber transfer operator. In particular, the chamber zeta function is \emph{rational} in its complex parameter. As an application of the determinant formula, we obtain explicit counting results for closed gallery classes arising from tailless galleries in $\mathcal{B}$, including exact identities and spectral asymptotics governed by the chamber operator.</description>

      <title>Linear identities for partition pairs with $5$-cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04743v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an infinite family of linear identities for the number $A_5(n)$ of partition pairs of $n$ with $5$-cores by using certain theta function identities involving the Ramanujan's parameter $k(q)$ due to Cooper, and Lee and Park. Consequently, we deduce an infinite family of congruences for $A_5(n)$ using these linear identities.</description>
