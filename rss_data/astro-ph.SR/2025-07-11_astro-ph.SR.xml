      <title>The Unhurried Universe: A Continued Search for Long Term Variability in ASAS-SN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search a sample of 5,685,060 isolated sources in the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) with 14.5&lt;g&lt;15 mag for slowly varying sources with brightness changes larger than ~0.03 mag/year over 10 years. We find 426 slowly-varying systems. Of these systems, 200 are identified as variables for the first time, 226 are previously classified as variables, and we find equal numbers of sources becoming brighter and fainter. Previously classified systems were mostly identified as semi-regular variables (SR), slow irregular variables (L), or unknown (MISC or VAR), as long time scale variability does not fit into a standard class. Much like Petz &amp; Kochanek 2025, the sources are scattered across the color magnitude diagram and can be placed into 5 groups that exhibit distinct behaviors. There are also six AGN. There are 262 candidates (~62 percent) that also show shorter time scale periodic variability, mostly with periods longer than 10 days. The variability of 66 of these candidates may be related to dust. Combining the new slow variable candidates with the candidates from Petz &amp; Kochanek 2025, we have found a total of 1206 slow variables.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Orbits of Subsystems in Multiple Stars. XI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adding to the large radial velocity survey of nearby solar-type stars (summary in Tokovinin, 2023a), spectroscopic orbits are determined for four hierarchical systems: HIP 49442 (inner and outer periods of 164.55 d and 34 yr, respectively), HIP 55691 (2.4 and 415 yr), HIP 61465 (86.8 d), and HIP 78662C (0.82 d). Each system is discussed individually. Seven Gaia orbits of low-mass dwarfs, each with two additional resolved (interferometric and wide) companions, i.e. potential quadruples, are tested by monitoring radial velocities; five orbits are confirmed and two are refuted. Five of these systems are quadruples of 3+1 hierarchy, one is quintuple, and one is triple. Strengths and limitations of the Gaia data on multiple systems and the need of complementary observations are highlighted.</description>

      <title>A Radio Flaring, Chromospherically-Inactive K Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on an unusual radio source J180526-292953, initially identified as a steep spectrum, polarized point source toward the Galactic bulge and found to coincide with the nearby K dwarf HD317101A. We conducted a multi-wavelength radio study utilizing new GMRT observations and archival data from ASKAP, MeerKAT, and the VLA. At 1.5 GHz, HD317101A exhibits highly polarized coherent emission with variable activity lasting several hours with an apparent period of 3.7 days, which is consistent with electron cyclotron maser (ECM) emission. The behavior at 3 GHz is distinctive, with a short burst lasting tens of seconds to minutes, a flat spectrum, and no detected polarization, possibly suggesting gyro-synchrotron emission. High-resolution optical spectroscopy from CHIRON/SMARTS confirms HD317101A as a mature, chromospherically inactive K7V star, while Gaia astrometry, combined with speckle imaging from Zorro/Gemini-S, indicates the presence of a close-in M5.5V companion. We evaluated three possible origins for the combined radio behavior: chromospheric activity, auroral emission (possibly from a star-planet interaction), or an ultra-long-period transient. The bulk of the evidence favors an auroral origin, but the dominant stellar source of the ECM emission remains uncertain. Future VLBI observations, long-term TESS monitoring, high resolution spectroscopy and further radio characterization will be key to distinguishing between various scenarios.</description>

      <title>OWLS I: The Olin Wilson Legacy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present initial results from a planned 10 year survey of Ca II H &amp; K emission, using observations made with the ARC 3.5m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory. The primary goal of the survey is to investigate activity cycles in low mass stars. The sample includes stars chosen from the legacy Mount Wilson survey carried out by Olin Wilson more than 50 years ago, together with newly identified planet-host stars and a select sample of early-mid M dwarfs. This paper presents the first four years of data, comprising 1040 observations of 271 stars, with a specific focus on K and M stars. We identify a subsample of 153 stars for continuing observations over the full 10 year survey. Early results indicate that our data are consistent with the MWO cycle periods over a time span of more than 50 years; that there is a bifurcation in activity in the late K range with separate populations of low and high activity stars at lower masses; and that M dwarf planet hosts tend to be mainly found in the population of low activity stars, even in the unbiased (by activity) TESS sample, potentially indicating a link between activity and planet formation. We have also found indications of possible cyclic variability in some of the lower mass stars in the sample. Our ultimate goal is to link the activity cycle and rotation periods in a robust sample of stars spanning FGKM spectral types and to investigate the implications for the underlying magnetic dynamo.</description>

      <title>Axisymmetric second order perturbations of rotating main sequence stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the second order perturbations driven by oscillation modes of rotating stars. Assuming that the typical amplitude $a$ of oscillation modes is small, we expand the perturbed quantities as $Q=Q^{(0)}+Q^{(1)}+Q^{(2)}+\cdots$ where $Q^{(0)}$ represents the equilibrium state and $Q^{(1)}$ and $Q^{(2)}$ are the first order and second order perturbations in $a$, respectively. We assume that the first order perturbations are given by non-axisymmetric modes and the second order perturbations are axisymmetric. For the second order perturbations, we derive a set of linear partial differential equations, which have inhomogeneous terms due to the first order perturbations. For low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes and overstable convective (OsC) modes of main sequence stars, we calculate the second order velocity field $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$ and find that prograde $g$-modes and OsC modes tend to accelerate and retrograde $r$-modes to decelerate $v_\phi^{(2)}$ in the surface equatorial regions where $v_\phi^{(2)}$ is the $\phi$ component of $\mathbf{v}^{(2)}$. Using the angular momentum conservation equation derived for waves, we discuss that low frequency $g$- and $r$-modes transport angular momentum between the inner and outer parts of the envelope. For OsC modes in the core resonantly coupled with envelope prograde $g$-modes, we find that they can transport angular momentum from the core to the outer envelope so that they tend to brake the core rotation. We also suggest that the OsC modes provide the outer envelope of rotating stars with the torque enough to support a decretion disc.</description>

      <title>Minimal Roles of Solar Subsurface Meridional Flow in the distributed-shear Babcock-Leighton Dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subsurface meridional flow has long been recognized as a critical factor in driving the solar cycle. Specifically, the equatorward return flow in the tachocline is widely believed to be responsible for the formation of the sunspot butterfly diagram and determine the solar cycle period within the framework of flux transport dynamo (FTD) models. We aim to investigate whether the subsurface meridional flow also plays a significant role in the recently developed distributed-shear Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo model, which operates within the convection zone, rather than the tachocline. Various meridional flow configurations, including a deep single cell, a shallow single cell, and double cells, are applied in the distributed-shear BL dynamo model to explore the mechanisms driving the butterfly diagram and variations in the cycle period. Subsurface meridional flow plays a minimal role in the distributed-shear BL dynamo. A solar-like butterfly diagram can be generated even with a double-cell meridional flow. The diagram arises from the time- and latitude-dependent regeneration of the toroidal field, governed by latitude-dependent latitudinal differential rotation and the evolution of surface magnetic fields. The cycle period is determined by the surface flux source and transport process responsible for polar field generation, which corresponds to the $\alpha$-effect in the BL-type dynamo. The cycle period may exhibit varying dependence on the amplitude of the subsurface flow. The distributed-shear BL dynamo differs fundamentally from the FTD models, as it does not rely on the subsurface flux transport. This distinction aligns the distributed-shear BL dynamo more closely with the original BL dynamo and the conventional $\alpha\Omega$ dynamo. Although the subsurface meridional flow plays a negligible role in our distributed-shear BL dynamo, the poleward surface flow is essential.</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Sun-as-a-star flare spectra from high-resolution solar observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially resolved observations of the Sun and the astronomical sample size of stellar bodies are the respective key strengths of solar and stellar observations. However, the large difference in object brightness between the Sun and other stars has led to distinctly different instrumentation and methodologies between the two fields. We produce and analyze synthetic full-disk spectra derived from 19 small area field-of-view optical observations of solar flares acquired by the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST) between 2011 and 2024. These are used to investigate what can and cannot be inferred about physical processes on the Sun from Sun-as-a-star observations. The recently released Numerical Empirical Sun-as-a-Star Integrator (NESSI) code provides synthetic full-disk integrated spectral line emission based on smaller field-of-view input, accounting for center-to-limb variations and differential rotation. We use this code to generate pseudo-Sun-as-a-star spectra from the SST observations. ...</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Atmospheric Escape Observations with the Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 highlights the importance of advancing research focused on discovering and characterizing habitable worlds. In line with this priority, our goal is to investigate how planetary systems evolve through atmospheric escape and to develop methods for identifying potentially Earth-like planets. By leveraging the ultraviolet (UV) capabilities of the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), we can use transit spectroscopy to observe atmospheric escape in exoplanets and explore the processes that shape their evolution, assess the ability of small planets to retain their atmospheres, and search for signs of Earth-like atmospheres. To achieve this, we support the development of a UV spectrograph with moderate- to high-resolution capabilities for point-source observations, coverage of key spectral features in the 100-300 nm range, and detectors that can register high count rates reliably. This article is an adaptation of a science case document developed for the Characterizing Exoplanets Steering Committee within HWO's Solar Systems in Context Working Group.</description>

      <title>The Orbital Eccentricity-Radius Relation for Planets Orbiting M Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital eccentricity-radius relation for small planets is indicative of the predominant dynamical sculpting processes during late-stage orbital evolution. Previous studies have shown that planets orbiting Sun-like stars exhibit an eccentricity-radius trend such that larger planets have higher orbital eccentricities, and that radius gap planets may have modestly higher orbital eccentricities than planets on either side of the radius gap. In this work, we investigate the trend for a sample of smaller M dwarf stars. For a sample of 236 single- and multi-transit confirmed planets or candidates discovered by the TESS and Kepler missions, we constrain orbital eccentricity for each planet from the transit photometry together with a stellar density prior. We investigate the binned eccentricity-planet radius relation for the combined planet sample and present evidence for a positive eccentricity-radius relationship with elevated eccentricities for planets larger than 3.5 R_earth, similar to the trend for planets orbiting Sun-like stars. We find modest evidence that single-transit M dwarf planets near the radius gap exhibit higher eccentricity, consistent with trends for Sun-like stars. However, we see no evidence for an increased eccentricity near the radius gap among multi-transit M dwarf planets. We discuss implications for these results in the context of predominant atmospheric loss mechanisms: namely, supporting evidence for photoevaporation in M dwarf planets vs. planet-planet collisions or giant impacts in FGK dwarf planets.</description>

      <title>The Roasting Marshmallows Program with IGRINS on Gemini South III: Seeing deeper into the metal depleted atmosphere of a gas-giant on the cusp of the hot to ultra-hot Jupiter transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-hot Jupiters are a class of gas-giant exoplanets that show a peculiar combination of thermochemical properties in the form of molecular dissociation, atomic ionization, and inverted thermal structures. Atmospheric characterization of gas giants lying in the transitional regime between hot and ultra-hot Jupiters can help in understanding the physical mechanisms that cause the fundamental transition in atmospheres between the two classes of hot gas giants. Using Doppler spectroscopy with IGRINS on Gemini South (1.4 to 2.5 $\mu$m), we present the day-side high-resolution spectrum of WASP-122b (T$_{\mathrm{day}}$=2258$ \pm$ 54 K), a gas-giant situated at this transition. We detect the signal from H$_{2}$O, based on which we find that WASP-122b has a significantly metal-depleted atmosphere with metallicity log$_{10}$[Z$_{\mathrm{P}}$/Z$_{\odot}$] = $-$1.48$\pm$0.25 dex (0.033$_{-0.016}^{+0.018}$ $\times$ solar), and solar/sub-solar C/O ratio = 0.36$\pm$0.22 (3$\sigma$ upper limit 0.82). Drastically low atmospheric metallicity pushes the contribution function to higher pressures, resulting in the planetary spectral lines to originate from a narrow region around 1 bar where the thermal profile is non-inverted. This is inconsistent with solar composition radiative convective equilibrium (RCTE) which predicts an inverted atmosphere with spectral lines in emission. The sub-solar metallicity and solar/sub-solar C/O ratio is inconsistent with expectations from core-accretion. We find the planetary signal to be significantly shifted in K$_{\mathrm{P}}$ and V$_{\mathrm{sys}}$, which is in tension with the predictions from global circulation models and require further investigation. Our results highlight the detailed information content of high-resolution spectroscopy data and their ability to constrain complex atmospheric thermal structures and compositions of exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping Survey: VIII. Galactic Chemical Gradient and Azimuthal Analysis from SDSS/MWM DR19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Open Cluster Chemical Abundances and Mapping (OCCAM) survey seeks to curate a large, comprehensive, uniform dataset of open clusters and member stars to constrain key Galactic parameters. This eighth entry from the OCCAM survey, based on the newly released SDSS-V/MWM Data Release 19 (DR19), has established a sample of 164 high quality open clusters that are used to constrain the radial and azimuthal gradients of the Milky Way. The DR19 cluster sample [Fe/H] abundances are roughly consistent with measurements from other large-scale spectroscopic surveys. However, the gradients we calculate deviate considerably for some elements. We find an overall linear Galactic radial [Fe/H] gradient of $-0.075 \pm 0.006$ dex kpc$^{-1}$ using the cluster's current Galactocentric Radius ($R_{GC}$) and a gradient of $-0.068 \pm 0.005$ dex kpc$^-1$ with respect to the cluster's guiding center radius. We do not find strong evidence for significant evolution of the differential element gradients ([X/Fe]) investigated here (O, Mg, Si, S, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Na, Al, K, Ce, Nd). For the first time using the OCCAM sample we have sufficient numbers of clusters to investigate Galactic azimuthal variations. In this work, we do find evidence of azimuthal variations in the measured radial abundance gradient in the Galactic disk using our open cluster sample.</description>

      <title>A comprehensive study on radial velocity signals using ESPRESSO: Pushing precision to the 10 cm/s level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse ESPRESSO data for the stars HD10700, HD20794, HD102365, and HD304636 acquired via its Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) programme. We characterise the stars' radial velocity (RV) signals down to a precision of 10 cm/s on timescales ranging from minutes to planetary periods falling within the host's habitable zone (HZ). We study the RV signature of pulsation, granulation, and stellar activity, inferring the potential presence of planets around these stars. Thus, we outline the population of planets that while undetectable remain compatible with the available data.
  A simple model of stellar pulsations successfully reproduced the intra-night RV scatter of HD10700 down to a few cm/s. For HD102365 and HD20794, an additional source of scatter at the level of several 10 cm/s remains necessary to explain the data. A kima analysis was used to evaluate the number of planets supported by the nightly averaged time series of each of HD10700, HD102365, and HD304636, under the assumption that a quasi-periodic Gaussian process (GP) regression is able to model the activity signal. While a frequency analysis of HD10700 RVs is able to identify a periodic signal at 20d, when it is modelled along with the activity signal the signal is formally non-significant. ESPRESSO data on their own do not provide conclusive evidence for the existence of planets around these three stars.
  ESPRESSO is shown to reach an on-sky RV precision of better than 10 cm/s on short timescales (&lt;1h) and of 40 cm/s over 3.5 yr. A subdivision of the datasets showcases a precision reaching 20-30 cm/s over one year. These results impose stringent constraints on the impact of granulation mechanisms on RV. In spite of no detections, our analysis of HD10700 RVs demonstrates a sensitivity to planets with a mass of 1.7M$_{\oplus}$ for periods of up to 100 d, and a mass of 2-5M$_{\oplus}$ for the star's HZ.

      <title>The Impact of Natal Kicks on Black Hole Binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In massive binary-star systems, supernova explosions can significantly alter the orbit during the formation of compact objects. Some compact objects are predicted to form via direct collapse, a scenario with negligible mass loss and no baryonic ejecta emitted. In this scenario, most of the energy is released via neutrinos, and any resulting natal kick arises from asymmetries in their emission. Here I investigate stellar collapse leading to binary black hole (BH) formation, with a focus on how the natal kick influences the gravitational-wave-driven merger time. Broadly, I find three regimes. For low natal kicks, the effect on the time-to-coalescence is negligible. For moderate natal kicks, if the binary remains bound, up to 50% of binary BHs experience a decrease in their time-to-coalescence by more than an order of magnitude. For large natal kicks, although most binaries become unbound, those that remain bound may acquire retrograde orbits and/or lead to shorter time-to-coalescence. For binary BH mergers, large natal kicks ($\gtrsim100$ km/s) are hard to reconcile with both neutrino natal kicks and the complete collapse scenario. This suggests that retrograde orbits and shortened merger times could only arise in volatile BH formation scenarios or if spin-axis tossing is at work. Consequently, electromagnetic observations of BHs in massive star binaries within the Local Group offer a more effective means to probe the physics behind complete collapse. Another promising population for deciphering the complete collapse scenario is that of massive, wide binaries. Although Gaia may help shed light on these systems, longer observational baselines will likely be needed to fully understand the roles of neutrino natal kicks and stellar collapse in BH formation.</description>

      <title>A forecasting framework for galactic cosmic ray flux in space weather applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intensity and energy spectrum of galactic cosmic rays in the heliosphere are significantly influenced by the 11-year solar cycle, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. Understanding this effect and its underlying physical mechanisms is essential for assessing radiation exposure and associated risks during space missions. Starting from a previously developed effective predictive model of solar modulation, validated using cosmic ray flux measurements from space-based detectors such as PAMELA and AMS-02, we build a generalizable forecasting strategy for the long-term evolution of cosmic ray fluxes. This strategy is based on identifying delayed cross-correlation relationships between solar proxies and the model's parameters. It integrates recent findings on time lags between cosmic ray fluxes and solar activity, and incorporates advanced time-series signal processing techniques. The framework not only performs well in reproducing observed data, but also shows strong potential for applications in space radiation monitoring and forecasting. By efficiently capturing the long-term variability of galactic cosmic rays, our approach contributes valuable insights for evaluating radiation risks, ultimately supporting safer and more effective space exploration.</description>

      <title>TOI-1259Ab: A Warm Jupiter Orbiting a K-dwarf White-Dwarf Binary is on a Well-aligned Orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The evolution of one member of a stellar binary into a white dwarf has been proposed as a mechanism that triggers the formation of close-in gas giant planets. The star's asymmetric mass loss during the AGB stage gives it a "kick" that can initiate Eccentric Lidov-Kozai oscillations, potentially causing a planet around the secondary star to migrate inwards and perturbing the eccentricity and inclination of its orbit. Here we present a measurement of the stellar obliquity of TOI-1259Ab, a gas giant in a close-in orbit around a K star with a white dwarf companion about 1650 au away. By using the NEID spectrograph to detect the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect during the planetary transit, we find the sky-projected obliquity to be $\lambda = 6^{+21}_{-22}\,^\circ$. When combined with estimates of the stellar rotation period, radius, and projected rotation velocity, we find the true 3D obliquity to be $\psi = 24^{+14}_{-12}\,^\circ$ ($\psi &lt; 48^\circ$ at 95% confidence), revealing that the orbit of TOI-1259Ab is well aligned with the star's equatorial plane. Because the planet's orbit is too wide for tidal realignment to be expected, TOI-1259Ab might have formed quiescently in this well-aligned configuration. Alternatively, as we show with dynamical simulations, Eccentric Lidov-Kozai oscillations triggered by the evolution of the binary companion are expected to lead to a low obliquity with a probability of about $\sim$14%.</description>

      <title>CO desorption from interstellar icy grains induced by IR excitation of superhydrogenated PAHs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) radiation dominates dense, interstellar clouds, yet its effect on icy grains remains largely unexplored. Its potential role in driving the photodesorption of volatile species from such grains has recently been demonstrated, providing a crucial link between the solid state reservoir of molecules and the gas phase. In this work, we investigate IR-induced photodesorption of CO for astrophysically relevant ice systems containing perhydropyrene (PHP). This fully superhydrogenated version of pyrene is used as an analogue for large carbonaceous molecules such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and related species, as well as hydrogenated carbonaceous grains. The abundance and range of strong IR absorption bands of these carbonaceous species make them interesting candidates for IR-induced effects. We present IR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric measurements probing the effects of IR radiation on two ice systems: a layered ice with CO on top of PHP, and a CO:PHP mixed ice. These ices were irradiated with IR radiation from the FELIX IR Free Electron Laser (FEL) FEL-2. In accordance with previous studies, we confirm that direct excitation of CO is not an efficient pathway to CO desorption, indicating that another energy dissipation mechanism exists. We demonstrate that vibrational excitation of the PHP CH stretching modes leads to efficient CO photodesorption. The derived photodesorption yields are an order of magnitude higher for the layered than the mixed system and comparable to those previously obtained for CO photodesorption from CO on amorphous solid water upon excitation of H$_2$O vibrational modes. Our results indicate that IR excitation of carbonaceous molecules and grains in dense clouds could potentially play an important role in the desorption of volatile species such as CO from icy grains.</description>

      <title>Fragmentation of Dense Rotation-Dominated Structures Fed by Collapsing Gravomagneto-Sheetlets and Origin of Misaligned 100 au-Scale Binaries and Multiple Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07777v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The majority of stars are in binary/multiple systems. How such systems form in turbulent, magnetized cores of molecular clouds in the presence of non-ideal MHD effects remains relatively under-explored. Through ATHENA++-based non-ideal MHD AMR simulations with ambipolar diffusion, we show that the collapsing protostellar envelope is dominated by dense gravo-magneto-sheetlets, a turbulence-warped version of the classic pseudodisk produced by anisotropic magnetic resistance to the gravitational collapse, in agreement with previous simulations of turbulent, magnetized single-star formation. The sheetlets feed mass, magnetic fields, and angular momentum to a Dense ROtation-Dominated (DROD) structure, which fragments into binary/multiple systems. This DROD fragmentation scenario is a more dynamic variant of the traditional disk fragmentation scenario for binary/multiple formation, with dense spiral filaments created by inhomogeneous feeding from the highly structured larger-scale sheetlets rather than the need for angular momentum transport, which is dominated by magnetic braking. Provided that the local material is sufficiently demagnetized, with a plasma-$\beta$ of 10 or more, collisions between the dense spiraling filaments play a key role in facilitating gravitational collapse and stellar companion formation by pushing the local magnetic Toomre parameter $Q_\mathrm{m}$ below unity. This mechanism can naturally produce {\it in situ} misaligned systems on the 100-au scale, often detected with high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Our simulations also highlight the importance of non-ideal MHD effects, which affect whether fragmentation occurs and, if so, the masses and orbital parameters of the stellar companions formed.</description>

      <title>Probing the origins. II. Unravelling lithium depletion and stellar motion: Intrinsic stellar properties drive depletion, not kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Paper I, we classified a stellar sample from the thin disc with a broad range in metallicity as being churned outward or inward, or blurred/undisturbed. In this paper (Paper II), we delve deeper by analysing our entire metallicity-stratified sample along with their dynamic properties, focusing on the connection between radial migration and Li depletion. We analyse the chemo-dynamics of a set of 1188 thin disc dwarf stars observed by the \textit{Gaia}-ESO survey, previously classified into six metallicity-stratified groups via Hierarchical Clustering (HC). We examine several features, such as effective temperatures, masses, and dynamic properties. We also implement a parametric survival analysis using penalised splines (logistic distribution) to quantify how stellar properties and motion (or migration) direction jointly influence Li depletion patterns. We find that stars in our sample that appear to have churned outward are predominantly Li-depleted, regardless of their metallicities. These stars are also the oldest, coldest, and least massive compared to those in the same HC group that have either churned inward or kept their orbital radii. Our survival analysis confirms temperature as the primary driver of Li depletion, followed by metallicity and age, while migration direction shows negligible influence. The increasing proportion of outward-churned stars with higher metallicity (and older ages) indicates their dominant influence on the overall trend observed in the [Fe/H]-A(Li) space for stellar groups with [Fe/H]&gt;0. The survival model reinforces that the observed Li depletion stems primarily from intrinsic stellar properties (cool temperatures, higher metallicity, old ages) rather than migration history. This suggests the metallicity-dependent depletion pattern emerges through stellar evolution rather than Galactic dynamical processes.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Disks Fed By Dense Collapsing Gravo-Magneto-Sheetlets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16774v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stars form from the gravitational collapse of turbulent, magnetized molecular cloud cores. Our non-ideal MHD simulations reveal that the intrinsically anisotropic magnetic resistance to gravity during the core collapse naturally generates dense gravo-magneto-sheetlets within inner protostellar envelopes -- disrupted versions of classical sheet-like pseudodisks. They are embedded in a magnetically dominant background, where less dense materials flow along the local magnetic field lines and accumulate in the dense sheetlets. The sheetlets, which feed the disk predominantly through its upper and lower surfaces, are the primary channels for mass and angular momentum transfer from the envelope to the disk. The protostellar disk inherits a small fraction (up to 10\%) of the magnetic flux from the envelope, resulting in a disk-averaged net vertical field strength of 1-10 mG and a somewhat stronger toroidal field, potentially detectable through ALMA Zeeman observations. The inherited magnetic field from the envelope plays a dominant role in disk angular momentum evolution, enabling the formation of gravitationally stable disks in cases where the disk field is relatively well-coupled to the gas. Its influence remains significant even in marginally gravitationally unstable disks formed in the more magnetically diffusive cases, removing angular momentum at a rate comparable to or greater than that caused by spiral arms. The magnetically driven disk evolution is consistent with the apparent scarcity of prominent spirals capable of driving rapid accretion in deeply embedded protostellar disks. The dense gravo-magneto-sheetlets observed in our simulations may correspond to the ``accretion streamers" increasingly detected around protostars.</description>

      <title>Plasma refilling of the lunar wake: plasma-vacuum interactions, electrostatic shocks, and electromagnetic instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A plasma void forms downstream of the Moon when the solar wind impacts the lunar surface. This void gradually refills as the solar wind passes by, forming the lunar wake. We investigate this refilling process using a fully kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation. The early stage of refilling follows plasma-vacuum interaction theory, characterized by exponential decay of plasma density into the wake, along with ion acceleration and cooling in the expansion direction. Our PIC simulation confirms these theoretical predictions. In the next stage of the refilling process, the counter-streaming supersonic ion beams collide, generating Debye-scale electrostatic shocks at the wake's center. These shocks decelerate and thermalize the ion beams while heating electrons into flat-top velocity distributions along magnetic field lines. Additionally, fast magnetosonic waves undergo convective growth via anomalous cyclotron resonance as they co-propagate with temperature-anisotropic ion beams toward the wake's center. Electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves may also be excited through normal cyclotron resonance, counter-propagating with these anisotropic ion beams. Our findings provide new insights into the kinetic aspects of lunar wake refilling and may enhance interpretation of spacecraft observations.</description>
