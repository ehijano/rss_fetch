      <title>Magnetic penetration depth in topological superconductors: Effect of Majorana surface states and application for UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we examine how the orbital degrees of freedom of electrons and Majorana surface states influence the magnetic penetration depth in the superconductor UTe$_2$. We use a model involving two orbital electrons and consider superconducting states classified into irreducible representations of the $D_{2h}$ crystal symmetry: $A_{u}$, $B_{1u}$, $B_{2u}$, and $B_{3u}$. We first show that in bulk nodal superconductors, such as the $B_{2u}$ state, the magnetic penetration depth for the screening current along the antinodal direction exhibits a $T^2$ dependence, which significantly deviates from $T^4$ expected from conventional theory. This anomalous exponent is attributed to quasiparticle contributions around the point nodes to the inter-orbital paramagnetic current. We then explore the roles of surface states. The fully gapped $A_{u}$ state hosts Majorana surface states with cone-shaped dispersions, while Majorana Fermi arcs appear in the other pairing states. We demonstrate that when the ratio of magnetic penetration depth to coherence length ($\kappa$) is small, the Majorana cone in the $A_u$ state significantly contributes to the paramagnetic current, leading to the $T^3$ dependence of the penetration depth. In the other states hosting Majorana arcs, the penetration depth exhibits anisotropic power-law behavior, such as $T^2$ ($T^3$) for the screening current flowing along the dispersive (dispersionless) direction of Majorana arcs. Therefore, in low-$\kappa$ type-II superconductors, the signals of Majorana surface states may be detectable through penetration depth measurements. As $\kappa$ increases and approaches the type-II limit, however, the impact of Majorana surface states diminishes, and the temperature dependence is determined by bulk quasiparticle excitations instead of surface states.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of coherent nodal and antinodal dynamics in underdoped Bi-2212</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physics of strongly correlated materials is deeply rooted in electron interactions and their coupling to low-energy excitations. Unraveling the competing and cooperative nature of these interactions is crucial for connecting microscopic mechanisms to the emergence of exotic macroscopic behavior, such as high-temperature superconductivity. Here we show that polarization-resolved multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is able to selectively drive and measure coherent Raman excitations in different parts of the Fermi surface, where the superconducting gap vanishes or is the largest (respectively called Nodal and Antinodal region) in underdoped Bi-2212. Our evidence reveal that in the superconducting phase, the energy of Raman excitations in the nodal region is anti-correlated with the energy of electronic excitations at $\sim$1.6~eV, and both maintain coherence for over 44~fs. In contrast, excitations in the antinodal region show significantly faster decoherence ($&lt;$18~fs) and no measurable correlations. Importantly, this long-lived coherence is specific to the superconducting phase and vanishes in the pseudogap and normal phases. This anti-correlation reveals a coherent link between the transition energy associated with the many body Cu-O bands and the energy of electronic Raman modes that map to the near-nodal superconducting gap. The different coherent dynamics of the nodal and antinodal excitations in the superconducting phase suggest that nodal fluctuations are protected from dissipation associated with scattering from antiferromagnetic fluctuations and may be relevant to sustaining the quantum coherent behaviour associated with high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Signature of chiral superconducting order parameter evidenced in mesoscopic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral superconductivity is a novel superconducting phase characterized by order parameters that break the time-reversal symmetry, endowing the state with a definite handedness. Unlike conventional superconductors, the Cooper pairs in a chiral superconductor carry nonzero orbital angular momentum. Through coupling with an external magnetic field, the finite angular momentum of the Cooper pair modulates the temperature-magnetic field phase boundary in a distinctive way, which could serve as an experimental signature of the chiral superconducting state. Here we demonstrate that the chiral signature can be detected in mesoscopic superconducting rings of $\beta$-Bi$_2$Pd, manifesting as a linear-in-field modulation of the critical temperature in the Little-Parks effect. Our findings establish a new experimental method for detecting the chiral superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Ultrasound response to time-reversal symmetry breaking below the superconducting phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrasound attenuation is a powerful probe of symmetry-breaking phenomena in superconductors. In this work, we develop a framework to model the ultrasound response of multi-component superconductors undergoing a time-reversal symmetry breaking transition below the superconducting phase transition. By coupling the elastic strain of the crystal lattice to the superconducting order parameters through group-theoretical analysis of tetragonal crystals, we classify how different symmetry channels contribute to the ultrasound signal. Using a two-component Ginzburg--Landau theory, we analyze the temperature dependence of sound velocity across both superconducting and time-reversal symmetry breaking transitions for several cases, including $(A_{1g}, A_{1g})$, $(A_{2g}, B_{1g})$, and $E_g$ representations. Our results demonstrate that ultrasound measurements are highly sensitive to the presence of bilinear Josephson couplings and can distinguish between different realizations of the superconducting state. We further show how external strain can significantly alter the ultrasound response in systems breaking time reversal symmetry.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum of vortex-core Majorana zero modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are highly sought-after states with a possible application in quantum computation. Here, we show that vortex-core MZMs can carry a nontrivial angular momentum. This establishes new `flavors' of Majorana modes, independent of the Chern classification of topological superconductors. The MZM angular momentum is explicitly calculated for a microscopic model of a $d+id$ superconductor placed on a three-dimensional topological insulator ($d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model) using both exact diagonalization and the Chebyshev expansion. We classify all possible quantum numbers of MZMs depending on the windings of the order parameter and underlying normal state. The topological protection of the MZM is set by the bulk gap, quasiparticle poisoning by trivial in-gap states, and its localization length. All these severely limit the stability of MZMs in the $d+id+\phantom{}$Dirac model, in contrast to earlier claims. Nevertheless, the possibility of having different flavors of MZM - in the form of angular momentum or something else - can provide a unique path forward for the study of MZMs.</description>

      <title>Re-emergent superconducting state with broken time-reversal symmetry under uniaxial stress</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conditions of the appearance of \$U(1) \times \mathbb{Z}_2\$ superconducting states that spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) on a square lattice as a function of applied stress. We focus on the spin-singlet s+id state. Calculations show that if critical temperatures coincide at zero stress they exhibit linear kink and no kink otherwise. We find that in general, the microscopic calculations show a complex phase diagram, for example, non-monotonic behavior of BTRS transition. Another beyond-Ginzburg-Landau theory result is that \$U(1)\$ critical temperature can decrease under compressional strain for small Poisson ratio materials. In the second part of the paper we consider effects of boundaries and finiteness of the sample on the strain-induced splitting of \$T_c^{U(1)}\$ and \$T_c^{\mathbb{Z}_2}\$ transitions. A finite sample has BTRS boundary states with persistent superconducting currents over a wide range of band filling. Overall, the BTRS dome occupies a larger band filling--temperature phase space region for a mesoscopic sample with [110] surface compared to an infinite system. Hence, the presence of boundaries helps to stabilize the BTRS phase.</description>

      <title>Orbital-Selective Band Structure Evolution in BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$ (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Ru and Mn) Probed by Polarization-Dependent ARPES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the evolution of the band structure in the Fe-based superconductor family BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$ (M = Cr, Co, Cu, Ru and Mn) using polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Low-substituted samples, with comparable spin-density wave transition temperatures ($T_\text{SDW}$), were chosen to facilitate controlled comparisons. The sizes of the central hole pockets ($\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$) remain largely unchanged across different substitutions, showing no clear correlation with either $T_\text{SDW}$ or the As height relative to the Fe planes. However, subtle trends are observed: a modest increase in the size of the $\eta_\text{X}$ electron pocket correlates with the suppression of $T_\text{SDW}$. Furthermore, the contraction of the $\eta_\text{X}$ pocket appears to be linked to an increase in the As height relative to the Fe planes. Our results suggest that the suppression of $T_\text{SDW}$ is primarily driven by changes in the Fe-As bond length, with the effect being more pronounced in electronic states with planar character. These findings provide insight into the electronic structure of BaFe$_{2-x}$M$_x$As$_2$.</description>

      <title>High temperature superconductivity with giant pressure effect in 3D networks of boron doped ultra-thin carbon nanotubes in the pores of ZSM-5 zeolite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19255v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have fabricated three-dimensional (3D) networks of ultrathin carbon nanotubes (CNTs) within the ~5-Angstrom diameter pores of zeolite ZSM-5 crystals using the chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. The 1D electronic characteristics of ultrathin CNTs are characterized by van Hove singularities in the density of states. Boron doping was strategically employed to tune the Fermi energy near a van Hove singularity, which is supported by extensive ab-initio calculations, while the 3D network structure ensures the formation of a phase-coherent bulk superconducting state under a 1D to 3D crossover. We report characteristic signatures of superconductivity using four complementary experimental methods: magnetization, specific heat, resistivity, and point-contact spectroscopy, all consistently support a critical temperature Tc at ambient conditions ranging from 220 to 250 K. In particular, point-contact spectroscopy revealed a multigap nature of superconductivity with a large ~30 meV leading gap, in rough agreement with the prediction of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) theory of superconductivity. The differential conductance response displays a particle-hole symmetry and is tuneable between the tunnelling and Andreev limits via the transparency of the contact, as uniquely expected for a superconductor. Preliminary experiments also reveal a giant pressure effect which increases the Tc above the ambient temperature.</description>

      <title>Impact of Nitrogen and Oxygen Interstitials on Niobium SRF Cavity Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18564v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting radio-frequency (SRF) cavities are the leading technology for highly efficient particle acceleration, and their performance can be significantly enhanced through the controlled introduction of interstitial impurities into bulk niobium. Nitrogen doping has demonstrated a substantial reduction in surface resistance losses, which improves the quality factor of the cavities. More recently, oxygen doping has emerged as a promising alternative, demonstrating comparable reductions in surface resistance. In this study, we combine cavity measurements on \SI{1.3}{GHz} niobium SRF cavities subjected to a range of nitrogen- and oxygen-based treatments with material characterizations performed on cavity cutouts processed under identical conditions. This approach allows us to quantitatively assess the contribution of each impurity to the reduction of surface resistance. We find that nitrogen is ten times more effective than oxygen in reducing surface resistance at \SI{16}{MV/m}. We propose a model to explain this variation, suggesting that nitrogen more effectively traps hydrogen, thus suppressing the formation of niobium hydrides within the RF penetration layer and enabling an improved superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Dynamics of Two-level Systems directly after Cryogenic Alternating Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19223v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-level systems (TLSs) are tunneling states commonly found in amorphous materials that electrically couple to qubits, resonators, and vibrational modes in materials, leading to energy loss in those systems. Recent studies suggest that applying a large alternating electric field changes the oxide structure, potentially improving the performance of qubits and resonators. In this study, we probe the effect of alternating bias at cryogenic temperatures on TLS dynamics within amorphous oxide parallel-plate capacitors operating in the strongly coupled regime. We bias the TLSs in the capacitors using an electric field. This allows us to spectroscopically image TLSs and extract their densities and dipole moments. When an in-situ alternating bias is applied, the steady-state spectra from the standard TLS model disappear. Post-alternating bias TLS spectroscopy reveals transient behavior, in which the TLS frequency fluctuates on the order of minutes. Thermal cycling above 10 K reverses these effects, restoring the TLS spectrum to its original state, indicating a reversible mechanism. Importantly, the intrinsic loss tangent of the LC oscillator remains unchanged before and after the application of the alternating bias. We propose that the disappearance of the steady-state spectrum are caused by non-equilibrium energy build up from strain in the oxide film introduced by the pulsed voltage bias sequence. Understanding this non-equilibrium energy could inform future models of time-dependent TLS dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate flux-flow instability (FFI) in a superconducting single-crystal titanium nitride (TiN) film with negligible volume pinning. By studying the critical current density in 12-nm thick TiN strips of varying widths, we accurately identify the experimental parameters at which the FFI regime occurs. A comprehensive analysis of critical velocity measurements allows us to determine the quasiparticle energy relaxation time, $\tau_E$. By comparing our results with the $\tau_E$ values obtained from other experimental methods, we gain insight into the dominant microscopic process that governs quasiparticle relaxation within the vortex core in TiN. This mechanism is driven by an increase in quasiparticle temperature relative to phonons, rather than by quasiparticles leaving the core. Our findings indicate that $\tau_E$ can be accurately determined through FFI measurements.</description>

      <title>Disorder-induced Diffusion Transport in Flat-band Systems with Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Our previous understanding of transport in disordered system depends on the assumption that there is a well-defined Fermi velocity. The Fermi velocity determines important length scales in the system such as the diffusion length and localization length. However, nearly flat band materials with vanishing Fermi velocity, it is uncertain how to understand the disorder effects and what quantities determine the characteristic length scales in the system. In the clean limit, it is expected that the bulk transport is absent. In this work, we demonstrate, with a 1D Lieb lattice, that disorder can induce diffusion transport in a flat-band system with finite quantum metric. As disorder increases, the bulk transmission channels are activated, and the conductance reaches a maximum before decays inversely with disorder strength. Importantly, via the calculation of the wave-packet dynamics numerically, we show that the quantum metric determines the diffusion length of the system. Analytically, we show that the interplay between the disorder and quantum geometry gives rise to an effective Fermi velocity, as captured by the self-consistent Born approximation. The diffusion coefficient is identified from the Bethe-Salpeter equation under the ladder approximation. Our results reveal a disorder-driven delocalization mechanism in flat-band systems with finite quantum metric which cannot be understood by well-established theories of quantum diffusion. Our theory is important for understanding the disorder effects and transport properties of flat band materials such as twisted bilayer graphene which are current under intense investigation.</description>

      <title>Ex Situ Fabrication of Superconducting Nanostructures for Low-Temperature STM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14092v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nanofabrication of topological insulator (TI) devices is essential for accessing edge and interface states, but conventional lithography and etching compromise the atomically clean surfaces required for scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). We demonstrate a fabrication strategy that combines ex situ lithographic patterning with in situ ultrahigh-vacuum cleaving and flipping, yielding atomically clean, nanopatterned TI-superconductor heterostructures suitable for STM/STS. In Design I, nanoribbons were defined by etching trenches into a TI film and capping with Nb. This enabled spectroscopy on large areas, although edge quality was limited by etch debris. In Design II, local thinning defined buried nanoribbons within a continuous TI film, producing pristine planar surfaces. STM/STS revealed well-developed superconducting gaps in the surrounding film, with suppressed gaps on the nanoribbons, consistent with vertical proximity coupling. This approach establishes a reproducible pathway for high-resolution STM/STS studies of proximitized nanostructures, providing a scalable platform for exploring topological superconductivity.</description>
