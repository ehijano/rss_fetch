      <title>Nanoparticle uptake by a semi-permeable, spherical cell from an external planar diffusive field. I. Mathematical model and asymptotic solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the diffusion of nanoparticles taken up by a semi-permeable spherical cell placed in the path of a diffusive particle field generated by an external planar source. The cell interior and exterior are characterized by different diffusive properties, while the cell is able to accommodate a different saturation level of particles at steady state than is present in the external medium. The situation models the practical problem of biological cells exposed from one direction. The conflict of geometries is handled by the introduction of an effective boundary condition at a virtual spherical boundary. A closed-form, large-time asymptotic solution for the local concentration interior to the cell is developed. We consequently derive an asymptotic approximation for the rate of nanoparticle accumulation in the cell. We contrast the resulting time dependence with that of the corresponding quantity found under strictly spherically symmetric conditions.</description>

      <title>Analysis of non-equilibrium fluctuations in a number of COVID-19 cases and deaths based on time-convolutionless projection-operator method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-equilibrium fluctuations observed in a number of COVID-19 cases and deaths are analyzed from a statistical-dynamical point view. By investigating the data observed around the world which were collected from January 15, 2020 to April 28, 2023 at https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/, we first show that the dynamics of the fluctuations is described by a stochastic equation whose stochastic force is a multiplicative type. By employing the time-convolutionless projection-operator method in open systems previously proposed by the present author, we then transform it into a Langevin-type equation with an additive-type stochastic force together with the corresponding Fokker-Planck type equation. Thus, we explore the stochastic properties of a Langevin-type stochastic force not only analytically but also numerically from a unified point of view. Finally, we emphasize that the dynamical behavior in deaths resembles that in cases very much not only for the causal motion but also for the fluctuation.</description>

      <title>Nanoparticle uptake by a semi-permeable, spherical cell from an external planar diffusive field. II. Numerical study of temporal and spatial development validated using FEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a mathematical study of particle diffusion inside and outside a spherical biological cell that has been exposed on one side to a propagating planar diffusive front. The media inside and outside the spherical cell are differentiated by their respective diffusion constants. A closed form, large-time, asymptotic solution is derived by the combined means of Laplace transform, separation of variables and asymptotic series development. The solution process is assisted by means of an effective far-field boundary condition, which is instrumental in resolving the conflict of planar and spherical geometries. The focus of the paper is on a numerical comparison to determine the accuracy of the asymptotic solution relative to a fully numerical solution obtained using the finite element method. The asymptotic solution is shown to be highly effective in capturing the dynamic behaviour of the system, both internal and external to the cell, under a range of diffusive conditions.</description>

      <title>A story of cooperation: Centrosome-cytoskeleton interactions and implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A structural link between cell's centrosome and cytoskeleton has been proposed years ago. Centrosomes are usually located in the proximity to the nuclei and maintain nucleus-centrosome axis. This positioning aids in determining the polarity of interphase cells and ensure spindle assembly in mitotic cells. Centrosome also maintains physical interaction with different forms of cytoskeleton to trade-off between internal architecture and cell polarity in tissue specific as well as development specific manner. Several crosslinkers are also available to support this interaction and consequently promote cytoskeleton nucleation as well as centrosome nucleation. We present an overview of coordinated action of cytoskeletal elements on centrosomes and vice versa to modulate complex cellular functions, as diverse as cell migration, cell adhesion and cell division.</description>

      <title>Topological transition in cyanobacteria: from motion to structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many active systems are capable of forming intriguing patterns at scales significantly larger than the size of their individual constituents. We recently introduced a model for gliding filamentous cyanobacteria, which form a reticulate pattern as an early-stage biofilm. Our observations reveal that the filaments' bodies follow the track of the head, and are subject to curvature fluctuations, defining a new class of active matter: active spaghetti. By identifying the dominant aspects of the filament's dynamics, our model achieves great computational efficiency, without coarse-graining past the scale of an individual filament. Here, we explore large-scale collective effects and rich dynamics of cyanobacteria colonies, while still retaining information about the individual constituents' dynamics and their interactions. We characterize the system's topological transition from an isotropic distribution to a state of large-scale reticulate patterns by quantifying both dynamical and structural observables. Although it is not a periodic structure, in the steady state the reticulate pattern possesses a well-defined length scale determined by the filaments' Peclet number, which controls the relative importance of activity and curvature fluctuations.</description>

      <title>System- and Sample-agnostic Isotropic 3D Microscopy by Weakly Physics-informed, Domain-shift-resistant Axial Deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) subcellular imaging is essential for biomedical research, but the diffraction limit of optical microscopy compromises axial resolution, hindering accurate 3D structural analysis. This challenge is particularly pronounced in label-free imaging of thick, heterogeneous tissues, where assumptions about data distribution (e.g. sparsity, label-specific distribution, and lateral-axial similarity) and system priors (e.g. independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) noise and linear shift-invariant (LSI) point-spread functions (PSFs)) are often invalid. Here, we introduce SSAI-3D, a weakly physics-informed, domain-shift-resistant framework for robust isotropic 3D imaging. SSAI-3D enables robust axial deblurring by generating a PSF-flexible, noise-resilient, sample-informed training dataset and sparsely fine-tuning a large pre-trained blind deblurring network. SSAI-3D was applied to label-free nonlinear imaging of living organoids, freshly excised human endometrium tissue, and mouse whisker pads, and further validated in publicly available ground-truth-paired experimental datasets of 3D heterogeneous biological tissues with unknown blurring and noise across different microscopy systems.</description>

      <title>A biosensor based on magnetoelastic waves for detection of antibodies in human plasma for COVID-19 serodiagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study proposes a new efficient wireless biosensor based on magnetoelastic waves for the detection of antibodies in human plasma, aiming at the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. The biosensor was functionalized with the N antigen - nucleocapsid phosphoprotein of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Validation analyses, by sodium dodecyl-sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blotting, atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), micro-Raman spectroscopy, confirmed the selectivity and effective surface functionalization of the biosensor. The research successfully obtained, expressed and purified the recombinant antigen, while plasma samples from COVID-19 positive and negative patients were used to test the performance of the biosensor. A comparison of performance with the ELISA method revealed equivalent diagnostic power. These results indicate the robustness of the biosensor in reliably differentiating between positive and negative samples, highlighting its potential as an efficient and low-cost tool for the serological diagnosis of COVID-19. In addition to being fast to execute and having the potential for automation in large-scale diagnostic studies, the biosensor fills a significant gap in existing SARS-CoV-2 detection approaches.</description>

      <title>An Information Bottleneck Approach for Markov Model Construction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Markov state models (MSMs) are valuable for studying dynamics of protein conformational changes via statistical analysis of molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. In MSMs, the complex configuration space is coarse-grained into conformational states, with the dynamics modeled by a series of Markovian transitions among these states at discrete lag times. Constructing the Markovian model at a specific lag time requires state defined without significant internal energy barriers, enabling internal dynamics relaxation within the lag time. This process coarse grains time and space, integrating out rapid motions within metastable states. This work introduces a continuous embedding approach for molecular conformations using the state predictive information bottleneck (SPIB), which unifies dimensionality reduction and state space partitioning via a continuous, machine learned basis set. Without explicit optimization of VAMP-based scores, SPIB demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in identifying slow dynamical processes and constructing predictive multi-resolution Markovian models. When applied to mini-proteins trajectories, SPIB showcases unique advantages compared to competing methods. It automatically adjusts the number of metastable states based on a specified minimal time resolution, eliminating the need for manual tuning. While maintaining efficacy in dynamical properties, SPIB excels in accurately distinguishing metastable states and capturing numerous well-populated macrostates. Furthermore, SPIB's ability to learn a low-dimensional continuous embedding of the underlying MSMs enhances the interpretation of dynamic pathways. Accordingly, we propose SPIB as an easy-to-implement methodology for end-to-end MSM construction.</description>

      <title>Curvature-driven transport of thin Bingham fluid layers in airway bifurcations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.11084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.11084v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mucus on the bronchial wall forms a thin layer of non-Newtonian fluid. One of the roles of mucus is to protect the lungs by capturing inhaled pollutants. It is transported by mucocilliary clearance toward the tracheo-pharyngeal bifurcation, where it is eliminated. Due to the corrugation of its interface with air, the mucus layer is subject to surface tension forces that interact with its rheology. It is still not clear whether these forces can affect mucus displacement and, if they can, under what conditions and how this displacement can occur. In this work, we model the mucus as a thin Bingham fluid layer located on the wall of idealized, multi-scaled airway bifurcations. We analyze the resulting physical system using lubrication theory and 3D simulations. The theoretical analysis allows us to characterize the nonlinear behavior of the system and determine the geometric conditions under which the Bingham fluid can be moved by surface tension. 3D simulations are then used to quantify the effects in idealized airway bifurcations on a range of scales corresponding to those of bronchial bifurcations. Our results suggest that surface tension effects can displace overly thick mucus layers in airway bifurcations, a typical situation in obstructive lung pathologies (asthma, BPCO, cystic fobrosis, etc.). Moreover, our results indicate that this movement can disrupt mucociliary clearance and the homogeneity of the layer thickness, thus increasing the risk of lung infection.</description>

      <title>Diamond-lattice photonic crystals assembled from DNA origami</title>

Abstract: Colloidal self-assembly allows rational design of structures on the micrometer and submicrometer scale. One architecture that can generate complete 3D photonic band gaps is the diamond cubic lattice, which has remained difficult to realize at length scales comparable to the wavelength of visible or ultraviolet light. Here, we demonstrate three-dimensional photonic crystals self-assembled from DNA origami that act as precisely programmable patchy colloids. Our DNA-based nanoscale tetrapods crystallize into a rod-connected diamond cubic lattice with a periodicity of 170 nm. This structure serves as a scaffold for atomic layer deposition of high refractive index materials such as TiO$_2$, yielding a tunable photonic band gap in the near-ultraviolet.</description>

      <title>Pattern selection and the route to turbulence in incompressible polar active fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10305v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active fluids, such as suspensions of microswimmers, are known to self-organize into complex spatio-temporal flow patterns. An intriguing example is mesoscale turbulence, a state of dynamic vortex structures exhibiting a characteristic length scale. Here, we employ a minimal model for the effective microswimmer velocity field to explore how the turbulent state develops from regular vortex patterns when the strength of activity resp. related parameters such as nonlinear advection or polar alignment strength - is increased. First, we demonstrate analytically that the system, without any spatial constraints, develops a stationary square vortex lattice in the absence of nonlinear advection. Subsequently, we perform an extended stability analysis of this nonuniform "ground state" and uncover a linear instability, which follows from the mutual excitement and simultaneous growth of multiple perturbative modes. This extended analysis is based on linearization around an approximation of the analytical vortex lattice solution and allows us to calculate critical activity parameters. Above these critical values, the vortex lattice develops into mesoscale turbulence in numerical simulations. Utilizing the numerical approach, we uncover an extended region of hysteresis where both patterns are possible depending on the initial condition. Here, we find that turbulence persists below the instability of the vortex lattice. We further determine the stability of square vortex patterns as a function of their wavenumber and represent the results analogous to the well-known Busse balloons known from classical pattern-forming systems. Here, the region of stable periodic patterns shrinks and eventually disappears with increasing activity parameters. Our results show that the strength of activity plays a similar role for active turbulence as the Reynolds number does in driven flow exhibiting inertial turbulence.</description>

      <title>Metasurfaces for infrared multi-modal microscopy: phase contrast and bright field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Different imaging modalities are used to extract the diverse information carried in an optical field. Two prominent modalities include bright field and phase contrast microscopy that can visualize the amplitude and phase features of a sample, respectively. However, capturing both of these images on the same camera typically requires interchanging optical components. Metasurfaces are ultra-thin nanostructures that can merge both of these operations into a single miniaturized device. Here, a silicon-based metasurface that supports a Mie resonance is demonstrated to perform near-infrared phase contrast and bright field multi-modal microscopy that can be tuned by changing the polarization of the illumination. We performed experiments using optical fields with phase variations synthesized by a spatial light modulator and introduced by propagation through semi-transparent samples, including C. elegans, unstained human prostate cancer cells and breast tissue. The results demonstrate the potential of metasurfaces for label-free point-of-care testing.</description>
