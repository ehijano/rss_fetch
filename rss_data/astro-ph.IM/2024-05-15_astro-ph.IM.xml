      <title>The Scientific Impact of a Noiseless Energy-Resolving Detector for a Future Exoplanet-Imaging Mission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future space missions that aim to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets will require an instrument that efficiently measures spectra of these planets, placing strict requirements on detector performance. The upcoming Roman Space Telescope will demonstrate the performance of an electron-multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD) as part of the coronagraphic instrument (CGI). The recent LUVOIR and HabEx studies baselined pairing such a detector with an integral field spectrograph (IFS) to take spectra of multiple exoplanets and debris disks simultaneously. We investigate the scientific impact of a noiseless energy-resolving detector for the planned Habitable Worlds Observatory's (HWO) coronagraphic instrument. By assuming higher quantum efficiency, higher optical throughput, and zero noise, we effectively place upper limits on the impact of advancing detector technologies. We find that energy-resolving detectors would potentially take spectra of hundreds of additional exoplanets "for free" over the course of an HWO survey, greatly increasing its scientific yield.</description>

      <title>Learned radio interferometric imaging for varying visibility coverage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the next generation of interferometric telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), the need for highly computationally efficient reconstruction techniques is particularly acute. The challenge in designing learned, data-driven reconstruction techniques for radio interferometry is that they need to be agnostic to the varying visibility coverages of the telescope, since these are different for each observation. Because of this, learned post-processing or learned unrolled iterative reconstruction methods must typically be retrained for each specific observation, amounting to a large computational overhead. In this work we develop learned post-processing and unrolled iterative methods for varying visibility coverages, proposing training strategies to make these methods agnostic to variations in visibility coverage with minimal to no fine-tuning. Learned post-processing techniques are heavily dependent on the prior information encoded in training data and generalise poorly to other visibility coverages. In contrast, unrolled iterative methods, which include the telescope measurement operator inside the network, achieve state-of-the-art reconstruction quality and computation time, generalising well to other coverages and require little to no fine-tuning. Furthermore, they generalise well to realistic radio observations and are able to reconstruct the high dynamic range of these images.</description>

      <title>SOLSAT: An FPGA Based satellite for effective Solar-activity monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kp-Index is a very important factor for determining how the Sun's magnetic field is affecting the Earth's magnetic field and help us prepare for the worst (like solar or geomagnetic storms). Currently there are around thirteen observation centers to determine the worldwide Kp index. Huge data is generated from all the observation centers which is then used to determine several factors, but the observatories are concentrated in places like North America and Europe only. To eliminate the data dependency from a very limited geographical periphery we can use a constellation of satellites in LEO which can log in data continuously and provide a real time and accurate Kp index which can help humanity for tackling with the impending issues from our nearest star in a better way. The constellation of the satellites will be deployed in the Low Earth Orbit(LEO) and continuously log the geomagnetic data and provide a constant stream of data, which will be more diverse given the area coverage made by one satellite. This is essentially a boon as more the data we can have better geomagnetic data and the Kp index will be all encompassing which can help in better mapping of any solar-catastrophe.</description>

      <title>Rapid parameter estimation for pulsar-timing-array datasets with variational inference and normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the gravitational-wave analysis of pulsar-timing-array datasets, parameter estimation is usually performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to explore posterior probability densities. We introduce an alternative procedure that relies instead on stochastic gradient-descent Bayesian variational inference, whereby we obtain the weights of a neural-network approximation of the posterior by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence of the approximation from the exact posterior. This technique is distinct from simulation-based inference with normalizing flows, since we train the network for a single dataset, rather than the population of all possible datasets, and we require the computation of the data likelihood and its gradient. Unlike Markov Chain methods, our technique can transparently exploit highly parallel computing platforms. This makes it extremely fast on modern graphical processing units, where it can analyze the NANOGrav 15-yr dataset in few tens of minutes, depending on the probabilistic model, as opposed to hours or days with the analysis codes used until now. We expect that this speed will unlock new kinds of astrophysical and cosmological studies of pulsar-timing-array datasets. Furthermore, variational inference would be viable in other contexts of gravitational-wave data analysis as long as differentiable and parallelizable likelihoods are available.</description>

      <title>Into the red: an M-band study of the chemistry and rotation of $\beta$ Pictoris b at high spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy (HRCCS) combined with adaptive optics has been enormously successful in advancing our knowledge of exoplanet atmospheres, from chemistry to rotation and atmospheric dynamics. This powerful technique now drives major science cases for ELT instrumentation including METIS/ELT, GMTNIRS/GMT and MICHI/TMT, targeting biosignatures on rocky planets at 3-5 $\mu$m, but remains untested beyond 3.5 $\mu$m where the sky thermal background begins to provide the dominant contribution to the noise. We present 3.51-5.21 $\mu$m M-band CRIRES+/VLT observations of the archetypal young directly imaged gas giant $\beta$ Pictoris b, detecting CO absorption at S/N = 6.6 at 4.73 $\mu$m and H$_2$O at S/N = 5.7, and thus extending the use of HRCCS into the thermal background noise dominated infrared. Using this novel spectral range to search for more diverse chemistry we report marginal evidence of SiO at S/N = 4.3, potentially indicative that previously proposed magnesium-silicate clouds in the atmosphere are either patchy, transparent at M-band wavelengths, or possibly absent on the planetary hemisphere observed. The molecular detections are rotationally broadened by the spin of $\beta$ Pic b, and we infer a planetary rotation velocity of $v$sin(i) = 22$\pm$2 km s$^{-1}$ from the cross-correlation with the H$_2$O model template, consistent with previous K-band studies. We discuss the observational challenges posed by the thermal background and telluric contamination in the M-band, the custom analysis procedures required to mitigate these issues, and the opportunities to exploit this new infrared window for HRCCS using existing and next-generation instrumentation.</description>

      <title>RIGEL: Simulating dwarf galaxies at solar mass resolution with radiative transfer and feedback from individual massive stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the RIGEL model, a novel framework to self-consistently model the effects of stellar feedback in the multiphase ISM of dwarf galaxies with radiative transfer (RT) on a star-by-star basis. The RIGEL model integrates detailed implementations of feedback from individual massive stars into the RHD code, AREPO-RT. It forms individual massive stars from the resolved multiphase ISM by sampling the IMF and tracks their evolution individually. The lifetimes, photon production rates, mass-loss rates, and wind velocities of these stars are determined by their initial masses and metallicities based on a library that incorporates a variety of stellar models. The RT equations are solved in seven spectral bins accounting for the IR to HeII ionizing bands, using an M1 RT scheme. The thermochemistry model tracks the non-equilibrium H, He chemistry and the equilibrium abundance of CI, CII, OI, OII, and CO to capture the thermodynamics of all ISM phases. We evaluate the performance of the RIGEL model using $1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ resolution simulations of isolated dwarf galaxies. We found that the SFR and ISRF show strong positive correlations to the metallicity of the galaxy. Photoionization and photoheating can reduce the SFR by an order of magnitude by removing the available cold-dense gas fuel for star formation. The ISRF also changes the thermal structure of the ISM. Radiative feedback occurs immediately after the birth of massive stars and rapidly disperses the molecular clouds within 1 Myr. As a consequence, radiative feedback reduces the age spread of star clusters to less than 2 Myr, prohibits the formation of massive star clusters, and shapes the cluster initial mass function to a steep power-law form with a slope of $\sim-2$. The mass-loading factor of the fiducial galaxy has a median of $\sim50$, while turning off radiative feedback reduces this factor by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>An ultra wide-band, high-sensitivity Q-band receiver for single-dish telescopes, eQ: rest frequency determination of CCS ($J_N$ = $4_3$-$3_2$) and SO ($J_N$ = $1_0$-$0_1$), and high-redshift CO ($J$ = 1-0) detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the development and commissioning of a new Q-band receiver for the Nobeyama 45-m telescope, covering 30--50 GHz with a receiver noise temperature of about 15 K. We name it eQ (extended Q-band) receiver. The system noise temperatures for observations are measured to be $\sim$ 30 K at 33 GHz and $\sim$ 75 K at 45 GHz. The Half-Power-Beam-Width (HPBW) is around 38\arcsec at 43 GHz. To enhance the observation capability, we tested the smoothed bandpass calibration technique and demonstrated the observation time can be significantly reduced compared to the standard position switch technique. The wide-bandwidth capability of this receiver provides precise determination of rest frequencies for molecular transitions with an accuracy of a few kHz through simultaneous observations of multiple transitions. Particularly, we determined the rest frequency of SO ($J_N$ = $1_0$--$0_1$) to be 30.001542 GHz, along with the rest frequency of CCS ($J_N$ = $4_3$--$3_2$) being 45.379033 GHz, adopting CCS ($J_N$ = $3_2$--$2_1$) at 33.751370 GHz as a reference line. The SO profile shows a double peak shape at the Cyanopolyyne Peak (CP) position of the Taurus Molecular Cloud-1 (TMC-1). The SO peaks coincide well with the CCS sub-components located near the outer parts of the TMC-1 filament. We interpret that the gravitational infall of TMC-1 generates shocks which enhance the SO abundance. The TMC-1 map shows that carbon-chain molecules are more abundant in the southern part of the filament, whereas SO is more abundant in the northern part. The eQ's excellent sensitivity allowed us to detect faint CO ($J$ = 1--0) spectra from the high-redshift object at a redshift of 2.442. Our receiver is expected to open new avenues for high-sensitivity molecular line observations in the Q-band.</description>

      <title>SRG/ART-XC all-sky X-ray survey: Catalog of sources detected during the first five surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an updated catalog of sources detected by the Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC telescope aboard the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory during its all-sky survey. It is based on the data of the first four and the partially completed fifth scans of the sky (ARTSS1-5). The catalog comprises 1545 sources detected in the 4-12 keV energy band. The achieved sensitivity ranges between $\sim 4\times 10^{-12}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ near the ecliptic plane and $\sim 7\times 10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ near the ecliptic poles, which is a $\sim$30-50% improvement over the previous version of the catalog based on the first two all-sky scans (ARTSS12). There are $\sim 130$ objects, excluding the expected contribution of spurious detections, that were not known as X-ray sources before the SRG/ART-XC all-sky survey. We provide information, partly based on our ongoing follow-up optical spectroscopy program, on the identification and classification of the majority of the ARTSS1-5 sources (1463), of which 173 are tentative at the moment. The majority of the classified objects (964) are extragalactic, a small fraction (30) are located in the Local Group of galaxies, and 469 are Galactic. The dominant classes of objects in the catalog are active galactic nuclei (911) and cataclysmic variables (192).</description>

      <title>NeuralCMS: A deep learning approach to study Jupiter's interior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: NASA's Juno mission provided exquisite measurements of Jupiter's gravity field that together with the Galileo entry probe atmospheric measurements constrains the interior structure of the giant planet. Inferring its interior structure range remains a challenging inverse problem requiring a computationally intensive search of combinations of various planetary properties, such as the cloud-level temperature, composition, and core features, requiring the computation of ~10^9 interior models. We propose an efficient deep neural network (DNN) model to generate high-precision wide-ranged interior models based on the very accurate but computationally demanding concentric MacLaurin spheroid (CMS) method. We trained a sharing-based DNN with a large set of CMS results for a four-layer interior model of Jupiter, including a dilute core, to accurately predict the gravity moments and mass, given a combination of interior features. We evaluated the performance of the trained DNN (NeuralCMS) to inspect its predictive limitations. NeuralCMS shows very good performance in predicting the gravity moments, with errors comparable with the uncertainty due to differential rotation, and a very accurate mass prediction. This allowed us to perform a broad parameter space search by computing only ~10^4 actual CMS interior models, resulting in a large sample of plausible interior structures, and reducing the computation time by a factor of 10^5. Moreover, we used a DNN explainability algorithm to analyze the impact of the parameters setting the interior model on the predicted observables, providing information on their nonlinear relation.</description>

      <title>Robust inference of gravitational wave source parameters in the presence of noise transients using normalizing flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) detection is of paramount importance in fundamental physics and GW astronomy, yet it presents formidable challenges. One significant challenge is the removal of noise transient artifacts known as ``glitches," which greatly impact the search and identification of GWs. Recent research has achieved remarkable results in data denoising, often using effective modeling methods to remove glitches. However, for glitches from uncertain or unknown sources, current methods cannot completely eliminate them from the GW signal. In this work, we leverage the inherent robustness of machine learning to obtain reliable posterior parameter distributions directly from GW data contaminated by glitches. Our network model provides reasonable and rapid parameter inference even in the presence of glitches, without needing to remove them. We also investigate various factors affecting the rationality of parameter inference in our normalizing flow network, including glitch and GW parameters. The results demonstrate that the normalizing flow can reasonably infer the source parameters of GWs even with unknown contamination. We find that the nature of the glitch itself is the only factor that can affect the rationality of the inferred results. With improvements to our model, we anticipate accelerating the localization of electromagnetic counterparts and providing priors for more accurate deglitching, thereby speeding up subsequent data processing procedures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modeling the brightness of satellites in large Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations can not only assist the astronomical community in assessing the impact of reflected light from satellites, optimizing observing schedules and guiding data processing, but also motivate satellite operators to improve their satellite designs, thus facilitating cooperation and consensus among different stakeholders. This work presents a photometric model of the Starlink satellites based on the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) using millions of photometric observations. To enhance model accuracy and computational efficiency, data filtering and reduction are employed, and chassis blocking on the solar array and the earthshine effect are taken into account. The assumptions of the model are also validated by showing that the satellite attitude is as expected, the solar array is nearly perpendicular to the chassis, and both the solar array pseudo-specular reflection and the chassis earthshine should be included in the model. Reflectance characteristics of the satellites and the apparent magnitude distributions over station are finally discussed based on the photometric predictions from the model. In addition to assessing the light pollution and guiding the development of response measures, accurate photometric models of satellites can also play an important role in areas such as space situational awareness.</description>

Abstract: We report measurements characterizing the performance of a kinetic inductance detector array designed for a wavelength of 25 microns and very low optical background level suitable for applications such as a far-infrared instrument on a cryogenically cooled space telescope. In a pulse counting mode of operation at low optical flux, the detectors can resolve individual 25-micron photons. In an integrating mode, the detectors remain photon noise limited over more than six orders of magnitude in absorbed power from 70 zW to 200 fW, with a limiting NEP of 4.6 x 10^-20 W/rtHz at 1 Hz. In addition, the detectors are highly stable with flat power spectra under optical load down to 1 mHz. Operational parameters of the detector are determined including the efficiency of conversion of the incident optical power into quasiparticles in the aluminum absorbing element and the quasiparticle self-recombination constant.</description>

      <title>Extracting the gamma-ray source-count distribution below the Fermi-LAT detection limit with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01947v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reconstruct the extra-galactic gamma-ray source-count distribution, or $dN/dS$, of resolved and unresolved sources by adopting machine learning techniques. Specifically, we train a convolutional neural network on synthetic 2-dimensional sky-maps, which are built by varying parameters of underlying source-counts models and incorporate the Fermi-LAT instrumental response functions. The trained neural network is then applied to the Fermi-LAT data, from which we estimate the source count distribution down to flux levels a factor of 50 below the Fermi-LAT threshold. We perform our analysis using 14 years of data collected in the $(1,10)$ GeV energy range. The results we obtain show a source count distribution which, in the resolved regime, is in excellent agreement with the one derived from catalogued sources, and then extends as $dN/dS \sim S^{-2}$ in the unresolved regime, down to fluxes of $5 \cdot 10^{-12}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. The neural network architecture and the devised methodology have the flexibility to enable future analyses to study the energy dependence of the source-count distribution.</description>

Abstract: In a previous paper using Gaia DR2 data, we demonstrated that the two closely situated open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 might have formed together about 50 Myr ago. In this work, we performed star-by-star dynamical modelling of the evolution of the open clusters Collinder 135 and UBC 7 from their supposed initial state to their present-day state, reproducing observational distributions of members. Modelling of the Collinder 135 and UBC 7 dynamical evolution was done using the high-order parallel N-body code \phi-GPU with up-to-date stellar evolution. Membership and characteristics of the clusters were acquired based on Gaia DR3 data. The comparison of the present-day radial cumulative star count obtained from the N-body simulations with the current observational data gave us full consistency of the model with observational data, especially in the central 8 pc, where 80% of the stars reside. The proper motion velocity components obtained from the N-body simulations of the stars are also quite consistent with the observed distributions and error bars. These results show that our numerical modelling is able to reproduce the open clusters' current complex 6D observed phase-space distributions with a high level of confidence. Thus, the model demonstrates that the hypothesis of a common origin of Collinder 135 and UBC 7 complies with present-day observational data.</description>
