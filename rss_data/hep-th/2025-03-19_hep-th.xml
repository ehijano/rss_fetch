      <title>Microstates of Non-extremal Black Holes: A New Hope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new roadmap for constructing microstates of non-extremal black holes in supergravity. First, we review the non-linear sigma model of five-dimensional supergravity governing stationary solutions with a U(1) isometry and present the first generalized Ernst formulation of this model. We then revisit solution-generating techniques associated to the coset model symmetry, Ernst formalism and inverse scattering method. While some of these techniques have been extensively used to generate non-extremal black holes and black rings in supergravity, we demonstrate how they can be adapted to construct systematically non-BPS smooth horizonless geometries that have the same mass and charges as non-extremal black holes. To illustrate these methods, we construct novel static solutions of this type, including a non-BPS generalization of the $\frac{1}{2}$-BPS Gibbons-Hawking center, which has served as the fundamental building block of multicenter microstates of BPS black holes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Scattering via the Born Series: Scalar Tidal Matching to $\mathcal{O}(G^7)$ and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel method to compute gravitational wave amplitudes within the framework of effective field theory. By reinterpreting the Feynman diagram expansion as a Born series, our method offers several key advantages. It directly yields partial wave amplitudes, streamlining the matching with black hole perturbation theory. Long-distance gravitational interactions are unambiguously factorized from short-distance tidal effects, including dissipation, which are systematically incorporated via an in-in worldline effective action. Crucially, at every order in perturbation theory, integrals are expressed in terms of harmonic polylogarithms, enabling an end-to-end computation scalable to arbitrary orders. We illustrate the method with new predictions for scalar black hole Love numbers and their Renormalization Group equations to $\mathcal{O}(G^7)$.</description>

      <title>Wavefunction coefficients from Amplitubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph its set of connected subgraphs (tubes) can be defined in two ways: either by considering subsets of edges, or by considering subsets of vertices. We refer to these as binary tubes and unary tubes respectively. Both notions come with a natural compatibility condition between tubes which differ by a simple adjacency constraint. Compatible sets of tubes are refered to as tubings. By considering the set of binary tubes, and summing over all maximal binary-tubings, one is lead to an expression for the flat space wavefunction coefficients relevant for computing cosmological correlators. On the other hand, considering the set of unary tubes, and summing over all maximal unary-tubings, one is lead to expressions recently referred to as amplitubes which resemble the scattering amplitudes of $\text{tr}(\phi^3)$ theory. In this paper we study the two definitions of tubing in order to provide a new formula for the flat space wavefunction coefficient for a single graph as a sum over products of amplitubes. We also show how the expressions for the amplitubes can naturally be understood as a sum over orientations of the underlying graph. Motivated by our rewriting of the wavefunction coefficient we introduce a new definition of tubing which makes use of both the binary and unary tubes which we refer to as cut tubings. We explain how each cut tubing induces a decorated orientation of the underlying graph and demonstrate how the set of all decorated orientations for a given graph count the number of basis functions appearing in the kinematic flow.</description>

      <title>Braidings on topological operators, anomaly of higher-form symmetries and the SymTFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomaly of non-invertible higher-form symmetries is determined by the braiding of topological operators implementing them. In this paper, we study a method to classify braidings on topological line and surface operators by leveraging the fact that topological operators which admit a braiding are symmetries of their associated SymTFT. This perspective allows us to formulate an algorithm to explicitly compute all possible braidings on a given fusion category, bypassing the need to solve the hexagon equations. Additionally, using 3+1d SymTFTs, we determine braidings on various fusion 2-categories. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for the fusion 2-categories $\Sigma \mathcal{C}$, 2Vec$_G^{\pi}$ and Tambara-Yamagami (TY) 2-categories TY$(A,\pi)$ to admit a braiding.</description>

      <title>On the Explicit Asymptotic Symmetry Breaking of sl(3,R) Jackiw-Teitelboim Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the asymptotic symmetry algebras (ASA) of Jackiw-Teitelboim (JT) gravity within the framework of sl(3,R) symmetry. By explicitly constructing this algebra,
  we explore how the presence of the dilaton field influences the structure of asymptotic symmetries and symmetry breaking mechanisms at the AdS(2) boundary. For the sl(3,R) model, the
  dilaton field preserves a subset of the complete W(3)-symmetry, restricting the algebra to sl(3,R). These results provide deeper insights into the role of dilaton dynamics
  in holographic dualities, with implications for the thermodynamics and geometry of AdS(2). The findings pave the way for systematically exploring extended gauge symmetries in
  two-dimensional gravity and their relevance to higher-rank Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Attractors in Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of attractors, well-known in classical mechanics, proved to be very productive in supergravity, in the theory of black holes and inflationary cosmology. We start with attractors in supersymmetric black holes and discuss also non-BPS black hole attractors. Recently the non-BPS case helped to explain, via enhanced dualitiy symmetry, mysterious cancellation of ultraviolet divergences in 82 Feynman diagrams in 4-loop superamplitude in $N=5$ supergravity. We discuss the implications of these results for the possibility of the all-loop finiteness of $N &gt; 4$ 4D supergravities.
  We continue with the description of inflationary $\alpha$-attractors. This large class of inflationary models gives predictions that are stable with respect to even very significant modifications of inflationary potentials. These predictions match all presently available CMB-related cosmological data. These models provide targets for the future satellite mission LiteBIRD, which will attempt to detect primordial gravitational waves. We describe some of the recent advanced versions of cosmological attractors which have a beautiful fractal landscape structure.

      <title>Topological Holography for 2+1-D Gapped and Gapless Phases with Generalized Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study topological holography for 2+1-D gapped and gapless phases with generalized symmetries using tools from higher linear algebra and higher condensation theory. We focus on bosonic fusion 2-category symmetries, where the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) are 3+1D Dijkgraaf-Witten theories.
  (1). Gapped phases are obtained from the sandwich construction with gapped symmetry and physical boundaries. A gapped boundary of the 3+1D SymTFT is called minimal if it has no intrinsic 2+1-D topological order. We derive the general structure of a sandwich construction with minimal gapped symmetry and physical boundaries, including the underlying topological order and the symmetry action. We also study some concrete examples with 2-group or non-invertible symmetries.
  (2). For gapless phases, we show that the SymTFT provides a complete description of the \textit{topological skeleton} of a gapless phase. The topological skeleton of a gapless phase is the higher categorical structure of its topological defects. We rigorously establish this relation for 2+1-D gapless phases with finite group symmetries. For a gapless phase with a finite group symmetry, its topological skeleton(also known as gapless SPT(gSPT)) can be characterized by the decorated domain wall construction. We give a precise formulation of this using spectral sequence. We show that certain class of condensable algebras in the SymTFT $\mathcal{Z}_1[2\mathbf{Vec}_G]$, which we call minimal condensable algebras, has exactly the same structure. We further give a cohomological classification of minimal condensable algebras, which enables us to compute the classification of 2+1-D $G$-gSPTs via ordinary group cohomology. Finally we use SymTFT to construct 2+1-D gSPT with generalized symmetries, including an intrinsically gSPT(igSPT) with exact non-invertible fusion 2-category symmetry and anomalous 2-group IR symmetry.</description>

      <title>Path integral games with de Sitter {\alpha}-vacua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\alpha$-vacua are a 1-parameter family of quantum field vacua in de Sitter space which are invariant under the $SO(1,d)$ isometry group. In this work we study the $\alpha$-vacua using the path integral. These states can be prepared by acting on the Bunch-Davies vacuum with a certain charge operator. While most conserved charges live on a single codimension-1 manifold, this particular charge lives on a pair of two codimension-1 manifolds which are antipodal mirrors of each other. The rules for the manipulation of this charge as an insertion in the path integral are explained.
  We also discuss the special $\alpha$-vacua known as the ``in'' and ``out'' vacua. It is well known that the ``in'' and ``out'' vacua are equal in odd dimensions, but we also show that they are equal in even dimensions when $\sqrt{(d-1)^2/4 - m^2}$ is a half-integer.
  In addition, we study the wavefunctionals of the $\alpha$-vacua at $\mathcal{I}^+$, and argue that the $\alpha$-vacua cannot be constructed in interacting quantum field theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the search for embedded on-shell supermultiplets in higher dimensional off-shell theories, we investigate several 16-color supermultiplets and their topology. An Adinkra's topology is known to be equivalent to $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$-quotients of an N-cube. This is revisited with the focus of closing the off-shell problem for the 4D $\mathcal{N} = 4$ Maxwell supermultiplet.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical Rotating AdS Black Holes with Quantum Hair in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the AdS/CFT duality, we study semiclassical stationary rotating AdS black holes with non-trivial quantum hair in three and five dimensions. We construct these solutions by perturbing the BTZ black hole and the five-dimensional Myers-Perry AdS black hole according to holographic semiclassical equations. In the three-dimensional case, the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor diverges as $\sim 1/\lambda^n~(n=1,2)$ along a radial null geodesic as the affine parameter $\lambda$ approaches zero at the Cauchy horizon, depending on the type of perturbation. In the five-dimensional case, most hairy solutions exhibit strong divergences, either in the stress-energy tensor or in the parallelly propagated Riemann components, along the radial null geodesic crossing the Cauchy horizon. Nevertheless, there exists a specific class of semiclassical solutions that retain a $C^0$-regular Cauchy horizon, where perturbations remain bounded. For extremal black holes, the vacuum expectation value of the stress-energy tensor diverges along a radial null geodesic transverse to the event horizon in both three and five dimensions, even though all components of the perturbed metric vanish in this limit.</description>

      <title>On BRST Lagrangian formulation for massive higher-spin fields in $4D$ Minkowski space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief overview of the BRST approach to the gauge invariant Lagrangian formulation for free massive higher-spin bosonic fields focusing on two specific aspects. First, the theory is considered in four dimensional flat space in terms of spin-tensor fields with two component undotted and dotted indices. This leads to a significant simplification of the whole approach in comparison with the one where the fields with vector indices were used, since now there is no need to introduce a constraint responsible for the traces of the fields into the BRST charge. Second, we develop an extremely simple and clear procedure to eliminate all the auxiliary fields and prove that the BRST equations of motion identically reproduce the basic conditions for irreducible representations of the Poinc\'are group with a given mass and spin. Similar to the massless theory, the final Lagrangian for massive higher-spin fields is formulated in triplet form. The BRST formulation leads to a system of fields that are clearly subdivided into the basic spin $s$ field, Zinoviev-like auxiliary fields, Singh-Hagen-like auxiliary fields, and special BRST auxiliary fields. The auxiliary fields can be partially eliminated by gauge fixing and/or using the equations of motion. This allows one to obtain formally different (with different numbers of auxiliary fields) but equivalent Lagrangian formulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an amplitude-generating formula in renormalizable quantum field theory. It reflects the self-similarity of loop amplitudes, in which an amplitude can also be a subamplitude of another. Amplitudes are generated by a small number of "irreducible" ones, which may replace tree-level couplings to form more complex amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a relativistic version of the global symmetries responsible for the restricted mobility of fracton quasiparticles. The theories have a symmetry current that is proportional to a vector field that spontaneously breaks Lorentz boost symmetry. We argue that the existence of a pressureless dust in the early universe could be a consequence of this symmetry. We provide an example of a fractonic scalar field with a quartic self-interaction evolving on a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background and show that the interaction gives rise to a separately conserved fluid with equation of state $w=1$.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature bubble nucleation with shifting scale hierarchies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Focusing on supercooled phase transitions in models with classical scale symmetry, we formulate a state-of-the art framework for computing the bubble-nucleation rate, accounting for the presence of various energy scales. In particular, we examine the limitations of derivative expansions in constructing a thermal effective field theory for bubble nucleation. We show that for gauge field fluctuations, derivative expansions diverge after the leading two orders due to the strong variation in gauge field masses between the high- and low-temperature phases. By directly computing these contributions using the fluctuation determinant, we capture these effects while also accounting for large explicit logarithms at two loops, utilising the exact renormalisation group structure of the EFT. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach significantly improves nucleation rate calculations compared to leading-order results, providing a more robust framework for predicting gravitational-wave signals from supercooled phase transitions in models such as the SU(2)cSM.</description>

      <title>Innermost stable circular orbits around a Reissner-Nordstr\"om-global monopole spacetime in a homogeneous magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of charged particles in the spacetime of a global monopole swallowed by a Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) black hole in the presence of a external weak asymptotically homogeneous magnetic field. We carefully analyze and deduce the conditions to have such a magnetic field around this black hole and show that this is indeed possible in the small but nontrivial charge and monopole term limit. We obtain general equations of motion and analyze them for special cases of circular orbits, focusing on the inner-most stable circular orbit (ISCO) of this configuration. The richness of the parameters and complicated forms of the resulting equations of motion necessitate a numerical approach. Hence, we have presented our results with numerous graphs, which help to understand the evolution of ISCO as a function of the external test magnetic field and the monopole term depending on the parameters of the black hole, such as its electrical charge as well as the properties of the test particle such as its specific charge, angular momentum, and energy. We have also analyzed the effective potential that these fields generate and deduced results for the aforementioned values of external and internal parameters of spacetime.</description>

      <title>The $\pi\pi$ scattering amplitude at large $N_\text{c}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the scaling of meson-meson scattering amplitudes with the number of colors, $N_\text{c}$. We use lattice calculations in a theory with $N_\text{f}=4$ degenerate flavors, with $N_\text{c}=3-6$ and pion mass $M_\pi\approx 560$ MeV. We focus on three different scattering channels, two of which have the same quantum numbers as some tetraquark candidates recently found at LHCb: the $T_{cs0}^0(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^{++}(2900)$, $T_{c\bar{s}0}^0(2900)$ and $T_{c\bar{s}1}^0(2900)$ states. Finite-volume energies are extracted using a large set of operators, containing two-particle operators with the form of two pions or two vector mesons, and local tetraquark operators. The resulting energy spectra is used to constrain the infinite-volume scattering amplitude by means of L\"uscher's quantization condition. We consider polynomial parametrizations of the phase shift, as well as one-loop chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) predictions. We find that our lattice results follow the expected $N_\text{c}$ scaling and are sensitive to subleading $N_\text{c}$ corrections. In addition, we constrain the scaling of different combinations of low-energy constants from matching to large $N_\text{c}$ ChPT. The results for the channel corresponding to a $(\pi^+ D^+_s - K^+ D^+)$ state show evidence of a virtual bound state with energy $E_\text{virtual}=1.63(10)M_\pi$ for $N_\text{c}=3$, while this pole disappears at $N_\text{c}&gt;3$. This may be connected to the exotic states found in experiment.</description>

      <title>Lattice Monte Carlo meets lattice functional Renormalization Group: A quantitative comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice Monte Carlo (MC) simulations and the functional Renormalization Group (RG) are powerful approaches that allow for quantitative studies of non-perturbative phenomena such as bound-state formation, spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions. While results from both methods have recently shown remarkable agreement for many observables, e.g., in Quantum Chromodynamics, an analysis of deviations in certain quantities turns out to be challenging. This is because calculations with the two methods are based on different approximations, regularizations and scale fixing procedures. In the present work, we present a framework for a more direct comparison by formulating the functional RG approach on a finite spacetime lattice. This removes all ambiguities of regularization, finite size and scale fixing procedures in concrete studies. By investigating the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking and phase transitions in a $Z(2)$ scalar theory in $d=1,2,3$ spacetime dimensions, we demonstrate at the example of the local potential approximation how this framework can be used to evaluate and compare the systematic errors of both approaches.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic Geometry and Gappable Edges in Rotationally Invariant Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work on Abelian topological phases with rotational symmetry has raised the question of whether rotational symmetry can protect gapless propagating edge modes. Here we address this issue by considering the coupling of topological phases to the extrinsic geometry of the background. First, we analyze an effective hydrodynamic theory for an Abelian topological phase with vanishing Hall conductance. After integrating out the bulk hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, we identify charge neutral, rotationally invariant mass terms by coupling the propagating boundary modes to the extrinsic geometry. This allows us to integrate out the edge modes and we find a gapped theory described by a local induced action that depends on the extrinsic geometry of the boundary, regardless of the shift. Finally, we apply these ideas to a microscopic theory and find the explicit bulk terms which respect gauge and rotational symmetry and open a gap in the edge spectrum.</description>

      <title>The infrared-safe Minkowskian Curci-Ferrari model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the existence of Landau-pole-free renormalization group trajectories in the Minkowskian version of the Curci-Ferrari model as a function of a running parameter $q^2$ associated to the four-vector $q$ at which renormalization conditions are imposed, and which can take both space-like ($\smash{q^2&lt;0}$) and time-like ($\smash{q^2&gt;0}$) values. We discuss two possible extensions of the infrared-safe scheme defined in Ref. [Phys. Rev. D, 84, 045018, 2011] for the Euclidean version of the model, which coincide with the latter in the space-like region upon identifying $\smash{Q^2\equiv-q^2}$ with the square of the renormalization scale in that reference. The first extension uses real-valued renormalization factors and leads to a flow in the time-like region with a similar structure as the flow in the space-like region (or in the Euclidean model), including a non-trivial fixed point and a family of trajectories bounded at all scales by the value of the coupling at this fixed point. Interestingly, the fixed point in the time-like region has a much smaller value of $\lambda\equiv g^2N/16\pi^2$ than the corresponding one in the space-like region, a value closer to the perturbative boundary $\smash{\lambda=1}$. However, in this real-valued infrared-safe scheme, the flow cannot connect the time-like and space-like regions. Thus, it is not possible to deduce the relevant time-like flow trajectory from the sole knowledge of a space-like flow trajectory. To try to cure this problem, we investigate a second extension of the Euclidean IR-safe scheme, which allows for complex-valued renormalization factors. We discuss under which conditions these schemes can make sense and study their ability to connect space- and time-like flow trajectories. In particular, we investigate to which types of time-like trajectories the perturbative space-like trajectories are mapped onto.</description>

      <title>Relativistic stars in $f(Q)$-gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate static spherically symmetric spacetimes within the framework of symmetric teleparallel $f(Q)$ gravity in order to describe relativistic stars. We adopt a specific ansatz for the background geometry corresponding to a singularity-free space-time. We obtain an expression for the connection, which allows the derivation of solutions for any $f(Q)$ theory in this context. Our approach aims to address a recurring error appearing in the literature, where even when a connection compatible with spherical symmetry is adopted, the field equation for the connection is systematically omitted and not checked if it is satisfied. For the stellar configuration, we concentrate on the power-law model $f(Q)=Q+\alpha Q_{0}\left( \frac{Q}{Q_{0}}\right) ^{\nu }$. The de Sitter-Schwarzschild geometry naturally emerges as an attractor beyond a certain radius, we thus utilize it as the external solution beyond the boundary of the star. We perform a detailed investigation of the physical characteristics of the interior solution, explicitly determining the mass function, analyzing the resulting gravitational fluid properties and deriving the angular and radial speed of sound.</description>

      <title>Scalar Field Static Spherically Symmetric Solutions in Teleparallel $F(T)$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate in this paper the static radial coordinate-dependent spherically symmetric spacetime in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity for a scalar field source. We begin by setting the static field equations (FEs) to be solved and solve the conservation laws for scalar field potential solutions. We simplify the FEs and then find a general formula for computing the new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions applicable for any scalar field potential $V(T)$ and coframe ansatz. We compute new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions by using a power-law coframe ansatz for each scalar potential case arising from the conservation laws. We apply this formula to find new exact teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions for several cases of coframe ansatz parameter. The new $F(T)$ solution classes will be relevant for {studying the models close to Born--Infeld and/or scalarized Black Hole (BH) solutions inside the} dark energy (DE) described by a fundamental scalar field such as quintessence, phantom energy or quintom system, to name only those types.</description>

Abstract: Over a decade before the modern formulation of AdS/CFT duality, Duff et al. had observed a candidate microscopic explanation by identifying the CFT fields with fluctuations of probe p-branes stretched out in parallel near the horizon of their own black brane incarnation. A profound way to characterize these and more general probe p-brane configurations, especially for M5-branes, is expected to be as "super-embeddings" of their super-worldvolumes into target super-spacetime - but no concrete example of these had appeared in the literature. Here we fill this gap by constructing the explicit holographic super-embeddings of probe M5-branes and M2-branes into their corresponding super-AdS backgrounds.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of perturbed (3, 10) minimal model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study RG flows between non-unitary minimal models and massive quantum theories using Truncated Conformal Space Approach (TCSA). We consider the integrable non-unitary Yang-Lee model perturbed by $i\phi$ and the $D$-series version of $M(3,10)$ which is a product of two Yang-Lee models, perturbing the latter by relevant operators $\phi_{1,3}$ and $i\phi^+_{1,5}$. Utilizing the quasi-primary fields we find, TCSA is performed up to the level $N=15$ for $M(2,5)+i\phi$. The conjecture about the $M(3,10)$ perturbed by $\phi_{1,3}$ is stated: this theory flows to a massive phase; its spectrum contains a kink and two breathers, whose masses we find. Our TCSA results support the conjecture.</description>

      <title>On scale-separated supersymmetric AdS$_2$ flux vacua</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that scale-separated AdS$_2$ vacua with at least two preserved supercharges cannot arise from flux compactifications in a regime of computational control. We deduce this by showing that the AdS$_2$ scale is parametrically of the same order as the tension of a fundamental BPS domain wall, which provides an upper bound on the UV cutoff. Since the latter does not need to be associated to any geometric scale, the argument excludes scale separation in a broader sense than what commonly considered. Our claim is exemplified by a bottom-up 2D supergravity analysis as well as top-down models from Type II flux compactifications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological zero modes in topological insulators or superconductors are exponentially localized at the phase transition between a topologically trivial and nontrivial phase. These modes are solutions of a Jackiw-Rebbi equation modified with an additional term which is quadratic in the momentum. Moreover, localized fermionic modes can also be induced by harmonic potentials in superfluids and superconductors or in atomic nuclei. Here, by using inverse methods, we consider in the same framework exponentially-localized zero modes, as well as Gaussian modes induced by harmonic potentials (with superexponential decay) and polynomially decaying modes (with subexponential decay), and derive the explicit and analytical form of the modified Jackiw-Rebbi equation (and of the Schr\"odinger equation) which admits these modes as solutions. We find that the asymptotic behavior of the mass term is crucial in determining the decay properties of the modes. Furthermore, these considerations naturally extend to the nonhermitian regime. These findings allow us to classify and understand topological and nontopological boundary modes in topological insulators and superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10178v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the non-relativistic string theory (NRST) limit of type II string theory and its action on gravitational solitons. As a start, we exhibit in detail that the NRST limit is T-dual to a discrete lightcone limit and can be viewed as a near-BPS limit. This also clarifies the nature of multi-string states of NRST and its connection to matrix string theory. We consider the NRST limit of the fundamental string soliton, confirming the recent finding that it corresponds to a relativistic near-horizon background, which we argue is the manifestation of a strong coupling phase of the NRST worldvolume theory. Furthermore, we consider the NRST limit of a class of D-branes as well as the NS5-brane. This reveals that they become gravitational solitons in NRST, as they are sourced torsional string Newton-Cartan (TSNC) geometries. Finally, for the NRST D-brane solitons we show that a further decoupling limit leads to new holographic correspondences between multicritical matrix theories and NRST in curved TSNC backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Useful trick to compute correlation functions of composite operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In general, in gauge field theories, physical observables are represented by gauge-invariant composite operators, such as the electromagnetic current. As we recently demonstrated in the context of the $U\left(1\right)$ and $SU\left(2\right)$ Higgs models \cite{Dudal:2019pyg,Dudal:2020uwb,Maas:2020kda}, correlation functions of gauge-invariant operators exhibit very nice properties. Besides the well-known gauge independence, they do not present unphysical cuts, and their K\"{a}ll\'{e}n-Lehmann representations are positive, at least perturbatively. Despite all these interesting features, they are not employed as much as elementary fields, mainly due to the additional complexities involved in their computation and renormalization. In this article, we present a useful trick to compute loop corrections to correlation functions of composite operators. This trick consists of introducing an additional field with no dynamics, coupled to the composite operator of interest. By using this approach, we can employ the traditional algorithms used to compute correlation functions of elementary fields.</description>

Abstract: In the context of the Swampland program, black hole attractors have been employed to probe infinite distances in moduli space, where the EFT cutoff goes to zero in Planck units and UV effects become significant. In this paper, we take the perspective of the two-derivative action of string theoretic effective field theories and explore various families of extremal black hole solutions that probe infinite distance limits at their horizons. While these solutions do not include higher-order corrections in the EFT expansion, we find that, in many cases, the smallest BPS black holes in these families remarkably reproduce either the species scale or some other Kaluza-Klein scale. In highly supersymmetric cases, this match with UV scales even persists in the interior of moduli space. We even find that non-BPS black holes solutions in circle compactification of Type II string theories follow the species scale in decompactification limits. These observations suggests that the two-derivative action may encode information about relevant UV scales. We discuss the interplay of these results with emergence and UV/IR mixing in quantum gravity.</description>

Abstract: Superstring compactifications have been vigorously studied for over four decades, and have flourished involving an active iterative feedback between physics and (complex) algebraic geometry. This led to an unprecedented wealth of constructions, virtually all of which are "purely" algebraic. Recent developments however indicate many more possibilities to be afforded by including certain generalizations that, at first glance at least, are not algebraic -- yet fit remarkably well within an overall mirror-symmetric framework and are surprisingly amenable to standard computational analysis upon certain mild but systematic modifications.</description>

Abstract: We construct supersymmetric rotating AdS$_5$ black holes in 5d $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauged supergravity coupled to two vector multiplets and a universal hypermultiplet, and verify their microscopic counting from the superconformal index of the dual 4d class $\mathcal{S}$ $\mathcal{N}=1$ SCFTs. From the CFT, we perform the Legendre transform of the index to the microcanonical ensemble. The theories are parametrized by a rational number $z$ which enters into the extremization equations making them more challenging to solve. We present a method to address these difficulties and highlight the subtleties involved. From the gravity perspective, we identify a charged, rotating black hole whose Bekenstein-Hawking entropy matches the prediction from the index for $z=\pm1$. Beyond this value, where hypermultiplet scalars are nonzero, we construct the near-horizon extremal geometry perturbatively around $z= 1$ and verify that the entropy is consistent with the CFT prediction. We discuss the thermodynamics and verify the near-horizon versions of the first law of thermodynamics and the supersymmetric condition. In this setting, our analysis characterizes the first construction of a rotating black hole geometry in a 5d $\mathcal{N}=2$ supergravity theory that contains hypermultiplets.</description>

      <title>Fusion rules and structure constants of E-series minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ADE classification of Virasoro minimal models, the E-series is the sparsest: their central charges $c=1-6\frac{(p-q)^2}{pq}$ are not dense in the half-line $c\in (-\infty,1)$, due to $q=12,18,30$ taking only 3 values -- the Coxeter numbers of $E_6, E_7, E_8$. The E-series is also the least well understood, with few known results beyond the spectrum.
  Here, we use a semi-analytic bootstrap approach for numerically computing 4-point correlation functions. We deduce non-chiral fusion rules, i.e. which 3-point structure constants vanish. These vanishings can be explained by constraints from null vectors, interchiral symmetry, simple currents, extended symmetries, permutations, and parity, except in one case for $q=30$. We conjecture that structure constants are given by a universal expression built from the double Gamma function, times polynomial functions of $\cos(\pi\frac{p}{q})$ with values in $\mathbb{Q}\big(\cos(\frac{\pi}{q})\big)$, which we work out explicitly for $q=12$.
  We speculate on generalizing E-series minimal models to generic integer values of $q$, and recovering loop CFTs as $p,q\to \infty$.</description>

      <title>Self-Similar Structure of Loop Amplitudes and Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the self-similar structure of loop amplitudes in quantum field theory and apply it to amplitude generation and renormalization. A renormalized amplitude can be regarded as an effective coupling that recursively appears within another loop. It is best described as a vertex function from the effective action. It is a scale-dependent, finite, parametrically small and observable quantity appearing in the S-matrix. Replacing a tree-level coupling with a loop amplitude provides a systematic method of generating high-order loop amplitudes, guaranteeing no subamplitude divergence. This method also provides an alternative bottom-up proof to the traditional top-down recursive renormalization of general amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Probing non-equilibrium steady states of the Klein-Gordon field with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the transition rate of an Unruh-DeWitt detector coupled to a non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) of a free massless scalar field on four-dimensional Minkowski spacetime. The NESS arises from bringing two semi-infinite heat baths into thermal contact along a hypersurface. The detector couples linearly to the field by a monopole interaction, and it moves inertially along the axis of the NESS heat flow. We contrast the resulting transition rates with the case of a detector that is coupled to an inertial thermal equilibrium state. The results illustrate that the monopole does not properly couple to the heat flow, resulting in the detector to merely register kinematical effects. Hence dynamical features of the NESS are hidden from this detector model.</description>

      <title>Constructing noncommutative black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a self-contained and consistent formulation of noncommutative (NC) gauge theory of gravity, focusing on spherically symmetric black hole geometries. Our construction starts from the gauge-theoretic viewpoint of Poincar\'{e} (or de Sitter) gravity and introduces noncommutativity through the Moyal star product and the Seiberg-Witten map, retaining NC gauge invariance at each order in the deformation parameter $\Theta$. Working systematically to second order in $\Theta$, we obtain explicit NC corrections to the spin connection, the vierbein, and various geometric objects such as the metric and curvature scalars. Using these results, we compute NC modifications of four-dimensional Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m solutions, including scenarios with a cosmological constant, as well as three-dimensional BTZ-type black holes (both uncharged and charged). For each black hole solution, we explore various possible Moyal twists, each of which generally breaks some symmetries and modifies the horizon structure, surface gravity, and curvature invariants. In particular, we show that while the radial location of horizons in Schwarzschild-like solutions remains unchanged for some twists, other twists introduce important but finite deformations in curvature scalars and can decouple the Killing horizon from the causal horizon. Similar patterns arise in the charged and lower-dimensional cases. Beyond constructing explicit examples, our approach provides a blueprint for systematically incorporating short-distance quantum corrections through noncommutativity in gravitational settings. The methods and expansions we present can be extended to more general geometries including rotating black holes and additional matter fields, offering a broad framework for future studies of NC effects in classical solutions of general relativity.</description>

      <title>A search for super-imposed oscillations to the primordial power spectrum in Planck and SPT-3G 2018 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for super-imposed oscillations linearly or logarithmically spaced in Fourier wavenumbers in Planck and South Pole Telescope (SPT-3G) 2018 temperature and polarization data. The SPT-3G temperature and polarization data provide a new window to test these oscillations at high multipoles beyond the Planck angular resolution and sensitivity. We consider both models with a constant and a Gaussian modulated amplitude, which correspond to three and four additional parameters beyond power-law primordial power spectrum for the templates considered, respectively. We find that each of the four models considered can provide an improved fit to Planck data, consistently with previous findings, and to SPT-3G data, always compared to power-law power spectrum. For a constant amplitude of the superimposed oscillations, we find tighter constraints on the amplitude of the oscillations from the combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than in each individual data sets. When the ranges of parameters which provide a better fit to Planck and SPT-3G data overlap, as in the case of Gaussian modulated oscillations, we find a larger $\Delta \chi^2 \sim - 17.5 \, (-14.7)$ for logarithmic (linear) oscillations - in a combined Planck/SPT-3G data set than %the one obtained in each individual data sets. These findings will be further tested with upcoming CMB temperature and polarization measurements at high multipoles provided by ongoing ground experiments.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo Simulation of Operator Dynamics and Entanglement in Dual-Unitary Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00953v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate operator dynamics and entanglement growth in dual-unitary circuits, a class of locally scrambled quantum systems that enables efficient simulation beyond the exponential complexity of the Hilbert space. By mapping the operator evolution to a classical Markov process,we perform Monte Carlo simulations to access the time evolution of local operator density and entanglement with polynomial computational cost. Our results reveal that the operator density converges exponentially to a steady-state value, with analytical bounds that match our simulations. Additionally, we observe a volume-law scaling of operator entanglement across different subregions,and identify a critical transition from maximal to sub-maximal entanglement growth, governed by the circuit's gate parameter. This transition, confirmed by both mean-field theory and Monte Carlo simulations, provides new insights into operator entanglement dynamics in quantum many-body systems. Our work offers a scalable computational framework for studying long-time operator evolution and entanglement, paving the way for deeper exploration of quantum information dynamics.</description>

      <title>Boson star superradiance with spinning effects and in time domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiance, the process by which waves are amplified through energy and angular momentum transfer, can also occur in horizonless objects like boson stars, due to both the real space and internal field space rotations. In this work, we study superradiance in the frequency and time domains for static and spinning boson stars, constructed within general relativity and with a self-interacting complex scalar field as a matter source. Using linear perturbation theory and three dimensional nonlinear simulations, we calculate amplification factors and analyze energy and angular momentum transfer in scattering processes, with results showing consistency between approaches. Wave scattering inside a cavity containing a boson star is also examined, demonstrating the effects of confinement on amplification.</description>

      <title>Spacetime curvature corrections for the Yukawa potential and its application for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of the spacetime curvature on the Yukawa potential, focusing on boson-boson interactions derived from the {\Phi^3} theory. Using the Bunch-Parker propagator expansion within Born's first approximation, we derive a Yukawa-like potential in a curved spacetime. We analyze the impact of the curvature on the propagator in momentum space, revealing modifications to the potential and showing that the corrections are determined by geometric quantities from Einstein's equations, like the Ricci scalar and tensor. We illustrate this using the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, highlighting the corrections' magnitude for specific parameters. Our results underscore the nuanced interplay between spacetime curvature and quantum interactions, providing insights into nucleon-nucleon systems in curved spacetimes or near strong gravitational fields.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of quantum field theory, we analyze the neutrino oscillations in the presence of a torsion background. We consider the Einstein Cartan theory and we study the cases of constant torsion and of linearly time-dependent torsion. We derive new neutrino oscillation formulae which depend on the spin orientation and the CP asymmetry formula. Experiment such as PTOLEMY which analyzes the cosmological background of neutrino, can provide insights into the effect shown here.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic properties and Joule-Thomson expansion of AdS black hole with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamics and Joule-Thomson expansion of anti-de Sitter black hole (AdS BH) with Gaussian distribution in non-commutative geometry is systematically studied. The metric of Gaussian-distributed BH is obtained, showing a dS geometry at the core of BH. The research indicates that the BH characterized by a Gaussian distribution exhibit thermodynamic properties that are remarkably similar to those of BH with a Lorentzian distribution in non-commutative geometry. This similarity is specifically manifested in the small BH-large BH phase transition, the corrected first law of thermodynamics, the criticality, the heat capacity, the zeroth-order phase transition and the Joule-Thomson process. Notably, the critical ratio of Gaussian-distributed BH (0.46531) is significantly larger than those observed in Van der Waals fluids (0.375), and indeed, it is also substantially exceed those of Lorentzian-distributed BH (0.36671). Moreover, compared to the case of Lorentzian source, the zeroth-order phase transition effect in Gaussian-distributed BH is exceedingly subtle (accompanied by a relative increase in the Gibbs free energy on the order of $10^{-3}\!\sim\!\!10^{-2}$) and is difficult to detect distinctly.</description>

      <title>Scale-Dependent Suppression Functions and Functional Space Geometry in Renormalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of a scale-dependent suppression function $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ on the functional space geometry in renormalization theory. By introducing a dynamical cutoff scale $\Lambda$, the suppression function smoothly regulates high-momentum contributions without requiring a hard cutoff. We show that $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ induces a modified metric on functional space, leading to a non-trivial Ricci curvature that becomes increasingly negative in the ultraviolet (UV) limit. This effect dynamically suppresses high-energy states, yielding a controlled deformation of the functional domain. Furthermore, we derive the renormalization group (RG) flow of $\Omega(k, \Lambda)$ and demonstrate its role in controlling the curvature flow of the functional space. The suppression function leads to spectral modifications that suggest an effective dimensional reduction at high energies, a feature relevant to functional space deformations and integral convergence in renormalization theory. Our findings provide a mathematical framework for studying regularization techniques and their role in the UV behavior of function spaces.</description>
