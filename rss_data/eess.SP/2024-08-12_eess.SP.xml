      <title>CSI-Free Position Optimization for Movable Antenna Communication Systems: A Black-Box Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is a new technology which leverages local movement of antennas to improve channel qualities and enhance the communication performance. Nevertheless, to fully realize the potential of MA systems, complete channel state information (CSI) between the transmitter-MA and the receiver-MA is required, which involves estimating a large number of channel parameters and incurs an excessive amount of training overhead. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a CSI-free MA position optimization method. The basic idea is to treat position optimization as a black-box optimization problem and calculate the gradient of the unknown objective function using zeroth-order (ZO) gradient approximation techniques. Simulation results show that the proposed ZO-based method, through adaptively adjusting the position of the MA, can achieve a favorable signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) using a smaller number of position measurements than the CSI-based approach. Such a merit makes the proposed algorithm more adaptable to fast-changing propagation channels.</description>

      <title>Digital Semantic Communications: An Alternating Multi-Phase Training Strategy with Mask Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemComm) has emerged as new paradigm shifts.Most existing SemComm systems transmit continuously distributed signals in analog fashion.However, the analog paradigm is not compatible with current digital communication frameworks. In this paper, we propose an alternating multi-phase training strategy (AMP) to enable the joint training of the networks in the encoder and decoder through non-differentiable digital processes. AMP contains three training phases, aiming at feature extraction (FE), robustness enhancement (RE), and training-testing alignment (TTA), respectively. AMP contains three training phases, aiming at feature extraction (FE), robustness enhancement (RE), and training-testing alignment (TTA), respectively. In particular, in the FE stage, we learn the representation ability of semantic information by end-to-end training the encoder and decoder in an analog manner. When we take digital communication into consideration, the domain shift between digital and analog demands the fine-tuning for encoder and decoder. To cope with joint training process within the non-differentiable digital processes, we propose the alternation between updating the decoder individually and jointly training the codec in RE phase. To boost robustness further, we investigate a mask-attack (MATK) in RE to simulate an evident and severe bit-flipping effect in a differentiable manner. To address the training-testing inconsistency introduced by MATK, we employ an additional TTA phase, fine-tuning the decoder without MATK. Combining with AMP and an information restoration network, we propose a digital SemComm system for image transmission, named AMP-SC. Comparing with the representative benchmark, AMP-SC achieves $0.82 \sim 1.65$dB higher average reconstruction performance among various representative datasets at different scales and a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Analysis of RIS-Assisted Cellular Networks with Reflective Intelligent Surfaces on Roads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) provide alternative routes for reflected signals to network users, offering numerous applications. This paper explores an innovative approach of strategically deploying RISs along road areas to leverage various propagation and blockage conditions present in cellular networks with roads. To address the local network geometries shown by such networks, we use a stochastic geometry framework, specifically the Cox point processes, to model the locations of RISs and vehicle users. Then, we define the coverage probability as the chance that either a base station or an RIS is in line of sight (LOS) of the typical user and that the LOS signal has a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than a threshold. We derive the coverage probability as a function of key parameters such as RIS density and path loss exponent. We observe that the network geometry highly affects the coverage and that the proposed RIS deployment effectively leverages the underlying difference of attenuation and blockage, significantly increasing the coverage of vehicle users in the network. With experimental results addressing the impact of key variables to network performance, this work serves as a versatile tool for designing, analyzing, and optimizing RIS-assisted cellular networks with many vehicles.</description>

      <title>Improving 3D Cellular Positioning Integrity with Bayesian RAIM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring positioning integrity amid faulty measurements is crucial for safety-critical applications, making receiver autonomous integrity monitoring (RAIM) indispensable. This paper introduces a Bayesian RAIM algorithm with a streamlined architecture for snapshot-type 3D cellular positioning. Unlike traditional frequentist-type RAIM algorithms, it computes the exact posterior probability density function (PDF) of the position vector as a Gaussian mixture (GM) model using efficient message passing along a factor graph. This Bayesian approach retains all crucial information from the measurements, eliminates the need to discard faulty measurements, and results in tighter protection levels (PLs) in 3D space and 1D/2D subspaces that meet target integrity risk (TIR) requirements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the Bayesian RAIM algorithm significantly outperforms a baseline algorithm, achieving over $50\%$ PL reduction at a comparable computational cost.</description>

      <title>Survey: Transformer-based Models in Data Modality Conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have made significant strides across various artificial intelligence domains, including natural language processing, computer vision, and audio processing. This success has naturally garnered considerable interest from both academic and industry researchers. Consequently, numerous Transformer variants (often referred to as X-formers) have been developed for these fields. However, a thorough and systematic review of these modality-specific conversions remains lacking. Modality Conversion involves the transformation of data from one form of representation to another, mimicking the way humans integrate and interpret sensory information. This paper provides a comprehensive review of transformer-based models applied to the primary modalities of text, vision, and speech, discussing their architectures, conversion methodologies, and applications. By synthesizing the literature on modality conversion, this survey aims to underline the versatility and scalability of transformers in advancing AI-driven content generation and understanding.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of FAS-Aided NOMA-ISAC: A Backscattering Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a two-user downlink system for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in which the two users deploy a fluid antenna system (FAS) and adopt the nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) strategy. Specifically, the integrated sensing and backscatter communication (ISABC) model is considered, where a dual-functional base station (BS) serves to communicate the two users and sense a tag's surrounding. In contrast to conventional ISAC, the backscattering tag reflects the signals transmitted by the BS to the NOMA users and enhances their communication performance. Furthermore, the BS extracts environmental information from the same backscatter signal in the sensing stage. Firstly, we derive closed-form expressions for both the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and probability density function (PDF) of the equivalent channel at the users utilizing the moment matching method and the Gaussian copula. Then in the communication stage, we obtain closed-form expressions for both the outage probability and for the corresponding asymptotic expressions in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Moreover, using numerical integration techniques such as the Gauss-Laguerre quadrature (GLQ), we have series-form expressions for the user ergodic communication rates (ECRs). In addition, we get a closed-form expression for the ergodic sensing rate (ESR) using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). Finally, the accuracy of our analytical results is validated numerically, and we confirm the superiority of employing FAS over traditional fixed-position antenna systems in both ISAC and ISABC.</description>

      <title>Multi-User MISO with Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces: A DRL-Based Sum-Rate Optimization Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) represent a novel signal processing paradigm that enables over-the-air processing of electromagnetic waves at the speed of light. Their multi-layer architecture exhibits customizable computational capabilities compared to conventional single-layer reconfigurable intelligent surfaces and metasurface lenses. In this paper, we deploy SIM to improve the performance of multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless systems through a low complexity manner with reduced numbers of transmit radio frequency chains. In particular, an optimization formulation for the joint design of the SIM phase shifts and the transmit power allocation is presented, which is efficiently tackled via a customized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach that systematically explores pre-designed states of the SIM-parametrized smart wireless environment. The presented performance evaluation results demonstrate the proposed method's capability to effectively learn from the wireless environment, while consistently outperforming conventional precoding schemes under low transmit power conditions. Furthermore, the implementation of hyperparameter tuning and whitening process significantly enhance the robustness of the proposed DRL framework.</description>

      <title>Large Models for Aerial Edges: An Edge-Cloud Model Evolution and Communication Paradigm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The future sixth-generation (6G) of wireless networks is expected to surpass its predecessors by offering ubiquitous coverage through integrated air-ground facility deployments in both communication and computing domains. In this network, aerial facilities, such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), conduct artificial intelligence (AI) computations based on multi-modal data to support diverse applications including surveillance and environment construction. However, these multi-domain inference and content generation tasks require large AI models, demanding powerful computing capabilities, thus posing significant challenges for UAVs. To tackle this problem, we propose an integrated edge-cloud model evolution framework, where UAVs serve as edge nodes for data collection and edge model computation. Through wireless channels, UAVs collaborate with ground cloud servers, providing cloud model computation and model updating for edge UAVs. With limited wireless communication bandwidth, the proposed framework faces the challenge of information exchange scheduling between the edge UAVs and the cloud server. To tackle this, we present joint task allocation, transmission resource allocation, transmission data quantization design, and edge model update design to enhance the inference accuracy of the integrated air-ground edge-cloud model evolution framework by mean average precision (mAP) maximization. A closed-form lower bound on the mAP of the proposed framework is derived, and the solution to the mAP maximization problem is optimized accordingly. Simulations, based on results from vision-based classification experiments, consistently demonstrate that the mAP of the proposed framework outperforms both a centralized cloud model framework and a distributed edge model framework across various communication bandwidths and data sizes.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Delay-Tolerant Data Harvest Architecture Leveraging Low Earth Orbit Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaching all regions of Earth, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites can harvest delay-tolerant data from remotely located users on Earth without ground infrastructure. This work aims to assess a data harvest network architecture where users generate data and LEO satellites harvest data from users when passing by. By developing a novel stochastic geometry Cox point process model that simultaneously generates orbits and the motion of LEO satellite harvesters on them, we analyze key performance indices of such a network by deriving the following: (i) the average fraction of time that the typical user is served by LEO satellite harvesters, (ii) the average amount of data uploaded per each satellite pass, (iii) the maximum harvesting capacity of the proposed network model, and (iv) the delay distribution in the proposed network. These key metrics are given as functions of key network variables such as $\lambda$ the mean number of orbits and $\mu$ the mean number of satellites per orbit. Providing rich comprehensive analytical results and practical interpretations of these results, this work assesses the potential of the delay-tolerant use of LEO satellites and also serves as a versatile framework to analyze, design, and optimize delay-tolerant LEO satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Analysis of Downlink Communications in a Heterogeneous LEO Satellite Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks connect millions of devices on Earth and offer various services, such as data communications, remote sensing, and data harvesting. As the number of services increases, LEO satellite networks will continue to grow, and many LEO satellite network operators will share the same spectrum resources. We aim to examine the coexistence of such a future heterogeneous LEO satellite network by proposing a tractable spatial model and analyzing the basic performance of downlink communications. We model a heterogeneous LEO satellite network as Cox point processes, ensuring satellites are located on various orbits. Then, we analyze two different access technologies for such a heterogeneous satellite network: closed access and open access. For both cases, we derive the coverage probability and prove that the coverage probability of the open access scenario outperforms that of the closed access, and this coverage enhancement applies to all users. By providing essential network performance statistics as key distributional parameters and by presenting the fact that the Cox point process approximates a forthcoming future constellation with slight variation, the developed framework and analysis will serve as a tractable instrument to design, evaluate, and optimize heterogeneous LEO satellite networks with numerous constellations.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Guided Label Noise Distillation for Robust Signal Modulation Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is an effective way to deal with physical layer threats of the internet of things (IoT). However, there is often label mislabeling in practice, which significantly impacts the performance and robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs). In this paper, we propose a meta-learning guided label noise distillation method for robust AMC. Specifically, a teacher-student heterogeneous network (TSHN) framework is proposed to distill and reuse label noise. Based on the idea that labels are representations, the teacher network with trusted meta-learning divides and conquers untrusted label samples and then guides the student network to learn better by reassessing and correcting labels. Furthermore, we propose a multi-view signal (MVS) method to further improve the performance of hard-to-classify categories with few-shot trusted label samples. Extensive experimental results show that our methods can significantly improve the performance and robustness of signal AMC in various and complex label noise scenarios, which is crucial for securing IoT applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14319v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Algorithms for mutual interference mitigation and object parameter estimation are a key enabler for automotive applications of frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radar. In this paper, we introduce a signal separation method to detect and estimate radar object parameters while jointly estimating and successively canceling the interference signal. The underlying signal model poses a challenge, since both the coherent radar echo and the non-coherent interference influenced by individual multipath propagation channels must be considered. Under certain assumptions, the model is described as a superposition of multipath channels weighted by parametric interference chirp envelopes. Inspired by sparse Bayesian learning (SBL), we employ an augmented probabilistic model that uses a hierarchical Gamma-Gaussian prior model for each multipath channel. Based on this, an iterative inference algorithm is derived using the variational expectation-maximization (EM) methodology. The algorithm is statistically evaluated in terms of object parameter estimation accuracy and robustness, indicating that it is fundamentally capable of achieving the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) with respect to the accuracy of object estimates and it closely follows the radar performance achieved when no interference is present.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Receiver Design for Massive MIMO-OFDM with Low-Resolution ADCs and Oversampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-resolution analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and hybrid beamforming have emerged as efficient solutions to reduce power consumption with satisfactory spectral efficiency (SE) in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we investigate the performance of a hybrid receiver in uplink massive MIMO orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems with low-resolution ADCs and oversampling. Considering both the temporal and spatial correlation of the quantization distortion (QD), we derive a closed-form approximation of the frequency-domain QD covariance matrix, which facilitates the evaluation of the system SE. Then we jointly design the analog and baseband combiners to maximize the SE. The formulated problem is significantly challenging due to the constant-modulus constraint of the analog combiner and its coupling with the digital one. To overcome the challenges, we transform the objective function into an equivalent but more tractable form and then iteratively update the analog and digital combiner. Numerical simulations verify the superiority of the proposed algorithm compared to the considered benchmarks and show the resilience of the hybrid receiver to beam squint for low-resolution systems. Furthermore, the results show that the proposed hybrid receiver design with oversampling can achieve significantly higher energy efficiency compared to the digital one.</description>

      <title>The Rlign Algorithm for Enhanced Electrocardiogram Analysis through R-Peak Alignment for Explainable Classification and Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings have long been vital in diagnosing different cardiac conditions. Recently, research in the field of automatic ECG processing using machine learning methods has gained importance, mainly by utilizing deep learning methods on raw ECG signals. A major advantage of models like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) is their ability to effectively process biomedical imaging or signal data. However, this strength is tempered by challenges related to their lack of explainability, the need for a large amount of training data, and the complexities involved in adapting them for unsupervised clustering tasks. In addressing these tasks, we aim to reintroduce shallow learning techniques, including support vector machines and principal components analysis, into ECG signal processing by leveraging their semi-structured, cyclic form. To this end, we developed and evaluated a transformation that effectively restructures ECG signals into a fully structured format, facilitating their subsequent analysis using shallow learning algorithms. In this study, we present this adaptive transformative approach that aligns R-peaks across all signals in a dataset and resamples the segments between R-peaks, both with and without heart rate dependencies. We illustrate the substantial benefit of this transformation for traditional analysis techniques in the areas of classification, clustering, and explainability, outperforming commercial software for median beat transformation and CNN approaches. Our approach demonstrates a significant advantage for shallow machine learning methods over CNNs, especially when dealing with limited training data. Additionally, we release a fully tested and publicly accessible code framework, providing a robust alignment pipeline to support future research, available at https://github.com/imi-ms/rlign.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the issue of how to exploit target location distribution for multiple input multiple output (MIMO) radar waveform design. We consider a MIMO radar aiming to estimate the unknown and random angular location parameters of a point target, whose distribution information can be exploited by the radar. First, we establish the models of the MIMO radar system and the target location distribution. Based on the considered models, we propose the first category of target location distribution exploitation methods by analyzing the radar direction-of-angle (DoA) estimation performance and deriving a general form of posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) as the lower bound of the mean square error of DoA estimation. Following this, to explore more insights, we proposed the second category of target location distribution exploitation methods by introducing a novel radar metric, probability scaled beampattern (PSBP), from the perspective of radar beampattern. To compare the two methods, we formulate the PCRB and PSBP oriented radar waveform design problems and propose corresponding low-complexity and convergence-guaranteed algorithms to tackle them. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in different scenarios to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the radar performance.</description>

      <title>The Adaptive $\tau$-Lasso: Robustness and Oracle Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new regularized version of the robust $\tau$-regression estimator for analyzing high-dimensional datasets subject to gross contamination in the response variables and covariates (explanatory variables). The resulting estimator, termed adaptive $\tau$-Lasso, is robust to outliers and high-leverage points. It also incorporates an adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term, which enables the selection of relevant variables and reduces the bias associated with large true regression coefficients. More specifically, this adaptive $\ell_1$-norm penalty term assigns a weight to each regression coefficient. For a fixed number of predictors $p$, we show that the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso has the oracle property, ensuring both variable-selection consistency and asymptotic normality. Asymptotic normality applies only to the entries of the regression vector corresponding to the true support, assuming knowledge of the true regression vector support. We characterize its robustness by establishing the finite-sample breakdown point and the influence function. We carry out extensive simulations and observe that the class of $\tau$-Lasso estimators exhibits robustness and reliable performance in both contaminated and uncontaminated data settings. We also validate our theoretical findings on robustness properties through simulations. In the face of outliers and high-leverage points, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators achieve the best performance or close-to-best performance in terms of prediction and variable selection accuracy compared to other competing regularized estimators for all scenarios considered in this study. Therefore, the adaptive $\tau$-Lasso and $\tau$-Lasso estimators provide attractive tools for a variety of sparse linear regression problems, particularly in high-dimensional settings and when the data is contaminated by outliers and high-leverage points.</description>

      <title>On the Ground and in the Sky: A Tutorial on Radio Localization in Ground-Air-Space Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05704v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent limitations in scaling up ground infrastructure for future wireless networks, combined with decreasing operational costs of aerial and space networks, are driving considerable research interest in multisegment ground-air-space (GAS) networks. In GAS networks, where ground and aerial users share network resources, ubiquitous and accurate user localization becomes indispensable, not only as an end-user service but also as an enabler for location-aware communications. This breaks the convention of having localization as a byproduct in networks primarily designed for communications. To address these imperative localization needs, the design and utilization of ground, aerial, and space anchors require thorough investigation. In this tutorial, we provide an in-depth systemic analysis of the radio localization problem in GAS networks, considering ground and aerial users as targets to be localized. Starting from a survey of the most relevant works, we then define the key characteristics of anchors and targets in GAS networks. Subsequently, we detail localization fundamentals in GAS networks, considering 3D positions, orientations, and velocities. Afterward, we thoroughly analyze radio localization systems in GAS networks, detailing the system model, design aspects, and considerations for each of the three GAS anchors. Preliminary results are presented to provide a quantifiable perspective on key design aspects in GAS-based localization scenarios. We then identify the vital roles 6G enablers are expected to play in radio localization in GAS networks.</description>

      <title>On Performance of FAS-aided Wireless Powered NOMA Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the performance of a wireless powered communication network (WPCN) under the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) scheme, where users take advantage of an emerging fluid antenna system (FAS). More precisely, we consider a scenario where a transmitter is powered by a remote power beacon (PB) to send information to the planar NOMA FAS-equipped users through Rayleigh fading channels. After introducing the distribution of the equivalent channel coefficients to the users, we derive compact analytical expressions for the outage probability (OP) in order to evaluate the system performance. Additionally, we present asymptotic OP in the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. Eventually, results reveal that deploying the FAS with only one activated port in NOMA users can significantly enhance the WPCN performance compared with using traditional antenna systems (TAS).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced control, operation, and planning tools of electrical networks with ML are not straightforward. 110 experts were surveyed to show where and how ML algorithms could advance. This paper assesses this survey and research environment. Then, it develops an innovation roadmap that helps align our research community with a goal-oriented realisation of the opportunities that AI upholds. This paper finds that the R&amp;D environment of system operators (and the surrounding research ecosystem) needs adaptation to enable faster developments with AI while maintaining high testing quality and safety. This roadmap serves system operators, academics, and labs advancing next-generation electrical network tools.</description>

      <title>Optimal Sensing Policy With Interference-Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06280v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Assume that an interferer behaves according to a parametric model but one does not know the value of the model parameters. Sensing improves the model knowledge and therefore enables better link adaptation. However, we consider a half-duplex scenario where, at each time slot, the communication system must decide between sensing and communication. Thus, we propose to investigate the optimal policy to maximize the expected sum rate given a finite-time communication. We first show that this problem can be modelled in the Markov decision process (MDP) framework. We then demonstrate that the optimal open-loop and closed-loop policies can be found faster than with the standard backward-induction algorithm.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Identifying Anatomical Biomarkers of Early Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alzheimer Disease poses a significant challenge, necessitating early detection for effective intervention. MRI is a key neuroimaging tool due to its ease of use and cost effectiveness. This study analyzes machine learning methods for MRI based biomarker selection and classification to distinguish between healthy controls and those who develop mild cognitive impairment within five years. Using 3 Tesla MRI data from ADNI and OASIS 3, we applied various machine learning techniques, including MATLAB Classification Learner app, nested cross validation, and Bayesian optimization. Data harmonization with polynomial regression improved performance. Consistent features identified were the entorhinal, hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and lateral orbitofrontal regions. For balanced ADNI data, Naive Bayes with z score harmonization performed best. For balanced OASIS 3, SVM with z score correction excelled. In imbalanced data, RUSBoost showed strong performance on ADNI and OASIS 3. Z score harmonization highlighted the potential of a semi automatic pipeline for early AD detection using MRI.</description>

      <title>Joint Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization with Self-Interference Mitigation in MA-ISAC System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00413v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, the application in the integrated and cost-effective full-duplex (FD) monostatic systems remains underexplored. To address this research gap, we develop an MA-ISAC model within a monostatic framework, where the self-interference channel is modeled in the near field and characterized by antenna position vectors. This model allows us to investigate the use of MAs with the goal of maximizing the weighted sum of communication capacity and sensing mutual information. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex making it challenging to solve optimally. To overcome this, we employ fractional programming (FP) to propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions for both transceivers. Specifically, closed-form solutions for the transmit and receive beamforming matrices are derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a novel coarse-to-fine grained search (CFGS) approach is employed to determine the high-quality sub-optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that with strong self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities, MAs significantly enhance the overall performance and reliability of the ISAC system when utilizing our proposed algorithm, compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.</description>

      <title>A Primer on Near-Field Communications for Next-Generation Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00952v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multiple-antenna technologies are advancing toward the development of extremely large aperture arrays and the utilization of extremely high frequencies, driving the progress of next-generation multiple access (NGMA). This evolution is accompanied by the emergence of near-field communications (NFC), characterized by spherical-wave propagation, which introduces additional range dimensions to the channel and enhances system throughput. In this context, a tutorial-based primer on NFC is presented, emphasizing its applications in multiuser communications and multiple access (MA). The following areas are investigated: \romannumeral1) the commonly used near-field channel models are reviewed along with their simplifications under various near-field conditions. \romannumeral2) Building upon these models, the information-theoretic capacity limits of NFC-MA are analyzed, including the derivation of sum-rate capacity and capacity region, and their upper limits for both downlink and uplink scenarios. \romannumeral3) A detailed investigation of near-field multiuser beamforming design is presented, offering low-complexity and effective NFC-MA design methodologies in both the spatial and wavenumber (angular) domains. Throughout these investigations, near-field MA is compared with its far-field counterpart to highlight its superiority and flexibility in terms of interference management, thereby laying the groundwork for achieving NGMA.</description>

      <title>Transforming Time-Varying to Static Channels: The Power of Fluid Antenna Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04320v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the mobility problem with the assistance of fluid antenna (FA) on the user equipment (UE) side. We propose a matrix pencil-based moving port (MPMP) prediction method, which may transform the time-varying channel to a static channel by timely sliding the liquid. Different from the existing channel prediction method, we design a moving port selection method, which is the first attempt to transform the channel prediction to the port prediction by exploiting the movability of FA. Theoretical analysis shows that for the line-ofsight (LoS) channel, the prediction error of our proposed MPMP method may converge to zero, as the number of BS antennas and the port density of the FA are large enough. For a multi-path channel, we also derive the upper and lower bounds of the prediction error when the number of paths is large enough. When the UEs move at a speed of 60 or 120 km/h, simulation results show that, with the assistance of FA, our proposed MPMP method performs better than the existing channel prediction method.</description>
