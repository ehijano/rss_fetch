      <title>Stability, bifurcation and spikes of stationary solutions in a chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and logistic source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the current paper, we study stability, bifurcation, and spikes of positive stationary solutions of the following parabolic-elliptic chemotaxis system with singular sensitivity and logistic source, \begin{cases} u_t=u_{xx}-\chi (\frac{u}{v} v_x)_x+u(a-b u), &amp; 0&lt;x&lt;L, \, t&gt;0,\cr 0=v_{xx}- \mu v+ \nu u, &amp; 0&lt;x&lt;L, \, t&gt;0 \cr u_x(t,0)=u_x(t,L)=v_x(t,0)=v_x(t,L)=0, &amp; t&gt;0, \tag{1} \end{cases} where $\chi$, $a$, $b$, $\mu$, $\nu$ are positive constants. Among others, we prove there are $\chi^*&gt;0$ and $\{\chi_k^*\}\subset [\chi^*,\infty)$ ($\chi^*\in\{\chi_k^*\}$) such that the constant solution $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$ of (1) is locally stable when $0&lt;\chi&lt;\chi^*$ and is unstable when $\chi&gt;\chi^*$, and under some generic condition, for each $k\ge 1$, a (local) branch of non-constant stationary solutions of (1) bifurcates from $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$ when $\chi$ passes through $\chi_k^*$, and global extension of the local bifurcation branch is obtained. We also prove that any sequence of non-constant positive stationary solutions $\{(u(\cdot;\chi_n),v(\cdot;\chi_n))\}$ of (1) with $\chi=\chi_n(\to \infty)$ develops spikes at any $x^*$ satisfying $\liminf_{n\to\infty} u(x^*;\chi_n)&gt;\frac{a}{b}$. Some numerical analysis is carried out. It is observed numerically that the local bifurcation branch bifurcating from $(\frac{a}{b},\frac{\nu}{\mu}\frac{a}{b})$ when $\chi$ passes through $\chi^*$ can be extended to $\chi=\infty$ and the stationary solutions on this global bifurcation extension are locally stable when $\chi\gg 1$ and develop spikes as $\chi\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>A nonvariational form of the Neumann problem for H\"{o}lder continuous harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a nonvariational setting for the Neumann problem for harmonic functions that are H\"{o}lder continuous and that may have infinite Dirichlet integral. Then we introduce a space of distributions on the boundary (a space of first order traces for H\"{o}lder continuous harmonic functions), we analyze the properties of the corresponding distributional single layer potential and we prove a representation theorem for harmonic H\"{o}lder continuous functions in terms of distributional single layer potentials. As an application, we solve the interior and exterior Neumann problem with distributional data in the space of first order traces that has been introduced.</description>

      <title>A non-linear characterization of stochastic completeness of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-linear Schr\"odinger operators on graphs. We construct minimal nonnegative solutions to corresponding semi-linear elliptic equations and use them to introduce the notion of stochastic completeness at infinity in a non-linear setting. We provide characterizations for this property in terms of a semi-linear Liouville theorem. It is employed to establish a non-linear characterization for stochastic completeness, which is a graph version of a recent result on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Quantitative propagation of smallness and spectral estimates for the Schr\"odinger operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate quantitative propagation of smallness properties for the Schr\"odinger operator on a bounded domain in $\mathbb R^d$. We extend Logunov, Malinnikova's results concerning propagation of smallness for $A$-harmonic functions to solutions of divergence elliptic equations perturbed by a bounded zero order term. We also prove similar results for gradient of solutions to some particular equations. This latter result enables us to follow the recent strategy of Burq, Moyano for the obtaining of spectral estimates on rough sets for the Schr\"odinger operator. Applications to observability estimates and to the null-controllability of associated parabolic equations posed on compact manifolds or the whole euclidean space are then considered.</description>

      <title>Low-Regularity Solutions of the Nonlinear Schr\"odinger Equation on the Spatial Quarter-Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hadamard well-posedness of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with power nonlinearity formulated on the spatial quarter-plane is established in a low-regularity setting with Sobolev initial data and Dirichlet boundary data in appropriate Bourgain-type spaces. As both of the spatial variables are restricted to the half-line, a different approach is needed than the one previously used for the well-posedness of other initial-boundary value problems. In particular, now the solution of the forced linear initial-boundary problem is estimated \textit{directly}, both in Sobolev spaces and in Strichartz-type spaces, i.e. without a linear decomposition that would require estimates for the associated homogeneous and nonhomogeneous initial value problems. In the process of deriving the linear estimates, the function spaces for the boundary data are identified as the intersections of certain modified Bourgain-type spaces that involve spatial half-line Fourier transforms instead of the usual whole-line Fourier transform found in the definition of the standard Bourgain space associated with the one-dimensional initial value problem. The fact that the quarter-plane has a corner at the origin poses an additional challenge, as it requires one to expand the validity of certain Sobolev extension results to the case of a domain with a non-smooth (Lipschitz) and non-compact boundary.</description>

      <title>Scaling limit of fluctuations for high contrast stochastic homogenization of the Helmholtz equation: second order moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with the high contrast stochastic homogenization of the Helmholtz equation. Our goal is to characterize the second order moments of the scaling limit of the fluctuations of the wavefield. We show that these moments are those of a random wavefield solution to a homogenized Helmholtz equation with a white noise source term and obtain expressions for its variance. Two factors contribute to the white noise: fluctuations in the inverse permittivity of the high contrast inhomogeneities, and fluctuations in their size. This problem is motivated by wave propagation in sea ice, which is a random compositive of ice and pockets of air and brine. The analysis hinges on three ingredients: a covariance formula due to Chatterjee for functions of independent random variables; small-volume expansions to quantify the fluctuations due to one inclusion; and the standard two-scale expansions for stochastic homogenization.</description>

      <title>Perturbations in PDE-constrained optimal control decay exponentially in space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For linear-quadratic optimal control problems (OCPs) governed by elliptic and parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs), we investigate the impact of perturbations on optimal solutions. Local perturbations may occur, e.g., due to discretization of the optimality system or disturbed problem data. Whereas these perturbations may exhibit global effects in the uncontrolled case, we prove that the ramifications are exponentially damped in space under stabilizability- and detectability-like conditions. To this end, we prove a bound on the optimality condition's solution operator that is uniform in the domain size. Then, this uniformity is used in a scaling argument to show the exponential decay of perturbations in space. We numerically validate and illustrate our results by solving OCPs involving Helmholtz, Poisson, and advection-diffusion-reaction equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study stability of abstract differential equations coupled by means of a general algebraic condition. Our approach is based on techniques from operator theory and systems theory, and it allows us to study coupled systems by exploiting properties of the components, which are typically much simpler to analyse. As our main results we establish resolvent estimates and decay rates for abstract boundary-coupled systems. We illustrate the power of the general results by using them to obtain rates of energy decay in coupled systems of one-dimensional wave and heat equations, and in a wave equation with an acoustic boundary condition.</description>

      <title>A data-driven approach to PDE-constrained optimization in inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse problems are ubiquitous in science and engineering. Many of these are naturally formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. These non-linear, large-scale, constrained optimization problems know many challenges, of which the inherent non-linearity of the problem is an important one. As an alternative to this physics-driven approach, data-driven methods have been proposed. These methods come with their own set of challenges, and it appears that, ideally, one would devise hybrid methods that combine the best of both worlds. In this paper, we propose one way of combining PDE-constrained optimization with recently proposed data-driven reduced-order models. Starting from an infinite-dimensional formulation of the inverse problem with discrete data, we propose a general framework for the analysis and discretisation of such problems. The proposed approach is based on a relaxed formulation of the PDE-constrained optimization problem, which reduces to a weighted non-linear least-squares problem. The weight matrix turns out to be the Gram matrix of solutions of the PDE, and it can be estimated directly from the measurements. We provide a number of representative case studies and numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of strongly interacting unstable two-solitons for generalized Korteweg-de Vries equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.06294</link>
      <description>arXiv:1802.06294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation $\partial_t u = -\partial_x(\partial_x^2 u + f(u))$, where $f(u)$ is an odd function of class $C^3$. Under some assumptions on $f$, this equation admits \emph{solitary waves}, that is solutions of the form $u(t, x) = Q_v(x - vt - x_0)$, for $v$ in some range $(0, v_*)$. We study pure two-solitons in the case of the same limit speed, in other words global solutions $u(t)$ such that \begin{equation} \label{eq:abstract} \tag{$\ast$} \lim_{t\to\infty}\|u(t) - (Q_v(\cdot - x_1(t)) \pm Q_v(\cdot - x_2(t)))\|_{H^1} = 0, \qquad \text{with}\quad\lim_{t \to \infty}x_2(t) - x_1(t) = \infty. \end{equation} Existence of such solutions is known for $f(u) = |u|^{p-1}u$ with $p \in \mathbb{Z} \setminus \{5\}$ and $p &gt; 2$. We describe the~dynamical behavior of any solution satisfying \eqref{eq:abstract} under the assumption that $Q_v$ is linearly unstable (which corresponds to $p &gt; 5$ for power nonlinearities). We prove that in this case the sign in \eqref{eq:abstract} is necessarily "$+$", which corresponds to an attractive interaction. We also prove that the~distance $x_2(t) - x_1(t)$ between the solitons equals $\frac{2}{\sqrt v}\log(\kappa t) + o(1)$ for some $\kappa = \kappa(v) &gt; 0$.</description>

      <title>Symmetric doubly periodic gravity-capillary waves with small vorticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.13093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct small amplitude gravity-capillary water waves with small nonzero vorticity, in three spatial dimensions, bifurcating from uniform flows. The waves are symmetric, and periodic in both horizontal coordinates. The proof is inspired by Lortz' construction of magnetohydrostatic equilibria in reflection-symmetric toroidal domains. It relies on a global representation of the vorticity as the cross product of two gradients, and on prescribing a functional relationship between the Bernoulli function and the orbital period of the water particles. The presence of the free surface introduces significant new challenges. In particular, the resulting free boundary problem is not elliptic, and the involved maps incur a loss of regularity under Fr\'echet differentiation. Nevertheless, we show that a version of the Crandall--Rabinowitz local bifurcation method applies, by carefully tracking the loss of regularity.</description>

      <title>On Some Mean Field Games and Master Equations through the lens of conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10360v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript we derive a new nonlinear transport equation written on the space of probability measures that allows to study a class of deterministic mean field games and master equations, where the interaction of the agents happens only at the terminal time. The point of view via this transport equation has two important consequences. First, this equation reveals a new monotonicity condition that is sufficient both for the uniqueness of MFG Nash equilibria and for the global in time well-posedness of master equations. Interestingly, this condition is in general in dichotomy with both the Lasry--Lions and displacement monotonicity conditions, studied so far in the literature. Second, in the absence of monotonicity, the conservative form of the transport equation can be used to define weak entropy solutions to the master equation. We construct several concrete examples to demonstrate that MFG Nash equilibria, whether or not they actually exist, may not be selected by the entropy solutions of the master equation.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notion of mean viability for controlled stochastic differential equations and establish counterparts of Nagumo's classical viability theorems (necessary and sufficient conditions for mean viability). As an application, we provide a purely probabilistic proof of a comparison principle and of existence for contingent and viscosity solutions of second-order fully nonlinear path-dependent Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. We do not use compactness and optimal stopping arguments, which are usually employed in the literature on viscosity solutions for second-order path-dependent PDEs.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical estimates for measure potentials on the real line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.17722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an explicit weighted estimate for the semiclassical Schr\"odinger operator $P = - h^2 \partial^2_x + V(x;h)$ on $L^2(\mathbb{R})$, with $V(x;h)$ a finite signed measure, and where $h &gt;0$ is the semiclassical parameter. The proof is a one dimensional instance of the spherical energy method, which has been used to prove Carleman estimates in higher dimensions and in more complicated geometries. The novelty of our result is that the potential need not be absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure. Two consequences of the weighted estimate are the absence of positive eigenvalues for $P$, and a limiting absorption resolvent estimate with sharp $h$-dependence. The resolvent estimate implies exponential time-decay of the local energy for solutions to the corresponding wave equation with a compactly supported measure potential, provided there are no negative eigenvalues and no zero resonance, and provided the initial data have compact support.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show results on propagation of anisotropic Gabor wave front sets for solutions to a class of evolution equations of Schr\"odinger type. The Hamiltonian is assumed to have a real-valued principal symbol with the anisotropic homogeneity $a(\lambda x, \lambda^\sigma \xi) = \lambda^{1+\sigma} a(x,\xi)$ for $\lambda &gt; 0$ where $\sigma &gt; 0$ is a rational anisotropy parameter. We prove that the propagator is continuous on anisotropic Shubin--Sobolev spaces. The main result says that the propagation of the anisotropic Gabor wave front set follows the Hamilton flow of the principal symbol.</description>

      <title>Approximate boundary controllability for parabolic equations with inverse square infinite potential wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider heat operators on a bounded domain $\Omega \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, with a critically singular potential diverging as the inverse square of the distance to $\partial \Omega$. While null boundary controllability for such operators was recently proved in all dimensions in arXiv:2112.04457, it crucially assumed (i) $\Omega$ was convex, (ii) the control must be prescribed along all of $\partial \Omega$, and (iii) the strength of the singular potential must be restricted to a particular subrange. In this article, we prove instead a definitive approximate boundary control result for these operators, in that we (i) do not assume convexity of $\Omega$, (ii) allow for the control to be localized near any $x_0 \in \partial \Omega$, and (iii) treat the full range of strength parameters for the singular potential. Morever, we lower the regularity required for $\partial \Omega$ and the lower-order coefficients. The key novelty is a local Carleman estimate near $x_0$, with a carefully chosen weight that takes into account both the appropriate boundary conditions and the local geometry of $\partial \Omega$.</description>

      <title>Uniform concentration property for Griffith almost-minimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that a Hausdorff limit of Griffith almost-minimizers, is still a Griffith almost-minimizer. For that purpose we present a new approach to the uniform concentration property of Dal Maso, Morel and Solimini which avoids the use of the coarea formula, not available for the symmetric gradient. We then obtain several applications, as for instance a general procedure to perform blow-up limits.</description>

      <title>Mathematical analysis of a mesoscale model for multiphase membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05069v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a mesoscale continuum model for membranes made of two different types of amphiphilic lipids. The model extends work by Peletier and the second author [Arch. Ration. Mech. Anal. 193, 2009] for the one-phase case. We present a mathematical analysis of the asymptotic reduction to the macroscale when a key length parameter becomes arbitrarily small. We identify two main contributions in the energy: one that can be connected to bending of the overall structure and a second that describes the cost of the internal phase separations. We prove the $\Gamma$-convergence towards a perimeter functional for the phase separation energy and construct, in two dimensions, recovery sequences for the convergence of the full energy towards a 2D reduction of the J\"ulicher-Lipowsky bending energy with a line tension contribution for phase separated hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Spectral inequalities for Schr\"odinger equations with various potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the spectral inequalities of Schr\"odinger operator in the whole space for different potentials, which can be power growth or continuously vanishing at infinity. The spectral inequalities quantitatively depend on the density of the sensor sets with positive measure, growth rate of the potentials and spectrum (or eigenvalues). One important component in the poof is the adaptation of propagation of smallness argument for gradients in \cite{LM18}. As an application, we apply the spectral inequalities to obtain quantitative observability inequalities for heat equations.</description>

      <title>Stochastic PDEs for large portfolios with general mean-reverting volatility processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05898</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.05898v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a structural stochastic volatility model for the loss from a large portfolio of credit risky assets. Both the asset value and the volatility processes are correlated through systemic Brownian motions, with default determined by the asset value reaching a lower boundary. We prove that if our volatility models are picked from a class of mean-reverting diffusions, the system converges as the portfolio becomes large and, when the vol-of-vol function satisfies certain regularity and boundedness conditions, the limit of the empirical measure process has a density given in terms of a solution to a stochastic initial-boundary value problem on a half-space. The problem is defined in a special weighted Sobolev space. Regularity results are established for solutions to this problem, and then we show that there exists a unique solution. In contrast to the CIR volatility setting covered by the existing literature, our results hold even when the systemic Brownian motions are taken to be correlated.</description>

      <title>Optimal finite element approximation of unique continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider finite element approximations of ill-posed elliptic problems with conditional stability. The notion of {\emph{optimal error estimates}} is defined including both convergence with respect to mesh parameter and perturbations in data. The rate of convergence is determined by the conditional stability of the underlying continuous problem and the polynomial order of the finite element approximation space. A proof is given that no finite element approximation can converge at a better rate than that given by the definition, justifying the concept. A recently introduced class of finite element methods with weakly consistent regularisation is recalled and the associated error estimates are shown to be quasi optimal in the sense of our definition.</description>
