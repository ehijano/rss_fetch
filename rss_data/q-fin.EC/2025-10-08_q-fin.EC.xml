      <title>Distributional welfare impacts and compensatory transit strategies under NYC congestion pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early evaluations of NYC's congestion pricing program indicate overall improvements in vehicle speed and transit ridership. However, its distributional impacts remain understudied, as does the design of compensatory transit strategies to mitigate potential welfare losses. This study identifies population segments and regions most affected by congestion pricing, and evaluates how welfare losses can be compensated through transit improvements. We estimate joint mode and destination models using aggregated synthetic trips in New York and New Jersey and calibrate toll-related parameters with traffic counts reported by the MTA. The results show that the program leads to an accessibility-related welfare loss of approximately $240 million per year, which is considerably lower than the gains from toll revenues: the gross revenue estimated by our models ($1.077 billion per year) and the net revenue projected by the MTA ($450 million per year). However, these benefits gains conceal significant disparities. Welfare losses are concentrated in Upper Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Hudson County, NJ, particularly among travelers less able to shift to transit or alternative destinations. For NYC residents, compensating aggregate welfare loss requires a 0.48-minute reduction in transit wait time or a $135.59 million annual fare subsidy. Ensuring accessibility gains for all populations and counties (Pareto improving) requires a 1-2 minute reduction in wait time combined with an annual subsidy of about $100-300 million. For New Jersey residents, achieving aggregate welfare gains primarily through fare discounts (requiring $108.53 million per year) is more feasible and efficient; however, uniform discounts should be replaced by targeted mechanisms such as origin-based fare reductions or commuter pass bundles.</description>

      <title>When Machines Meet Each Other: Network Effects and the Strategic Role of History in Multi-Agent AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) enters the agentic era, large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as autonomous agents that interact with one another rather than operate in isolation. This shift raises a fundamental question: how do machine agents behave in interdependent environments where outcomes depend not only on their own choices but also on the coordinated expectations of peers? To address this question, we study LLM agents in a canonical network-effect game, where economic theory predicts convergence to a fulfilled expectation equilibrium (FEE). We design an experimental framework in which 50 heterogeneous GPT-5-based agents repeatedly interact under systematically varied network-effect strengths, price trajectories, and decision-history lengths. The results reveal that LLM agents systematically diverge from FEE: they underestimate participation at low prices, overestimate at high prices, and sustain persistent dispersion. Crucially, the way history is structured emerges as a design lever. Simple monotonic histories-where past outcomes follow a steady upward or downward trend-help stabilize coordination, whereas nonmonotonic histories amplify divergence and path dependence. Regression analyses at the individual level further show that price is the dominant driver of deviation, history moderates this effect, and network effects amplify contextual distortions. Together, these findings advance machine behavior research by providing the first systematic evidence on multi-agent AI systems under network effects and offer guidance for configuring such systems in practice.</description>

      <title>The importance of emotional intelligence in leadership for building an effective team</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the significance of emotional intelligence (EI) as a fundamental component of effective leadership and its impact on building cohesive, motivated, and high-performing teams. Drawing on data from a survey of 100 professionals, the research examines how EI competencies including self-awareness, self-regulation, empathy, and social skills shape leadership effectiveness, team collaboration, conflict resolution, and workplace motivation. The results demonstrate strong correlations between EI and key leadership traits such as empathy, ethical conduct, social competence, and motivational effectiveness. Leaders with higher levels of EI are perceived as more empathetic, ethical, and capable of fostering trust, resolving conflicts, and inspiring commitment, thereby improving team dynamics and overall organizational performance. The study also highlights that ethical leadership significantly enhances motivation and that social competence is essential for engaging and aligning teams toward common goals. While the findings are exploratory due to the limited sample size, they provide valuable insights for leadership development programs, emphasizing the importance of integrating EI-focused training, coaching, and assessment tools into organizational strategies. The research contributes to leadership theory by demonstrating that emotional intelligence is not an isolated skill but a central driver of interpersonal effectiveness, employee engagement, and sustainable business success.</description>

      <title>The role of communication in effective business management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the impact of internal communication on effective business management through a comparative analysis of two medium-sized car rental companies operating in Poland. Using a structured survey completed by 220 employees, the study evaluates 15 communication-related factors, including feedback culture, managerial accessibility, message clarity, and interdepartmental coordination. The findings indicate that Company X significantly outperforms Company Y across all evaluated dimensions, largely due to its use of advanced communication technologies, participatory models, and clear feedback mechanisms. The research highlights the strategic role of two-way communication in fostering employee engagement, organizational transparency, and operational efficiency. It contributes to the field by offering a rare, data-driven comparison within one industry and supports existing models that link internal communication to job satisfaction and motivation. Limitations include reliance on self-reported data and focus on a single industry and country. Future studies are recommended to explore cross-sector and longitudinal perspectives, especially in the context of digital and hybrid work environments.</description>

      <title>Optimal bidding in multiperiod day-ahead electricity markets assuming non-uniform uncertainty of clearing prices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a recent publication, using a simple two-period model, which is already capable to capture essential non-convex multiperiod bids, Richstein et al. have shown that in the case of optimal bidding, multi-part bidding always ensures a higher expected profit for the bidder, compared to simple bidding and block-bidding. The model proposed in their analysis assumes a uniform distribution of the market-clearing prices in both periods. In this paper, we study how the conclusions of the analysis are affected, if a very simple, symmetric, stepwise-constant but non-uniform distribution is assumed in the case of the market-clearing price. We show that the results of Richstein et al. also hold in this case.</description>

      <title>Exchange for Growth: Currency Dynamics in Emerging Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currency crises are frequently discussed retrospectively as a necessary and deterministic outcome of a finite sequence of fiscal decisions, monetary manoeuvres, and limited exogenous inputs. Parallelly, the Twin Deficits Hypothesis (TDH) posits that an increase in the budget deficit leads to a direct rise in the current account deficit; although analogous to the idea of currency crises being the outcome of finite inputs (through a balance of payments crisis here), this notion runs contrary to the conclusion that independent intervention can have bearing on the expression of a currency crisis.
  Since its introduction by Mundell and Fleming in 1960, the TDH has sparked considerable academic debate regarding its validity. Given its assumption of a stable private savings gap, and conflicting empirical evidence, we believe there are novel insights to be gained from a more nuanced approach incorporating theoretical frameworks from contemporary Monetary Economics in order to reconcile criticisms of the TDH with the basis for its broad applicability.
  The results from this paper thus investigate the link - or lack thereof - between real economic factors, which can support the assessment of fiscal policy autonomy, and thereby a government's ability, to meet domestic policy objectives without compromising trade policy autonomy and current account sustainability.</description>

      <title>Analysis of managerial behaviors in business management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.07047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores how different managerial behaviors influence team effectiveness and organizational outcomes, using Kenneth Blanchard's situational leadership model as a diagnostic tool. Conducted across ten companies, the research evaluates leadership adaptability through a scenario-based questionnaire identifying instructional, teaching, supportive, and delegating styles. Results show that the supportive (affiliative) style is dominant, present in 60 percent of surveyed companies, with delegating being second. Correlation analysis reveals strong negative relationships between certain styles, particularly instructional and supportive, indicating that flexibility in leadership is crucial. The findings suggest that over-reliance on any one style may lead to inefficiencies, while a balanced, situational approach enhances decision-making, morale, and adaptability. The research contributes to leadership theory by demonstrating how behavioral combinations, not static traits, influence outcomes. It offers practical implications for managerial training, recommending the integration of diagnostic tools like the Blanchard test to improve style awareness and behavioral flexibility. Limitations include reliance on self-assessment data and a small sample size. Future research should explore longitudinal and cross-industry analyses to assess how leadership behaviors evolve over time or under pressure.</description>

      <title>Inducing State Anxiety in LLM Agents Reproduces Human-Like Biases in Consumer Decision-Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from text generators to autonomous agents, raising urgent questions about their reliability in real-world contexts. Stress and anxiety are well known to bias human decision-making, particularly in consumer choices. Here, we tested whether LLM agents exhibit analogous vulnerabilities. Three advanced models (ChatGPT-5, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3.5-Sonnet) performed a grocery shopping task under budget constraints (24, 54, 108 USD), before and after exposure to anxiety-inducing traumatic narratives. Across 2,250 runs, traumatic prompts consistently reduced the nutritional quality of shopping baskets (Change in Basket Health Scores of -0.081 to -0.126; all pFDR&lt;0.001; Cohens d=-1.07 to -2.05), robust across models and budgets. These results show that psychological context can systematically alter not only what LLMs generate but also the actions they perform. By reproducing human-like emotional biases in consumer behavior, LLM agents reveal a new class of vulnerabilities with implications for digital health, consumer safety, and ethical AI deployment.</description>

      <title>Economic Entropy and Sectoral Dynamics: A Thermodynamic Approach to Market Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an application of geometrothermodynamics (GTD) to the economic analysis of Bogot\'a's sports sector through the Satellite Account of Sport (CSDB). By establishing an analogy between thermodynamic systems and economic structures, we develop a mathematical framework where monetary flows behave analogously to energy, while economic entropy, temperature, and heat capacity acquire well-defined economic interpretations. The study focuses on two contrasting sectors: gambling and betting $\mathbb{S}_{15}$, and recreational and sports activities $\mathbb{S}_{16}$, analyzing data from 2018-2023. Our results demonstrate that $\mathbb{S}_{15}$ exhibits lower economic entropy than $\mathbb{S}_{16}$ , indicating a higher degree of organization and regulatory structure in the gambling sector compared to the more heterogeneous recreational sports sector. The heat capacity function reveals critical points that may signal phase transitions in economic dynamics, while Ricci and Kretschmann curvature scalars identify potential crisis points in the sectoral organization. Furthermore, the cross-income elasticity analysis shows distinct resource flow patterns between sectors, suggesting that gambling activities may serve as an economic driver for recreational sports. This thermodynamic approach provides a quantitative tool for analyzing resource redistribution policies and anticipating critical transitions in sectoral economics. The findings suggest that econophysics and statistical thermodynamics constitute powerful frameworks for understanding the sectoral dynamics of Bogot\'a's sports economy, with significant potential for developing prospective analysis tools in public policy design.</description>

      <title>Paradoxes of the public sector productivity measurement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper critically investigates standard total factor productivity (TFP) measurement in the public sector, where output information is often incomplete or distorted. The analysis reveals fundamental paradoxes under three common output measurement conventions. When cost-based value added is used as the aggregate output, measured TFP may paradoxically decline as a result of genuine productivity-enhancing changes such as technical progress and improved allocative and scale efficiencies, as well as reductions in real input prices. We show that the same problems carry over to the situation where the aggregate output is constructed as the cost-share weighted index of outputs. In the case of distorted output prices, measured TFP may move independently of any productivity changes and instead reflect shifts in pricing mechanisms. Using empirical illustrations from the United Kingdom and Finland, we demonstrate that such distortions are not merely theoretical but are embedded in widely used public productivity statistics. We argue that public sector TFP measurement requires a shift away from cost-based aggregation of outputs and toward non-market valuation methods grounded in economic theory.</description>
