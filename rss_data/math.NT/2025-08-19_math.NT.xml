      <title>Galois cohomology of elliptic curves over anticyclotomic extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and $p$ be an odd prime number. Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve with good ordinary reduction at $p$. We study the Iwasawa theory of $E$ over the anticyclotomic $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$ by adopting a unifying framework. We also study the Galois cohomology of the dual Selmer group of $E$ over the unique $\mathbb{Z}_p^2$-extension of $K$ as well as over the anticyclotomic extension of $K$.</description>

      <title>Metric Theory for Continued Fractions with Multiple Large Partial Quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of large partial quotients can invalidate many classical limit theorems in the metric theory of continued fractions. A commonly employed strategy to overcome this problem is to discard the largest partial quotient when formulating variant forms of such theorems. However, this method will fail when dealing with at least two large partial quotients. Motivated by recent work of Tan, Tian, and Wang [Sci. China Math., 2023], we investigate the metric theory of real numbers that contain at least $r$ large partial quotients among the first $n$ terms of their continued fraction expansions. Specifically, let $[a_1(x), a_2(x), \ldots ]$ be the continued fraction expansion of a real number $x \in [0, 1)$. We determine the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff dimension of the following set: \[ F(r, \psi)=\Big\{ x \in [0,1): \exists 1 \leq k_1&lt; \cdots &lt; k_r \leq n, a_{k_i} (x) \geq \psi(n)~(i=1, \ldots, r)\ \text{for i.m.}~n \in \mathbb{N} \Big\}, \] where `i.m.' stands for `infinitely many', $r \geq 1$ and $\psi$ is a positive function defined on $\mathbb{N}$.</description>

Abstract: This paper re-organizes Vojta's proof of the Mordell conjecture (i.e. Faltings' theorem) in terms of Arakelov geometry. A new ingredient is to replace an application of Gillet--Soule's arithmetic Riemannn--Roch theorem by that of Yuan's arithmetic Siu inequality.</description>

      <title>Semiconjugacy and Self-Similar Subgroups of pfIMGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The profinite iterated monodromy group (pfIMG) is a self-similar group associated to dynamical systems. We show that its proper open self-similar subgroups correspond to highly rigid semiconjugacies, which we partly classify in general. For polynomials, we show that only the twisted Chebyshev maps can arise. Next, we define and construct self-similar closures of subgroups of pfIMGs, and show that this preserves many group-theoretic properties of the original subgroup. As a consequence, we conclude that pfIMGs with open subgroups satisfying certain properties (e.g. prosolvable or pronilpotent) either satisfy that property themselves, or arise from one of these exceptional semiconjugacies.
  This is applied to answer some questions posed in [BGJT25] about open Frattini subgroups of pfIMGs: unicritical polynomials of composite degree do not have an open Frattini subgroup, and a polynomial with an open Frattini subgroup is often pro-\(p\).</description>

      <title>On the Algebraic Independence of a Set of Generalized Constants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neither the Euler-Mascheroni constant, \gamma=0.577215\ldots , nor the Euler-Gompertz constant, \delta=0.596347\ldots , is currently known to be irrational. However, it has been proved that these two numbers are disjunctively transcendental; that is, at least one of them must be transcendental. The two constants are related through a well-known equation of Hardy, which recently has been generalized to a pair of infinite sequences (\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\delta^{\left(n\right)}) based on moments of the Gumbel(0,1) probability distribution. In the present work, we demonstrate the algebraic independence of the set \{\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)}\}_{n\geq0}, and thus the transcendence of \tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}+\gamma^{\left(n\right)} for all n\geq0. This further implies the disjunctive-transcendence of each pair (\gamma^{\left(n\right)},\tfrac{\delta^{\left(n\right)}}{e}).</description>

      <title>Additive congruences with factorials modulo a prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a large prime number. We prove that any integer $\lambda$ modulo $p$ can be represented in the form $$ m!n! +\sum_{i=1}^{47}n_i!\equiv \lambda \pmod p, $$ with $\max\{m,n,n_1,\ldots,n_{47}\}\ll p^{1300/1301}.$ This improves the exponent $1350/1351$ of Garaev, Luca and Shparlinski (2005). Furthermore, we prove that any integer $\lambda$ can be represented in the form $$ m_1!n_1! +m_2!n_2!+m_3!n_3! +m_4!n_4!+m_5!n_5! \equiv \lambda \pmod p $$ with $\max\{m_1,n_1,\ldots,m_5,n_5\}\le p^{97/113 +o(1)}.$ This improves the exponent $27/28$ of Garaev and Garcia (2007). The proofs of these two results are based on the recent work of Grebennikov, Sagdeev, Semchankau and Vasilevskii (2024).
  We also obtain some lower bound estimates on the cardinality of the product set of two factorials modulo a prime. For instance, we prove that if $0&lt;c&lt;3/20,$ then for $N=[p^{1/2 + c}]$ we have $$ \#\{m!n!\pmod p; \, 1\le m,n\le N\}\gg p^{1/2+2c/3-o(1)}. $$ The proof of this result is based on the work of Banks and Shparlinski (2020) and the work of Katz and Shen (2008) related to the Ruzsa-Pl\"unnecke inequality from additive combinatorics.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an irrational $\alpha\in \mathbb{R}$, we consider additive problems with the set of primes satisfying $\lVert\alpha p\rVert\leq \frac{1}{p^\tau}$ for some fixed $\tau&gt;0$. In particular, we show that there exist infinitely many non-trivial three-term arithmetic progressions in the set of primes satisfying $\lVert \alpha p\rVert\leq \frac{1}{p^\tau}$ for $\tau\in(0, \tfrac18)$. We also consider a binary Goldbach-type problem.</description>

      <title>An Explicit Cohen-Style Threefield Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1988, Andrews, Dyson, and Hickerson showed that a $q$-series $\sigma$ found in Ramanujan's lost notebook and related to partitions could be interpreted as counting ideals in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$, and found similar formulas for $\sigma$ in terms of ideals of $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})$. Cohen followed this by showing more generally that for certain triples of quadratic fields, there is abelian extension and conductor so that the ray class character theta series for all three fields coincide. In the intervening years, several $q$-series counting ideals in quadratic fields have been explored, nearly all relating to the fields explored by Andrews et al. In this paper we give an example of a ray class character theta series which stems from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-6})$, $\mathbb{Q}(i)$, and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{6})$. We use recent work of Okano to give explicit formulas via quadratic form theta series with congruence conditions stemming from each field. We isolate an analogue of $\sigma$ for this series and show that it has coefficients also given by a partition generating function.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the conditional large values of the quadratic Dirichlet $L$-functions near the central point $s=1/2$. When $\sigma $ closes to $1/2$ within a suitable range, we show that $L(\sigma, \chi_d)$ have the conditional large values of the similar order of magnitude as $L(1/2, \chi_d)$.</description>

      <title>On balancing and Lucas-balancing numbers expressible as product of two $k$-Fibonacci numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A positive integer $n$ is called a balancing number if there exists a positive integer $r$ such that $1 + 2 + \cdots + (n-1) = (n+1) + (n+2) + \cdots + (n+r)$. The corresponding value $r$ is known as the balancer of $n$. If $n$ is a balancing number, then $8n^{2}+1$ is a perfect square, and its positive square root is called a Lucas-balancing number. For any integer $k \geq 2$, let $\{F_{n}^{(k)} \}_{n \geq -(k-2)}$ denote $k$-generalized Fibonacci sequence which starts with $0, \dots ,1$($k$ terms) where each next term is the sum of the $k$ preceding terms. In this paper, we investigate all balancing and Lucas-balancing numbers that can be expressed as the product of two $k$-generalized Fibonacci numbers.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the reduction type and related invariants of curves in families of curves over a discretely valued field. By a family, we will mean a set of curves obtained by perturbing the coefficients of the defining equations. We will show that the reduction type in these families is locally constant in the topology induced by the valuation. We also derive local constancy results for some related invariants, such as the Tamagawa number, the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer 'fudge factor' and the Galois representation.</description>

      <title>On the analytic rank of the twin prime elliptic curve $y^2=x(x-2)(x-p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p\geq 7$ and suppose $(p,p-2)$ are twin prime numbers, in [Hatley, 2009], the elliptic curve $E_p:y^2=x(x-2)(x-p)$ was considered in the context of a conjecture by Jason Beers about the Mordell-Weil ranks of $E_p/\mathbb{Q}$. I show that for $p\equiv 3,5\bmod 8$, the analytic rank of $E_p$ is at least one (Theorem 1.1.2) in line with Beers' predictions. This is done by finding a formula (Theorem 4.1.1) for the global root number of $E_p$ for all twin prime pairs. I also show that Beers' conjecture, that for $p\equiv 1\bmod 8$ the rank of $E_p$ is two, is false as stated because $E_{73}$ has rank zero. In the light of Theorem 4.1.1, Beers' conjecture needs to be modified: if $p\equiv 1\bmod 8$ then the rank of $E_p$ is zero or two (Conjecture 5.3.1).</description>

Abstract: A formula connecting a moment of L-functions and a dual moment in a way that interchanges the roles of certain key parameters on both sides is known as a reciprocity relation. We establish a reciprocity relation for a first moment of GL(2) L-functions twisted by Dirichlet characters. This extends, via a new and simple argument, some results of Bettin, Drappeau, and Nordentoft.</description>

      <title>Some New Modular Rank Four Nahm Sums as Lift-dual of Rank Three Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find nine new sets of rank four Nahm sums associated with nine different numeric matrices which are likely to be modular. They are discovered by applying the lift-dual operation to some modular rank three Nahm sums in the works of Zagier and the authors. We prove the modularity of four sets of these Nahm sums by establishing Rogers--Ramanujan type identities which express them as modular infinite products. We use various $q$-series techniques including the constant term method and Bailey pairs to prove these identities. Meanwhile, we present some conjectural identities expressing several Nahm sums as modular infinite products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double descent is a method to construct automorphic representations of classical groups. For given A-parameter $\psi$ with certain good properties, double descent constructs a space of functions orthogonal to any cuspidal representation whose A-parameter is not $\psi$ and not orthogonal to any cuspidal representation with A-parameter $\psi$. In this paper, we show that functions constructed by double descent are always square-integrable.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the values of multiple zeta functions (MZFs) at non-positive integers can be expressed by Bernoulli numbers. This paper gives explicit formulas for the values of MZFs and multiple zeta star functions (MZSFs) at non-positive integers using Stirling polynomials. We also study the following two points: a connection between MZFs and MZSFs at non-positive integers and a connection between reverse values and generalized Gregory coefficients studied by Matsusaka, Murahara, and Onozuka.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Eichler criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove an Eichler-type criterion for symplectic lattices which determines in a simple way when two primitive vectors are equivalent under a canonical congruence subgroup of the symplectic group. This is supplemented by another, related criterion which determines when a given primitive vector is splitting. Both criteria use the discriminant groups.</description>

      <title>On the distribution of the total number of generators of $h$-free and $h$-full elements in an abelian monoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be an element of an abelian monoid, with $\Omega(\mathfrak{m})$ denoting the total number of prime elements generating $\mathfrak{m}$. We study the moments of $\Omega(\mathfrak{m})$ over subsets of $h$-free and $h$-full elements, establishing the normal order of $\Omega(\mathfrak{m})$ within these subsets. This work continues the study on the distribution of generalized arithmetic functions over $h$-free and $h$-full elements in abelian monoids as introduced in the authors' previous work.</description>

Abstract: For any positive integers $s$ and $t$, let $Q_{t}^{s}(n)$ denotes the number of partitions of a positive integer $n$ into distinct parts such that no part is congruent to $s$ or $t-s$ modulo $t$. We prove some Ramanujan-type congruences for $Q_{t}^{s}(n)$ for some particular values of $s$ and $t$ by employing $q$-series and theta function identities.</description>

      <title>On the limiting distribution of sums of random multiplicative functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the limiting distribution of $\frac{{(\log \log x)}^{1/4}}{\sqrt{x}} \sum_{n\le x}\alpha(n)$ where $\alpha$ is a Steinhaus random multiplicative function, answering a question of Harper. The distributional convergence is proved by applying the martingale central limit theorem to a suitably truncated sum. This truncation is inspired by work of Najnudel, Paquette, Simm and Vu on subcritical holomorphic multiplicative chaos setting, but analysed with a different conditioning argument generalised from Harper's work on fractional moments to circumvent integrability issues at criticality.
  A significant part of the proof is devoted to the convergence in probability of the associated partial Euler product to a critical multiplicative chaos measure, independent of the mild shift away from the critical line. Our approach to the universality of critical non-Gaussian multiplicative chaos bypasses the barrier analysis with the help of a modified second moment method, and employs a novel argument based on coupling and homogenisation by change of measure, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Descent theory (a modern formulation of Fermat's classical method of infinite descent) is a powerful tool in arithmetic geometry. In this  article, we reinterpret descent theory through the lens of quotient stacks  and apply it in the setting where it first arose: the Diophantine study of  generalized Fermat equations
  (1)   \[  Ax^a + By^b + Cz^c = 0.  \] 
  We focus on understanding the arithmetic of the stacks that arise from the study of primitive integral solutions to general Fermat equations, rather than on solving any particular instance of the equation.</description>

      <title>A triple convolution sum of the divisor function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the triple convolution sum of the divisor function given by $$\sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n-h)d(n+h)$$ for $h\neq 0$ and $d(n)$ denotes the number of positive divisors of $n$. Based on algebraic and geometric considerations, Browning conjectured that the above sum is asymptotic to $c_hx(\log x)^3$, for a suitable constant $c_h\neq 0$, as $x\to \infty$. This conjecture is still unproved. The purpose of this paper is two-fold. First, we show that there are positive constants $A,B$ such that $$Ax(\log x)^3 \leq \sum_{n\leq x} d(n)d(n-h)d(n+h) \leq Bx(\log x)^3,$$ as $x\to \infty$. Second, we provide theoretical basis for Browning's conjectured constant $c_h$ emanating from the theory of Dirichlet series of several complex variables.</description>

      <title>Counting primitive integral solutions to spherical generalized Fermat equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solution $(x,y,z) \in \mathbb{Z}^3-\{(0,0,0)\}$ to a generalized Fermat equation \[
  Ax^a + By^b + Cz^c = 0, \] is called \emph{primitive} if $\gcd(x,y,z) = 1$. By work of Beukers, we know that in the \emph{spherical} regime (that is, when the Euler characteristic $\chi = \tfrac{1}{a} + \tfrac{1}{b} + \tfrac{1}{c} - 1$ is positive), if the equation has one primitive solution, then it has infinitely many. In this work, we use the method of \emph{Fermat descent}, as employed by Poonen--Schaefer--Stoll, to refine Beukers' result to an asymptotic count of the number of primitive integral solutions of bounded height.</description>

      <title>The maximum size of sumsets in finite cyclic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a nonempty finite subset of an additive abelian group $G$. Given a nonnegative integer $h$, the $h$-fold sumset $hA$ is the set of all sums of $h$ elements of $A$, and the restricted $h$-fold sumset $h^\wedge A$ is the set of all sums of $h$ distinct elements of $A$. The union of restricted sumsets $s^\wedge A$, where $s=0, 1, \ldots, h$, is denoted by $[0, h]^\wedge A$. For fixed positive integers $m$ and $h$, the maximum size of the sumset $hA$ of a set $A \subseteq G$ with $m$ elements is denoted by $\nu(G, m, h)$. In other words, $\nu(G, m, h) = \max\{|hA| : A \subseteq G, |A|= m\}$. Analogous quantities can be defined for the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$. Optimal upper bounds are known for these quantities. If $G$ is a finite cyclic group of order $n$, then each of these quantities agrees with the optimal upper bound, except in many cases. Bajnok posed the problem of determining all positive integers $n$, $m$, and $h$ for which the value of the function $f(n, m, h)$ is strictly less than the optimal upper bound. He posed similar problems for quantities related to the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$. We prove that, for any positive integer $h$, there are infinitely many positive integers $m$ and $n$ such that $\nu(\mathbb{Z}_n, m, h)$ is strictly less than the optimal upper bound. We also prove similar results for quantities related to the sumsets $h^\wedge A$ and $[0, h]^\wedge A$ also. These results provide the partial solutions to the problems posed by Bajnok.</description>

      <title>Cassini-Catalan Determinants via Ramanujan's Theta Identity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11877v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the classical Cassini and Catalan identities for Fibonacci numbers arise naturally from a single quadratic theta-function identity of Ramanujan. Expanding the identity $\psi(q)\psi(q^{3})=\psi(q^{4})\varphi(q^{6})+q\,\varphi(q^{2})\psi(q^{12})$ via the Jacobi triple product and equating coefficients yields the unified $q$-determinant $F_{n+r}(q)F_{n-r}(q)-F_{n}(q)^{2}=(-q)^{\,n-r}F_{r}(q)^{2}$, $n\ge r\ge 1$, where $\psi(q)$ and $\varphi(q)$ are Ramanujan's theta functions with $q$ a complex parameter in the unit disc $(\lvert q \rvert &lt; 1)$ and $F_n(q)$ denotes the Carlitz $q$-Fibonacci polynomials. The radial limit $q\to1^{-}$ recovers Cassini's formula ($r=1$) and Catalan's one-parameter extension, while the same derivation with an auxiliary weight produces new partition-refined versions. The argument uses only standard $q$-series algebra (triple-product expansions, $q$-Pochhammer cancellations, and coefficient extraction), providing a transparent modular explanation of the alternating sign $(-1)^{\,n-r}$ in Catalan's identity through the level-6 provenance of $\varphi$ and $\psi$. Beyond unifying Cassini\textendash Catalan in a single framework, the method lifts seamlessly to higher-order recurrences, giving a template for Tribonacci-type determinants and suggesting congruence phenomena obtained from modular dissections and root-of-unity limits. The results place familiar Fibonacci determinants within Ramanujan's analytic landscape, indicate routes to combinatorial bijections that mirror the analytic cancellations, and connect with themes in modern $q$-series\textemdash ranging from colored partition identities to quantum-modular and exactly solvable models\textemdash thereby highlighting both the explanatory power and the ongoing relevance of Ramanujan's theta identities.</description>

      <title>Higher and extended Jacobi polynomials for codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Jacobi polynomial generalizations of several classical invariants in coding theory over finite fields, specifically, the higher and extended weight enumerators, and we establish explicit correspondences between the resulting Jacobi polynomials. Moreover, we present the Jacobi analogue of MacWilliams identity for both higher and extended weight enumerators. We also present that the higher Jacobi polynomials for linear codes whose subcode supports form $t$-designs can be uniquely determined from the higher weight enumerators of the codes via polarization technique. Finally, we demonstrate how higher Jacobi polynomials can be computed from harmonic higher weight enumerators with the help of Hahn polynomials.</description>

      <title>On the compatibility of the Betti harmonic coproduct with cyclotomic filtrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, the second author introduced a Betti counterpart of $N$-cyclotomic double shuffle theory for any $N \geq 1$. The construction is based on the group algebra of the free group $F_2$, endowed with a filtration relative to a morphism $F_2 \to \mu_N$ (where $\mu_N$ is the group of $N$-th roots of unity). One of the main results therein is the construction of a complete Hopf algebra coproduct $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$ on the relative completion of a specific subalgebra $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ of the group algebra of $F_2$. However, an explicit formula for this coproduct is missing. In this paper, we show that the discrete Betti harmonic coproduct $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ defined in \cite{EF1} for the classical case ($N=1$) by the first author and Furusho remains compatible with the filtration structure on $\mathcal{W}^\mathrm{B}$ induced by the relative completion for arbitrary $N$. This compatibility suggests that the completion corresponding to $\Delta^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}$ is a candidate for an explicit realization of $\widehat{\Delta}^{\mathcal{W}, \mathrm{B}}_N$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I consider the class of surfaces $X$ over algebraically closed fields with numerical invariants given in the title. In characteristic zero, this class contains fake projective planes which were introduced by David Mumford. I prove that in characteristic $p&gt;0$ such surfaces are Hodge-Witt and also ordinary under additional assumptions. In particular, fake projective planes are Hodge-Witt (Theorem 3.1). I show that if $X$ is Frobenius split then $X\simeq \mathbb{P}^2$ (Theorem 4.1). I also establish a characteristic free characterization of the projective plane using the Nori fundamental group scheme (Theorem 5.1). Finally, I show that any fake projective plane over a number field has good ordinary reduction at all but finitely many primes and in particular fake projective planes exist in positive characteristics (Theorem 6.1).</description>

      <title>Log-concavity of rows of triangular arrays satisfying a certain super-recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recurrences of the form \begin{equation*}
  T(n,k) = (\alpha n+\beta k +\gamma) \ T(n-1,k) + (\alpha'n+\beta'k+\gamma')\ T(n-1,k-1)+\delta_{n,0}\delta_{k,0}. \end{equation*} show up as the recurrence for many well-studied combinatorial sequences such as the Stirling numbers of first and second kind, the Lah numbers, Eulerian numbers etc. Recently, many of these sequences have received generalisations that obey a recurrence of the form \begin{equation*}
  T(n,k) = (\alpha n+\beta k +\gamma)^l \ T(n-1,k) + (\alpha'n+\beta'k+\gamma')^l\ T(n-1,k-1)+\delta_{n,0}\delta_{k,0}. \end{equation*} where $l$ is a positive integer. Many of these generalised sequences also satisfy properties such as unimodality, log-concavity, gamma-nonnegativity, real-rootedness that the original sequences satisfy. In this article, we give sufficient conditions for rows of triangular arrays, arising from the recurrence stated above, to be log-concave. We show that our sufficient condition is satisfied by many of the classical examples, thereby giving a new unified approach to proving their log-concavity. This sufficient condition also confirms a conjecture of Tankosic about the log-concavity of generalised Lah numbers.
  Our main technique will be to interpret the triangular array $(T(n,k))$ as weighted lattice paths and produce an injection that is increasing in weight. Finally, we introduce a two-parameter generalisation of the Eulerian numbers analogous to the generalised Stirling and Lah counterparts. We prove that this sequence is palindromic and make some remarks about their gamma-nonnegativity and real-rootedness.</description>

Abstract: We construct Gaussian test functions for the general linear side of the Jacquet-Rallis relative trace formula comparison. These are functions which are defined in terms of their orbital integrals and transfer to the compact unitary group. Our construction relies on the formalism of Kudla-Millson and simple geometric properties of symmetric spaces. In particular, it also provides an explicit formula in terms of the Howe operator.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for a dynamical system on an algebraic variety over $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$ generated by finitely many unramified endomorphisms, it is decidable whether a given point has a finite orbit. This is achieved by establishing an effective upper bound for the size of finite orbits in integral algebraic dynamical systems with unramified morphisms.</description>

      <title>Iwasawa Theory for GU(2,1) at inert primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many problems of arithmetic nature rely on the computation or analysis of values of $L$-functions attached to objects from geometry. Whilst basic analytic properties of the $L$-functions can be difficult to understand, recent research programs have shown that automorphic $L$-values are susceptible to study via algebraic methods linking them to Selmer groups. Iwasawa theory, pioneered first by Iwasawa in the 1960s and later Mazur and Wiles provides an algebraic recipe to obtain a $p$-adic analogue of the $L$-function. In this work we aim to adapt Iwasawa theory to a new context of representations of the unitary group GU(2,1) at primes inert in the respective imaginary quadratic field. This requires a novel approach using the Schneider--Venjakob regulator map, working over locally analytic distribution algebras. Subsequently, we show vanishing of some Bloch--Kato Selmer groups when a certain $p$-adic distribution is non-vanishing. These results verify cases of the Bloch--Kato conjecture for GU(2,1) at inert primes in rank 0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide new, elementary proofs that Robin's inequality and the Lagarias inequality hold for almost every number, including all numbers not divisible by one of the prime numbers $2$, $3$, $5$; all primorials; given $k$ a natural number, all sufficiently large numbers of the form $2^kn$ for $n\ge1$ odd; and all $21$-free integers. Additionally, we prove that the Kaneko-Lagarias inequality holds for all natural numbers if and only if it holds for all superabundant numbers.</description>

      <title>Metric theory of inhomogeneous Diophantine approximations with a fixed matrix</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a metric theory of inhomogeneous Diophantine approximation for the case of a fixed matrix. We use transference principle to connect uniform Diophantine properties of a pair $(\Theta, \pmb{\eta})$ of a matrix and a vector with the asymptotic Diophantine properties of the transposed matrix $\Theta^{\top}$, and vice versa, the asymptotic Diophantine properties of a pair $(\Theta, \pmb{\eta})$ with asymptotic Diophantine properties of the transposed matrix. In these setups, we prove analogues of classical statements of metrical homogeneous Diophantine approximations and answer some open questions that were raised in recent works.</description>

Abstract: The objective of this paper is to study the anabelian object referred to as \emph{pointed virtual curves}. Namely, given a family of curves $Y \rightarrow X$ over a field $k$ under suitable conditions, we consider the fundamental-group-theoretic pullback of a Galois section $G_{k} \rightarrow \Pi_{X}$. We show that, in various aspects, such pullbacks exhibit anabelian properties analogous to those of the fundamental group of a curve over $k$.</description>

      <title>On Nathanson's Triangular Number Phenomenon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a finite set $A\subseteq \mathbb{Z}$, the $h$-fold sumset is $hA :=\{x_1+\dots+x_h:x_i\in A\}$. We interpret the beginning of the sequence of sumset sizes $(|hA|)_{h=1}^\infty$ in terms of the successive $L^1$-minima of a lattice (specifically, the points in $\mathbb{Z}^{|A|}$ whose coordinates sum to 0 and which are perpendicular to $\langle a_1,\dots,a_{|A|}\rangle$). In particular, if $h_1,h_2$ are the first and second minima, and $1\le h&lt;h_1$, then $|hA|=\binom{h+|A|-1}{|A|-1}$, while if $h_1\le h &lt;h_2$, then $|hA|=\binom{h+|A|-1}{|A|-1}-\binom{h-h_1+|A|-1}{|A|-1}$. This explains the appearance of triangular numbers in the sequence of sumset sizes, an observation related to a recent experiment of Nathanson.</description>

      <title>Modular Resolution by Polyseries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04231v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the modular resolution method using a new tool called a Polyserie introduced by Wildberger N.J. \&amp; Rubine D. in their recent article \cite{wildberger2025hyper} to prove an equivalence theorem of the existence and the unicity of the solution of the equation of the form $% H_{t}^{2}\left( x\right) -H_{t}\left( x\right) +t\equiv 0\ \ \left( \mathrm{mod}% \text{ }t^{n}\right) .$ These equations admits solutions for a fixed $t$ but when $t$ changes in a range of several values, then the equation becomes parametric and hence the solution should be parametric too. Prof. Wildberger N.J has studied such equations using Catalan numbers sequence using the recurrence formula between their terms $C_{n+1}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}C_{k}C_{n-k},$ which allow us to easily prove the main result of the present article. We study Wildberger's Polynumber Sequences, Binomial Chu-Vandermonde Identity, Truncated Polyseries and finally Modular Resolution as Application.</description>

      <title>The SOS Rank of Biquadratic Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1973, Calder\'{o}n proved that an $m \times 2$ positive semidefinite (psd) biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of ${3m(m+1) \over 2}$ squares of quadratic forms. Very recently, by applying Hilbert's theorem, we proved that a $2 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as the sum of three squares of bilinear forms. This improved Calder\'{o}n's result for $m=2$, and left the sos (sum-of-squares) rank problem of $m \times 2$ biquadratic forms for $m \ge 3$ to further exploration. In this paper, we show that a $3 \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as four squares of bilinear forms. For $m \ge 4$, we make a conjecture that an $m \times 2$ psd biquadratic form can always be expressed as $m+1$ squares of bilinear forms.</description>

      <title>Single-valued periods of meromorphic modular forms and a motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate.
  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>The partition function and elliptic curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $n\geq 1$, we express the partition function $p(n)$ as a CM trace on $X_0(6)$ of the discriminant $\Delta_n:=1-24n$ invariants of a weight 0 weak Maass function $P$ that records
  where CM elliptic curves sit on $X(1)$, together with their canonical first-order "CM tangent'', the diagonal local slope of the CM isogeny relation on $X(1)\times X(1)$. In this viewpoint, we obtain a formula for $p(n)\!\!\pmod{\ell},$ when $\ell$ is inert in $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{\Delta_n}),$ as a Brandt-module pairing $\langle u_{\Delta_n},v_P\rangle$ that is assembled from oriented optimal embeddings of Eichler orders. For $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}$ and $j\geq 1$, we obtain a new proof of the Ramanujan congruences $$
  p(5^j n +\beta_5(j))\equiv 0\pmod{5^j}, $$ $$
  p(7^j n +\beta_7(j))\equiv 0\pmod{7^{ [ j/2]+1}}, $$ $$ p(11^jn+\beta_{11}(j))\equiv 0\pmod{11^j}, $$
  where $\beta_m(j)$ is the unique residue $0\le \beta&lt;m^j$ with $24\,\beta_m(j)\equiv 1\pmod{m^j}$. The key point is a "bonus valuation" that stems from the fact that the supersingular locus of $X_0(6)_{\mathbb{F}_{\ell}}$ lies over $\{0, 1728\}$ for $\ell \in \{5, 7, 11\}.$ This special property, combined with the uniform growth of the $\lambda$-adic valuations of the number of oriented optimal embeddings, explains these congruences. More generally, we give a portable genus 0 template showing that the Watson--Atkin $U_\ell$-contraction works uniformly for suitable traces of singular moduli for genus 0 modular curves with $\ell\nmid N.$</description>

Abstract: The enumeration $d_k(n)$ of $k$-elongated plane partition diamonds has emerged as a generalization of the classical integer partition function $p(n)$. Congruences for $d_k(n)$ modulo certain powers of primes have been proven via elementary means and modular forms by many authors. Recently, Banerjee and Smoot established an infinite family of congruences for $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 5. In this paper we have discovered an infinite congruence family for $d_3(n)$ and $d_5(n)$ modulo powers of 7.</description>

Abstract: The orbital chromatic polynomial introduced by Cameron and Kayibi counts the number of proper $\lambda$-colorings of a graph modulo a group of symmetries. In this paper, we establish expansions for the orbital chromatic polynomial of the $n$-cycle for the group of rotations and its full automorphism group. As a side result, we obtain a new proof of Fermat's Little Theorem.</description>

      <title>Rigid inner forms over global function fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.10820v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct an fpqc gerbe $\mathcal{E}_{\dot{V}}$ over a global function field $F$ such that for a connected reductive group $G$ over $F$ with finite central subgroup $Z$, the set of $G_{\mathcal{E}_{\dot{V}}}$-torsors contains a subset $H^{1}(\mathcal{E}_{\dot{V}}, Z \to G)$ which allows one to define a global notion of ($Z$-)rigid inner forms. There is a localization map $H^{1}(\mathcal{E}_{\dot{V}}, Z \to G) \to H^{1}(\mathcal{E}_{v}, Z \to G)$, where the latter parametrizes local rigid inner forms (cf. [Kal16, Dil23]) which allows us to organize local rigid inner forms across all places $v$ into coherent families. Doing so enables a construction of (conjectural) global $L$-packets and a conjectural formula for the multiplicity of an automorphic representation $\pi$ in the discrete spectrum of $G$ in terms of these $L$-packets. We also show that, for a connected reductive group $G$ over a global function field $F$, the adelic transfer factor $\Delta_{\mathbb{A}}$ for the ring of adeles $\mathbb{A}$ of $F$ serving an endoscopic datum for $G$ decomposes as the product of the normalized local transfer factors from [Dil20].</description>

      <title>Metallic mean Wang tiles II: the dynamics of an aperiodic computer chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03197v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a new family $(\mathcal{T}_n)_{n\geq1}$ of aperiodic sets of Wang tiles and we describe the dynamical properties of the set $\Omega_n$ of valid configurations $\mathbb{Z}^2\to\mathcal{T}_n$. The tiles can be defined as the different instances of a square-shaped computer chip whose inputs and outputs are 3-dimensional integer vectors. The family include the Ammann aperiodic set of 16 Wang tiles and gathers the hallmarks of other small aperiodic sets of Wang tiles. Notably, the tiles satisfy additive versions of equations verified by the Kari--Culik aperiodic sets of 14 and 13 Wang tiles. Also configurations in $\Omega_n$ are the codings of a $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action on a 2-dimensional torus like the Jeandel--Rao aperiodic set of 11 Wang tiles. The family broadens the relation between quadratic integers and aperiodic tilings beyond the omnipresent golden ratio as the dynamics of $\Omega_n$ involves the positive root $\beta$ of the polynomial $x^2-nx-1$, also known as the $n$-th metallic mean. We show the existence of an almost one-to-one factor map $\Omega_n\to\mathbb{T}^2$ which commutes with the shift action on $\Omega_n$ with horizontal and vertical translations by $\beta$ on $\mathbb{T}^2$. The factor map can be explicitly defined by the average of the top labels from the same row of tiles as in Kari and Culik examples. The proofs are based on the minimality of $\Omega_n$ (proved in a previous article) and a polygonal partition of $\mathbb{T}^2$ which we show is a Markov partition for the toral $\mathbb{Z}^2$-action. The partition and the sets of Wang tiles are symmetric which makes them, like Penrose tilings, worthy of investigation.</description>

      <title>A Compact Post-quantum Strong Designated Verifier Signature Scheme from Isogenies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14893v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Digital signatures are fundamental cryptographic tools that provide authentication and integrity in digital communications. However, privacy-sensitive applications, such as e-voting and digital cash, require more restrictive verification models to ensure confidentiality and control. Strong Designated Verifier Signature (SDVS) schemes address this need by enabling the signer to designate a specific verifier, ensuring that only this party can validate the signature. Existing SDVS constructions are primarily based on number-theoretic assumptions and are therefore vulnerable to quantum attacks. Although post-quantum alternatives, particularly those based on lattices, have been proposed, they often entail large key and signature sizes. In this work, we present $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$, a novel isogeny-based SDVS scheme that offers a compact, quantum-resistant alternative to existing SDVS constructions. The scheme leverages the ideal class group action on $\mathbb{F}_p$-isomorphism classes of supersingular elliptic curves and is founded on the hardness of the Multi-Target Group Action Inverse Problem (MT-GAIP). $\mathsf{CSI\text{-}SDVS}$ achieves strong security guarantees, Strong Unforgeability under Chosen-Message Attacks (SUF-CMA), Non-Transferability (NT), and Privacy of Signer's Identity (PSI), in the random oracle model, thereby making it among the most compact PQC-based SDVS schemes and the only post-quantum secure construction based on isogenies.</description>

      <title>On Cloitre's hiccup sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2003, Benoit Cloitre entered a family of sequences in the OEIS that we call hiccup sequences. We collect the various claims, observations, and proofs of properties of these sequences that have been entered in the OEIS over the years, and present a unified approach, inspired by a remarkable theorem of Bosma, Dekking, and Steiner.</description>
