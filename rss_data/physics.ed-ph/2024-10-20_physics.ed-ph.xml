      <title>Air Resistance From the Acceleration of a Falling Smartphone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14172v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the motion of a falling smartphone under the influence of air drag using acceleration data collected by its built-in accelerometer. By analyzing the proper acceleration profiles, we could distinguish between laminar and turbulent drag regimes, a distinction readily apparent even through visual inspection of the data. The turbulent drag model proves to be a suitable representation for the observed motion, accurately capturing the dynamics of both the upward and downward phases of the smartphone's flight. This approach provides an effective and simple method to explore fluid dynamics concepts in an educational context.</description>

      <title>Responding to objections made by Sorin Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} concerning kinetic molecular theory: an illustration of how to teach physics students to evaluate pseudoscientific work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sorin Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} has argued that kinetic molecular theory does not correctly describe thermal equilibrium in ideal gases and has provided some examples that purportedly show that the standard laws imply consequences that contradict experimental results. This paper considers a few of the examples in detail and concludes that Co\c{s}ofre\c{t}'s analysis is erroneous. Furthermore, although it does not disprove any of the other claims made by Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} in criticising thermodynamics and many other fields of physics, it does call his whole project into question, as Co\c{s}ofre\c{t} exhibits a lack of relevant training, limited knowledge of key facts and previous research, and a disposition to favour his own intuitions above theoretical and experimental checks. The exercise below illustrates some of the problems commonly encountered in pseudoscientific approaches, and provides a few tips on how to teach aspiring scientists about how to evaluate such works for themselves.</description>

      <title>How much time do we have before catastrophic disclosure occurs?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Claims of the retrieval of crashed craft and vehicles from non-human intelligences (NHI) abound in popular culture and the media. For this article, we utilize the number of such claims to estimate the number of years expected before the occurrence of a Catastrophic Disclosure, a term which was defined at the 2023 Sol Foundation's inaugural conference as the accidental disclosure of conclusive evidence of the existence of NHI, outside of the control of human institutions, such as governments and militaries. Here, we will consider one possible example of this as the crash of a piloted spacecraft (or, an ET probe) in the middle of a busy metropolis. The distribution of humans on Earth's surface, the population as a function of time, and the fraction of individuals owning smartphones, also versus time, are each taken into account as foundations for a rigorous statistical analysis. The author adopts a skeptical approach and doesn't claim NHI or ET are real but uses their analysis as an educational example of critical thinking and application of standard statistical distributions to an issue which captures the imagination of the public like almost no other issue. Making the extraordinary assumptions that sentient species other than humans exist, are capable of constructing vehicles for transportation, and are sufficiently fallible that their technology can malfunction, it is possible to quantify potential answers to the question of how long it will be before smartphone imagery or video proofs appear on the internet and become irrevocable through classification in the modern era. The results of simulations of numerous different potential scenarios, of varying degrees of pessimism/optimism, indicate that, if NHI/ETs is/are real, catastrophic disclosure may actually happen accidentally rather soon, with the mean expected year being 2040+/-20 under the default assumptions.</description>
