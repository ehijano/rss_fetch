      <title>AI-Driven Hybrid Ecological Model for Predicting Oncolytic Viral Therapy Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Oncolytic viral therapy (OVT) is an emerging precision therapy for aggressive and recurrent cancers. However, its clinical efficacy is hindered by the complexity of tumor-virus-immune interactions and the lack of predictive models for personalized treatment. This study develops a data-driven, AI-powered computational model combining time-delayed Generalized Lotka-Volterra equations with advanced optimization algorithms, including Genetic Algorithms, Differential Evolution, and Reinforcement Learning, to optimize OVT oscillations' growth and damping. We hypothesize that the model can provide accurate, real-time predictions of OVT responses while identifying key biomarkers to enhance therapeutic efficacy. The model demonstrates strong predictive accuracy, achieving mean squared error (MSE) &lt; 0.02 and R-squared &gt; 0.82. It also identifies experimentally validated biomarkers such as TNF, NFkB, CD81, TRAF2, IL18, and BID, among other inflammatory cytokines and extracellular matrix reconstruction factors, despite being causally agnostic and unaware of specific experimental conditions or therapeutic combinations. Gene set enrichment analysis confirmed these biosignatures as critical predictors of tumor progression and indicated that photodynamic therapy activates immune responses similar to those elicited by combined OVT and immune checkpoint inhibitors. This hybrid model represents a significant step toward precision oncology and computational medicine, enabling longitudinal, adaptive treatment regimens and developing targeted immunotherapies based on molecular signatures, potentially improving patient outcomes.</description>

      <title>EMICSS: Added-value annotations for EMDB entries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivation: The Electron Microscopy Data Bank (EMDB) is a key repository for 3D electron microscopy (3DEM) data but lacks comprehensive annotations and connections to most of the related biological, functional, and structural data. This limitation arises from the optional nature of such information to reduce depositor burden and the complexity of maintaining up-to-date external references, often requiring depositor consent. To address these challenges, we developed EMICSS (EMDB Integration with Complexes, Structures, and Sequences), an independent system that automatically updates cross-references with over 20 external resources, including UniProt, AlphaFold DB, PubMed, Complex Portal and Gene Ontology. Results: EMICSS (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/emdb/emicss) annotations are accessible in multiple formats for every EMDB entry and its linked resources, and programmatically via the EMDB Application Programming Interface (API). EMICSS plays a crucial role supporting the EMDB website, with annotations being used on entry pages, statistics, and in the search system. Availability and implementation: EMICSS is implemented in Python and it is an open-source, distributed under the EMBL-EBI license, with core code available on GitHub (https://github.com/emdb-empiar/added_annotations).</description>

      <title>Fixed-budget simulation method for growing cell populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investigating the dynamics of growing cell populations is crucial for unraveling key biological mechanisms in living organisms, with many important applications in therapeutics and biochemical engineering. Classical agent-based simulation algorithms are often inefficient for these systems because they track each individual cell, making them impractical for fast (or even exponentially) growing cell populations. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel stochastic simulation approach based on a Feynman-Kac-like representation of the population dynamics. This method, named the Feynman-Kac-inspired Gillespie's Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (FKG-SSA), always employs a fixed number of independently simulated cells for Monte Carlo computation of the system, resulting in a constant computational complexity regardless of the population size. Furthermore, we theoretically show the statistical consistency of the proposed method, indicating its accuracy and reliability. Finally, a couple of biologically relevant numerical examples are presented to illustrate the approach. Overall, the proposed FKG-SSA effectively addresses the challenge of simulating growing cell populations, providing a solid foundation for better analysis of these systems.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) is an integrated set of methods for testing hypotheses about the brain's structure and function, using data from imaging devices. These methods are implemented in an open source software package, SPM, which has been in continuous development for more than 30 years by an international community of developers. This paper reports the release of SPM 25.01, a major new version of the software that incorporates novel analysis methods, optimisations of existing methods, as well as improved practices for open science and software development.</description>

      <title>Interplay of Electrostatic Interaction and Steric Repulsion between Bacteria and Gold Surface Influences Raman Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures have wide applications in photonics including pathogen detection and diagnosis via Surface-Enhanced Raman Spectroscopy (SERS). Despite major role plasmonics play in signal enhancement, electrostatics in SERS is yet to be fully understood and harnessed. Here, we perform a systematic study of electrostatic interactions between 785 nm resonant gold nanorods designed to harbor zeta potentials of +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV spanning positive neutral and negative domains. SERS activity is tested on representative Gram-negative Escherichia coli and Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria with zeta potentials of -30 and -23 mV respectively in water. Raman spectroscopy and Cryo-Electron microscopy reveal that +29, +16, 0 and -9 mV nanorods give SERS enhancement of 7.2X, 3.6X, 4.2X, 1.3X to Staphylococcus epidermidis and 3.9X, 2.8X, 2.9X, 1.1X to Escherichia coli. Theoretical results show that electrostatics play the major role among all interaction forces in determining cell-nanorod proximity and signal enhancement. We identify steric repulsion due to cell protrusions to be the critical opposing force. Finally, a design principle is proposed to estimate the electrostatic strength in SERS. Our work provides new insights into the principle of bacteria-nanorod interactions, enabling reproducible and precise biomolecular readouts, critical for next-generation point-of-care diagnostics and smart healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Village-Net Clustering: A Rapid approach to Non-linear Unsupervised Clustering of High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering large high-dimensional datasets with diverse variable is essential for extracting high-level latent information from these datasets. Here, we developed an unsupervised clustering algorithm, we call "Village-Net". Village-Net is specifically designed to effectively cluster high-dimension data without priori knowledge on the number of existing clusters. The algorithm operates in two phases: first, utilizing K-Means clustering, it divides the dataset into distinct subsets we refer to as "villages". Next, a weighted network is created, with each node representing a village, capturing their proximity relationships. To achieve optimal clustering, we process this network using a community detection algorithm called Walk-likelihood Community Finder (WLCF), a community detection algorithm developed by one of our team members. A salient feature of Village-Net Clustering is its ability to autonomously determine an optimal number of clusters for further analysis based on inherent characteristics of the data. We present extensive benchmarking on extant real-world datasets with known ground-truth labels to showcase its competitive performance, particularly in terms of the normalized mutual information (NMI) score, when compared to other state-of-the-art methods. The algorithm is computationally efficient, boasting a time complexity of O(N*k*d), where N signifies the number of instances, k represents the number of villages and d represents the dimension of the dataset, which makes it well suited for effectively handling large-scale datasets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents a combinatorial framework for analyzing assembly systems using generating functions. We explore the theory through concrete examples, such as linear polymers, and develop recursive equations to characterize valid assemblies. The framework accommodates various levels of description, from atoms to complex molecular structures, and provides combinatorial interpretations for each generating function. This approach enables the study of equilibrium behavior and the computation of equilibrium probabilities in polymer ensembles.</description>

      <title>Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring cells alleviate neuropathic pain in mice by secreting TGF-b and IL-10</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuropathic pain is a chronic condition characterized by damage to and dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system. There are currently no effective treatment options available for neuropathic pain, and existing drugs often provide only temporary relief with potential side effects. Multilineage-differentiating stress-enduring (Muse) cells are characterized by high expansion potential, a stable phenotype and strong immunosuppression. These properties make them attractive candidates for therapeutics for neuropathic pain management. In this study, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the effect of Muse cells on neuropathic pain. Muse cells from different species demonstrated analgesic potential by reversing CCI-induced neuropathic pain. Protein profiling revealed a high degree of similarity between Muse cells and BMSCs. The intrathecal injection of Muse cells effectively reduced neuropathic pain in various mouse models, resulting in better analgesic effects than the administration of equivalent low doses of BMSCs. Immunohistochemical analysis and qPCR revealed the ability of Muse cells to inhibit spinal cord neuroinflammation caused by SNI. In addition, Transwell and ELISA revealed that Muse cells migrated through the injured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) via the CCR7-CCL21 chemotactic axis. In addition, the secretion of TGF-b and IL-10 by Muse cells was identified as the mechanism underlying the analgesic effect of Muse cells. The capacity of Muse cells to mitigate neuroinflammation and produce analgesic effects via the modulation of TGF-b and IL-10 underscores their potential as promising therapeutic approaches for the treatment of neuropathic pain.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional point forecast combinations for emergency department demand</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current work on forecasting emergency department (ED) admissions focuses on disease aggregates or singular disease types. However, given differences in the dynamics of individual diseases, it is unlikely that any single forecasting model would accurately account for each disease and for all time, leading to significant forecast model uncertainty. Yet, forecasting models for ED admissions to-date do not explore the utility of forecast combinations to improve forecast accuracy and stability. It is also unknown whether improvements in forecast accuracy can be yield from (1) incorporating a large number of environmental and anthropogenic covariates or (2) forecasting total ED causes by aggregating cause-specific ED forecasts. To address this gap, we propose high-dimensional forecast combination schemes to combine a large number of forecasting individual models for forecasting cause-specific ED admissions over multiple causes and forecast horizons. We use time series data of ED admissions with an extensive set of explanatory lagged variables at the national level, including meteorological/ambient air pollutant variables and ED admissions of all 16 causes studied. We show that the simple forecast combinations yield forecast accuracies of around 3.81%-23.54% across causes. Furthermore, forecast combinations outperform individual forecasting models, in more than 50% of scenarios (across all ED admission categories and horizons) in a statistically significant manner. Inclusion of high-dimensional covariates and aggregating cause-specific forecasts to provide all-cause ED forecasts provided modest improvements in forecast accuracy. Forecasting cause-specific ED admissions can provide fine-scale forward guidance on resource optimization and pandemic preparedness and forecast combinations can be used to hedge against model uncertainty when forecasting across a wide range of admission categories.</description>

      <title>Confinement-induced proliferation of vortices around marine invertebrate larvae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ocean is teeming with a myriad of invertebrate planktonic larvae, which thrive in a viscous fluid environment. Many of them rely on ciliary beating to generate fluid flows for locomotion and feeding. Their forms, local morphologies, and ciliation patterns exhibit remarkable diversity, producing intricate and dynamic three-dimensional flows that are notoriously difficult to characterize in laboratory settings. Traditional microscopic imaging techniques typically involve gently squeeze-confining the soft larvae between a glass slide and cover slip, to study their flows in quasi-two-dimensions. However, a comprehensive hydrodynamic framework for the low-to-intermediate Reynolds number flows at the larval scale in quasi-2D confinement - particularly in light of their complex forms - has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate that vortices around larvae proliferate with increasing confinement, and elucidate the underlying physical mechanism. We experimentally quantify confinement-induced flows in larvae of sea stars and sea urchins. The flows exhibited strikingly universal patterns: under weak confinement, all larvae generated two vortices, whereas under strong confinement, multiple vortices appeared. The experimental observations were well captured by a low Reynolds number theoretical model based on superposition of confined Stokeslets. Building on experiments and theory, we developed a comprehensive framework for confinement-induced larval flows, which suggests that the vorticity dynamics are primarily determined by local morphological features, rather than the larval forms. Our work provides fundamental insights into the form-functional relationships between larval morphology and flow generation. Our findings are broadly applicable to understanding fluid flows generated by a wide range of ciliated organisms with complex forms and morphologies, from micro- to milli-length-scales.</description>

      <title>Using Space-Filling Curves and Fractals to Reveal Spatial and Temporal Patterns in Neuroimaging Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method, Fractal Space-Curve Analysis (FSCA), which combines Space-Filling Curve (SFC) mapping for dimensionality reduction with fractal Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA). The method is suitable for multidimensional geometrically embedded data, especially for neuroimaging data which is highly correlated temporally and spatially. We conduct extensive feasibility studies on diverse, artificially generated data with known fractal characteristics: the fractional Brownian motion, Cantor sets, and Gaussian processes. We compare the suitability of dimensionality reduction via Hilbert SFC and a data-driven alternative. FSCA is then successfully applied to real-world magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional MRI (fMRI) scans.
  The method utilizing Hilbert curves is optimized for computational efficiency, proven robust against boundary effects typical in experimental data analysis, and resistant to data sub-sampling. It is able to correctly quantify and discern correlations in both stationary and dynamic two-dimensional images. In MRI Alzheimer's dataset, patients reveal a progression of the disease associated with a systematic decrease of the Hurst exponent. In fMRI recording of breath-holding task, the change in the exponent allows distinguishing different experimental phases.
  This study introduces a robust method for fractal characterization of spatial and temporal correlations in many types of multidimensional neuroimaging data. Very few assumptions allow it to be generalized to more dimensions than typical for neuroimaging and utilized in other scientific fields. The method can be particularly useful in analyzing fMRI experiments to compute markers of pathological conditions resulting from neurodegeneration. We also showcase its potential for providing insights into brain dynamics in task-related experiments.</description>

      <title>Experts' cognition-driven safe noisy labels learning for precise segmentation of residual tumor in breast cancer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precise segmentation of residual tumor in breast cancer (PSRTBC) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a fundamental key technique in the treatment process of breast cancer. However, achieving PSRTBC is still a challenge, since the breast cancer tissue and tumor cells commonly have complex and varied morphological changes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, which inevitably increases the difficulty to produce a predictive model that has good generalization with usual supervised learning (SL). To alleviate this situation, in this paper, we propose an experts' cognition-driven safe noisy labels learning (ECDSNLL) approach. In the concept of safe noisy labels learning, which is a typical type of safe weakly supervised learning, ECDSNLL is constructed by integrating the pathology experts' cognition about identifying residual tumor in breast cancer and the artificial intelligence experts' cognition about data modeling with provided data basis. Experimental results show that, compared with usual SL, ECDSNLL can significantly improve the lower bound of a number of UNet variants with 2.42% and 4.1% respectively in recall and fIoU for PSRTBC, while being able to achieve improvements in mean value and upper bound as well.</description>

      <title>Decoding Dmrt1: Insights into vertebrate sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12060v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dmrt1 is pivotal in testis formation and function by interacting with genes crucial for Sertoli cell differentiation. Dmrt1, or Sox9, forms a conserved antagonistic interaction with Foxl2 across mammals. Across 128 vertebrate species, Dmrt1 exhibits sexually dimorphic expression, implicating its role in master regulation of sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation. Dmrt1 emerges as a master/upstream sex-determining gene in one fish, frog, chicken and turtle. Recent studies suggest epigenetic regulation of Dmrt1 in its promoter methylation, and transposable element insertion introducing epigenetic modification to cis-regulatory elements of Dmrt1, alongside non-coding RNA involvement, in a wide spectrum of sex-determining mechanisms ranging from genetic factors, to interactions between genetic factors with the environment, to solely environmental factors. Additionally, alternative splicing of Dmrt1 was found in all major vertebrate groups except amphibians. Dmrt1 has evolved many lineage-specific isoforms (ranging from 2 to 10), and various isoforms showed sex, tissue or development-specific expression, which is in contrast to the highly conserved sex-specific splicing of its homolog Dsx across insects. Future research should focus on understanding the molecular basis of environmental sex determination from a broader taxon, and the molecular basis of epigenetic regulation. It is also essential to understand why and how multiple alternative splicing variants of Dmrt1 evolve in vertebrates, the specific roles each isoform plays in sex determination and gonadal sex differentiation, as well as the significant differences in the molecular mechanisms and functions of alternative splicing between Dmrt1 in vertebrates and Dsx in insects. Understanding the differences could provide deeper insights into the evolution of sex-determining mechanisms between vertebrates and insects.</description>

      <title>Approximating particle-based clustering dynamics by stochastic PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work proposes stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) as a practical tool to replicate clustering effects of more detailed particle-based dynamics. Inspired by membrane-mediated receptor dynamics on cell surfaces, we formulate a stochastic particle-based model for diffusion and pairwise interaction of particles, leading to intriguing clustering phenomena. Employing numerical simulation and cluster detection methods, we explore the approximation of the particle-based clustering dynamics through mean-field approaches. We find that SPDEs successfully reproduce spatiotemporal clustering dynamics, not only in the initial cluster formation period, but also on longer time scales where the successive merging of clusters cannot be tracked by deterministic mean-field models. The computational efficiency of the SPDE approach allows us to generate extensive statistical data for parameter estimation in a simpler model that uses a Markov jump process to capture the temporal evolution of the cluster number.</description>

      <title>Enhancing End Stage Renal Disease Outcome Prediction: A Multi-Sourced Data-Driven Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To improve prediction of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) progression to End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models applied to an integrated clinical and claims dataset of varying observation windows, supported by explainable AI (XAI) to enhance interpretability and reduce bias.
  Materials and Methods: We utilized data about 10,326 CKD patients, combining their clinical and claims information from 2009 to 2018. Following data preprocessing, cohort identification, and feature engineering, we evaluated multiple statistical, ML and DL models using data extracted from five distinct observation windows. Feature importance and Shapley value analysis were employed to understand key predictors. Models were tested for robustness, clinical relevance, misclassification errors and bias issues.
  Results: Integrated data models outperformed those using single data sources, with the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model achieving the highest AUC (0.93) and F1 score (0.65). A 24-month observation window was identified as optimal for balancing early detection and prediction accuracy. The 2021 eGFR equation improved prediction accuracy and reduced racial bias, notably for African American patients. Discussion: Improved ESRD prediction accuracy, results interpretability and bias mitigation strategies presented in this study have the potential to significantly enhance CKD and ESRD management, support targeted early interventions and reduce healthcare disparities.
  Conclusion: This study presents a robust framework for predicting ESRD outcomes in CKD patients, improving clinical decision-making and patient care through multi-sourced, integrated data and AI/ML methods. Future research will expand data integration and explore the application of this framework to other chronic diseases.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Computational Framework for Practical Identifiability Analysis in Mathematical Models Arising from Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01283v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Practical identifiability is a critical concern in data-driven modeling of mathematical systems. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for practical identifiability analysis to evaluate parameter identifiability in mathematical models of biological systems. Starting with a rigorous mathematical definition of practical identifiability, we demonstrate its equivalence to the invertibility of the Fisher Information Matrix. Our framework establishes the relationship between practical identifiability and coordinate identifiability, introducing a novel metric that simplifies and accelerates the evaluation of parameter identifiability compared to the profile likelihood method. Additionally, we introduce new regularization terms to address non-identifiable parameters, enabling uncertainty quantification and improving model reliability. To guide experimental design, we present an optimal data collection algorithm that ensures all model parameters are practically identifiable. Applications to Hill functions, neural networks, and dynamic biological models demonstrate the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed computational framework in uncovering critical biological processes and identifying key observable variables.</description>

      <title>Topological analysis of brain dynamical signals indicates signatures of seizure susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Epilepsy is known to drastically alter brain dynamics during seizures (ictal periods), but its effects on background (non-ictal) brain dynamics remain poorly understood. To investigate this, we analyzed an in-house dataset of brain activity recordings from epileptic zebrafish, focusing on two controlled genetic conditions across two fishlines. After using machine learning to segment and label recordings, we applied time-delay embedding and Persistent Homology -- a noise-robust method from Topological Data Analysis (TDA) -- to uncover topological patterns in brain activity. We find that ictal and non-ictal periods can be distinguished based on the topology of their dynamics, independent of genetic condition or fishline, which validates our approach. Remarkably, within a single wild-type fishline, we identified topological differences in non-ictal periods between seizure-prone and seizure-free individuals. These findings suggest that epilepsy leaves detectable topological signatures in brain dynamics even outside of ictal periods. Overall, this study demonstrates the utility of TDA as a quantitative framework to screen for topological markers of epileptic susceptibility, with potential applications across species.</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Alignment in Diffusion Models with Reward-Guided Generation: Tutorial and Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This tutorial provides an in-depth guide on inference-time guidance and alignment methods for optimizing downstream reward functions in diffusion models. While diffusion models are renowned for their generative modeling capabilities, practical applications in fields such as biology often require sample generation that maximizes specific metrics (e.g., stability, affinity in proteins, closeness to target structures). In these scenarios, diffusion models can be adapted not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly maximize desired measures at inference time without fine-tuning. This tutorial explores the foundational aspects of such inference-time algorithms. We review these methods from a unified perspective, demonstrating that current techniques -- such as Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)-based guidance, value-based sampling, and classifier guidance -- aim to approximate soft optimal denoising processes (a.k.a. policies in RL) that combine pre-trained denoising processes with value functions serving as look-ahead functions that predict from intermediate states to terminal rewards. Within this framework, we present several novel algorithms not yet covered in the literature. Furthermore, we discuss (1) fine-tuning methods combined with inference-time techniques, (2) inference-time algorithms based on search algorithms such as Monte Carlo tree search, which have received limited attention in current research, and (3) connections between inference-time algorithms in language models and diffusion models.
