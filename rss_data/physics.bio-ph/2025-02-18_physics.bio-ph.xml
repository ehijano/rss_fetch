      <title>Analytical methods for cytoplasmic streaming in elongated cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cytoplasmic streaming, the coherent flow of cytoplasm, plays a critical role in transport and mixing over large scales in eukaryotic cells. In many large cells, this process is driven by active forces at the cell boundary, such as cortical cytoskeletal contractions in Drosophila and C. elegans embryos, or intracellular cargo transport in plant cells. These cytoplasmic flows are approximately Newtonian and governed by the Stokes equations. In this paper, we use lubrication theory - a powerful technique for simplifying the fluid mechanics equations in elongated geometries - to derive a general solution for boundary-driven cytoplasmic flows. We apply this framework to predict cytoplasmic fluid dynamics and cortical stresses in four systems of biological significance: the Drosophila and C. elegans embryos (including pseudocleavage furrow formation), the pollen tube of seed plants, and plant root hair cells. Our results showcase the elegance and accuracy of asymptotic solutions in capturing the complex flows and stress patterns in diverse biological contexts, reinforcing its utility as a robust tool for cellular biophysics.</description>

      <title>Comprehensive scaling laws across animals, microorganisms and plants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaling laws illuminate Nature's fundamental biological principles and guide bioinspired materials and structural designs. In simple cases they are based on the fundamental principle that all laws of nature remain unchanged (i.e., invariant) under a change of units. A more general framework is a change of variables for the governing laws that takes all equations, boundary, and interaction conditions into themselves. We consider an accepted macroscale system of partial differential equations including coupled fluid dynamics, nonlinear elasticity, and rigid body mechanics for a complex organism. We show that there is a set of scaling laws where length, time, density, elastic modulus, viscosity, and gravitational constant undergo nontrivial scaling (Table 1). We compare these results to extensive data sets mined from the literature on beating frequency of flying, swimming, and running animals, speed of bacteria, insects, fish, mammals and reptiles, leg stiffness of mammals, and modulus of elasticity of plants. The uniform agreement of the scaling laws with the dynamics of fauna, flora, and microorganisms supports the dominating role of coupled nonlinear elasticity and fluid dynamics in evolutionary development. We conclude with predictions for some prehistoric cases for which observations are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Dephasing enhanced transport of spin excitations in a two dimensional lossy lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noise is commonly regarded as an adverse effect disrupting communication and coher- ent transport processes or limiting their efficiency. However, as has been shown for example for small light-harvesting protein complexes decoherence processes can play a significant role in facilitating transport processes, a phenomenon termed environment- assisted quantum transport (ENAQT). We here study numerically and analytically how dephasing noise improves the efficiency of spin excitation transport in a two dimen- sional lattice with small homogeneous losses. In particular we investigate the efficiency and time of excitation transfer from a random initial site to a specific target site and show that for system sizes below a characteristic scale it can be substantially enhanced by adding small dephasing noise. We derive approximate analytic expressions for the efficiency which become rather accurate in the two limits of small (coherent regime) and large noise (Zeno regime) and give a very good overall estimate. These analytic expressions provide a quantitative description of ENAQT in spatially extended systems and allow to derive conditions for its existence.</description>

      <title>Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11206v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincar\'e Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).</description>

      <title>Diffuse-charge dynamics across a capacitive interface in a DC electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cells and cellular organelles are encapsulated by nanometrically thin membranes whose main component is a lipid bilayer. In the presence of electric fields, the ion-impermeable lipid bilayer acts as a capacitor and supports a potential difference across the membrane. We analyze the charging dynamics of a planar membrane separating bulk solutions with different electrolyte concentrations upon the application of an applied uniform DC electric field. The membrane is modeled as a zero-thickness capacitive interface. The evolution of the electric potential and ions distributions in the bulk are solved for using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations. Asymptotic solutions are derived in the limit of thin Debye layers and weak fields (compared to the thermal electric potential).</description>

      <title>Active gel theory for cell migration with two myosin isoforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Myosin II molecular motors slide actin filaments relatively to each other and are essential for force generation, motility and mechanosensing in animal cells. For non-muscle cells, evolution has resulted in three different isoforms, which have different properties concerning the motor cycle and also occur in different abundances in the cells, but their respective biological and physical roles are not fully understood. Here we use active gel theory to demonstrate the complementary roles of isoforms A and B for cell migration. We first show that our model can be derived both from coarse-graining kinetic equations and from nonequilibrium thermodynamics as the macroscopic limit of a two-component Tonks gas. We then parametrize the model and show that motile solutions exist, in which the more abundant and more dynamic isoform A is localized to the front and the stronger isoform B to the rear, in agreement with experiments. We then explore the parameter space of the model and find a general pull-and-push mechanism that can produce different migratory modes, including cell oscillations in length and velocity. We also describe an analytical solution for the stiff limit. Our findings highlight the importance of including isoform-specific molecular details to describe whole cell behavior.</description>

      <title>A versatile experimental method to measure the traction forces at interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement of surface forces, including cohesive forces and contact forces, is critical for understanding and controlling interactions at interfaces to optimize the interfacial performance of applications. The objective of this paper is to introduce a general in-situ method that enables the measurement of 3D micron-scale displacements and corresponding force distribution at interfaces in dry or wet environment. Stereo digital image correlation was used to measure the 3D-displacement of a soft and deformable substrate. The efficiency and accuracy of the technique were evaluated by applying compression to the substrate using a steel ball, with the measured 3D displacements aligning closely with finite element analysis simulations. To further assess the method's applicability, the wet adhesion between mussel plaques and substrate was tested under aqueous conditions. The interfacial displacements and forces at different stages during the test were measured. The application of the technique can be extended for varied circumstances regarding force range and substrate materials based on Winkler Spring model.</description>

      <title>Lattice ultrasensitivity amplifies signals in E. coli without fine-tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18331v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The E. coli chemosensory lattice, consisting of receptors, kinases, and adaptor proteins, is an important test case for biochemical signal processing. Kinase output is characterized by precise adaptation to a wide range of background ligand levels and large gain in response to small relative changes in concentration. Existing models of this lattice achieve their gain through allosteric interactions between either receptors or core units of receptors and kinases. Here we introduce a model which operates through an entirely different mechanism in which receptors gate inherently far from equilibrium enzymatic reactions between neighboring kinases. Our lattice model achieves gain through a mechanism more closely related to zero-order ultrasensitivity than to allostery. Thus, we call it lattice ultrasensitivity (LU). Unlike other lattice critical models, the LU model can achieve arbitrarily high gain through time-scale separation, rather than through fine-tuning. The model also captures qualitative experimental results which are difficult to reconcile with existing models. We discuss possible implementations in the lattice's baseplate where long flexible linkers could potentially mediate interactions between neighboring core units.</description>

      <title>Non Equilibrium Transitions in a Polymer Replication Ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fuel-driven process of replication in living systems generates distributions of copied entities with varying degrees of copying accuracy. Here we introduce a thermodynamically consistent ensemble for investigating universal population features of replicating systems. In the context of copolymer copying, coarse-graining over molecular details, we establish a phase diagram of copying accuracy. We discover sharp non-equilibrium transitions between populations of random and accurate copies. Maintaining a population of accurate copies requires a minimum energy expenditure that depends on the configurational entropy of copolymer sequences.</description>
