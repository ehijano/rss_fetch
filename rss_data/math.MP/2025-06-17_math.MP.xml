      <title>Ergodic Theory of Inhomogeneous Quantum Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a rigorous framework for understanding ergodicity and mixing in time-inhomogeneous quantum systems. By analyzing quantum processes driven by sequences of quantum channels, we distinguish between forward and backward dynamics and reveal their fundamental asymmetries. A key contribution is the development of a quantum Markov-Dobrushin approach to characterize mixing behavior, offering clear criteria for convergence and exponential stability. The framework not only generalizes classical and homogeneous quantum models but also applies to non-translation-invariant matrix product states, highlighting its relevance to real-world quantum systems. These results contribute to the mathematical foundations of quantum dynamics and support the broader goal of advancing quantum information science.</description>

      <title>Local perturbations of block Toeplitz matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is about the asymptotic spectral theory of tridiagonal Toeplitz matrices with matrix entries, with periodicity broken on a finite number of entries. Varying the ranks of these perturbations allow to interpolate between open boundary and circulant Toeplitz matrices. While the continuous part of the limit spectrum only depends on these ranks and no other aspect of the perturbation, the outliers of the spectrum depend continuously on the local perturbation. The proof is essentially based on a new generalized Widom formula for the characteristic polynomial. All this holds for Lebesgue almost all perturbed Toeplitz matrices, a fact that constitutes another important extension of Widom's work. The mathematical results are illustrated by numerics.</description>

      <title>Multi-parameter isospectral Fokker-Planck equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.</description>

      <title>The Kuramoto model on the Sierpinski Gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) of coupled phase oscillators on graphs approximating the Sierpinski gasket (SG). As the size of the graph tends to infinity, the limit points of the sequence of stable equilibria in the KM correspond to the minima of the Dirichlet energy, i.e., to harmonic maps from the SG to the circle. We provide a complete description of the stable equilibria of the continuum limit of the KM on graphs approximating the SG, under both Dirichlet and free boundary conditions. We show that there is a unique stable equilibrium in each homotopy class of continuous functions from the SG to the circle. These equilibria serve as generalizations of the classical twisted states on ring networks. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the KM on post-critically finite fractals. The results of this work reveal the link between self-similar organization and network dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Casimir eigenvalues on $ad^{\otimes k}$ of SU(N) are linear on N</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider eigenvalues of the Casimir operator on the naturally defined \textit{stable sequences} of representations of $su(N)$ algebra and prove that eigenvalues are linear over $N$ iff $\lambda_1+2\lambda_2+...+k\lambda_k=\lambda_{N-1}+2\lambda_{N-2}+...+k\lambda_{N-k}$, where $\lambda_i$ are Dynkin labels, and $\lambda_i=0$ for $k&lt;i&lt;N-k$, with fixed $k$. These representations are exactly those which appear in the decomposition of $ad(su(N))^{\otimes k}$, therefore this linearity admits the presentation of eigenvalues in the universal, in Vogel's sense, form, and supports the hypothesis of universal decomposition of $ad^{\otimes k}$ into Casimir eigenspaces.</description>

      <title>Topological Conservation Laws in Magnetohydrodynamics on Higher-Dimensional Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Are conservation laws such as fluid enstrophy, fluid helicity, or magnetic helicity inherently tied to the geometry of Euclidean space or the dimensionality of a fluid system? In this work, we first derive the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on a general Riemannian manifold. We then demonstrate that the associated conservation laws arise not from the flatness of the metric, but rather from the intrinsic mathematical structure of the governing equations. Moreover, we demonstrate that their qualitative behavior depends crucially on whether the ambient space is of even or odd dimensions. In particular, we demonstrate that higher-dimensional magnetofluid systems admit natural generalizations of familiar topological invariants - such as fluid enstrophy, total magnetic flux, fluid helicity, cross-helicity, and magnetic helicity - under appropriate boundary and field conditions.</description>

      <title>Many-body Localization and Poisson statistics in the Quantum Sun model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Quantum Sun model is a many-body Hamiltonian model of interacting spins arranged on the half-line. Spins at distance $n$ from the origin are coupled to the rest of the system via a term of strength $\alpha^n$, with $\alpha \in (0,1)$. From theoretical and numerical considerations, it is believed that this model undergoes a localization-delocalization transition at the critical value $\alpha=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. We prove that, for $\alpha \ll \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$, the model is localized and that its spectral statistics is Poissonian. The main interest of this result is that the model is a genuine many-body model. In particular, the number of independent disorder variables grows only logarithmically with the Hilbert space dimension.</description>

      <title>A note on Hall conductance and Hall conductivity in interacting Fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider lattice fermions on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ with a gapped ground state and show how to apply the NEASS approach to linear response to derive the formula for the Hall conductance in terms of an expectation of a commutator of modified step functions. This formula is usually derived by a charge pumping argument going back to Laughlin. Here we show that it can also be obtained as the linear response coefficient of the microscopic current response to an adiabatic increase of the chemical potential on a half plane. We discuss the connection with the double commutator formula with modified position operators for the Hall conductivity derived in arXiv:2411.06967 as the linear response coefficient of the macroscopic current response to the adiabatic application of a constant electric field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an evolution of multiple particles on a discrete manifold $G$. Each particle alone moves on geodesics and particles can interact if they are on the same facet. They move deterministically and reversibly on the frame bundle $P$ of the abstract simplicial complex $G$. Particles are signed and each is represented by a totally ordered maximal simplex $p \in P$ in $G$. The motion of divisors on $P$ also defines a time dependent reversible deformation of space.</description>

      <title>Single-photon emission modeling with statistical estimators for the exponential distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-photon sources are used in numerous quantum technologies, from sensing and imaging to communication, making the accurate modeling of their emissions essential. In this work, we propose a statistical framework for describing single-photon emission processes and implement estimators for the exponential distribution to quantify this phenomenon. Our approach provides a reliable method for estimating the radiative decay time, represented by the inverse rate parameter, which is crucial in quantum optics applications. We explore several statistical estimators, including maximum likelihood estimation, minimum-variance unbiased estimator, and best linear unbiased estimator. To validate our theoretical methods, we test the proposed estimators on experimental data, demonstrating their applicability in real-world settings. We also evaluate the performance of these estimators when dealing with censored data, a frequent limitation in photon emission experiments. The analysis allows us to track the performance of the proposed estimators as the amount of available data decreases, providing insights into their reliability for modeling single-photon emission events under limited resources.</description>

      <title>The multinomial dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $N$-dimer cover of a graph is a collection of edges (with multiplicity) such that each vertex is contained in exactly $N$ edges in the collection. The multinomial dimer model is a natural probability measure on $N$-dimer covers. We study the behavior of these measures on periodic bipartite graphs in ${\mathbb R}^d$, in the scaling limit as the multiplicity $N$ and then the size of the graph go to infinity.
  In this iterated limit, we prove a large deviation principle, where the rate function is the integral of an explicit surface tension, and show that random configurations concentrate on a limit shape which is the unique solution to an associated Euler-Lagrange equation. We further show that the associated critical gauge functions, which exist in the $N\to\infty$ limit on each finite graph, converge in the scaling limit to a limiting gauge function which solves a dual Euler-Lagrange equation.
  We use our techniques to compute explicit limit shapes in some two and three dimensional examples, such as the Aztec diamond and ``Aztec cuboid". These $3d$ examples are the first stat mech models in dimensions $d\ge3$ where limit shapes can be computed explicitly.</description>

      <title>Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon that deepens the analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model.</description>

Abstract: We consider a non-exchangeable system of interacting quantum particles with mean-field type interactions, subject to continuous measurement on a class of dense graphs. In the mean-field limit, we derive a graphon-based quantum filtering system of equations, study its well-posedness, and establish a propagation of chaos result for multiple bosonic systems with blockwise interactions. We then discuss applications to quantum graphon games and quantum state preparation.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted a lot of interest and has been widely studied, revealing several types of chimeras. Most cases involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction, modeled via networks. However, real-world systems often have non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. From previous studies, it is known that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while easier to be found when the latter are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called m-directed hypergraphs, and we show that, not only the higher-order topology allows the emergence of chimera states despite the non-reciprocal coupling, but also that chimera states can emerge because of the directionality. Finally, we compare the latter results with the one resulting from non-reciprocal pairwise interactions: their elusiveness confirms that the observed phenomenon is thus due to the presence of higher-order interactions. The nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

Abstract: We obtain exact solutions of the nonlinear Dirac equation in 1+1 dimension of the form $ \Psi(x,t) =\Phi(x) \rme^{-\rmi \omega t}$ where the nonlinear interactions are a combination of vector-vector and scalar-scalar interactions with the interaction Lagrangian given by $L_I = \frac{g^2}{(\kappa+1)}[\bar{\psi} \gamma_{\mu}\psi \bar{\psi} \gamma^{\mu} \psi]^{(\kappa+1)/2} - \frac{g^2}{q(\kappa+1)}(\bar{\psi} \psi)^{\kappa+1}$, where $\kappa&gt;0$ and $q&gt;1$. This is the complement of the generalization of the ABS model \cite{abs} that we recently studied \cite{ak} and denoted as the gABS model. We show that like the gABS model, in the complementary gABS models the solitary wave solutions also exist in the entire $(\kappa, q)$ plane and further in both models energy of the solitary wave divided by its charge is
  {\it independent} of the coupling constant $g$. However, unlike the gABS model here all the solitary waves are single humped, any value of $0 &lt; \omega &lt; m$ is allowed and further unlike the gABS model, for this complementary gABS model the solitary wave bound states exist only in case $\kappa \le \kappa_c$, where $\kappa_c$ depends on the value of $q$. Here $\omega$ and $m$ denote frequency and mass, respectively. We discuss the regions of stability of these solutions as a function of $\omega,q,\kappa$ using the Vakhitov-Kolokolov criterion. Finally we discuss the non-relativistic reduction of the two-parameter family of this complementary generalized ABS model to a modified nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE) and discuss the stability of the solitary waves in the domain of validity of the modified NLSE.</description>

      <title>A universal cutoff phenomenon for mean-field exchange models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a broad class of high-dimensional mean-field exchange models, encompassing both noisy and singular dynamics, along with their dual processes. This includes a generalized version of the averaging process as well as some non-reversible extensions of classical exchange dynamics, such as the flat Kac model. Within a unified framework, we analyze convergence to stationarity from worst-case initial data in Wasserstein distance. Our main result establishes a universal cutoff phenomenon at an explicit mixing time, with a precise window and limiting Gaussian profile. The mixing time and profile are characterized in terms of the logarithm of the size-biased redistribution random variable, thus admitting a natural entropic interpretation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a family of matrix models such that their partition functions are tau functions of the universal character (UC) hierarchy. This develops one of the topics of our previous paper arXiv:2410.14823. We found new matrix models associated with the product of two spheres with embedded graphs via a gluing matrix. We also generalize these studies to multi-matrix models case, which corresponds to the multi-component UC hierarchy.</description>

      <title>The effects of initial conditions on the accuracy of mean-field approximations of Markov processes on large random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of a general class of stochastic processes (containing, e.g. SIS and SIR models) on large random networks, focusing on a particular general class of random graph models. To approximate the expected dynamics of these processes, we employ a mean-field technique known as the N-Intertwined Mean-Field Approximation (NIMFA). Our primary goal is to quantify the impact of the randomness in the network topology on the accuracy of such approximations. While classical work by Kurtz established strong approximation results for density-dependent Markov chains using mean-field on the complete-graph of order $N$, yielding error bounds of order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$, we demonstrate that in the context of NIMFA on random graphs, the error admits a refined characterization depending on initial conditions. Specifically, for generic initial conditions, the worst case error is of order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}$, where $d$ is the expected average degree of the graph. This result highlights how network sparsity contributes an additional source of variability not captured by classical mean-field approaches. Furthermore, when the initial conditions are taken to be fairly homogeneous, we show that the error term is of order $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}+\frac{1}{d}$, where $N$ is the number of nodes, underscoring the intricate role of the choice of initial conditions in the error bounds. Our analysis connects with recent interest in quantifying the role of graph heterogeneity in epidemic thresholds and dynamics.</description>

      <title>Viscoplastic flows in narrow channels: Herschel-Bulkley models versus its regularizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the two-dimensional flows of a viscoplastic fluid in symmetric channels with impermeable walls under no-slip boundary conditions. As response functions for the Cauchy stress tensor of the viscoplastic fluid, we considered both the celebrated Herschel-Bulkley model and a very general class $\mathcal{C}$ of its regularizations that depend on a positive parameter with the same physical dimensions as the strain rate and known as the \emph{regularization parameter}. Within this class of regularized Herschel-Bulkley models, the response function for the viscosity of the viscoplastic fluid tends to the non-smooth Herschel-Bulkley viscosity function as the regularization parameter tends to zero. To make the equations governing the flow amenable to analysis, we considered channels with small aspect ratio so that the lubrication approximation can be used. In this way, we were able to obtain analytical solutions, perform an asymptotic analysis of the regularized solutions, and compare the results predicted by the Herschel-Bulkley model and its regularizations. We found that for any given channel, the regularized flows predicted by the regularizations in $\mathcal{C}$ tend to the same velocity field in the limit as the regularization parameter tends to zero. Such an asymptotic flow coincides with that predicted by the Herschel-Bulkley model only if the viscoplastic fluid flows in plane channels. Instead, in channels with curved walls, the results are markedly different.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of Activator Solutions for Geopolymer Synthesis: Thermochemical Stability, Sequencing, and Standardisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geopolymers present a sustainable alternative to conventional binders, however, their commercial viability is hindered by a lack of standardised methods for preparing stabile activator solutions; alkaline feedstocks critical to geopolymer synthesis. This study presents a combined experimental and modelling approach to evaluate the thermochemical stability, solubility constraints, and silica speciation behaviour of sodium silicate-based activators. Using quantitative 29Si NMR analysis, thermodynamic stability and three-dimensional solubility modelling, this research identifies optimal preparation conditions that minimise irreversible precipitation risks and optimises mixing periods. Key findings indicate that higher solution temperatures associated with optimised activator solution preparation were found to enhance thermochemical stability and reactivity, while cooling increased viscosity and the likelihood of unstable solution behaviour, which may necessitate discarding. The order in which feedstocks are combined directly affects whether the solution becomes unstable, with an optimal sequence of water, alkali-hydroxide, soluble silicate found to ensure greater process reliability. A predictive model and accompanying visual tools enable practitioners to assess solution viability and define stability windows by quantifying initial and final/unstable periods and temperatures based on feedstock composition and solution temperature. These results contribute to improved reproducibility and quality control in geopolymer research and represent a step toward developing standard operating procedures for activator solution synthesis.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to study integrable deformations of chiral conformal field theories on elliptic curves from the viewpoint of contact algebra. We introduce the relevant integrable condition within the framework of conformal vertex algebra, and derive the contact term relations among certain local operators. We investigate three versions of genus one partition functions and derive the contact equations. This leads to a rigorous formulation of Dijkgraaf's master equation \cite{Dijk1996master} for chiral deformations.</description>

Abstract: The optimization of mixed-variable problems remains a significant challenge. We propose an extension of the policy-based optimization method that handles mixed-variables problems in a natural way, through a simple policy combination. This is achieved by independently sampling from a multivariate normal distribution for the continuous domain, and from multiple categorical distributions for the discrete choices. Results demonstrate that the agent successfully yields high-quality solutions on a classical problem of electromagnetics, showcasing its robustness.</description>

Abstract: Bargmann invariants have recently emerged as powerful tools in quantum information theory, with applications ranging from geometric phase characterization to quantum state distinguishability. Despite their widespread use, a complete characterization of their physically realizable values has remained an outstanding challenge. In this work, we provide a rigorous determination of the numerical range of Bargmann invariants for quantum systems of arbitrary finite dimension. We demonstrate that any permissible value of these invariants can be achieved using either (i) pure states exhibiting circular Gram matrix symmetry or (ii) qubit states alone. These results establish fundamental limits on Bargmann invariants in quantum mechanics and provide a solid mathematical foundation for their diverse applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13480v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Starting from the multi-species Boltzmann equation for a gas mixture, we propose the formal derivation of the isentropic two-phase flow model introduced in [Romenski, E., and Toro, E. F., Comput. Fluid Dyn. J., 13 (2004)]. We examine the asymptotic limit as the Knudsen numbers approach zero, in a regime characterized by resonant intra-species collisions, where interactions between particles of the same species dominate. This specific regime leads to a multi-velocity and multi-pressure hydrodynamic model, enabling the explicit computation of the coefficients for the two-phase macroscopic model. Our derivation also accounts for the inclusion of the evolution of the volume fraction, which is a key variable in many macroscopic multiphase models</description>

Abstract: We initiate the theory of real noncommutative convex sets, following the recent and profound complex case developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the real case of the topics from the first several sections of their profound memoir.. Later results will be discussed in a future paper. We give many foundational structural results for real operator systems and their associated noncommutative (nc) convex sets, and elucidate how the complexification interacts with the basic convexity theory constructions. Several new features appear in the real case, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex set.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.13764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit a double-scaled limit of the superconformal index of ${\cal N}=2$ superconformal field theories (SCFTs) which generalizes the Schur index. The resulting partition function, $\hat {\cal Z}(q,\alpha)$, has a standard $q$-expansion with coefficients depending on a continuous parameter $\alpha$. The Schur index is a special case with $\alpha=1$. Through explicit computations we argue that this partition function is an invariant of certain mass deformations and vacuum expectation value (vev) deformations of the SCFT. In particular, two SCFTs residing in different corners of the same Coulomb branch, satisfying certain restrictive conditions, have the same partition function with a non-trivial map of the parameters, $\hat {\cal Z}_1(q,\alpha_1)=\hat {\cal Z}_2(q,\alpha_2(\alpha_1))$. For example, we show that the Schur index of all the SCFTs in the Deligne-Cvitanovi\'c series is given by special values of $\alpha$ of the partition function of the SU(2) $N_f=4$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD.</description>

Abstract: We prove new concentration inequalities for quantum spin systems which apply to any local observable measured on any product state or on any state with exponentially decaying correlations. Our results do not require the spins to be arranged in a regular lattice, and cover the case of observables that contain terms acting on spins at arbitrary distance. Moreover, we introduce a local W1 distance, which quantifies the distinguishability of two states with respect to local observables. We prove a transportation-cost inequality stating that the local W1 distance between a generic state and a state with exponentially decaying correlations is upper bounded by a function of their relative entropy. Finally, we apply such inequality to prove the equivalence between the canonical and microcanonical ensembles of quantum statistical mechanics and the weak eigenstate thermalization hypothesis for the Hamiltonians whose Gibbs states have exponentially decaying correlations.</description>

Abstract: A variety of local index formulas is constructed for quantum Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions. All dimensions of physical space as well as many symmetry constraints are covered, notably one-dimensional systems in Class DIII as well as two- and three-dimensional systems in Class AII. The constructions are based on several periodic variations of the spectral localizer and are rooted in the existence of underlying fuzzy tori. For these latter, a general invariant theory is developed.</description>

      <title>The Ising Model Coupled to 2D Gravity: Higher-order Painlev\'{e} Equations/The $(3,4)$ String Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a higher-order Painlev\'{e}-type equation, arising as a string equation of the $3^{rd}$ order reduction of the KP hierarchy. This equation appears at the multi-critical point of the $2$-matrix model with quartic interactions, and describes the Ising phase transition coupled to 2D gravity, cf. [1]. We characterize this equation in terms of the isomonodromic deformations of a particular rational connection on $\mathbb{P}^{1}$. We also identify the (nonautonomous) Hamiltonian structure associated to this equation, and write a suitable $\tau$-differential for this system. This $\tau$-differential can be extended to the canonical coordinates of the associated Hamiltonian system, allowing us to verify Conjectures 1. and 2. of [2]. We also present a fairly general formula for the $\tau$-differential of a special class of resonant connections, which is somewhat simpler than that of [3].

Abstract: This user's guide (updated version) consists of two parts. The first part is an extensive survey contributed to the Encyclopedia of Mathematical Physics, 2nd edition. It covers many of the main constructions, definitions, and applications of the classical configuration spaces of points. The second part delves into the geometry of chromatic configuration spaces, giving a detailed proof of the remarkable result that the Poincar\'e polynomial of the chromatic configuration spaces of $\mathbb R^N$, associated to a finite simple graph $\Gamma$, corresponds to the reciprocal of the chromatic polynomial of the graph (with signs). Further applications and a stable splitting are given.</description>

      <title>The loop equations for noncommutative geometries on quivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a path integral over Dirac operators that averages over noncommutative geometries on a fixed graph, as the title reveals, using quiver representations. We prove algebraic relations that are satisfied by the expectation value of the respective observables, computed in terms of integrals over unitary groups, with weights defined by the spectral action. These equations generalise the Makeenko-Migdal equations -- the constraints of lattice gauge theory -- from lattices to arbitrary graphs. As a perspective, our loop equations are combined with positivity conditions (on a matrix parametrised by composition of Wilson loops). On a simple quiver this combination known as `bootstrap' is fully worked out. The respective partition function boils down to an integral known as Gross-Witten-Wadia model; their solution confirms the solution bootstrapped by our loop equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09798v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a class of polynomials that we call fused Specht polynomials and use them to characterize irreducible representations of the fused Hecke algebra with parameter $q=-1$ in the space of polynomials. We apply the fused Specht polynomials to construct a basis for a space of holomorphic (chiral) conformal blocks with central charge $c=1$ which are degenerate at each point. In conformal field theory, this corresponds to all primary fields having conformal weight in the Kac table. The associated correlation functions are expected to give rise to conformally invariant boundary conditions for the Gaussian free field, which has also been verified in special cases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In both the random hopping model and at topological phase transitions in one-dimensional chiral systems, the Lyapunov exponent vanishes at zero energy, but is here shown to have an inverse logarithmic increase with a coefficient that is computed explicitly. This is the counterpart of the Dyson spike in the density of states. The argument also transposes to the free energy density of the random field Ising model, and more generally to many so-called balanced hyperbolic critical points. It is based on the fact that the Furstenberg measure in rescaled logarithmic Dyson-Schmidt variables can be well-approximated by an absolutely continuous measure with trapezoidal density.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study particle dynamics under curl forces. These forces are a class of non-conservative, non-dissipative, position-dependent forces that cannot be expressed as gradient of a potential function. We show that the fundamental quantity of particle dynamics under curl forces is a work $1$-form. By using the Darboux classification of differential $1$-forms on $\mathbb{R}^2$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$, we establish that any curl force in two dimensions has at most two generalized potentials, while in three dimensions, it has at most three. These potentials generalize the single potential of conservative systems. For any curl force field, we introduce a corresponding conservative force field -- the conservative auxiliary force. The Hamiltonian of this conservative force is a conserved quantity of motion for the dynamics of a particle under the curl force, although it is not the physical energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermodynamics of Dirac fields under the influence of external electromagnetic fields is studied. For perturbations which act only for finite time, the influence of the perturbation can be described by an automorphism which can be unitarily implemented in the GNS representations of KMS states, a result long known for the Fock representation. For time-independent perturbations, however, the time evolution cannot be implemented in typical cases, so the standard methods of quantum statistical mechanics do not apply. Instead we show that a smooth switching on of the external potential allows a comparison of the free and the perturbed time evolution, and approach to equilibrium, a possible existence of non-equilibrium stationary states (NESS) and Araki's relative entropy can be investigated. As a byproduct, we find an explicit formula for the relative entropy of gauge invariant quasi-free states.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Normal Form Power Series for Infinite-Dimensional Lie Pseudo-Group Actions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.08869v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the convergence of normal form power series for suitably nonsingular analytic submanifolds under a broad class of infinite-dimensional Lie pseudo-group actions. Our theorem is illustrated by a number of examples, and includes, as a particular case, Chern and Moser's celebrated convergence theorem for normal forms of real hypersurfaces. The construction of normal forms relies on the equivariant moving frame method, while the convergence proof is based on the realization that the normal form can be recovered as part of the solution to an initial value problem for an involutive system of differential equations, whose analyticity is guaranteed by the Cartan-K\"ahler Theorem.</description>

      <title>Uniform convergence of Dyson Ferrari--Spohn diffusions to the Airy line ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.03723v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Dyson Ferrari--Spohn diffusion $\mathcal{X}^N = (\mathcal{X}^N_1,\dots,\mathcal{X}^N_N)$, consisting of $N$ non-intersecting Ferrari--Spohn diffusions $\mathcal{X}^N_1 &gt; \cdots &gt; \mathcal{X}^N_N &gt; 0$ on $\mathbb{R}$. This object was introduced by Ioffe, Velenik, and Wachtel (2018) as a scaling limit for line ensembles of $N$ non-intersecting random walks above a hard wall with area tilts, which model certain three-dimensional interfaces in statistical physics. It was shown by Ferrari and Shlosman (2023) that as $N\to\infty$, after a spatial shift of order $N^{2/3}$ and constant rescaling in time, the top curve $\mathcal{X}^N_1$ converges to the $\mathrm{Airy}_2$ process in the sense of finite-dimensional distributions. We extend this result by showing that the full ensemble $\mathcal{X}^N$ converges with the same shift and time scaling to the Airy line ensemble in the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets. In our argument we formulate a Brownian Gibbs property with area tilts for $\mathcal{X}^N$, which we show is equivalent after a global parabolic shift to the usual Brownian Gibbs property introduced by Corwin and Hammond (2014).</description>

      <title>A general approach to massive upper bound for two-point function with application to self-avoiding walk torus plateau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a sufficient condition for the two-point function of a statistical mechanical model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d &gt; 2$, to be bounded uniformly near a critical point by $|x|^{-(d-2)} \exp [ -c|x| / \xi ]$, where $\xi$ is the correlation length. The condition is given in terms of a convolution equation satisfied by the two-point function, and we verify the condition for strictly self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d &gt; 4$ using the lace expansion. As an example application, we use the uniform bound to study the self-avoiding walk on a $d$-dimensional discrete torus with $d &gt; 4$, proving a ``plateau'' of the torus two-point function, a result previously obtained for weakly self-avoiding walk in dimensions $d &gt; 4$ by Slade. Our method has the potential to be applied to other statistical mechanical models on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ or on the torus.</description>

      <title>Representations of a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra, Clebsch-Gordan map, and Fenchel-Nielsen representation of complex Chern-Simons theory at level-${N}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08176v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A family of infinite-dimensional irreducible $*$-representations on $\mathcal{H}\simeq L^2(\mathbb{R})\otimes\mathbb{C}^N$ is defined for a quantum-deformed Lorentz algebra $\mathscr{U}_{\bf q}(sl_2)\otimes \mathscr{U}_{\widetilde{\bf {q}}}(sl_2)$, where $\mathbf{q}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^2)]$ and $\tilde{\mathbf{q}}=\exp[\frac{\pi i}{N}(1+b^{-2})]$ with $N\in\mathbb{Z}_+$ and $|b|=1$. The representations are constructed with the irreducible representation of quantum torus algebra at level-$N$, which is developed from the quantization of $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory. We study the Clebsch-Gordan decomposition of the tensor product representation, and we show that it reduces to the same problem as diagonalizing the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators in quantizing $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ Chern-Simons theory on 4-holed sphere. Finally, we explicitly compute the spectral decomposition of the complex Fenchel-Nielson length operators and the corresponding direct-integral representation of the Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$, which we call the Fenchel-Nielson representation.</description>

      <title>Convergence to stationary measures for the half-space log-gamma polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the point-to-point half-space log-gamma polymer model in the unbound phase. We prove that the free energy increment process on the anti-diagonal path converges to the top marginal of a two-layer Markov chain with an explicit description, which can be interpreted as two random walks conditioned softly never to intersect. This limiting law is a stationary measure for the polymer on the anti-diagonal path.
  The starting point of our analysis is an embedding of the free energy into the half-space log-gamma line ensemble recently constructed by Barraquand, Corwin, and Das. Given the Gibbsian line ensemble structure, the main contribution of our work lies in developing a route to access and prove convergence to stationary measures via line ensemble techniques. Our argument relies on a description of the limiting behavior of two softly non-intersecting random walk bridges around their starting point, a result established in this paper that may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: We study the large deviations for focusing Gibbs measures by analyzing the asymptotic behavior of the free energy in the infinite volume limit. This is the invariant Gibbs measure for the dynamical $\Phi^3_2$-models. From our sharp estimates for the partition function, we establish a concentration phenomenon of the $\Phi^3_2$-measure around the zero field, leading to a triviality result in the infinite volume: the ensemble collapses onto a delta function on the zero field.</description>

      <title>A purely geometrical Aharonov-Bohm effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13919v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an application of the affine covariant integral quantization (ACIQ) (Adv.Oper.Theory, 5, 901, 2020, Adv.Oper.Theory, 7.1, 2020) to quantum mechanics on the punctured plane. The associated four-dimensional phase space is identified with the similitude group SIM(2), which comprises translations, rotations, and dilations of the plane. Due to the topology of the punctured plane, our quantization procedure gives rise to an affine vector potential. This potential can be interpreted as the Aharonov-Bohm (AB) gauge field produced by an infinite solenoid. This observation supports a reinterpretation of the AB effect: it emerges from the topological constraint imposed by the impenetrable coil rather than from an externally applied classical gauge field. In addition to this gauge structure, ACIQ also generates a repulsive, centrifugal-like scalar potential, a feature already encountered when applying ACIQ to motion on the half-line, whose phase space is the open half-plane. These results provide a new perspective on the AB effect, highlighting the central roles of topology and symmetry in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Ising Models with Hidden Markov Structure: Applications to Probabilistic Inference in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13927v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate tree-indexed Markov chains (Gibbs measures) defined by a Hamiltonian that couples two Ising layers: hidden spins \(s(x) \in \{\pm 1\}\) and observed spins \(\sigma(x) \in \{\pm 1\}\) on a Cayley tree. The Hamiltonian incorporates Ising interactions within each layer and site-wise emission couplings between layers, extending hidden Markov models to a bilayer Markov random field.
  Specifically, we explore translation-invariant Gibbs measures (TIGM) of this Hamiltonian on Cayley trees.
  Under certain explicit conditions on the model's parameters, we demonstrate that there can be up to three distinct TIGMs. Each of these measures represents an equilibrium state of the spin system. These measures provide a structured approach to inference on hierarchical data in machine learning. They have practical applications in tasks such as denoising, weakly supervised learning, and anomaly detection. The Cayley tree structure is particularly advantageous for exact inference due to its tractability.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions of which form the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <title>Self-Dual Electrodynamics via the Characteristic Method: Relativistic and Carrollian Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electric-magnetic duality plays a pivotal role in understanding the structure of nonlinear electrodynamics (NED). The Gaillard-Zumino (GZ) criterion provides a powerful constraint for identifying self-dual theories. In this work, we systematically explore solutions to the GZ self-duality condition by applying the method of characteristics, a robust tool for solving nonlinear partial differential equations. Our approach enables the construction of new classes of Lagrangians that respect duality symmetry, both in the relativistic and Carrollian frameworks. In the relativistic setting, we not only recover well-known examples such as Born-Infeld and ModMax theories, but also identify novel models. We then generalize the GZ formalism to the Carrollian case and construct several classes of Carrollian self-dual non-linear electrodynamic models. Remarkably, we demonstrate that the characteristic flow exhibits an attractor behavior, in the sense that different seed theories that may not be self-dual can generate the same descendant self-dual Lagrangian. These findings broaden the landscape of self-dual theories and open new directions for exploring duality in ultra-relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Mirror Symmetry in Geometric Constraints: Analytic and Riemann-Roch Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06610v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon the discovery of mirror symmetry phenomena in compatible pair Spencer complexes, this paper develops rigorous analytical foundations through systematic application of elliptic perturbation theory and characteristic class analysis. We establish a comprehensive multi-level framework revealing the mathematical mechanisms underlying the symbolic transformation $(D,\lambda) \mapsto (D,-\lambda)$: metric invariance analysis via Spencer metric theory, topological isomorphisms through elliptic operator perturbation methods, and algebraic geometric equivalences via GAGA principle and characteristic class machinery.
  Main results include: (1) Rigorous proof of Spencer-Hodge Laplacian perturbation relations and cohomological mirror isomorphisms using Fredholm theory; (2) Complete characteristic class equivalence theorems establishing algebraic geometric foundations for mirror symmetry; (3) Systematic Spencer-Riemann-Roch decomposition formulas with explicit error estimates on Calabi-Yau manifolds; (4) Computational verification frameworks demonstrated on elliptic curves.
  This research demonstrates that mirror symmetry in constraint geometry possesses deep analytical structure accessible through modern elliptic theory and algebraic geometry, establishing Spencer complexes as a bridge between constraint analysis and contemporary geometric theory.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness and orbital stability of solitary waves for Zakharov-Ito equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07053v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Zakharov-Ito equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} u_t+u_{xxx}+3uu_x+\rho\rho_x=0,\\ \rho_t+{(u\rho)}_x=0. \end{cases} \end{equation*} We prove the local well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s&gt;3/2$ and global well-posedness in $H^s\times H^s$ for $s\geq2$. When $\rho=0$, the Zakharov-Ito equation reduces to the KdV equation, hence has solitary waves with speeds $c\in(0,+\infty)$. We prove the orbital stability of these solitary waves in $H^1\times L^2$ by combining a variational approach and the framework of Grillakis, Shatah and Strauss \cite{GSS1987}.</description>

      <title>Delayed Arrow-of-Time Detection in Signed Laplacian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how rapidly the direction of time becomes operationally detectable from mesoscopic data when state-weights may be positive or negative. In contrast with classical Markov processes -- where forward evolution is instantly distinguishable from its reverse -- signed dynamics can render the arrow of time undetectable during an initial interval. Assume the generator of the signed dynamics is a symmetric signed Laplacian with a single linear invariant and a phase-space Second Law holds in the form of non-decreasing R\'enyi-$2$ entropy. Drawing on recent results on eventual exponential positivity of signed Laplacians (Chen et al., 2021), we define a test that correctly identifies the direction of thermodynamic time if conducted over a time interval of length at least $\tau$. We go on to prove that the test cannot deliver an incorrect conclusion if conducted over a shorter interval. Dropping symmetry, we exhibit a superquantum example where $\tau = +\infty$, so that the arrow of time remains permanently undetectable under our test.</description>
