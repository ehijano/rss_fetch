      <title>Exceptional Fano varieties with small minimal log discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct exceptional Fano varieties with the smallest known minimal log discrepancies in all dimensions. These varieties are well-formed hypersurfaces in weighted projective space. Their minimal log discrepancies decay doubly exponentially with dimension, and achieve the optimal value in dimension 2.</description>

      <title>On the automorphism groups of smooth Fano threefolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{X}$ be a smooth Fano threefold over the complex numbers of Picard rank $1$ with finite automorphism group. We give numerical restrictions on the order of the automorphism group $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{X})$ provided the genus $g(\mathcal{X})\leq 10$ and $\mathcal{X}$ is not an ordinary smooth Gushel-Mukai threefold. More precisely, we show that the order $|\mathrm{Aut}(\mathcal{X})|$ divides a certain explicit number depending on the genus of $\mathcal{X}$. We use a classification of Fano threefolds in terms of complete intersections in homogeneous varieties and the previous paper of A. Gorinov and the author regarding the topology of spaces of regular sections.</description>

      <title>Vanishing criteria for Ceresa cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C$ be a smooth projective curve, and let $J$ be its Jacobian. We prove vanishing criteria for the Ceresa cycle $\kappa(C) \in \mathrm{CH}_1(J)\otimes \mathbb{Q}$ in the Chow group of 1-cycles on $J$. Namely,
  $(A)$ If $\mathrm{H}_{\mathrm{prim}}^3(J)^{\mathrm{Aut}(C)} = 0$, then $\kappa(C)$ vanishes;
  $(B)$ If $\mathrm{H}^0(J, \Omega_J^3)^{\mathrm{Aut}(C)} = 0$ and the Hodge conjecture holds, then $\kappa(C)$ vanishes modulo algebraic equivalence.
  We then study the first interesting case where $(B)$ holds but $(A)$ does not, namely the case of Picard curves $C \colon y^3 = x^4 + ax^2 + bx + c$. Using work of Schoen on the Hodge conjecture, we show that the Ceresa cycle of a Picard curve is torsion in the Griffiths group. Moreover, we determine exactly when it is torsion in the Chow group. As a byproduct, we show that there are infinitely many plane quartic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$ with torsion Ceresa cycle (in fact, there is a one parameter family of such curves). Finally, we determine which automorphism group strata are contained in the vanishing locus of the universal Ceresa cycle over $\mathcal{M}_3$.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite abelian group acting faithfully on ${\mathbb C}{\mathbb P}^1$ via holomorphic automorphisms. In \cite{DF2} the $G$--equivariant algebraic vector bundles on $G$--invariant affine open subsets of ${\mathbb C}{\mathbb P}^1$ were classified. We classify the $G$--equivariant algebraic vector bundles on ${\mathbb C}{\mathbb P}^1$.</description>

      <title>Clifford representatives via the uniform algebraic rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the uniform algebraic rank of a divisor class on a finite graph. We show that it lies between Caporaso's algebraic rank and the combinatorial rank of Baker and Norine. We prove the Riemann-Roch theorem for the uniform algebraic rank, and show that both the algebraic and the uniform algebraic rank are realized on effective divisors. As an application, we use the uniform algebraic rank to show that Clifford representatives always exist. We conclude with an explicit description of such Clifford representatives for a large class of graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solid modules over $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$, introduced by Clausen and Scholze, are a well-behaved variant of complete topological vector spaces that forms a symmetric monoidal Grothendieck abelian category. For a discrete field $k$, we construct the category of ultrasolid $k$-modules, which specialises to solid modules over $\mathbb{Q}$ or $\mathbb{F}_p$. In this setting, we show some commutative algebra results like an ultrasolid variant of Nakayama's lemma. We also explore higher algebra in the form of animated and $\mathbb{E}_\infty$ ultrasolid $k$-algebras, and their deformation theory. We focus on the subcategory of complete profinite $k$-algebras, which we prove is contravariantly equivalent to equal characteristic formal moduli problems with coconnective tangent complex.</description>

      <title>All crepant resolutions of hyperpolygon spaces via their Cox rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct and enumerate all crepant resolutions of hyperpolygon spaces, a family of conical symplectic singularities arising as Nakajima quiver varieties associated to a star-shaped quiver. We provide an explicit presentation of the Cox ring of any such crepant resolution. Using techniques developed by Arzhantsev-Derenthal-Hausen-Laface we construct all crepant resolutions of the hyperpolygon spaces, including those which are not projective over the singularity. We find that the number of crepant resolutions equals the Ho\c{s}ten-Morris numbers. In proving these results, we obtain a description of all complete geometric quotients associated to the classical GIT problem constructing moduli spaces of ordered points on the projective line. These moduli spaces appear as the Lagrangian subvarieties of crepant resolutions of hyperpolygon spaces fixed under the conical action.</description>

      <title>On the Tensor Property of Bernstein-Sato Polynomial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M. Popa proposed a question whether $b_{f\cdot g}(s) = b_f(s)b_g(s)$ holds for $f\in \mathbb C[x_1,...,x_n]$ and $g\in \mathbb C[y_1,...,y_m]$, where $b_{f}$, $b_g$, and $b_{f\cdot g}$ are corresponding Bernstein-Sato polynomials. It is a subtle problem that seems clear but turns out highly non-trivial. In this paper, we give a positive answer for Popa's question and generalize the result to arbitrary non-singular complex varieties $X$ and $Y$, and the tensor of effective divisors $D_1$ and $D_2$ on them respectively, and prove a generalized theorem. The theorem also leads to a multiplicative result of Igusa's strong monodromy conjecture. Moreover, we propose two analogous conjectures about Bernstein-Sato polynomials for ideals and prove them for monomial ideals.</description>

      <title>On semiample vector bundles and parallelizable compact complex manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a characterization of parallelizable compact complex manifolds and their quotients using holomorphic symmetric differentials. In particular we show that compact complex manifolds of Kodaira dimension 0 having strongly semiample cotangent bundle are parallelizable manifolds, while compact complex manifolds of Kodaira dimension 0 having weakly semiample cotangent bundle are quotients of parallelizable manifolds. The main constructions used involve considerations about semiampleness of vector bundles, which are themselves of interest. As a byproduct we prove that compact manifolds having Kodaira dimension 0 and weakly sermiample cotangent bundle have infinite fundamental group, and we conjecture that this should be the case for all compact complex manifolds not of general type with weakly semiample cotangent bundle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a compact connected Riemann surface of genus $g \geq 3$ and $S \rightarrow X$ a $2:1$ branched covering defined by a generic quadratic differential on $X$. In the following notes, we explore how taking direct images of line bundles defined by certain distinguished special divisors on $S$ gives rank-2 bundles having nilpotent Higgs fields on $X$. The key ingredient is the notion of Baker-Akhiezer divisors associated to Higgs bundles and choices of subbundles of the underlying rank-2 bundles.</description>

      <title>Splitting aspects of holomorphic distributions with locally free tangent sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17415v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we mainly deal with a two-dimensional singular holomorphic distribution $\mathcal{D}$ defined on $M$, in the two situations $M=\mathbb{P}^n$ or $M=(\mathbb{C}^n,0)$, tangent to a one-dimensional foliation $\mathcal{G}$ on $M$, and whose tangent sheaf $T_{\mathcal{D}}$ is locally free. We provide sufficient conditions on $\mathcal{G}$ so that there is another one-dimensional foliation $\mathcal{H}$ on $M$ tangent to $\mathcal{D}$, such that their respective tangent sheaves satisfy the splitting relation $T_{\mathcal{D}}=T_{\mathcal{G}} \oplus T_{\mathcal{H}}$. As an application, we show that if $\mathcal{F}$ is a codimension one holomorphic foliation on $\mathbb{P}^3$ with locally free tangent sheaf and tangent to a nontrivial holomorphic vector field on $\mathbb{P}^3$, then $T_{\mathcal{F}}$ splits. Some division results for vector fields and differential forms are also obtained.</description>

      <title>Five-dimensional compatible systems and the Tate conjecture for elliptic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(\rho_\lambda\colon G_{\mathbb Q}\to \operatorname{GL}_5(\overline{E}_\lambda))_\lambda$ be a strictly compatible system of Galois representations such that no Hodge--Tate weight has multiplicity $5$. We show that if $\rho_{\lambda_0}$ is irreducible for some $\lambda_0$, then $\rho_\lambda$ is irreducible for all but finitely many $\lambda$. More generally, if $(\rho_\lambda)_\lambda$ is essentially self-dual, we show that either $\rho_\lambda$ is irreducible for all but finitely many $\lambda$, or the compatible system $(\rho_\lambda)_\lambda$ decomposes as a direct sum of lower-dimensional compatible systems.
  We apply our results to study the Tate conjecture for elliptic surfaces. For example, if $X_0\colon y^2 + (t+3)xy + y= x^3$, we prove the codimension one $\ell$-adic Tate conjecture for all but finitely many $\ell$, for all but finitely many general, degree $3$, genus $2$ branched multiplicative covers of $X_0$.
  To prove this result, we classify the elliptic surfaces into six families, and prove, using perverse sheaf theory and a result of Cadoret--Tamagawa, that if one surface in a family satisfies the Tate conjecture, then all but finitely many do. We then verify the Tate conjecture for one representative of each family by making our irreducibility result explicit: for the compatible system arising from the transcendental part of $H^2_{\mathrm{et}}(X_{\overline{\mathbb Q}}, \mathbb{Q}_\ell(1))$ for a representative $X$, we formulate an algorithm that takes as input the characteristic polynomials of Frobenius, and terminates if and only if the compatible system is irreducible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present paper we study the geometry of the closed Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cells of the quiver Grassmannians associated to a nilpotent representation of a cyclic quiver defined by a single matrix. For the special case, where we choose subrepresentations of dimension $\mathbf{1}=(1,\dots,1)$, the main result of this paper is that the closed Bia{\l}ynicki-Birula cells are smooth. We also discuss the multiplicative structure of the cohomology ring of such spaces. Namely, we describe the so-called Knutson-Tao basis in context to the basis of equivariant cohomology that is dual to fundamental classes in equivariant homology.</description>

      <title>Versality of Brill-Noether flags and degeneracy loci of twice-marked curves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2103.10969v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Brill-Noether degeneracy locus is closure in $\Pic^d(C)$ of the locus of line bundles with a specified rank function $r(a,b) = h^0(C,L(-ap-bq))$. These loci generalize the classical Brill-Noether loci $W^r_d(C)$ as well as Brill-Noether loci with imposed ramification. For general $(C,p,q)$ we determine the dimension, singular locus, and intersection class of Brill-Noether degeneracy loci, generalizing classical results about $W^r_d(C)$. The intersection class has a combinatorial interpretation in terms of the number of reduced words for a permutation associated to the rank function, or alternatively the number of saturated chains in the Bruhat order. The essential tool is a versality theorem for a certain pair of flags on $\Pic^d(C)$, conjectured by Melody Chan and the author.</description>

      <title>Nonabelian basechange theorems &amp; \'etale homotopy theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.00938v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper has two main goals. First, we prove nonabelian refinements of basechange theorems in \'etale cohomology (i.e., prove analogues of the classical statements for sheaves of spaces). Second, we apply these theorems to prove a number of results about the \'etale homotopy type. Specifically, we prove nonabelian refinements of the smooth basechange theorem, Huber-Gabber affine analogue of the proper basechange theorem, and Fujiwara-Gabber rigidity theorem. Our methods also recover Chough's nonabelian refinement of the proper basechange theorem. Transporting an argument of Bhatt-Mathew to the nonabelian setting, we apply nonabelian proper basechange to show that the profinite \'etale homotopy type satisfies arc-descent. Using nonabelian smooth and proper basechange and descent, we give rather soft proofs of a number of K\"unneth formulas for the \'etale homotopy type.</description>

      <title>Le principe de Hasse pour les intersections de deux quadriques dans $\mathbb{P}^7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.00313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove the Hasse principle for a smooth proper model of a geometrically integral non-conical intersection of two quadrics in the projective space of dimension 7 over a number field. This result generalizes the result of Heath-Brown who established the statement in the smooth case. Our argument is built upon the ideas of Colliot-Th\'el\`ene and the fibration method for zero-cycles in the form of Harpaz-Wittenberg.</description>

      <title>Special divisors in special divisor classes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As in algebraic geometry, an effective divisor class on a vertex-weighted graph is called special if also its residual class is effective. We study the question, when this is true already on the level of divisors; that is, when there exists an effective divisor in the class whose residual is effective as well, so called uniform divisors. We show that uniform divisors exist in any special class on graphs with all vertex weights non-zero; we show that in general a representative can be chosen, whose value is off by at most one on vertices of weight zero. To prove this, we generalize the notion of divisors that are reduced with respect to a vertex to divisors that are reduced with respect to a set of vertices. We compare this notion to a previous generalization due to Luo. As an application, we obtain a new algorithm to determine whether a divisor class is effective.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian families of Bridgeland moduli spaces from Gushel-Mukai fourfolds and double EPW cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11598v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a very general Gushel-Mukai (GM) variety of dimension $n\geq 4$, and let $Y$ be a smooth hyperplane section. There are natural pull-back and push-forward functors between the semi-orthogonal components (known as the Kuznetsov components) of the derived categories of $X$ and $Y$. In the first part of the paper, we prove that the Bridgeland stability of objects is preserved by both pull-back and push-forward functors. We then explore various applications of this result, such as constructing an 8-dimensional smooth family of Lagrangian subvarieties for each moduli space of stable objects in the Kuznetsov component of a general GM fourfold, and proving the projectivity of the moduli spaces of semistable objects of any class in the Kuznetsov component of a general GM threefold, as conjectured by Perry, Pertusi, and Zhao.
  In the second part, we study in detail the double EPW cube, a 6-dimensional hyperk\"ahler manifold associated with a very general GM fourfold $X$, through the Bridgeland moduli space, and show that it is the maximal rationally connected (MRC) quotient of the Hilbert scheme of twisted cubics on $X$. We also prove that it admits a covering by Lagrangian subvarieties, constructed from the Hilbert schemes of twisted cubics on GM threefolds.</description>

      <title>Equidistribution without stability for toric surface maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an equidistribution result for iterated preimages of curves by a large class of rational maps $f:\mathbb{CP}^2\dashrightarrow\mathbb{CP}^2$ that cannot be birationally conjugated to algebraically stable maps. The maps, which include recent examples with transcendental first dynamical degree, are distinguished by the fact that they have constant Jacobian determinant relative to the natural holomorphic two form on the algebraic torus. Under the additional hypothesis that $f$ has "small topological degree'' we also prove an equidistribution result for iterated forward images of curves.
  To prove our results we systematically develop the idea of a positive closed $(1,1)$ current and its cohomology class on the inverse limit of all toric surfaces. This, in turn, relies upon a careful study of positive closed $(1,1)$ currents on individual toric surfaces. This framework may be useful in other contexts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study mixtures of decomposable graphical models, focusing on their ideals and dimensions. For mixtures of clique stars, we characterize the ideals in terms of ideals of mixtures of independence models. We also give a recursive formula for their ML degrees. Finally, we prove that second secant varieties of all other decomposable graphical models have the expected dimension.</description>

      <title>A formal category theoretic approach to the homotopy theory of dg categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07873v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a bicategory which refines the localization of the category of dg categories with respect to quasi-equivalences and investigate its properties via formal category theory. Concretely, we first introduce the bicategory of dg categories $\mathsf{DBimod}$ whose Hom categories are the derived categories of dg bimodules and then define the desired bicategory as the sub-bicategory $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr}$ consisting only of right quasi-representable dg bimodules. The first half of the paper is devoted to the study of adjunctions and equivalences in these bicategories. We then show that the embedding $\mathsf{DBimod}^\text{rqr} \hookrightarrow \mathsf{DBimod}$ is a proarrow equipment in the sense of Richard J. Wood, which is a framework for formal category theory and makes it possible to talk about (weighted) (co)limits in an abstract way. Thus we obtain the notion of homotopical (co)limits in a dg category, including homotopical shifts and cones, by which we obtain a formal characterization of pretriangulated dg categories. As an immediate application we give a conceptual proof of the fact that the pretriangulatedness is preserved under the gluing procedure.</description>

      <title>SYZ and optimal transport stability of Weyl polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove optimal transport stability (in the sense of Andreasson and the second author) for reflexive Weyl polytopes: reflexive polytopes which are convex hulls of an orbit of a Weyl group. When the reflexive Weyl polytope is Delzant, it follows from work of Li, Andreasson, Hultgren, Jonsson, Mazzon, McCleerey, that the weak metric SYZ conjecture holds for the Dwork family in the corresponding toric Fano manifold. In particular, we show that the weak metric SYZ conjecture holds for centrally symmetric smooth Fano toric manifolds.</description>
