      <title>Evolution of the "long tail" concept for scientific data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review paper explores the evolution of discussions about "long-tail" scientific data in the scholarly literature. The "long-tail" concept, originally used to explain trends in digital consumer goods, was first applied to scientific data in 2007 to refer to a vast array of smaller, heterogeneous data collections that cumulatively represent a substantial portion of scientific knowledge. However, these datasets, often referred to as "long-tail data," are frequently mismanaged or overlooked due to inadequate data management practices and institutional support. This paper examines the changing landscape of discussions about long-tail data over time, situated within broader ecosystems of research data management and the natural interplay between "big" and "small" data. The review also bridges discussions on data curation in Library &amp; Information Science (LIS) and domain-specific contexts, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of the long-tail concept's utility for effective data management outcomes. The review aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this concept, its terminological diversity in the literature, and its utility for guiding data management, overall informing current and future information science research and practice.</description>

      <title>SocialED: A Python Library for Social Event Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SocialED is a comprehensive, open-source Python library designed to support social event detection (SED) tasks, integrating 19 detection algorithms and 14 diverse datasets. It provides a unified API with detailed documentation, offering researchers and practitioners a complete solution for event detection in social media. The library is designed with modularity in mind, allowing users to easily adapt and extend components for various use cases. SocialED supports a wide range of preprocessing techniques, such as graph construction and tokenization, and includes standardized interfaces for training models and making predictions. By integrating popular deep learning frameworks, SocialED ensures high efficiency and scalability across both CPU and GPU environments. The library is built adhering to high code quality standards, including unit testing, continuous integration, and code coverage, ensuring that SocialED delivers robust, maintainable software. SocialED is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/RingBDStack/SocialED} and can be installed via PyPI.</description>
