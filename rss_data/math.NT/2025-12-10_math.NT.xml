      <title>Wieferich and Mersenne primes for function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of recently introduced Wieferich primes for Drinfeld modules, as their relation with Fermat equations and finitess or non-finiteness of their number. We also introduce Mersenne numbers for Drinfeld modules, and study the links between these two notions.</description>

      <title>The $L$-polynomial of hyperelliptic function fields and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\ell$ be an odd prime, $q$ an odd prime power such that $q \not\equiv 0 \pmod \ell$, and $m$ the order of $q$ in $\F_\ell^\times$. We propose an explicit $L$-polynomial of hyperelliptic function field $K:=\F_q(T, \sqrt[\ell]{T^2+aT+b})$ with $a, b \in \F_q$ and $a^2-4b \ne 0$. Using our formula, we obtain the explicit closed formula for the class number of $K$, where $m$ is even or $m=\frac{\ell-1}{2}$.As an application, we compute the average class numbers for hyperelliptic function fields with genus up to $3$.</description>

      <title>On a bound of $p$-ranks of Iwasawa modules of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions over a quartic CM-field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. If a number field $k$ has at least one complex place, there are infinitely many $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions over $k$, and some authors studied the behavior of Iwasawa invariants of these $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. In particular, Fujii studied the case where $k$ is an imaginary quadratic field and obtained some results on the boundedness of Iwasawa $\lambda$-invariants in a certain infinite family of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions. In the present article, we give analogous theorems in the case where $k$ is a quartic CM-field. One of our main theorems determines all the Iwasawa invariants, including the $\nu$-invariants, of a certain infinite family of $\mathbb{Z}_p$-extensions over a quartic CM-field.</description>

Abstract: Using the stable twisted trace formula for the triality automorphism, we show the adjoint lifting (to GL(8)) of cuspidal representations of GL(3) with a discrete series local component. We also describe the possible isobaric decompositions of the resulting automorphic representations on GL(8).</description>

      <title>Comparison of canonical periods under base change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we prove the canonical period of a Hilbert modular form with respect to the base change of a real quadratic extension differs from the square of its own canonical period only by a $p$-adic unit under some conditions. We prove this by proving a specific version of anticyclotomic Iwasawa main conjecture for Hilbert modular forms.</description>

      <title>The St\'ephanois theorem with only prime isogenies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a strengthening of the proof of the St\'ephanois theorem. We follow the modular version by Waldschmidt, which is based in a suggestion by Daniel Bertrand, but it also applies to the original proof. The improvement is not in the result or the conditions, but in the need of weaker tools on the proof itself. More precisely, we only employ modular polynomials of prime degree, instead of polynomials of arbitrary level. Furthermore, one can restrict to primes in fixed arithmetic sequence.
  On the proof itself, the only crucial difference appears in Cinqui\`eme pas and on the final contradiction in Septi\`eme pas of Waldschmidt's proof, but for readability, we present a complete proof with this modification.
  This is part of a larger project to generalize the St\'ephanois theorem to the Igusa invariants of curves of genus two, as the Siegel modular polynomials in the literature are usually only considered for prime levels.
  The material is part of Chapter 7 of the author's PhD thesis.</description>

      <title>Generalized Discrepancy of Random Points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $L_p$-discrepancy of random point sets in high dimensions, with emphasis on small values of $p$. Although the classical $L_p$-discrepancy suffers from the curse of dimensionality for all $p \in (1,\infty)$, the gap between known upper and lower bounds remains substantial, in particular for small $p \ge 1$. To clarify this picture, we review the existing results for i.i.d.\ uniformly distributed points and derive new upper bounds for \emph{generalized} $L_p$-discrepancies, obtained by allowing non-uniform sampling densities and corresponding non-negative quadrature weights.
  Using the probabilistic method, we show that random points drawn from optimally chosen product densities lead to significantly improved upper bounds. For $p=2$ these bounds are explicit and optimal; for general $p \in [1,\infty)$ we obtain sharp asymptotic estimates. The improvement can be interpreted as a form of importance sampling for the underlying Sobolev space $F_{d,q}$.
  Our results also reveal that, even with optimal densities, the curse of dimensionality persists for random points when $p\ge 1$, and it becomes most pronounced for small $p$. This suggests that the curse should also hold for the classical $L_1$-discrepancy for deterministic point sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we will introduce a central problem in additive combinatorics, which arised from the famous van der Waerden theorem and an early conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Tur\'{a}n. The first important theorem was due to Roth in 1953. There were a number of generalized or improved results afterwards, which we call Roth-type theorems. We will list them and try to give concise expositions to the ideas in some of the proofs without much prior knowledge.</description>

      <title>Raimi's theorem for manifolds with circle symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Raimi's classical theorem establishes a partition of the natural numbers with a remarkable unavoidability property: for every finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$, there is a color class whose translate meets both parts of the partition in infinitely many points. Recently, Kang, Koh, and Tran have extended this phenomenon to the circle group, proving that there exists a measurable partition of the circle such that every finite measurable cover admits a rotation whose image meets each part of the partition in positive measure. This paper shows that this phenomenon extends beyond compact abelian groups to a wide class of non-group geometric surfaces that still exhibit \textit{a hidden one-dimensional symmetry}. Specifically, we establish analogs of Raimi's theorem for three families of surfaces (with their natural surface measures): the unit sphere $S^{n-1} \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, rotational power surfaces (such as cones and paraboloids), and circular cylindrical surfaces. The common feature is that each of these surfaces carries a natural measure-preserving action of the circle group by rotation in a fixed plane and admits a measurable trivialization as a product $C \times Y$. This circle-bundle structure allows the measurable Raimi partition on the base circle to be lifted to an unavoidable partition on the manifold. Our approach is unified through a general circle-bundle theorem, which reduces all three geometric cases to verifying suitable equivariance and product disintegration properties of the surface measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adapt Caro's notion of overholonomicity to give a definition of holonomic D-cap-modules on rigid analytic spaces. We prove stability under five of the six operations (both inverse image functors, duality, and both direct image functors for projective morphisms), as well as base change results. Up to the open problem of stability under tensor products, we obtain an analogue of the usual six-functor formalism for holonomic D-modules.</description>

      <title>On Twists of A Family of Elliptic Curves and Their $ L-$Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:1511.07581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ E $ be an elliptic curve defined over a number field, the conjecture of Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer (BSD, for short) asserts a deep relation between the group $ E(K) $ of rational points and the $ L-$function $ L(E/K, s)$ of $ E $ at $ s = 1. $ Very few explicit results about $ E(K) $ and $ L(1) $ are known, even no general method is known to determine $ L(1) $ vanishing or not for a given elliptic curve. In this paper, we study some quantities related to BSD of a special class of elliptic curves, more precisely, we study the arithmetic of quadratic twists of elliptic curves $ y^{2} = x(x + \varepsilon p )(x + \varepsilon q) $ and their $L-$function. Based on some classical works, especially those of Greenberg, Kramer-Tunnell, Kato-Rohrlich, Manin and Mazur, under some conditions, we obtain results about the vanishing of the value at $ s = 1 $ of the $ L$-function, and explicitly determine the following quantities: the norm index $ \delta (E, \Q, K), $ the root numbers, the set of anomalous prime numbers, a few prime numbers at which the image of Galois representation are surjective. We also study the relation between the ranks of the Mordell-Weil groups, Selmer groups and Shafarevich-Tate groups, and the structure about the $ l^{\infty }-$Selmer groups and the Mordell-Weil groups over $ \Z_{l}-$extension via Iwasawa theory. These results provide some useful evidence toward verifying the BSD for a family of elliptic curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.16446v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study relative Wach modules generalising our previous works on this subject. Our main result shows a categorical equivalence between relative Wach modules and lattices inside relative crystalline representations. Using this result, we deduce a purity statement for relative crystalline representations and provide a criteria for checking crystallinity of relative $p$-adic representations. Furthermore, we interpret relative Wach modules as modules with $q$-connections, and show that for a crystalline representation, its associated Wach module together with the Nygaard filtration is the canonical $q$-deformation (after inverting $p$) of the filtered $(\varphi,\partial)$-module associated to the representation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $E/\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve. We say that $E$ has a near coincidence of level $(n,m)$ if $m \mid n$ and $\mathbb{Q}(E[n]) = \mathbb{Q}(E[m],\zeta_{n})$. We classify near coincidences of prime power level and use this result to give a classification of values of $n$ for which ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ is a nilpotent group. Along the way we prove a Gauss-Wantzel analog for the elliptic curve $E\colon y^2 = x^3-x$, showing that $\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q}$ is constructible if and only if $\varphi(n)$ is a power of 2. Assuming that there are no non-CM rational points on the modular curves $X_{ns}^{+}(p)$ for primes $p &gt; 11$, we show that ${\rm Gal}(\mathbb{Q}(E[n])/\mathbb{Q})$ nilpotent implies that $n$ is a power of $2$ or $n \in \{ 3, 5, 6, 7, 15, 21 \}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01975v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove two fast formulas for the Hurwitz values $\zeta(2,a)$ and $\zeta(3,a)$ respectively with the help of the WZ method. In them $(a)_n$ denotes the rising factorial or Pochhammer's symbol defined by $(a)_0=1$ and $(a)_n=a(a+1)\cdots(a+n-1)$ for positive integers $n$. The Huwitz $\zeta$ function is defined by $\zeta(s,a)=\zeta(0,s,a)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (k+a)^{-s}$. In addition, we can use these fast evaluations to compute also in a rapid way Dirichlet values of the kinds $L_{\chi}(2)$ and $L_{\chi}(3)$.</description>

      <title>Improvements on exponential sums related to Piatetski-Shapiro primes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a new bound to the exponential sum of the form $$ \sum_{h \sim H}\delta_h \mathop{\sum_{m\sim M}\sum_{n\sim N}}_{mn\sim x}a_{m}b_{n}\e\big(\alpha mn + h(mn + u)^{\gamma}\big), $$ by a new approach to the Type I sum. The sum can be applied to many problems related to Piatetski-Shapiro primes, which are primes of the form $\lfloor n^c \rfloor$. In this paper, we improve the admissible range of the Balog-Friedlander condition, which leads to an improvement to the ternary Goldbach problem with Piatetski-Shapiro primes. We also investigate the distribution of Piatetski-Shapiro primes in arithmetic progressions, Piatetski-Shapiro primes in the intersection of multiple Beatty sequences and so on.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that any smooth rigid analytic variety $X$ admits an affinoid covering $\{U_i\}$ such that the Banach algebras involved in the Fr\'echet--Stein presentation of the completed ring of differential operators D-cap$(U_i)$ are Auslander regular for each $i$. We use this result to prove projection formulae and adjunction results for coadmissible D-cap-modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize the integral Hasse principle for an infinite family of spherical stacky curves with genus $g\in [2/3,1)$ that are defined using generalized Fermat equations, extending a result of Darmon and Granville. We then apply our methods to find that a positive proportion of curves in our family satisfy the integral Hasse principle.</description>

      <title>Stability of torsion subgroups of elliptic curves over non-Galois extensions of odd prime degree</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18194v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a field of characteristic $0$ and $E/K$ an elliptic curve over $K$. For a finite extension $L/K$ and a prime~$\ell$, we provide Galois-theoretic sufficient conditions on $L/K$ under which $E\left(L\right)\left[\ell^{\infty}\right] = E\left(K\right)\left[\ell^{\infty}\right]$. For a non-Galois extension $L/K$ of prime degree, we relate the growth of the $\ell^{\infty}$-torsion subgroup of $E$ under the base change $L/K$ to the image of the mod-$\ell$ cyclotomic character. In particular, In particular, we refine Gonz{\'a}lez-Jim{\'e}nez's result by ruling out certain torsion structures for quintic non-Galois extensions $L/\mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23932v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conjectures of Braverman and Kazhdan, Ng\^o and Sakellaridis have motivated the development of Schwartz spaces for certain spherical varieties. We prove that under suitable assumptions these Schwartz spaces are naturally a representation of a group that we christen the modulation group. This provides a broad generalization of the defining representation of the metaplectic group. The example of a vector space and the zero locus of a quadric cone in an even number of variables are discussed in detail. In both of these cases the modulation group is closely related to algebraic groups, and we propose a conjectural method of linking modulation groups to ind-algebraic groups in general. At the end of the paper we discuss adelization and the relationship between representations of modulation groups and the Poisson summation conjecture.</description>

      <title>Perfect Sets of Liouville Numbers with Controlled Self-Powers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the arithmetic behavior of self-powers $x^x$ when $x$ is a Liouville number. Using recent ideas on strengthened Liouville approximation, we develop flexible constructions that illuminate how transcendence, Liouville properties, and "large" topological size interact in this setting. As a concrete outcome, we build a perfect set of Liouville numbers of continuum cardinality whose finite sums, finite products, and self-powers all remain Liouville. These results show that rich algebraic and topological structures persist inside the Liouville universe for the map $x\mapsto x^x$.</description>

      <title>On the $2$-torsion in class groups of number fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In $2020$, Bhargava, Shankar, Taniguchi, Thorne, Tsimerman, and Zhao proved that for a finite extension $K/\mathbb{Q}$ of degree $n\geq 5$, the size of the $2$-torsion class group is bounded by $\# h_{2}(K)=O_{n,\varepsilon}(D_{K}^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2n}+\varepsilon})$, where $D_{K}$ is the absolute discriminant of $K$. In the present paper, we improve their bound by proving that $\# h_{2}(K)=O_{n,\varepsilon}(D_{K}^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2n}-\delta_{K}+\varepsilon})$, for a constant $\delta_{K}\geq\frac{1}{28n}-\frac{3}{28n(n-1)}$.</description>

      <title>Local Zeta Functions of Multiparameter Calabi-Yau Threefolds from the Picard-Fuchs Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08067v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The deformation approach of arXiv:2104.07816 for computing zeta functions of one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds is generalised to cover also multiparameter manifolds. Consideration of the multiparameter case requires the development of an improved formalism. This allows us, among other things, to make progress on some issues left open in previous work, such as the treatment of apparent and conifold singularities and changes of coordinates. We also discuss the efficient numerical computation of the zeta functions. As examples, we compute the zeta functions of the two-parameter mirror octic, a non-symmetric split of the quintic threefold also with two parameters, and the $S_5$ symmetric five-parameter Hulek-Verrill manifolds. These examples allow us to exhibit the several new types of geometries for which our methods make practical computations possible. They also act as consistency checks, as our results reproduce and extend those of arXiv:hep-th/0409202 and arXiv:math/0304169. To make the methods developed here more approachable, a Mathematica package "CY3Zeta" for computing the zeta functions of Calabi-Yau threefolds, which is attached to this paper, is presented.</description>

Abstract: We consider infinite sequences of positive numbers. The connection between log-concavity and the Bessenrodt--Ono inequality had been in the focus of several papers. This has applications in the white noise distribution theory and combinatorics. We improve a recent result of Benfield and Roy and show that for the sequence of partition numbers $\{p(n)\}$ Nicolas' log-concavity result implies the result of Bessenrodt and Ono towards $p(n) \, p(m) &gt; p(n+m)$. We provide several examples. Benfield and Roy gave a conjecture related to $\ell $-ary partition numbers. We prove part of this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Seminorm estimates and joint ergodicity for pairwise independent Hardy sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15130v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a robust structure theory for multiple ergodic averages of commuting transformations along Hardy sequences of polynomial growth. We then apply it to derive a number of novel results on joint ergodicity, recurrence and convergence. In particular, we prove joint ergodicity for (a) pairwise independent Hardy sequences and weakly mixing transformations, (b) strongly independent Hardy sequences and ergodic transformations, (c) strongly irrationally independent Hardy sequences and totally ergodic transformations. We use these joint ergodicity results to provide new recurrence results for multidimensional patterns along strongly independent Hardy sequences, showing for instance that all subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper density contain patterns of the form
  $$ (m_1, m_2),\; (m_1 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}}\rfloor, m_2),\; (m_1, m_2 + \lfloor n^{\sqrt{2}} + n^{1/2}\rfloor).$$
  Last but not least, we positively resolve the joint ergodicity classification problem for pairwise independent Hardy sequences, of which the aforementioned families are special cases.
  While building on recent technical advances (e.g. PET coefficient tracking schemes and joint ergodicity criteria), our work introduces a number of technical developments of its own. We construct a suitable generalization of Host-Kra and box seminorms that quantitatively control ergodic averages along Hardy sequences.
  We subsequently use them to obtain Host-Kra seminorm estimates for averages along all pairwise independent Hardy sequences. Furthermore, we develop an ergodic version of the quantitative concatenation argument that has recently found extensive use in combinatorics, number theory and harmonic analysis. Lastly, we obtain new simultaneous Taylor approximations for Hardy sequences, a crucial ingredient to deal with the aforementioned classes of Hardy sequences.</description>

      <title>The Polynomial Freiman-Ruzsa (Marton) Conjecture in Integers and Finite Fields via Spectral Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04433v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We settle the Polynomial Freiman--Ruzsa (PFR/Marton) conjecture for the integers and for cyclic groups. More precisely, we show that if $A$ is a finite subset of $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$ with $|A+A| \le K|A|$, then there is a subgroup $H$ of index at most $K^{O(1)}$ such that $A$ is contained in at most $K^{O(1)}$ cosets of $H$. The proof is based on a new spectral stability dichotomy for the $L^4$ Fourier mass of $\mathbf{1}_A$: either this mass is concentrated on a span of size $K^{O(1)}$, or, after passing to a quotient of codimension $K^{O(1)}$, the doubling constant of the image of $A$ decreases by a definite power of $K$. Using Freiman modeling we transfer this dichotomy to cyclic groups, obtain polynomial Bogolyubov-type bounds, and deduce Marton's conjecture in $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z}$. As a corollary, we also recover and extend the finite-field formulation of Marton's conjecture: in odd characteristic we obtain a direct spectral proof, and together with the characteristic-2 result of Green, Gowers, Manners, and Tao this yields a complete resolution of the conjecture for all finite fields. For context beyond finite fields, we recall their theorem for abelian groups of bounded exponent.</description>
