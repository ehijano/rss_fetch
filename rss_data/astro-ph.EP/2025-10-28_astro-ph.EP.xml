      <title>Metallicity regulates planet formation across all masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of stellar metallicity in shaping planetary systems is central to our understanding of planet formation. While the core accretion paradigm is widely accepted as the dominant mechanism for forming low- and intermediate-mass planets, the origin of the most massive planets remains debated, with gravitational instability often invoked to explain their existence. In this study, we analyze the dependence of planet formation on metallicity using the total heavy-element mass fraction (Z), which is a proxy for the composition of the protoplanetary disk inferred from stellar photospheres. We show that even the most massive planets form preferentially in metal-rich environments. Z correlates not only with the presence of planets, but also with planetary system multiplicity and total planetary mass. The most massive planets are found in the most metal-rich environments, and, in agreement with core-accretion theory, only the upper end of the planetary mass distribution shows a clear positive correlation with metallicity. These findings suggest that the chemical enrichment of protoplanetary disks plays a central role in shaping the full spectrum of planetary masses.</description>

      <title>Definition of Exoplanets and Brown Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter reviews the definition of exoplanets and of brown dwarfs. Emphasis is given to the separation of these two populations. A traditional view is to declare {\guillemotleft} planet {\guillemotright} objects with a mass &lt; 13 M Jup and {\guillemotleft} brown dwarf {\guillemotright} objects with a mass &gt; 13 M Jup . By analogy with Solar System planets, a better definition is to call {\guillemotleft} planets {\guillemotright} objects formed by accretion of dust and planetesimals in a disk. An by extension of the primitive introduction of the word {\guillemotleft} brown dwarf {\guillemotright} for failed stars by Jill Tarter, this term must be reserved to objects formed by gravitational collapse in a molecular gas cloud. The two definitions do not coincide since a {\guillemotleft} brown dwarf {\guillemotright} can have a mass down to about 6 Jupiter mass. And there is no physical reason to assert that a 20 Jupiter mass object has not been formed by accretion. From there, the difficulty is to decide if an object of say 20 Jupiter mass is formed by dust accretion or by gravitational collapse. A future observational test to solve this difficulty is presented.</description>

      <title>Earth Analogs in Reflected Light: Insights from Early Spectral Characterization in Unconstrained Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A next generation of space-based observatories aims to detect and characterize potentially Earth-like exoplanets around Sun-like stars using reflected light spectroscopy. However, it remains unclear how such direct imaging observations$-$limited in spectral coverage and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N)$-$translate into constraints on atmospheric composition and habitability. Coronagraphs used for high-contrast imaging typically operate over narrow bandpasses, and exposure time limits can restrict data quality. To optimize observing strategies and instrument design, we use our atmospheric retrieval tool, $\texttt{rfast}$, to assess the performance of a $\mathit{Habitable\ Worlds\ Observatory}$-type mission across different spectral bandpasses ("Red", "Blue", "Visible", "NIR", and their combination) and S/N levels (10, 15, and 20; from moderate to moderate-high observation quality) in retrieving a wide range of 17 atmospheric, surface, bulk, and orbital parameters of a habitable Earth analog. We outline the observation requirements for each parameter and the detection capabilities of each case, within a novel scenario where spectral data are taken "early", prior to achieving orbit constraints (which may require repeat visits to a system). For coronagraph-restricted and NIR-only bandpasses, most of the limited retrievable information is already captured at S/N = 10, with little improvement at higher S/N. For broader spectral coverage, the quality and quantity of retrieved information improve with increasing S/N, but combining visible and NIR ranges provides the most comprehensive characterization, even at moderate S/N. To maximize returns, wider spectral coverage should be prioritized over improving S/N when spectral access is limited.</description>

      <title>Impact of Charge Transfer Inefficiency on transit light-curves: A correction strategy for PLATO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PLATO is designed to detect Earth-sized exoplanets around solar-type stars and to measure their radii with accuracy better than $2\%$ via the transit method. Charge transfer inefficiency (CTI), a by-product of radiation damage to CCDs, can jeopardize this accuracy and therefore must be corrected. We assess and quantify the impact of CTI on transit-depth measurements and develop a correction strategy that restores CTI-biased depths within the accuracy budget. Using a calibration dataset generated with PLATOSim to simulate a realistic stellar field, we model the parallel overscan signal as a sum of exponential decays and use least-squares fitting to infer the number of trap species and initial estimates for the release times $\tau_{r,k}$. Smearing is modeled with an exponential-plus-constant function and removed on a column-wise basis. We model the spatial variation in trap density with a quadratic polynomial in radial distance from the focal-plane center. The polynomial coefficients $a_{p,k}$, the well-fill power index $\beta$, and the release times $\tau_{r,k}$ are adjusted via iterative application of the Extended pixel Edge Response (EPER) method combined with a CTI correction algorithm, yielding the final calibration model. In the worst-case scenario (8-year mission, high-CTI zone), CTI induces a bias of about $4\%$ in measured transit depth, reduced to a residual of $0.06\%$ after correction - well within PLATO's accuracy requirements. From the calibrated parameters, we derive a correction scheme that brings photometric measurements within PLATO's noise budget, ensuring that the mission's precision requirements are met.</description>

      <title>The cosmochemistry of planetary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planets form and obtain their compositions from the leftover material present in protoplanetary disks of dust and gas surrounding young stars. The chemical make-up of a disk influences every aspect of planetary composition including their overall chemical properties, volatile content, atmospheric composition, and potential for habitability. This Review discusses our knowledge of the chemical and isotopic composition of Solar System materials and how this information can be used to place constraints on the formation pathways of terrestrial planets. We conclude that planetesimal formation by the streaming instability followed by rapid accretion of drifting pebbles within the protoplanetary disk lifetime reproduces most of the chemical and isotopic observables in Solar System. This finding has important implications for planetary habitability beyond the Solar System because in pebble accretion, volatiles important for life are accreted during the main growth phase of rocky planets as opposed to the late-stage. Finally, we explore how bulk chemical inventories and masses of planetary bodies control the composition of their primordial atmospheres and their potential to develop habitable conditions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Subsurface Temperature Gradients on Emission Spectra of Airless Exoplanets: the Solid-state Greenhouse and Anti-Greenhouse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emerging goal of exoplanet science is to constrain the surface composition of airless exoplanets. Without the protection of an atmosphere, these planets are likely covered by a powder-like regolith, similar to the Moon. Laboratory studies show that, under vacuum conditions, such regoliths can develop subsurface temperature gradients, also known as the solid-state greenhouse effect. This effect can significantly modify the emission features of airless bodies, but its potential impact on exoplanets is still unexplored. Here we derive analytic solutions of the two-stream radiative transfer equations with scattering, absorption, plus emission, and combine them with Mie theory calculations to model subsurface temperature gradients and emission spectra of airless exoplanets. The results show exo-regoliths can develop strong solid-state greenhouse or anti-greenhouse effects, with temperature gradients $&gt;200$~K in the upper-most subsurface ($\mathcal{O}(100)\mu$m). These temperature gradients alter surface emission features, modify secondary eclipse depths by up to $\sim50\%$, and can produce higher-than-blackbody emission at some wavelengths. In addition, we study whether subsurface temperature gradients can be disentangled from other microscopic effects, such as changes in space weathering or particle size. At least in some cases, the co-existence of these effects makes it essentially impossible to distinguish different surface compositions within the precisions achievable by JWST. Overall, subsurface temperature gradients thus open potentially new ways to characterize surfaces of airless exoplanets, but they also complicate the interpretation of airless exoplanet spectra. In either case, their effect can be important and should be included in future modeling studies.</description>

      <title>The Detectability of Lunar-Origin Asteroids in the LSST Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While most near-Earth asteroids (NEAs) are thought to originate from the main belt, recent discoveries have suggested the existence of a lunar-derived NEA population, such as the asteroids Kamo'oalewa and 2024 PT5. These objects may hold key clues to the dynamical evolution of NEAs and the recent impact history of the Earth-Moon system. However, the population, distribution, and dynamical characteristics of these Lunar-Origin Asteroids (LOAs) remain poorly constrained. By combining the lunar ejecta production with N-body orbital simulations of the ejecta, we investigate their orbital evolution in the past millions of years and the current LOA population, revealing their significant potential for detection by future surveys. Specifically for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), we predict an average detection rate of about 6 LOAs (with D &gt; 5 m) per year. Additionally, we find that the LOAs tend to approach from sunward and anti-sunward directions, with encounter velocities significantly lower than those of typical NEAs. These findings offer valuable insights in guiding targeted ground-based surveys and planetary defense efforts for LOAs in the future.</description>

      <title>Open-Source High-Fidelity Orbit Estimation for Planetary Science and Space Situational Awareness Using the Tudat Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TU Delft Astrodynamics Toolbox (Tudat) is a free open-source software suite for research and education in astrodynamics. Initially focused on numerical simulations of orbital dynamics and state estimation, it enables combining optical and radiometric tracking data from multiple sources to estimate the dynamics and parameters of natural and artificial bodies. Recent developments have added functionality for real tracking data analysis, with applications to planetary missions and Space Situational Awareness (SSA). Tudat currently supports processing of (i) deep-space Doppler and range data from DSN and ESTRACK, (ii) Doppler and VLBI data from the PRIDE experiment, and (iii) optical astrometry from the Minor Planet Center (MPC) and Natural Satellite Data Center (NSDC). Using tracking data from the MRO and GRAIL spacecraft and astrometric data of the asteroid Eros, we present prefit residuals (from SPICE-based observables) and postfit residuals (from fitting data to the Tudat dynamical model). Postfit Doppler residuals reach 1-5 mHz for MRO and GRAIL, orbit differences are a few meters for GRAIL and about one meter for MRO, and MRO range residuals are a few meters. From eight years of Eros astrometry, we obtain an orbit difference from the JPL Horizons solution by several tens of kilometers, consistent with its 3-sigma formal error. Tudat's SSA capability is demonstrated by propagating the orbit of Kosmos 482, a Venus lander launched in 1972 that remained in Earth orbit, over 50 years, including its predicted re-entry on May 10 2025. These examples showcase Tudat's modular, flexible, high-fidelity modeling across diverse orbital regimes within a fully open-source framework. All example code is publicly available, and future Tudat analyses will be published with fully reproducible code, allowing anyone in the community to improve and expand upon our work.</description>

      <title>The effects of stellar activity cycles on planetary atmospheric escape and the HeI 1083nm transit signature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The HeI 1083nm transit signature is commonly used in tracing escaping planetary atmospheres. However, it can be affected by stellar activity, complicating detections and interpretations of atmospheric escape. We model how stellar activity cycles affect the atmospheric escape and HeI 1083nm signatures of four types of highly irradiated exoplanets, at 0.025 and 0.05 au, during minimum and maximum cycle phases. We consider two stars, exhibiting different cycle behaviours: the Sun and the more active star iota Hor, for which we reconstruct its spectral energy distributions at minimum and maximum phases using X-ray observations and photospheric models. We show that over a modulated activity cycle, the release of extreme ultraviolet photons, responsible for atmospheric escape, varies substantially more than that of mid-UV photons, capable of photoionising HeI (23S). This leads to consistently stronger helium signatures during maximum phases. We show that planets at the largest orbit are more affected by cycles, showing larger variations in escape rates and absorptions between minimum and maximum. We also confirm the counter-intuitive behaviour that, despite the fall-off in escape rate with orbital distance, the HeI 1083nm absorption is not significantly weaker at further orbits, even strengthening with orbital distance for some iota Hor planets. We partially explain this behaviour with the lower mid-UV fluxes at more distant orbits, leading to less HeI (23S) photoionisations. Finally, we propose that stellar cycles could explain some of the conflicting HeI 1083nm observations of the same planet, with detections more likely during a phase of activity maximum.</description>

      <title>The influence of a stably stratified layer on the hydromagnetic waves in the Earth's core and their electromagnetic torques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evidence from seismic studies, mineral physics, thermal evolution models and geomagnetic observations is inconclusive about the presence of a stably stratified layer at the top of the Earth's fluid outer core. Such a convectively stable layer could have a strong influence on the internal fluid waves propagating underneath the core-mantle boundary (CMB) that are used to probe the outermost region of the core through the wave interaction with the geomagnetic field and the rotation of the mantle. Here, we numerically investigate the effect of a top stable layer on the outer core fluid waves by calculating the eigenmodes in a neutrally stratified sphere permeated by a magnetic field with and without a top stable layer. We use a numerical model, assuming a flow with an m-fold azimuthal symmetry, that allows for radial motions across the lower boundary of the stable layer and angular momentum exchanges across the CMB through viscous and electromagnetic coupling. On interannual time-scales, we find torsional Alfv\'en waves that are only marginally affected by weak to moderate stratification strength in the outer layer. At decadal time-scales similarly weak stable layers promote the appearance of waves that propagate primarily within the stable layer itself and resemble Magneto-Archimedes-Coriolis (MAC) waves, even though they interact with the adiabatic fluid core below. These waves can exert viscous and electromagnetic torques on the mantle that are several orders of magnitude larger than those in the neutrally stratified case.</description>

      <title>HST-COS Transit Spectroscopy of KELT-20b: First Detection of Excess Far-ultraviolet Absorption From an Ultra-hot Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: KELT-20 b is an ultra-hot Jupiter with an equilibrium temperature of $2260$ K orbiting a bright (V =7.6), fast-rotating ($v\sin{i}$=117 km s$^{-1}$) A2 V star. The atmosphere of KELT-20 b has been studied extensively via transmission spectroscopy at optical wavelengths, showing strong hydrogen absorption as well as metals including Na I, Ca II, Fe I, Fe II, Mg I, Si I and Cr II. The atmospheric and ionization conditions of this planet may differ from Jupiter-mass exoplanets due to the relatively weak extreme-ultraviolet radiation from its host star, as the stellar dynamo that generates chromospheric and coronal activity is thought to shut down at spectral types earlier than A4. We present the first spectroscopic observations of KELT-20 b in the far-ultraviolet using the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, searching for previously undetected low-ionization and neutral atoms in the upper atmosphere. We find that the FUV transit depth increases with decreasing wavelengths, from $1.88\pm0.04$\% at 1600--1760 {\AA} to $2.28\pm0.04$\% at 1410--1570 {\AA}, yielding planetary radii of $0.1139\pm0.06$ $R_*$ and $0.1222\pm0.07$ $R_*$, respectively. We report tentative detections of Fe II and N I at $2.4\sigma$ each, and non-detections of C I, S I, Al II, and Si II. We find no evidence for molecular absorption from CO or H$_2$ and no sign of hydrodynamic escape.</description>

      <title>The Solar Neighborhood. LV. M Dwarf Twin Binaries -- One in Five Twin Sibling Pairs Are Mismatched in Activity and/or Rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a study of 36 pairs of `twin' M dwarfs in wide binaries and assess how similarly the stars behave. Stars in each twin pair have BP, RP, $J$, $H$, and $K_s$ differing by $&lt;$0.10 mag, mass estimates matching within $&lt;$3%, and presumably the same age and composition. We utilize short- and long-term photometry, multi-epoch spectroscopy, and archival data to measure rotation periods, photometric activity levels, and H$\alpha$ equivalent widths for many systems. Speckle imaging, radial velocities, and long-term astrometry are used to identify unresolved companions, yielding three systems with unseen components. Among the 33 remaining twin systems, numerous remarkable pairs show nearly identical rotation rates and activity levels between their twin components, including cases throughout the lower main sequence and across a broad range of rotation-activity parameter space. In contrast, mismatches with $&gt;$25% differences exist in rotation period for $21\%_{-7\%}^{+14\%}$ of twin pairs, in rotation amplitude for $67\%_{-15\%}^{+10\%}$ of pairs, in multi-year photometric variability for $33\%_{-9\%}^{+12\%}$ of pairs, and in H$\alpha$ activity for $21\%_{-6\%}^{+9\%}$ of pairs, with fully convective systems generally mismatched more often. Thus, roughly one out of five M dwarf twin sets does not match in rotation and/or activity despite otherwise identical fundamental parameters. Furthermore, we compile three key systems showing larger relative active/inactive H$\alpha$ mismatches. We propose the various mismatches likely stem from factors such as dynamo stochasticity, activity cycles, formative disk aspects, and/or star-planet interactions, depending on the system. These well-vetted twins offer ripe targets for many future investigations.</description>

      <title>Discovery of multi-temperature coronal mass ejection signatures from a young solar analogue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) on the early Sun may have profoundly influenced the planetary atmospheres of early Solar System planets. Flaring young solar analogues serve as excellent proxies for probing the plasma environment of the young Sun, yet their CMEs remain poorly understood. Here we report the detection of multi-wavelength Doppler shifts in Far-Ultraviolet (FUV) and optical lines during a flare on the young solar analog EK Draconis. During and before a Carrington-class ($\sim$10$^{32}$ erg) flare, warm FUV lines ($\sim$10$^5$ K) exhibit blueshifted emission at 300-550 km s$^{-1}$, indicative of a warm eruption. 10 minutes later, the H$\alpha$ line shows slow (70 km s$^{-1}$), long-lasting ($\gtrsim$2 hrs) blueshifted absorptions, suggesting a cool ($\sim$10$^4$ K) filament eruption. This provides evidence of multi-temperature and multi-component nature of a stellar CME. If Carrington-class flares/CMEs occurred frequently on the young Sun, they may have cumulatively impacted the early Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Do Young Suns Produce Frequent, Massive CMEs? Results from Five-year Dedicated Optical Observations of EK Draconis and V889 Hercules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report results from a five-year (132-night) dedicated observational campaign targeting two nearby young solar-type stars, EK Draconis ($\sim$50-125 Myr age) and V889 Hercules ($\sim$30 Myr age), using the 3.8m Seimei Telescope and Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite. The aim is to observationally constrain statistical properties of flaring radiation/heating as well as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), through high time-cadence H$\alpha$ spectroscopy. We obtained an unprecedented sample of 15 H$\alpha$ superflares, including two blueshifted absorption, two blueshifted emission, one redshifted emission, and nine line broadening events. We obtain the following results: (1) Larger flares exhibit broader H$\alpha$ line widths, up to 14.1$_{\pm 2.4}$ {\AA}, indicating higher chromospheric heating than solar flares. (2) The long-lasting redshifted event at $\sim$100 km s$^{-1}$ may indicate dense post-flare loops. (3) H$\alpha$ blueshifted absorptions/emissions provide evidence of massive filament/prominence eruptions, the core structures of CMEs. One newly identified event showed an unexpected rapid decrease in velocity. (4) The lower limit of the CME/eruption association rate with superflares is 27$_{-16}^{+25}$%, yielding occurrence rates of 0.21$_{\pm0.12}$ and $&lt;$0.32$^{+0.46}_{-0.32}$ events per day for EK Draconis and V889 Hercules, respectively. (5) We derived the first direct estimate of the lower limit of the mass-loss rate driven by super-CMEs ($\gtrsim10^{33}$ erg) for EK Dra as $4 \times (10^{-13}$-$10^{-12})$ $M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, comparable to the stellar wind mass loss at a similar age. This study provides critical observational constraints on the radiation and plasma environment around young solar-type stars and the early Sun, which can drive planetary space weather and stellar mass/angular momentum loss.</description>

      <title>Coronal Mass Ejections from Young Suns: Insights from Solar and Stellar Observations and Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries have revealed exoplanets orbiting young Sun-like stars, offering a window into the early solar system. These young stars frequently produce extreme magnetic explosions known as superflares, roughly once a day, potentially leading to fast and massive coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Recent research have highlighted the importance of stellar CMEs, as these events and associated particles can trigger atmospheric loss and initiate chemical reactions in planetary atmospheres. However, the observation of these associated CMEs remains largely unexplored, marking a crucial first step in assessing the particle environment. Here we present the results of 5-years multi-wavelength observations of young Sun-like stars, providing the critical clues to the common picture of solar and stellar CMEs. First, through optical spectroscopic observations, we found four of fifteen superflares are associated with fast prominence eruptions, precursors to CMEs. The stellar data greatly resemble solar counterparts, indicating a common picture of solar/stellar eruptions. Second, one of the eruptions is associated with potential coronal dimming in X-rays, indicating that the prominence eruptions evolved into stellar CMEs propagating through interplanetary space. Furthermore, the extension of solar MHD model supports the above indication and suggests that the eruption originates from the active region inferred by Zeeman Doppler Imaging and TESS light curve modeling. This comprehensive study suggests that further advancing the use of solar model could provide the first empirical inputs into calculations of atmospheric escape/chemical reactions for young planets.</description>

      <title>Morphological and Kinematical Diagnostic of FU Orionis-type Outburst Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the possibility of determining the mechanism of the FU Orionis-type outburst based on molecular line observations of protoplanetary disks with synthetic observations of distinct numerical burst models. The morphology of the synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission is sensitive to gas temperature and does not coincide with the actual gas disk structures, particularly in the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and clump-infall models, which exhibit peculiar temperature distributions. This highlights the need for careful interpretation of morphologies of line emission from disks under accretion outbursts. The synthetic $\mathrm{C^{18}O}$ emission of each model exhibits distinct kinematic features that can be used to distinguish outburst scenarios. In the MRI model, kinematic features of the gravitational instability (GI), which fuels MRI-driven accretion bursts, are small in both amplitude and spatial extent, resulting in no prominent local features in the residual velocity map at a typical distance for FU Orionis-type objects. In contrast, the clump-infall model shows a clear sign of gas expansion along a spiral, which is caused by exchange of angular momentum between an infalling clump and surrounding gas. The intruder model exhibits a highly asymmetric velocity structure with respect to the systemic velocity of the primary protostar in velocity channel maps. These distinct kinematic features may serve as promising diagnostics for distinguishing the physical mechanisms responsible for FU Orionis-type outbursts.</description>

      <title>Fundamental effective temperature measurements for eclipsing binary stars -- VI. Improved methodology and application to the circumbinary planet host star BEBOP-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BEBOP-3 is detached eclipsing binary star that shows total eclipses of a faint M~dwarf every 13.2 days by a 9$^{\rm th}$-magnitude F9V star. High precision radial velocity measurements have recently shown that this binary star is orbited by a planet with an orbital period $\approx 550$ days. The extensive spectroscopy used to detect this circumbinary planet has also been used to directly measure the masses of the stars in the eclipsing binary. We have used light curves from the TESS mission combined with these mass measurements to directly measure the following radii and surface gravities for the stars in this system: $R_1 = 1.386 \pm 0.010\,R_{\odot}$, $\log g_1 = 4.190 \pm 0.004$, $R_2 = 0.274 \pm 0.002\,R_{\odot}$, $\log g_2 = 4.979 \pm 0.002$. We describe an improved version of our method to measure the effective temperatures (T$_{\rm eff}$) of stars in binary systems directly from their angular diameters and bolometric fluxes. We measure T$_{\rm eff,1} = 6065{\rm\,K} \pm 44\,{\rm K}$ and T$_{\rm eff,2} = 3191{\rm\,K} \pm 40\,{\rm K}$ for the stars in BEBOP-3 using this method. BEBOP-3 can be added to our growing sample of stars that can be used test the accuracy of spectroscopic and photometric methods to estimate T$_{\rm eff}$ and $\log g$ for solar-type stars.</description>

      <title>The Near-Ultraviolet Spectra of FU Orionis Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results of the first high-sensitivity NUV (1800 to 3200 \AA) survey of FU Ori objects, using the \textit{Hubble Space Telescope} (HST) STIS spectrograph. We compare new low resolution spectra for 6 sources with predictions from accretion disk models and find that all show emission in excess of the disk model spectrum. The physical properties of the NUV emission excess are very consistent among the sample, with a mean luminosity of $10^{-1.11 \pm 0.4} \ L_\odot$ and temperature of $16400 \pm 2600$ K -- despite spanning 0.9 dex in $M_*$, 1.3 dex in $\dot{M}$, and 0.7 dex in $L_\mathrm{acc}$. We use the spectra to conclusively rule out the existence of a hot boundary layer in FU Ori accretion disks. We then discuss the source of the excess emission in the context of recent simulations of FU Ori outbursts and boundary layer accretion. The UV spectra also show the often-seen \ion{C}{2}] 2326 \AA\ multiplet and \ion{Mg}{2} 2796/2803 \AA\ doublet, as well as the unusual \ion{Fe}{2}] 2507/2509 \AA\ doublet, a feature that is not seen in the existing UV spectra of other young stellar objects. We measure and compare the luminosities of these lines in outbursting with those in non-outbursting objects.</description>

      <title>Unveiling stellar (and planetary) internal dynamics with the fully compressible MUSIC code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multidimensional hydrodynamical simulations have transformed the study of stellar interiors over the past few decades. Most codes developed during that time use the anelastic approximation, which fixes the thermal structure of simulations and filters out sound waves. Many of them also use explicit time integration, which imposes severe constraints on the time step of the simulations. In this context, MUSIC is developed to overcome these limitations. Its main scientific objective is to improve the phenomenological approaches used in 1D stellar evolution codes to describe major hydrodynamical and MHD processes. Here, we review recent applications of the MUSIC code, that focus mainly on convection, convective boundary mixing and waves in stars that possess convective cores, shells and/or envelopes.</description>

      <title>The mantle-inner core gravitational mode of oscillation in a strong magnetic field regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mantle-inner core gravitational (MICG) mode is the free mode axial oscillation between the mantle and inner core sustained by the gravitational torque between their degree 2 order 2 density structures. Here, we investigate how the MICG mode is affected by oscillations of cylindrical surfaces in the fluid outer core in the form of Alfv\'en waves. The latter are triggered by oscillations of the tangent cylinder (TC) moving jointly with the inner core and propagate away from the rotation axis. We show that the MICG mode remains a distinct normal mode of oscillation of the core-mantle system only when the triggered Alfv\'en waves are attenuated before they traverse the width of the fluid core. For an internal magnetic field strength of a few mT, as we expect in Earth's core, Alfv\'en waves can readily traverse the width of the core, and the MICG mode is absorbed into the spectrum of torsional oscillation (TO) modes. The MICG period retains a dynamical influence, acting as a point of resonance for TO modes, and marking the transition from a TO mode in which the motion of the TC (including the inner core) is weakly impacted by gravitational coupling to one in which the oscillating motion of the TC is strongly restricted. Our results imply that the observed 6-year periodic signal in the length of day cannot be interpreted as the signature of the MICG mode and must instead be caused by TO modes, or more generally, by the propagation of Alfv\'en waves.</description>

      <title>Assessing the feasibility range of Solar-powered Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.04845v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The work aims to assess principal physical technical constraints of the key technological concept for achieving maximal carrying capacity expansive potential of Planetary Systems. Chemical composition of most potential Biosphere Substrates is in most cases very far from optimal for full-scale habitability thus productivity potential realization. To cover all surface of a Biosphere Substrate with a dense photosynthesising layer during most of remaining Planetary System lifecycle for achieving maximal carrying capacity thus workforce productivity enabling further expansion of biosphere to new substrates importing significant amounts of the limiting chemical elements by planetesimals redirection is ubiquitously inevitable. Although the price of such operations is high the value of maximal population productivity of Biosphere Substrates during the remaining Planetary Systems lifecycle is orders of magnitude higher. The farther planetesimal is orbiting from a star the more time but less energy is required for its delivery. The more distant from a star, the more rich in volatiles planetesimals are. The most technically detailed and feasible scheme to date of Planetesimals Redirection was proposed in 1993 by Dr. Zubrin based on NTRs. Nuclear fuel is extremely scarce and might be the principal limiting factor for final stages of interstellar colonization missions. We investigate possibilities of using concentrated beamed solar power Planetesimals Redirection operations for Terraforming as it can increase the possible scale of such operations to orders of magnitude. Such a mission might consist of Planetesimal Tug Spacecraft Systems (PTSS) to redirect a planetesimal, and solar Power Harvesting Beaming System (PHBS) tracking the spacecraft with a beam to power it. We found Solarpowered Planetesimals Redirection for Terraforming is feasible within Kuiper Belt with present technologies.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion Development of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe pre-perihelion optical observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS taken during July - September 2025 using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index") n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.</description>

      <title>SAMPLE -- Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence -- A Method of Collection of Stratospheric Samples Using Balloon-Borne Payload System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11581v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Earth possesses many environmental extremes that mimic conditions on extraterrestrial worlds. The stratosphere at 30-40 km altitude closely resembles the surface of Mars in terms of pressure, temperature, and radiation levels (UV, proton, and Galactic cosmic rays). While microbial life in the troposphere is well documented, the true upper limit of Earth's biosphere remains unclear. The stratosphere offers a promising environment to explore microbial survival in such extreme conditions. Despite its significance to astrobiology, this region remains largely unexplored due to difficulties in access and avoiding contamination. To address this, we have developed SAMPLE (Stratospheric Altitude Microbiology Probe for Life Existence), a balloon-borne payload designed to collect dust samples from the stratosphere and return them in conditions suitable for lab analysis. The entire system is novel and designed in-house, with weight- and stress-optimized components. The main payload includes three pre-sterilized sampling trays and a controller that determines altitude and governs tray operation. One tray will remain closed during flight (airborne control) and another on the ground (cleanroom control) to monitor contamination. Additional systems include environmental sensors, GPS trackers, cameras, and a Flight Termination Unit (FTU) to end the mission once sampling is complete. A parachute ensures the safe recovery of the payload. Upon retrieving the payload, the sampling trays (including controls) will be sent to a suitable laboratory where the samples will be examined for the presence and nature of collected material.</description>

Abstract: 3I/ATLAS, the third discovered interstellar object, has a heliocentric speed of 58 km/s and exhibits cometary activity. To constrain the origin of 3I/ATLAS and its past dynamical evolution, we propagate the orbits of 3I/ATLAS and nearby stars to search for stellar encounters. Integrating orbits in the Galactic potential and propagating the astrometric and radial-velocity uncertainties of 30 million Gaia stars, we identify 25 encounters with median encounter distances less than 1 pc. However, because the encounter speeds between 3I/ATLAS and each encounter exceed 20 km/s, none is a plausible host under common ejection mechanisms. We infer stellar masses for most stars and quantify the gravitational perturbations exerted by each individual star or each binary system on 3I/ATLAS. The strongest gravitational scattering perturber is a wide M-dwarf binary. Among all past encounters, the binary's barycenter and 3I/ATLAS reach the small encounter distance of 0.242 pc and the encounter speed of 28.39 km/s,1.64 Myr ago. We further demonstrate that the cumulative influence of the stellar encounters on both the speed and direction of 3I/ATLAS is weak. Based on the present kinematics of 3I/ATLAS to assess its origin, we find that a thin-disk origin is strongly favored, because the thin disk both exhibits a velocity distribution closely matching that of 3I/ATLAS and provides the dominant local number density of stars.</description>

Abstract: Context. Medium-resolution IFS, such as MUSE at the VLT, are equipped to detect the emission lines of faint accreting companions when associated with dedicated stellar halo subtraction methods. We recently proposed a new approach based on polynomial modulations of a stellar spectrum estimate across the field of view, with orthogonal polynomials and lines masking. Aims. We seek to highlight and quantify analytically and on real data the benefits of this new approach over the one classically used, particularly with regard to distortions of the extracted spectra. Methods. We carried out analytical calculations based on simple toy models. Simulations of the most extreme situations identified were used to highlight these problems and corrections. Archival VLT/MUSE data of the young PDS70 and HTLup systems were used to vet the detection and characterization capabilities using on-sky observations. New images of the YSES1 planetary system were used to further illustrate the gains. Results. We show that the state-of-the-art method, based on low-pass filtering, can lead to the self-subtraction of the emission lines and modify the neighboring continua. We show that the proposed technique corrects these characterization problems, while maintaining the same detection capabilities. The two protoplanets PDS70 b and c were detected with 5sigma significance. The Halpha line estimate of the HTLup B stellar companion was improved by ~30% for the integrated flux and by ~8% for the 10%-width. As for YSES1 b, we found it uniquely displays a combination of Halpha, Hbeta, CaII H&amp;K triplet, and HeI lines in emission. Conclusions. The proposed method better preserves the spectral information, notably the emission line fluxes and profiles, while achieving similar detection performance. Based on a linear and parametric approach, it can be extended and/or combined with additional faint signal search algorithms.</description>
