      <title>Generalized one-way function and its application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-way functions are fundamental to classical cryptography and their existence remains a longstanding problem in computational complexity theory. Recently, a provable quantum one-way function has been identified, which maintains its one-wayness even with unlimited computational resources. Here, we extend the mathematical definition of functions to construct a generalized one-way function by virtually measuring the qubit of provable quantum one-way function and randomly assigning the corresponding measurement outcomes with identical probability. Remarkably, using this generalized one-way function, we have developed an unconditionally secure key distribution protocol based solely on classical data processing, which can then utilized for secure encryption and signature. Our work highlights the importance of information in characterizing quantum systems and the physical significance of the density matrix. We demonstrate that probability theory and randomness are effective tools for countering adversaries with unlimited computational capabilities.</description>

      <title>On classical advice, sampling advise and complexity assumptions for learning separations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the equivalence between sampling advice, i.e., advice in the form of a training set, and classical advice. Specifically, our main result demonstrates that BPP/samp is equal to P/poly. Additionally, we delve into the analysis of these relationships under the constraint of a fixed distribution. Notably, we show that under such circumstances, the equality does not hold. This result remains valid when considering quantum advice and a quantum generalization of the training set. Finally, leveraging the insights gained from these proofs, we identify sufficient and necessary complexity assumptions for the existence of concept classes that exhibit a quantum learning speed-up in the worst-case scenario, i.e., when accurate results are required for all inputs.</description>

      <title>Matching walks that are minimal with respect to edge inclusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14048v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that enumerating the set MM(G,R), defined below, cannot be done with polynomial-delay in its input G and R, unless P=NP. R is a regular expression over an alphabet $\Sigma$, G is directed graph labeled over $\Sigma$, and MM(G,R) contains walks of G. First, consider the set Match(G,R) containing all walks G labeled by a word (over $\Sigma$) that conforms to $R$. In general, M(G,R) is infinite, and MM(G,R) is the finite subset of Match(G,R) of the walks that are minimal according to a well-quasi-order &lt;. It holds w&lt;w' if the multiset of edges appearing in w is strictly included in the multiset of edges appearing in w'. Remarkably, the set MM(G,R) contains some walks that may be computed in polynomial time. Hence, it is not the case that the preprocessing phase of any algorithm enumerating MM(G,R) must solve an NP-hard problem.</description>

      <title>Enumerating models of DNF faster: breaking the dependency on the formula size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.04006v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of enumerating the models of DNF formulas. The aim is to provide enumeration algorithms with a delay that depends polynomially on the size of each model and not on the size of the formula, which can be exponentially larger. We succeed for two subclasses of DNF formulas: we provide a constant delay algorithm for $k$-DNF with fixed $k$ by an appropriate amortization method and we give a quadratic delay algorithm for monotone formulas. We then focus on the \emph{average delay} of enumeration algorithms and show how to obtain a sublinear delay in the formula size.</description>

      <title>Testing Isomorphism of Graphs in Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.12688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, the graph $[G]$ obtained by adding, for each pair of vertices of $G$, a unique vertex adjacent to both vertices is called the binding graph of $G$. In this work, we show that the class of binding graphs is graph-isomorphism complete and that the stable partitions of binding graphs by the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) algorithm produce automorphism partitions. To test the isomorphism of two graphs $G$ and $H$, one computes the stable graph of the binding graph $[G\uplus H]$ for the disjoint union graph $G\uplus H$. The automorphism partition reveals the isomorphism of $G$ and $H$. Because the WL algorithm is a polynomial-time procedure, the claim can be made that the graph-isomorphism problem is in complexity class $\mathtt{P}$.</description>
