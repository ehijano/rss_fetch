      <title>Perfect supercurrent diode efficiency in chiral nanotube-based Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supercurrent diode effect (SDE) describes superconducting systems where the magnitude of the superconducting-to-normal state switching current differs for positive and negative current bias. Despite the ubiquity of such diode effects in Josephson devices, the fundamental conditions to observe a diode effect in a Josephson junction and achieve perfect diode efficiency remain unclear. In this work, we analyze the supercurrent diode properties of a chiral nanotube-based Josephson junction within a Ginzburg-Landau theory. We find a diode effect and anomalous phase develops across the junction when a magnetic field is applied parallel to the tube despite the absence of spin-orbit interactions in the system. Unexpectedly, the SDE in the junction is independent of the anomalous phase. Alternatively, we determine a non-reciprocal persistent current that is protected by fluxoid quantization can activate SDE, even in the absence of higher-order pair tunneling processes. We show this new type of SDE can lead to, in principle, a perfect diode efficiency, highlighting how persistent currents can be used to engineer high efficiency supercurrent diodes.</description>

      <title>Maximal critical temperature dependence on number of layers due to phonon d-wave pairing in hole doped cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently an apical oxygen atoms vibrations exchange mechanism of d-wave pairing in cuprates was proposed. The phonon mode in an insulating layer generates attraction of holes in metallic cuper oxygen planes. The pairing has a maximum at the crystallographic gamma point leading to d-wave channel. The idea is generalized here to include the in-plane breathers and half - breather modes in a multi-layer cuprate generating the pairing in an adjacent cuper oxygen layer of the same multi-layer. It is demonstrated that the phonon exchange and the spin fluctuation pairing constructively enhance each other since the paramagnon pairing peaks at crystallographic M point. The phonon contribution explains the maximal critical temperature dependence on the number of layers N. It rises equidistantly by 15K from N=1 to N=3 and then saturates. The strength of the onsite Coulomb on site repulsion at optimal doping is to obtain the observed values of maximal critical temperature in the intermediate range of the effective on-site repulsion U=(1.5-2) eV, smaller than commonly used in purely in-plane (spin fluctuation) theory of high temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Quantum geometry of the surface states of rhombohedral graphite and its effects on the surface superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum geometry of rhombohedral graphite/graphene (RG) surface electronic states and its effects on superconductivity. We find that the RG surface bands have a non-vanishing quantum metric at the center of the drumhead region, and the local inequality between quantum metric and Berry curvature is an equality. Therefore, their quantum geometry is analogous to the lowest Landau level (LLL). The superconducting order parameters on the two surface orbitals of RG can be polarized by the surface potential, which boosts the superconducting transition in trilayer RG triggered by the displacement field. Analyzing the superfluid properties of multilayer RG, we make a connection with the topological heavy fermion model suggested to describe magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG). It shows that RG fits in an unusual heavy-fermion picture with the flattest part of the surface bands carrying a nonzero supercurrent. These results may constrain the models constructed for the correlated phases of RG.</description>

      <title>Vortex ratchet effect in superconductor open nanotubes and nanopetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in the fabrication of superconducting 3D nanostructures and the creation of artificial pinning sites pave the way to novel applications and enhancement of nanosensors, bolometers, and quantum interferometers. The dynamics of magnetic flux quanta (Abrikosov vortices) in 3D nanoarchitectures reveal a rich palette of phenomena unseen in planar counterparts. Here, we consider two types of superconductor 3D nanostructures -- open nanotubes and nanopetals -- carrying an azimuthal transport current in a homogeneous external magnetic field. The complex 3D geometry of the structures induces an inhomogeneity of the normal magnetic field and makes the vortices move along preferred paths. By introducing a series of asymmetric pinning sites along these paths, we demonstrate non-reciprocity in the flux transport, which, in the 3D nanostructures, is stronger than in the planar membranes. The enhancement of the vortex ratchet effect manifests via a difference in the vortex depinning current under current reversal in a wider range of magnetic fields. The revealed effect is attributed to the inhomogeneous field-induced vortex channeling through the areas containing the asymmetric pinning sites. Our results demonstrate that the ratchet effect can persist up to higher magnetic fields via extending a superconducting film into the third dimension, without an increase in the number of asymmetric pinning sites.</description>

      <title>The Higgs-Amplitude mode in the optical conductivity in the presence of a supercurrent: Gauge-invariant formulation with disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observing the ``Higgs" or amplitude mode in superconductors has been a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Moreover, arriving at a theoretical understanding of this mode and how it is accessible in, say, conductivity experiments presents an additional challenge as here one needs to satisfy gauge invariance in the presence of disorder. In this paper, we characterize the Higgs contribution within a fully gauge-invariant treatment of the linear optical conductivity, $\sigma(\omega)$, for a disordered superconductor carrying a uniform supercurrent. As a consequence of gauge invariance, there are two distinct charge conservation laws underlying the linear electromagnetic response with two associated sets of $f$-sum rules. An interesting finding from the Higgs-related sum rule is that the imaginary part of $\sigma(\omega)$ yields an anisotropic, \textit{negative} $1/\omega$ contribution in the THz regime. This is relevant to device applications and appears to be consistent with recent experiments. The work presented here emphasizes how difficult it is to disentangle the neutral amplitude mode contributions from those of the charged quasi-particles and we demonstrate why this is the case.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of $s_{\pm}-to-s_{++}$ transition in iron pnictides in the vicinity of the Born limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To study thermodynamical properties of the disorder-induced transition between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ superconducting gap functions, we calculate the grand thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ in the normal and the superconducting states. Expression for the difference between the two, $\Delta\Omega$, is derived for a two-band model for Fe-based systems with nonmagnetic impurities. The disorder is considered in a $\mathcal{T}$-matrix approximation within the multiband Eliashberg theory. In the vicinity of the Born limit near the $s_{\pm}$-to-$s_{++}$ transition, we find two solutions obtained for opposite directions of the system's evolution with respect to the impurity scattering rate. By calculating the change in entropy $\Delta S$ and the change in electronic specific heat $\Delta C$ from $\Delta\Omega$, we show that such a hysteresis is not due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking state, but it rather points out to the first order phase transition induced by the nonmagnetic disorder. Based on the $\Delta\Omega$ calculations, phase diagram is plotted representing the energetically favourable $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states and the transition between them. At finite temperature, a first order phase transition line there is limited by a critical end point. Above that point, the sharp $s_{\pm} \to s_{++}$ transition transforms to a crossover between $s_{\pm}$ and $s_{++}$ states.</description>

      <title>Superconducting diode efficiency from singlet-triplet mixing in disordered systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09421v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) -- the nonreciprocity of the critical current in a bulk superconductor -- has garnered significant attention due to its potential applications in superconducting electronics. However, the role of disorder scattering in SDE has rarely been considered, despite its potential qualitative impact, as we demonstrate in this work. We investigate SDE in a disordered Rashba superconductor under an in-plane magnetic field, employing a self-consistent Born approximation to derive the corresponding Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our analysis reveals two surprising effects. First, in the weak Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) regime, disorder can reverse the direction of the diode effect, indicated by a sign change in the superconducting diode efficiency coefficient. Second, in the strong Rashba SOC regime, disorder becomes the driving mechanism of SDE, which vanishes in its absence. In this case, we show that disorder-induced mixing of singlet and triplet superconducting orders underlies the effect.</description>

      <title>Emergent chirality and superfluidity of parity-doubled baryons in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose novel superfluids induced by the parity-doubled baryons. The parity-doubled baryons, i.e., a nucleon $N(940)$ with spin-parity $J^{P}=1/2^{+}$ and an excited nucleon $N^{\ast}(1535)$ with $J^{P}=1/2^{-}$ in vacuum, become degenerate at sufficiently high density where the chiral symmetry is restored. In this study, we extend the conventional $\mathrm{U}(1)$ chiral symmetry to the higher dimensional symmetries, dubbed emergent chiral symmetries, including the naive and mirror assignments as their subgroups. Starting with the Lagrangian up to four-point interactions among the neutron $n$ and its chiral partner $n^{\ast}$, neutral components in $N$ and $N^{\ast}$, in pure neutron matter, we investigate the properties of the ground state with a pairing gap generated by the $n$ and $n^{\ast}$ in the mean-field approximation. We find vector-type condensates that induce the dynamical breaking of a new class of internal symmetries, emergent chiral symmetries, as well as the baryon number and the rotational symmetries of the real space, indicating the appearance of massless Nambu-Goldstone bosons consisting of six quarks: emergent pions, superfluid phonons, and magnons, respectively. We also study the fermionic excitation modes at low-energy scales, and show that they exhibit a spatial anisotropy of the propagation at the Dirac cone in momentum space. Some phenomenological implications are advocated, shedding new light on the properties of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Floquet-Engineered Hybrid Topological Orders with Majorana Edge Modes in Number-Conserving Fermionic Quantum Simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an experimental protocol based on Floquet-engineered ultracold fermions in optical lattices, enabling the emulation of pair-hopping and competing singlet/triplet pairing interactions. Through large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we uncover three emergent topological phases: (i) A Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase featuring exponentially localized edge charges, non-local fermionic edge correlations, and doubly degenerate entanglement spectra; (ii) A z-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase exhibiting fractionalized edge spins (S=1/4 per edge), two-fold ground state degeneracy and a bulk single-particle gap; (iii) A hybrid x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase that uniquely combines fractional spin textures and Majorana-type edge correlations, defining a new universality class of hybrid orders in number-conserving systems. These findings establish a universal framework for engineering non-Abelian topological matter, crucially bypassing the need for external pairing fields while maintaining experimental feasibility with current cold-atom techniques.</description>
