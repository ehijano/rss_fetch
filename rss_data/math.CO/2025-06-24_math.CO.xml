      <title>Notes on sum-free sets in abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we highlight a few open problems concerning maximal sum-free sets in abelian groups. In addition, for most even order abelian groups $G$ we asymptotically determine the number of maximal distinct sum-free subsets in $G$. Our proof makes use of the container method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A uniform hypergraph is called a sunflower if all of its hyperedges intersect in the same set of vertices. In this paper, we determine the eigenvalues and spectral moments of a sunflower, thereby obtaining an explicit formula for its characteristic polynomial.</description>

      <title>Entropy Bounds for Perfect Matchings in Bipartite Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypergraph is \textit{bipartite with bipartition} $(A, B)$ if every edge has exactly one vertex in $A$, and a matching in such a hypergraph is \textit{$A$-perfect} if it saturates every vertex in $A$. We prove an upper bound on the number of $A$-perfect matchings in uniform hypergraphs with small maximum codegree. Using this result, we prove that there exist order-$n$ Latin squares with at most $(n/e^{2.117})^n$ transversals when $n$ is odd and $n \equiv 0\pmod 3$. We also show that $k$-uniform $D$-regular hypergraphs on $n$ vertices have at most $((1+o(1))q/e^k)^{Dn/k}$ proper $q$-edge-colorings when $q = (1+o(1))D$ and the maximum codegree is $o(q)$.</description>

      <title>Coloring outside the lines: Spectral bounds for generalized hypergraph colorings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that, for an oriented hypergraph with (vertex) coloring number $\chi$ and smallest and largest normalized Laplacian eigenvalues $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_N$, respectively, the inequality $\chi\geq (\lambda_N-\lambda_1)/\min\{\lambda_N-1,1-\lambda_1\}$ holds. We provide necessary conditions for oriented hypergraphs for which this bound is tight. Focusing on $c$-uniform unoriented hypergraphs, we then generalize the bound to the setting of \emph{$d$-proper colorings}: colorings in which no edge contains more than $d$ vertices of the same color. We also adapt our proof techniques to derive analogous spectral bounds for \emph{$d$-improper colorings} of graphs and for edge colorings of hypergraphs. Moreover, for all coloring notions considered, we provide necessary conditions under which the bound is an equality.</description>

      <title>Quantum $\mathfrak{gl}$-weight system and its average values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof of a recent conjecture due to M. Kazarian, E. Krasilnikov, S. Lando, and M. Shapiro, which describes the average value of the universal $\mathfrak{gl}$-weight system on permutations. The proof uses a quantum analogue of the $\mathfrak{gl}$-weight system on Hecke algebras of type $A$, which leads to a one-parameter deformation of the average value of the universal ${\mathfrak{gl}}$-weight system. We show that the average value of the quantum weight system is a linear combination of one-part Schur functions, with coefficients being $q$-analogues of Bernoulli polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We define and study an extension of the notion of the VC-dimension of a hypergraph and apply it to establish a Tverberg type theorem for unions of convex sets. We also prove a new Radon type theorem for unions of convex sets,
  vastly improving the estimates in an earlier result of B\'ar\'any and Kalai.</description>

      <title>Greedy Gossiping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renowned Gossiping Problem (1971) asks the following. There are $n$ people who each know an item of gossip. In a telephone call, two people share all the gossip they know. How many calls are needed for all of them to be informed of all the gossip? If $n\ge 4$, the answer is $2n-4$.
  We initiate and solve the related Greedy Gossiping Problem: given a fixed number $m&lt;2n-4$ of calls, at most how much gossip can be known altogether? If every call increases the total knowledge of gossip as much as possible, the sum reaches $n^2$ only when $m=2n-3$. Our main result is that surprisingly, for each $m&lt;2n-4$, this calling strategy is optimal.</description>

Abstract: In the May 2025 issue of the Amer. Math. Monthly, Norman J. Wildberger and Dean Rubine intoduced a new kind of multi-indexed numbers, that they call `Geode numbers', obtained from the Hyper-Catalan numbers.

      <title>Some sharp bounds on the average Steiner (k, l)-eccentricity for trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce some transformations for trees that do not increase the average Steiner $(k,l)$-eccentricity for all $0\leq l\leq k\leq n$. Using these transformations, we obtain some sharp bounds on the average Steiner $(k,l)$-eccentricity for trees with some certain conditions, including given nodes, given diameter, given max degree and given leaves, and get the corresponding extremal trees as well.</description>

      <title>How Trees on Atoms of Subset Algebras Define Minimal Forests and Their Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete description is given of how minimal trees on atoms of the algebra of subsets $\mathfrak{A}_k$ generated by minimal spanning $k$-component forests of a weighted digraph $V$ determine the form of these forests and how forests grow with increasing number of arcs (that is with a decrease in the number of trees). Precise bounds are established on what can be extracted about the tree structure of the original graph if the minimal trees on the atoms of a single algebra $\mathfrak{A}_k$ are known, and also what minimum spanning forests with fewer components can be constructed based on this, and what exactly additional information is required to determine minimum spanning forests consisting of even fewer components.</description>

      <title>A unified approach to total irregular labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a unified approach to compute the total vertex irregularity strength (tvs) of various graphs, employing a novel technique recently proposed by Barra et al. For graphs such as cycles, paths, prisms, wheels, complete graphs, helm graphs, friendship graphs, and $K_{n,n}$ , we offer simplified and unified proofs of their previously established tvs values. Furthermore, we resolve an open problem by determining the tvs for simple 2-regular graphs.</description>

      <title>Reducible Iterated Graph Systems: multiscale-freeness and multifractals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iterated Graph Systems (IGS) aims to transplant ideas from fractal geometry into graph theory. Building on this framework, we extend Edge IGS from the primitive to the reducible setting. Within this broader context, we formulate rigorous definitions of multifractality and multiscale-freeness for graph fractals, and we establish conditions that are equivalent to the occurrence of these two phenomena. We further determine the corresponding fractal and degree spectra, proving that both are finite and discrete. These results complete the foundational theory of Edge IGS by filling the gap left by the primitive case studied in [1,2].</description>

      <title>Large grid subsets without many cospherical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by intuitions from projective algebraic geometry, we provide a novel construction of subsets of the $d$-dimensional grid $[n]^d$ of size $n - o(n)$ with no $d + 2$ points on a sphere or a hyperplane. For $d = 2$, this improves the previously best known lower bound of $n/4$ toward the Erd\H{o}s--Purdy problem due to Thiele in 1995. For $d \ge 3$, this improves the recent $\Omega \bigl( n^{\frac{3}{d+1}-o(1)} \bigr)$ bound due to Suk and White, confirming their conjectured $\Omega \bigl( n^{\frac{d}{d+1}} \bigr)$ bound in a strong sense, and asymptotically resolves the generalized Erd\H{o}s--Purdy problem posed by Brass, Moser, and Pach.</description>

      <title>All Ramsey critical graphs for a large tree versus $tK_{m}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H, H_{1}$ and $H_{2}$ be graphs, and let $H\rightarrow (H_{1}, H_{2})$ denote that any red-blue coloring of $E(H)$ yields a red copy of $H_{1}$ or a blue copy of $H_{2}$. The Ramsey number for $H_{1}$ versus $H_{2}$, $r(H_{1}, H_{2})$, is the minimum integer $N$ such that $K_{N}\rightarrow (H_{1}, H_{2})$. The Ramsey critical graph $H$ for $H_{1}$ versus $H_{2}$ is a red-blue edge-colored $K_{N- 1}$ such that $H\not\rightarrow (H_{1}, H_{2})$, where $N= r(H_{1}, H_{2})$. In this paper, we characterize all Ramsey critical graphs for a large tree versus $tK_{m}$. As a corollary, we determine the star-critical Ramsey number for a large tree versus $tK_{m}$.</description>

      <title>On polluted bootstrap percolation in Cartesian grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and assuming that some vertices of $G$ are infected, the $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation rule makes an uninfected vertex $v$ infected if $v$ has at least $r$ infected neighbors. The $r$-percolation number, $m(G, r)$, of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a set of initially infected vertices in $G$ such that after continuously performing the $r$-neighbor bootstrap percolation rule each vertex of $G$ eventually becomes infected. In this paper, we continue the study of polluted bootstrap percolation introduced and studied by Gravner and McDonald [Bootstrap percolation in a polluted environment. J.\ Stat\ Physics 87 (1997) 915--927] where in this variant some vertices are permanently in the non-infected state. We study an extremal (combinatorial) version of the bootstrap percolation problem in a polluted environment, where our main focus is on the class of grid graphs, that is, the Cartesian product $P_m \square P_n$ of two paths $P_m$ and $P_n$ on $m$ and $n$ vertices, respectively. Given a number of polluted vertices in a Cartesian grid we establish a closed formula for the minimum $2$-neighbor bootstrap percolation number of the polluted grid, and obtain a lower bound for the other extreme.</description>

      <title>Counting edges of different types in a local graph of a Grassmann graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ denote a finite field with $q$ elements. Let $n,k$ denote integers with $n&gt;2k\geq 6$. Let $V$ denote a vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ that has dimension $n$. The vertex set of the Grassmann graph $J_q(n,k)$ consists of the $k$-dimensional subspaces of $V$. Two vertices of $J_q(n,k)$ are adjacent whenever their intersection has dimension $k-1$. Let $\partial$ denote the path-length distance function of $J_q(n,k)$. Pick vertices $x,y$ of $J_q(n,k)$ such that $1&lt;\partial(x,y)&lt;k$. Let $\Gamma(x)$ denote the local graph of $x$ in $J_q(n,k)$. In this paper we define three types of edges in $\Gamma(x)$, namely type $0$, type $+$, and type $-$; for adjacent $w,z\in \Gamma(x)$ such that $\partial(w,y)=\partial(z,y)$, the type of the edge $wz$ depends on the subspaces $w+z,w,z,w\cap z$ and their intersections with $y$. Our general goal is to count the number of edges in $\Gamma(x)$ for each type. Consider a two-vertex stabilizer $\text{Stab}(x,y)$ in $GL(V)$; it is known that the $\text{Stab}(x,y)$-action on $\Gamma(x)$ has five orbits. Pick two orbits $\mathcal{O},\mathcal{N}$ that are not necessarily distinct; for a given $w\in \mathcal{O}$, we find the number of vertices in $z\in \mathcal{N}$ such that the edge $wz$ has (i) type $0$, (ii) type $+$, (iii) type $-$. To find these numbers, we make heavy use of a subalgebra $\mathcal{H}$ of $\text{Mat}_{P}(\mathbb{C})$; the algebra $\mathcal{H}$ contains matrices that are closely related to the five orbits of the $\text{Stab}(x,y)$-action on $\Gamma(x)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the largest subset of vertices of the $n$ dimensional hypercube without three vertices at a Hamming distance of exactly $r$ from each other. In particular, we provide a lower bound of $\frac{c2^n}{e^r2^{\frac r2} (\frac nr)^{\frac{3r}{4}}}$ and an upper bound of $O(\frac{r2^n}{n+1})$ when $2r \le n$. In particular, when $r$ is a constant, the lower bound is $\frac{c2^n}{n^{3r/4}}$, while the upper bound is $\frac{c'2^n}{n}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove relations between the number of $k$-connected components of a graph, Crapo's invariant $\beta(M)$ of a matroid, and Speyer's polynomial $g_M(t)$. These yield a simple interpretation of $g_M'(-1)$ when $M$ is graphic or cographic. Furthermore, we improve Ferroni's algorithm to compute $g_M(t)$ and provide an implementation and an extensive data set. These calculations reveal a large number of graph theoretic constraints on the second derivative $g_M''(-1)$, which we thus advertise as an intriguing new invariant of graphs. We also propose a relation between the flow polynomial and $g_M''(0)$ for cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Is the spiral effect psychological?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.02827v4 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017 a definition of spiral tilings was given, thereby answering a question posed by Gr\"unbaum and Shephard in the late 1970s. The author had the pleasure to discuss the topic via e-mail with Branko Gr\"unbaum in his 87th year. During this correspondence the question arose whether a spiral structure (given a certain definition of it) could be recognized automatically or whether "to some extent, at least, the spiral effect is psychological", as Gr\"unbaum and Shephard had conjectured in 1987 (see exercise section of chapter 9.5 in "Tilings and Patterns"). In this paper, an algorithm for automatic detection of such a tiling's spiral structure and its first implementation results will be discussed. Finally, the definitions for several types of spiral tilings are refined based on this investigation.</description>

      <title>Forcing nonperiodic tilings with one tile using a seed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.09384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.09384v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The so-called "einstein problem" (a pun playing with the famous scientist's name and the German term "ein Stein" for "one stone") asks for a simply connected prototile only allowing nonperiodic tilings without need of any matching rule. So far, researchers come only close to this demand by defining decorated prototiles forcing nonperiodicity of any generated tiling using matching rules. In this paper a class of spiral tilings (and one non-spiral example) is linked to a weaker form of the einstein problem where one or several seed tiles are used. Furthermore, the classical types of matching rules are listed and some new types are discussed.</description>

      <title>Discrete Poincar\'e inequalities and universal approximators for random graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Poincar\'e inequalities are indispensable tools in the study of dimension reduction and low-distortion embeddings of graphs into metric spaces, and have found remarkable algorithmic applications. A basic open problem, posed by Jon Kleinberg (2013), asks whether the optimal nonlinear Poincar\'e constant for maps between two independent $3$-regular random graphs is dimension-free, i.e., independent of vertex-set sizes. We give a complete and affirmative resolution to Kleinberg's problem, also allowing for arbitrary graph degrees. As a corollary, we obtain a stochastic construction of $O(1)\text{-universal}$ approximators for random graphs, answering a question of Mendel and Naor.</description>

      <title>Detection and Reconstruction of a Random Hypergraph from Noisy Graph Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a $d$-uniform random hypergraph on $n$ vertices in which hyperedges are included i.i.d.\ so that the average degree in the hypergraph is $n^{\delta+o(1)}$, the projection of such a hypergraph is a graph on the same $n$ vertices where an edge connects two vertices if and only if they belong to a same hyperedge. In this work, we study the inference problem where the observation is a \emph{noisy} version of the graph projection where each edge in the projection is kept with probability $p=n^{-1+\alpha+o(1)}$ and each edge not in the projection is added with probability $q=n^{-1+\beta+o(1)}$. For all constant $d$, we establish sharp thresholds for both detection (distinguishing the noisy projection from an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph with edge density $q$) and reconstruction (estimating the original hypergraph). Notably, our results reveal a \emph{detection-reconstruction gap} phenomenon in this problem. Our work also answers a problem raised in \cite{BGPY25+}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conjecturally generalize the Conjecture by Brian\c{c}on and Iarrobino on the most singular points of the Hilbert scheme of a tetrahedral number of points in $\BA^3$ by introducing the notion of \textit{locally-maximal singularity}. The formulation of this conjecture is based on the shape of the ideals via a picturesque pattern. It also generalizes the conjectural necessary condition for the most singular points, suggested by the second-named author in \cite{Rezaee-23-Conjectures}, restricted to a tetrahedral number of points in 3D. These conjectures and those in the prequel work aim to prove the original conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study multiple ergodic averages along IP sets, meaning we restrict iterates in the averages to all finite sums of some infinite sequence of natural numbers. We give criteria for convergence and divergence in mean of these multiple averages and derive sufficient conditions for convergence to the projection onto the space of invariant functions. For a class of sequences that, roughly speaking, only have rational obstructions to such a limit, we show that the behavior is controlled by nilsystems. We also consider pointwise convergence, obtaining convergence and a formula for a set of functions on nilsystems that are dense in $L^2$. Finally, we show that certain correlations have optimally large intersections along an IP set</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a problem on singularity theory of differentiable (smooth) or real algebraic maps which is different from knowing existence and has been difficult: constructing explcit real algebraic functions.
  We discuss construction of real algebraic functions with exactly one singular value, the singular points being of definite type, and prescribed preimages of single points. We discuss generalizations of the canonical projection of the unit sphere around the pole and the Morse-Bott functions around the boundaries of the images with preimages diffeomorphic to the torus.
  This has been discussed in the differentiable (smooth) category since the pioneering study of Sharko in 2006, followed by Masumoto-Saeki, Michalak and so on: the author has first considered the cases respecting the topologies of the preimages of the points where these studies had not done this essentially. Related real algebraic studies have been started by the author essentially in 2020's and the studies are developing, mainly due to the author.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a family of hyperplane arrangements depending on a positive integer parameter $r$, which we refer to as the $r$-braid arrangements, and which can be viewed as a generalization of the classical braid arrangement. The wonderful compactification of the braid arrangement (with respect to its minimal building set) is well-known to yield the moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{0,n}$, and, in this work, we generalize this result, constructing a moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{M}}^r_{n}$ of certain genus-zero curves with an order-$r$ involution that we identify with the corresponding wonderful compactification of the $r$-braid arrangement. The resulting space is a variant of the previously studied moduli space $\overline{\mathcal{L}}^r_n$ [arXiv:2104.06526], related via a change of weights on the markings.</description>

      <title>On a conjectural supercongruence involving the dual sequence $s_n(x)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2017, motivated by a supercongruence conjectured by Kimoto and Wakayama and confirmed by Long, Osburn and Swisher, Z.-W. Sun introduced the sequence of polynomials: $$ s_n(x)=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}=\sum_{k=0}^n\binom{n}{k}(-1)^k\binom{x}{k}\binom{-1-x}{k} $$ and investigated its congruence properties. In particular, Z.-W. Sun conjectured that for any prime $p&gt;3$ and $p$-adic integer $x\neq-1/2$ one has \begin{equation*} \sum_{n=0}^{p-1}s_n(x)^2\equiv (-1)^{\langle x\rangle_p}\frac{p+2(x-\langle x\rangle_p)}{2x+1}\pmod{p^3}, \end{equation*} where $\langle x\rangle_p$ denotes the least nonnegative residue of $x$ modulo $p$. In this paper, we confirm this conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18370v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we introduce a unified analytic framework that connects simple varieties of trees, Bienayme-Galton-Watson processes and Khinchin families. Using Lagrange's inversion formula, we derive new coefficient-based expressions for extinction probabilities and reinterpret them as boundary phenomena tied to the domain of the inverse of the solution to Lagrange's equation. This perspective reveals a structural bridge between combinatorial and probabilistic models, simplifying classical arguments and yielding new results. It also leads to a computationally efficient method for simulating Galton-Watson processes via power series coefficients.</description>

Abstract: We present a simplified proof of a forty-year-old result concerning the tiling of the plane with equilateral convex polygons. Our new approach is based on a theorem by M. Rao, who used an exhaustive computer search to confirm the completeness of the well-known list of fifteen pentagon types. Assuming the validity of Rao's result, we provide a concise and entirely geometrical proof of a tiling theorem originally due to Hirschhorn and Hunt.</description>

      <title>Perfect phylogenies via the Minimum Uncovering Branching problem: efficiently solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present new efficiently solvable cases of the Minimum Uncovering Branching problem, an optimization problem with applications in cancer genomics introduced by Hujdurovi\'c, Husi\'c, Milani\v{c}, Rizzi, and Tomescu in 2018. The problem involves a family of finite sets, and the goal is to map each non-maximal set to exactly one set that contains it, minimizing the sum of uncovered elements across all sets in the family. Hujdurovi\'c et al. formulated the problem in terms of branchings of the digraph formed by the proper set inclusion relation on the input sets and studied the problem complexity based on properties of the corresponding partially ordered set, in particular, with respect to its height and width, defined respectively as the maximum cardinality of a chain and an antichain. They showed that the problem is APX-complete for instances of bounded height and that a constant-factor approximation algorithm exists for instances of bounded width, but left the exact complexity for bounded-width instances open. In this paper, we answer this question by proving that the problem is solvable in polynomial time. We derive this result by examining the structural properties of optimal solutions and reducing the problem to computing maximum matchings in bipartite graphs and maximum weight antichains in partially ordered sets. We also introduce a new polynomially computable lower bound and identify another condition for polynomial-time solvability.</description>

      <title>Gauged permutation invariant tensor quantum mechanics, least common multiples and the inclusion-exclusion principle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive the canonical ensemble partition functions for gauged permutation invariant tensor quantum harmonic oscillator thermodynamics, finding surprisingly simple expressions with number-theoretic characteristics. These systems have a gauged symmetry of $S_N$, the symmetric group of all permutations of a set of $N$ objects. The symmetric group acts on tensor variables $ \Phi_{ i_1, \cdots , i_s } $, where the $s$ indices each range over $ \{ 1, 2, \cdots , N \} $ and have the standard $S_N$ action of permutations. The result is a sum over partitions of $N$ and the summand is a product admitting simple expressions, which depend on the least common multiples (LCMs) of subsets of the parts of the partition. The inclusion-exclusion principle of combinatorics plays a central role in the derivation of these expressions. The behaviour of these partition functions under inversion of the Boltzmann factor $ x = e^{ - \beta } $ is governed by universal sequences associated with invariants of symmetric groups and alternating groups. The partition functions allow the development of a high temperature expansion analogous to the $s=2$ matrix case. The calculation of an $s$-dependent breakdown point leads to a critical Boltzmann factor $ x_c = { \log N \over sN^{ s-1}}$ as the leading large $N$ approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01723v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study systems of orientations on triples that satisfy the following so-called interiority condition: $\circlearrowleft(ABD)=~\circlearrowleft(BCD)=~\circlearrowleft(CAD)=1$ implies $\circlearrowleft(ABC)=1$ for any $A,B,C,D$. We call such an orientation a P3O (partial 3-order), a natural generalization of a poset, that has several interesting special cases. For example, the order type of a planar point set (that can have collinear triples) is a P3O; we denote a P3O realizable by points as p-P3O. If we do not allow $\circlearrowleft(ABC)=0$, we obtain a T3O (total 3-order). Contrary to linear orders, a T3O can have a rich structure. A T3O realizable by points, a p-T3O, is the order type of a point set in general position. In our paper "Orientation of convex sets" we defined a 3-order on pairwise intersecting convex sets; such a P3O is called a C-P3O. In this paper we extend this 3-order to pairwise intersecting good covers; such a P3O is called a GC-P3O. If we do not allow $\circlearrowleft(ABC)=0$, we obtain a C-T3O and a GC-T3O, respectively. The main result of this paper is that there is a p-T3O that is not a GC-T3O, implying also that it is not a C-T3O -- this latter problem was left open in our earlier paper. Our proof involves several combinatorial and geometric observations that can be of independent interest. Along the way, we define several further special families of GC-T3O's.</description>

Abstract: In the graph shotgun assembly problem, we are given the balls of radius $r$ around each vertex of a graph and asked to reconstruct the graph. We study the shotgun assembly of the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph $\mathcal G(n,p)$ for a wide range of values of $r$. We determine the threshold for reconstructibility for each $r\geq 3$, extending and improving substantially on results of Mossel and Ross for $r=3$.

      <title>Generating functions of dual $K$-theoretic $P$- and $Q$-functions and boson-fermion correspondence</title>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a new algebraic description of Ikeda-Naruse's $K$-theoretic Schur $P$- and $Q$-functions and their dual functions in terms of neutral fermion operators. We introduce four families of ``$\beta$-deformed neutral-fermion operators'' depending on a parameter $\beta$, which reduce to the usual neutral-fermion operators when $\beta$ is zero. Using these operators, we introduce two families of $\beta$-deformed vertex operators, power sums, and boson-fermion correspondences. From commutation relations among these operators, we naturally derive the $K$-theoretic Cauchy kernel of Nakagawa-Naruse. Exploiting this fact, we show that the four $K$-theoretic functions can be realized as vacuum expectation values of certain $\beta$-deformed fermionic operators. This presentation also allows us to derive generating functions for the dual $K$-theoretic $P$-and $Q$-functions, as conjectured by Nakagawa-Naruse.</description>

      <title>A parking function interpretation for $(-1)^{k}\nabla m_{2^{k}1^{l}}$</title>

Abstract: Haglund, Morse, and Zabrocki introduced a family of creation operators of Hall-Littlewood polynomials, $\{C_{a}\}$ for any $a\in \mathbb{Z}$, in their compositional refinement of the shuffle (ex-)conjecture. For any $\alpha\vDash n$, the combinatorial formula for $\nabla C_{\alpha}$ is a weighted sum of parking functions. These summations can be converted to a weighted sum of certain LLT polynomials. Thus $\nabla C_{\alpha}$ is Schur positive since Grojnowski and Haiman proved that all LLT polynomials are Schur positive. In this paper, we obtain a recursion that implies the $C$-positivity of $(-1)^{k} m_{2^{k}1^{l}}$, and hence prove the Schur positivity of $(-1)^{k}\nabla m_{2^{k}1^{l}}$. As a corollary, a parking function interpretation for $(-1)^{k}\nabla m_{2^{k}1^{l}}$ is obtained by using the compositional shuffle theorem of Carlsson and Mellit.</description>

Abstract: A set $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is called $r$-large if every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ admits arbitrarily long monochromatic arithmetic progressions $a,a+d,...,a+(k-1)d$ with gap $d \in D$. Closely related to largeness is accessibility; a set $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is called $r$-accessible if every $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ admits arbitrarily long monochromatic sequences $x_1,x_2,...,x_k$ with $x_{i+1}-x_{i} \in D$. It is known that if $D \subseteq \mathbb{N}$ is $2$-large, then the gaps between elements in $D$ cannot grow exponentially. In this paper, we show that if $D$ is $2$-accessible, then the gaps between elements in $D$ cannot grow much faster than exponentially. Additionally, we show that the notion of accessibility is equivalent to that of topological recurrence.</description>

      <title>Conformality of Minimal Transversals of Maximal Cliques</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10789v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $H$, the dual hypergraph of $H$ is the hypergraph of all minimal transversals of $H$. A hypergraph is conformal if it is the family of maximal cliques of a graph. In a recent work, Boros, Gurvich, Milani\v{c}, and Uno (Journal of Graph Theory, 2025) studied conformality of dual hypergraphs and proved several results related to this property, leading in particular to a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs in which all minimal transversals of maximal cliques have size at most $k$, for any fixed $k$. In this follow-up work, we provide a novel aspect to the study of graph clique transversals, by considering the dual conformality property from the perspective of graphs. More precisely, we study graphs for which the family of minimal transversals of maximal cliques is conformal. Such graphs are called clique dually conformal (CDC for short). It turns out that the class of CDC graphs is a rich generalization of the class of $P_4$-free graphs. As our main results, we completely characterize CDC graphs within the families of triangle-free graphs and split graphs. Both characterizations lead to polynomial-time recognition algorithms. Generalizing the fact that every $P_4$-free graph is CDC, we also show that the class of CDC graphs is closed under substitution, in the strong sense that substituting a graph $H$ for a vertex of a graph $G$ results in a CDC graph if and only if both $G$ and $H$ are CDC.</description>

      <title>On the Lottery Problem: Tracing Stefan Mandel's Combinatorial Condensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06857v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stefan Mandel is said to have won the lottery 14 times. He never disclosed the recipe he called combinatorial condensation, which enabled him to hit the Romanian lottery jackpot in the early phase of his betting career. Combinatorial condensation is frequently mixed up with another strategy known as buying the pot, which Stefan Mandel was pursuing later on. On occasion, he dropped a few hints on combinatorial condensation. The hints are applied in this work to narrow down and assess his initial recipe. The underlying theory resembles what a weekend mathematician, as he once referred to himself, may have encountered in the 1960s. The cardinality of the (15, 6, 6, 5) and (49, 6, 6, 5) lottery schemes shows that Stefan Mandel probably wasn't aware of lottery designs. First concepts on such topics had been available at that time, but coherent theories on combinatorial designs took off only in later decades. There is no absolute evidence beyond doubt, but the size of actual covering designs and the associated efforts allow the following hypothesis: Stefan Mandel most likely pioneered in constructing a (15, 6, 5) covering design many years before others published about it, which he applied in the Romanian lottery. Calculations indicate that he took considerable risks that his method might fail, because he limited himself to a subset of 15 numbers out of 49 numbers. The risks explain why he later changed his strategy from combinatorial condensation to buying the pot.</description>

      <title>On the fractional matching extendability of Cayley graphs of Abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fractional matching extendability is a concept that brings together two widely studied topics in graph theory, namely that of fractional matchings and that of matching extendability. A {\em fractional matching} of a graph $\Gamma$ with edge set $E$ is a function $f$ from $E$ to the real interval $[0,1]$ with the property that for each vertex $v$ of $\Gamma$, the sum of $f$-values of all the edges incident to $v$ is at most $1$. When this sum equals $1$ for each vertex $v$, the fractional matching is {\em perfect}. A graph of order at least $2t+1$ is {\em fractional $t$-extendable} if it contains a matching of size $t$ and if each such matching $M$ can be extended to a fractional perfect matching in the sense that the corresponding function $f$ assigns value $1$ to each edge of $M$.
  In this paper, we study fractional matching extendability of Cayley graphs of Abelian groups. We show that, except for the odd cycles, all connected Cayley graphs of Abelian groups are fractional $1$-extendable and we classify the fractional $2$-extendable Cayley graphs of Abelian groups. This extends the classification of $2$-extendable (in the classical sense) connected Cayley graphs of Abelian groups of even order from 1995, obtained by Chan, Chen and Yu.</description>

      <title>Linearly-exponential checking is enough for the Lonely Runner Conjecture and some of its variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tao (2018) showed that in order to prove the Lonely Runner Conjecture (LRC) up to $n+1$ runners it suffices to consider positive integer velocities in the order of $n^{O(n^2)}$. Using the zonotopal reinterpretation of the conjecture due to the first and third authors (2017) we here drastically improve this result, showing that velocities up to $\binom{n+1}{2}^{n-1} \le n^{2n}$ are enough.
  We prove the same finite-checking result, with the same bound, for the more general \emph{shifted} Lonely Runner Conjecture (sLRC), except in this case our result depends on the solution of a question, that we dub the \emph{Lonely Vector Problem} (LVP), about sumsets of $n$ rational vectors in dimension two. We also prove the same finite-checking bound for a further generalization of sLRC that concerns cosimple zonotopes with $n$ generators, a class of lattice zonotopes that we introduce.
  In the last sections we look at dimensions two and three. In dimension two we prove our generalized version of sLRC (hence we reprove the sLRC for four runners), and in dimension three we show that to prove sLRC for five runners it suffices to look at velocities adding up to $195$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the dotted pattern-avoiding map $s_{\dot{\tau}}$, which avoids the dotted pattern $\dot{\tau}$ instead of descents as West's stack-sorting map $s$ does. We also extend the pattern-avoiding machine, which is composed of a $\sigma$ avoiding map and West's stack-sorting map $s$, to the dotted pattern-avoiding machine. In this paper, we prove the analogs of the classical results on West's stack sorting map for the length $2$ dotted pattern-avoiding maps. We end with several conjectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1975 Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di asked what minimum degree guarantees an octahedral subgraph $K_3(2)$ in any tripartite graph $G$ with $n$ vertices in each vertex class. We show that $\delta(G)\geq n+2n^{\frac{5}{6}}$ suffices thus improving the bound $n+(1+o(1))n^{\frac{11}{12}}$ of Bhalkikar and Zhao obtained by following their approach. Bollob\'{a}s, Erd\H{o}s, and Szemer\'{e}di conjectured that $n+cn^{\frac{1}{2}}$ suffices and there are many $K_3(2)$-free tripartite graphs $G$ with $\delta(G)\geq n+cn^{\frac{1}{2}}$. We confirm this conjecture under the additional assumption that every vertex in $G$ is adjacent to at least $(1/5+\varepsilon)n$ vertices in any other vertex class.</description>

      <title>Blocking Ideals: a method for filtering linear extensions of a finite poset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11073v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard notion of poset probability of a finite poset P involves calculating, for incomparable $\alpha$, $\beta$ in P, the number of linear extensions of P for which $\alpha$ precedes $\beta$. The fraction of those linear extensions among all linear extensions of P is the probability that $\alpha &lt; \beta$. The question of whether there is always a pair $\alpha, \beta$ such that this probability lies between 1/3 and 2/3, in any poset P (that is not a chain) is the famous "1/3-2/3-conjecture".
  A general way of counting linear extensions of P for which $\alpha$ precedes $\beta$ is to count linear extensions of the poset obtained by adding the relation $(\alpha,\beta)$, and its transitive consequences.
  For chain-products, and more generally for partition posets, lattice-path methods can be used to count the number of those linear extensions.
  We present an alternative approach to find the pertinent linear extensions. It relies on finding the "blocking ideals" in $J(P)$, where $J(P)$ is the lattice of order ideals in P. This method works for all finite posets.
  We illustrate this method by using blocking ideals to find explicit formulas of poset probabilities in cell posets $P_{\lambda}$ of two-row partitions. Well-known formulae such as the hook-length formula for $f^\lambda$, the number of standard Young tableaux on a partition $\lambda$, and the corresponding determinental formula by Jacobi-Trudi-Aitken for $f^{\lambda / \mu}$, the number of standard Young tableaux on a skew partition $\lambda / \mu$, are used along the way.
  We also calculate the limit probabilities when the elements $\alpha,\beta$ are fixed cells, but the arm-lengths tend to infinity.</description>

      <title>Tropical cycles of discrete admissible covers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article applies the technical framework developed in previous work by the author to discrete admissible covers and their moduli spaces. More precisely, we construct a poic-space that parameterizes the discrete admissible covers after fixing the genus of the target, the number of marked legs, and prescribing the ramification profiles above these marked legs. We then construct a linear poic-fibration over this poic-space and show that the usual weight assignment of covers produces an equivariant cycle of this poic-fibration. This poic-fibration comes naturally with source and target maps, and after taking the weak pushforward in top dimension through the source map and subsequently forgetting the marking, this gives rise to an equivariant tropical cycle of the corresponding spanning tree fibration. Through this framework we obtain a generalization of previously known results on these cycles pertaining to the gonality of tropical curves. Special cases of these tropical cycles yield the following result: \emph{A generic genus-$g$ $r$-marked tropical curve $\Gamma$ (with $g+r$ even) has $C_{\frac{g+r}{2}}$ many $r$-marked discrete admissible covers of degree $\frac{g+r}{2}+1$ of a tree (counted with multiplicity) that have a tropical modification of $\Gamma$ as a source, where $C_{\frac{g+r}{2}}$ is the $(\frac{g+r}{2})$th Catalan number}.</description>

      <title>Total $k$-coalition: bounds, exact values and an application to double coalition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G=\big{(}V(G),E(G)\big{)}$ be a graph with minimum degree $k$. A subset $S\subseteq V(G)$ is called a total $k$-dominating set if every vertex in $G$ has at least $k$ neighbors in $S$. Two disjoint sets $A,B\subset V(G)$ form a total $k$-coalition in $G$ if none of them is a total $k$-dominating set in $G$ but their union $A\cup B$ is a total $k$-dominating set. A vertex partition $\Omega=\{V_{1},\ldots,V_{|\Omega|}\}$ of $G$ is a total $k$-coalition partition if each set $V_{i}$ forms a total $k$-coalition with another set $V_{j}$. The total $k$-coalition number ${\rm TC}_{k}(G)$ of $G$ equals the maximum cardinality of a total $k$-coalition partition of $G$. In this paper, the above-mentioned concept are investigated from combinatorial points of view. Several sharp lower and upper bounds on ${\rm TC}_{k}(G)$ are proved, where the main emphasis is given on the invariant when $k=2$. As a consequence, the exact values of ${\rm TC}_2(G)$ when $G$ is a cubic graph or a $4$-regular graph are obtained. By using similar methods, an open question posed by Henning and Mojdeh regarding double coalition is answered. Moreover, ${\rm TC}_3(G)$ is determined when $G$ is a cubic graph.</description>

Abstract: The Littlewood decomposition for partitions is a well-known bijection between partitions and pairs of $t$-core and $t$-quotient partitions. This decomposition can be described in several ways, such as the $t$-abacus method of James or the biinfinite word method of Garvan, Kim, and Stanton. In a recent study, Frobenius partitions have proven to be a highly useful tool in dealing with partition statistics related to $t$-core partitions. Motivated by this study, in this paper, we present an alternative description of the Littlewood decomposition using Frobenius partitions. We also apply our approach to self-conjugate partitions and doubled distinct partitions, and give new characterizations of their $t$-cores and $t$-quotients.</description>

      <title>An upper bound for the planar Turan number ofdouble star S_(3,5)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph H and a positive integer n, the planar Turan number of H, denoted by exp(n, H), is the maximum number of edges in an n-vertex H-free planar graph.Ghosh, et al. initiated the topic of double stars S_(k,l) for two positive integers k and l and recently Xu et al.[AIMS Mathematics, 2025, 10(1): 1628-1644.] mentioned that exp(n, S_(3,5)) is still unknown.In this paper, we establish an upper bound for the planar Turan number of a graph G that does not contain the double star S_(3,5), which is 23n/8 - 9/2 for all n &gt;= 2. The upper bound is tight for n = 12.</description>

      <title>Vertex Partitioning and $p$-Energy of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a Hermitian matrix $A$ of order $n$ with eigenvalues $\lambda_1(A)\ge \cdots\ge \lambda_n(A)$, define \[ \mathcal{E}_p^+(A)=\sum_{\lambda_i &gt; 0} \lambda_i^p(A), \quad \mathcal{E}_p^-(A)=\sum_{\lambda_i&lt;0} |\lambda_i(A)|^p,\] to be the positive and the negative $p$-energy of $A$, respectively. In this note, first we show that if $A=[A_{ij}]_{i,j=1}^k$, where $A_{ii}$ are square matrices, then \[ \mathcal{E}_p^+(A)\geq \sum_{i=1}^{k} \mathcal{E}_p^+(A_{ii}), \quad \mathcal{E}_p^-(A)\geq \sum_{i=1}^{k} \mathcal{E}_p^-(A_{ii}),\] for any real number $p\geq 1$. We then apply the previous inequality to establish lower bounds for $p$-energy of the adjacency matrix of graphs.</description>

      <title>Extreme Points of Base Polytope of Submodular Set Functions and Limit for Quotient Convergent Graph Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Submodular set functions are of great importance in mathematics and theoretical computer science, serving as fundamental tools in optimization, combinatorics, and economics due to their natural properties and wide-ranging applications. In 2023, Lov\'asz systematically extended the theory of submodular set functions from finite sets to general set algebras and proposed several open problems about the behavior of submodular functions in infinite settings, including the characterization of extreme points of the base polytope of submodular set functions.
  We characterize conditions under which the extreme points of the base polytope of a submodular function are restricting measures with respect to its majorizing measure. Applying this result, we characterize the core of increasing subadditive non-atomic games and provide a positive answer to a question of Krist\'of B\'erzi, M\'arton Borb\'enyi, L\'aszl\'o Lov\'asz and L\'aszl\'o M\'arton T\'oth regarding the rank function for graphing's cycle matroid.
  Furthermore, building on the limit theory for set functions, we prove that the limit of convergent sequence of bounded-degree graphs' cycle matroids can be represented as the cycle matroid of a graphing, analogous to the completeness result for local-global convergence.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph on $n$ vertices with girth $g$. Let $m_GI$ denote the number of Laplacian eigenvalues of graph $G$ in an interval $I$. In this paper, we show that if $G$ is not a cycle, then $m_G(n-g+3,n]\leq n-g$. Moreover, we prove that $m_G(n-g+3,n]= n-g$ if and only if $G\cong C_3$ or $G\cong K_{3,2}$ or $G\cong U_1$, where $U_1$ is obtained from a cycle by joining a single vertex with a vertex of this cycle.</description>

      <title>Independent Set Enumeration in King Graphs by Tensor Network Contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the enumeration of independent sets in king graphs of size $m \times n$, based on the tensor network contractions algorithm given in reference~\cite{tilEnum}. We transform the problem into Wang tiling enumeration within an $(m+1) \times (n+1)$ rectangle and compute the results for all cases where $m + n \leq 79$ using tensor network contraction algorithm, and provided an approximation for larger $m, n$.
  Using the same algorithm, we also enumerated independent sets with vertex number restrictions. Based on the results, we analyzed the vertex number that maximize the enumeration for each pair $(m, n)$. Additionally, we compute the corresponding weighted enumeration, where each independent set is weighted by the number of its vertices (i.e., the total sum of vertices over all independent sets). The approximations for larger $m, n$ are given as well.
  Our results have added thousands of new items to the OEIS sequences A089980 and A193580. In addition, the combinatorial problems above are closely related to the hard-core model in physics. We estimate some important constants based on the existing results, and the relative error between our estimation of the entropy constant and the existing results is less than $10^{-9}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.15606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a variety of new identities involving operators in the theory of wreath Macdonald polynomials. One such family of identities gives five-term relations, analogous to the one given by Garsia and Mellit for the modified Macdonald polynomials. As a consequence, we generate tableau formulas for wreath Macdonald Pieri coefficients, which give an incredibly quick way of computing their monomial expansions.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for 1-independent percolation on $\mathbb{Z}^n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A 1-independent bond percolation model on a graph $G$ is a probability distribution on the spanning subgraphs of $G$ in which, for all vertex-disjoint sets of edges $S_1$ and $S_2$, the states of the edges in $S_1$ are independent of the states of the edges in $S_2$. Such a model is said to percolate if the random subgraph has an infinite component with positive probability. In 2012 the first author and Bollob\'as defined $p_{\max}(G)$ to be the supremum of those $p$ for which there exists a 1-independent bond percolation model on $G$ in which each edge is present in the random subgraph with probability at least $p$ but which does not percolate.
  A fundamental and challenging problem in this area is to determine the value of $p_{\max}(G)$ when $G$ is the lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^2$. Since $p_{\max}(\mathbb{Z}^n)\leq p_{\max}(\mathbb{Z}^{n-1})$, it is also of interest to establish the value of $\lim_{n\to\infty} p_{\max}(\mathbb{Z}^n)$. In this paper we significantly improve the best known upper bound on this limit and obtain better upper and lower bounds on $p_{\max}(\mathbb{Z}^2)$. In proving these results, we also give an upper bound on the critical probability for a 1-independent model on the hypercube graph to contain a giant component asymptotically almost surely.</description>

      <title>Colored Interacting Particle Systems on the Ring: Stationary Measures from Yang-Baxter Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been much progress in understanding stationary measures for colored (also called multi-species or multi-type) interacting particle systems, motivated by asymptotic phenomena and rich underlying algebraic and combinatorial structures (such as nonsymmetric Macdonald polynomials).
  In this paper, we present a unified approach to constructing stationary measures for most of the known colored particle systems on the ring and the line, including (1) the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (multispecies ASEP, or mASEP); (2) the q-deformed Totally Asymmetric Zero Range Process (TAZRP) also known as the q-Boson particle system; (3) the q-deformed Pushing Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (q-PushTASEP). Our method is based on integrable stochastic vertex models and the Yang-Baxter equation. We express the stationary measures as partition functions of new "queue vertex models" on the cylinder. The stationarity property is a direct consequence of the Yang-Baxter equation.
  For the mASEP on the ring, a particular case of our vertex model is equivalent to the multiline queues of Martin (arXiv:1810.10650). For the colored q-Boson process and the q-PushTASEP on the ring, we recover and generalize known stationary measures constructed using multiline queues or other methods by Ayyer-Mandelshtam-Martin (arXiv:2011.06117, arXiv:2209.09859), and Bukh-Cox (arXiv:1912.03510). Our proofs of stationarity use the Yang-Baxter equation and bypass the Matrix Product Ansatz used for the mASEP by Prolhac-Evans-Mallick (arXiv:0812.3293).
  On the line and in a quadrant, we use the Yang-Baxter equation to establish a general colored Burke's theorem, which implies that suitable specializations of our queue vertex models produce stationary measures for particle systems on the line. We also compute the colored particle currents in stationarity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05930v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The famous Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem for the complete graph on six vertices was extended to the general complete graph on $n$ vertices by Kazakov--Korablev as a congruence modulo $2$, and its integral lift was given by Morishita--Nikkuni. However, the proof is complicated and long. In this paper, we provide a shorter proof of the generalized Conway--Gordon--Sachs theorem over integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Copositive matrices and copositive polynomials are objects from optimization. We connect these to the geometry of Feynman integrals in physics. The integral is guaranteed to converge if its kinematic parameters lie in the copositive cone. P\'olya's method makes this manifest. We study the copositive cone for the second Symanzik polynomial of any Feynman graph. Its algebraic boundary is described by Landau discriminants.</description>
