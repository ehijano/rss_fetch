      <title>The impact of economic policies on housing prices. Approximations and predictions in the UK, the US, France, and Switzerland from the 1980s to today</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I show that house prices can be modeled using machine learning (kNN and tree-bagging) and a small dataset composed of macro-economic factors (MEF), including an inflation metric (CPI), US treasury rates (10-yr), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and portfolio size of central banks (ECB, FED). This set of parameters covers all the parties involved in a transaction (buyer, seller, and financing facility) while ignoring the intrinsic properties of each asset and encompassing local (inflation) and liquidity issues that may impede each transaction composing a market. The model here takes the point of view of a real estate trader who is interested in both the financing and the price of the transaction. Machine Learning allows for the discrimination of two periods within the dataset. Unconventional policies of central banks may have allowed some institutional investors to arbitrage between real estate returns and other bond markets (sovereign and corporate). Finally, to assess the models' relative performances, I performed various sensitivity tests, which tend to constrain the possibilities of each approach for each need. I also show that some models can predict the evolution of prices over the next 4 quarters with uncertainties that outperform existing index uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of information communication and market price movements. The case of SP 500 market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we analyze how market prices change in response to information processing among the market participants and how non-linear information dynamics drive market price movement. We analyze historical data of the SP 500 market for the period 1950 -2025 using the logistic Continuous Wavelet Transformation method. This approach allows us to identify various patterns in market dynamics. These patterns are conceptualized using a new theory of reflexive communication of information in a market consisting of heterogeneous agents who assign meaning to information from different perspectives. This allows us to describe market dynamics and make forecasts of its development using the most general mechanisms of information circulation within the content-free approach.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moment of empirical degree distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for fees in AMMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the ever evolving landscape of decentralized finance automated market makers (AMMs) play a key role: they provide a market place for trading assets in a decentralized manner. For so-called bluechip pairs, arbitrage activity provides a major part of the revenue generation of AMMs but also a major source of loss due to the so-called informed orderflow. Finding ways to minimize those losses while still keeping uninformed trading activity alive is a major problem in the field. In this paper we will investigate the mechanics of said arbitrage and try to understand how AMMs can maximize the revenue creation or in other words minimize the losses. To that end, we model the dynamics of arbitrage activity for a concrete implementation of a pool and study its sensitivity to the choice of fee aiming to maximize the value retention. We manage to map the ensuing dynamics to that of a random walk with a specific reward scheme that provides a convenient starting point for further studies.</description>

      <title>Fees in AMMs: A quantitative study</title>

For so-called bluechip pairs, arbitrage activity provides a major part of the revenue generation of AMMs but also a major source of loss due to the so-called 'informed orderflow'. Finding ways to minimize those losses while still keeping uninformed trading activity alive is a major problem in the field. In this paper we will investigate the mechanics of said arbitrage and try to understand how AMMs can maximize the revenue creation or in other words minimize the losses. To that end, we model the dynamics of arbitrage activity for a concrete implementation of a pool and study its sensitivity to the choice of fee aiming to maximize the revenue for the AMM. We identify dynamical fees that mimic the directionality of the price due to asymmetric fee choices as a promising avenue to mitigate losses to toxic flow. This work is based on and extends a recent article by some of the authors.</description>

      <title>Impermanent loss and loss-vs-rebalancing I: some statistical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are two predominant metrics to assess the performance of automated market makers and their profitability for liquidity providers: 'impermanent loss' (IL) and 'loss-versus-rebalance' (LVR). In this short paper we shed light on the statistical aspects of both concepts and show that they are more similar than conventionally appreciated. Our analysis uses the properties of a random walk and some analytical properties of the statistical integral combined with the mechanics of a constant function market maker (CFMM). We consider non-toxic or rather unspecific trading in this paper. Our main finding can be summarized in one sentence: For Brownian motion with a given volatility, IL and LVR have identical expectation values but vastly differing distribution functions.</description>

      <title>Impermanent loss and Loss-vs-Rebalancing II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between impermanent loss (IL) and loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) in automated market makers (AMMs). Our main focus is on statistical properties, the impact of fees, the role of block times, and, related to the latter, the continuous time limit. We find there are three relevant regimes: (i) very short times where LVR and IL are identical; (ii) intermediate time where LVR and IL show distinct distribution functions but are connected via the central limit theorem exhibiting the same expectation value; (iii) long time behavior where both the distribution functions and averages are distinct. Subsequently, we study how fees change this dynamics with a special focus on competing time scales like block times and 'arbitrage times'.</description>
