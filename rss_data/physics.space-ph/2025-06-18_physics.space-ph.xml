      <title>Impact of Gravity Waves From Tropospheric and Non-tropospheric Sources on the Middle and Upper Atmosphere and Comparison with ICON/MIGHTI Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical and thermal roles of internal gravity waves generated in the troposphere and above using the Coupled Middle Atmosphere Thermosphere-2 General Circulation Model. This model incorporates the whole atmosphere nonlinear gravity wave parameterization and its extension to include non-tropospheric sources. We conducted model experiments for northern summer solstice conditions, first including only tropospheric sources, then including sources localized at 50 and 90 km, and uniformly distributed over all heights. The simulated differences in mean temperature and horizontal winds demonstrate that gravity waves produce the greatest dynamical and thermal changes in the latter case compared to the localized sources. While the gravity wave drag is longitudinally uniform in the lower thermosphere, it is more localized in the upper thermosphere in all the simulations. Waves from uniformly distributed sources increase the longitudinal variability of zonal winds in the thermosphere up to $\sim$150 km. Gravity wave effects exhibit different local time variations in the lower thermosphere (100--140 km) than in the upper thermosphere. In the upper thermosphere, gravity wave effects are stronger during the day than at night. In contrast, nighttime gravity wave effects are stronger than the daytime ones in the lower thermosphere. Finally, a comparison with ICON-MIGHTI observations shows that the model reproduces the basic structure of thermospheric winds, performing better with zonal winds than with meridional winds. Adding non-tropospheric wave sources modifies wind structures in wave-breaking regions, but does not improve the global statistical comparison.</description>

      <title>The Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT): an Adaptive Segmentation of the Open-Flux Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical observations of solar corona provide key information on its magnetic geometry. The large-scale open field of the corona plays an important role in shaping the ambient solar wind and constraining the propagation dynamics of the embedded structures, such as interplanetary coronal mass ejections. Rigorous analysis of the open-flux coronal regions based on coronagraph images can be quite challenging because of the depleted plasma density resulting in low signal-to-noise ratios. In this paper, we present an in-depth description of a new image segmentation methodology, the Quasi-Radial Field-line Tracing (QRaFT), enabling a detection of field-aligned optical coronal features approximating the orientation of the steady-state open magnetic field. The methodology is tested using synthetic coronagraph images generated by a three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic model. The results of the numerical tests indicate that the extracted optical features are aligned within $\sim 4-7$ degrees with the local magnetic field in the underlying numerical solution. We also demonstrate the performance of the method on real-life coronal images obtained from a space-borne coronagraph and a ground-based camera. We argue that QRaFT outputs contain valuable empirical information about the global steady-state morphology of the corona which could help improving the accuracy of coronal and solar wind models and space weather forecasts.</description>
