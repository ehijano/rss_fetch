      <title>New affine invariant ensemble samplers and their dimensional scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce some new affine invariant ensemble samplers that are easy to construct and improve upon existing widely used algorithms, especially for high-dimensional problems. Specifically, we propose a derivative-free ensemble side move sampler that performs favorably compared to popular samplers in the \texttt{emcee} package. Additionally, we develop a class of derivative-based ensemble Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) samplers with affine invariance, which outperform standard HMC without affine invariance when sampling highly skewed distributions. We provide asymptotic scaling analysis for high-dimensional Gaussian targets to further elucidate the properties of these affine invariant ensemble samplers. In particular, with derivative information, the affine invariant ensemble HMC can scale much better with dimension compared to derivative-free ensemble samplers.</description>

      <title>Robust High-Dimensional Covariate-Assisted Network Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern network data analysis often involves analyzing network structures alongside covariate features to gain deeper insights into underlying patterns. However, traditional covariate-assisted statistical network models may not adequately handle cases involving high-dimensional covariates, where some covariates could be uninformative or misleading, or the possible mismatch between network and covariate information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel robust high-dimensional covariate-assisted latent space model. This framework links latent vectors representing network structures with simultaneously sparse and low-rank transformations of the high-dimensional covariates, capturing the mutual dependence between network structures and covariates. To robustly integrate this dependence, we use a shrinkage prior on the discrepancy between latent network vectors and low-rank covariate approximation vectors, allowing for potential mismatches between network and covariate information. For scalable inference, we develop two variational inference algorithms, enabling efficient analysis of large-scale sparse networks. We establish the posterior concentration rate within a suitable parameter space and demonstrate how the proposed model facilitates adaptive information aggregation between networks and high-dimensional covariates. Extensive simulation studies and real-world data analyses confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric learning of covariate-based Markov jump processes using RKHS techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel nonparametric approach for linking covariates to Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) using the mathematical framework of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). CTMCs provide a robust framework for modeling transitions across clinical or behavioral states, but traditional multistate models often rely on linear relationships. In contrast, we use a generalized Representer Theorem to enable tractable inference in functional space. For the Frequentist version, we apply normed square penalties, while for the Bayesian version, we explore sparsity inducing spike and slab priors. Due to the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional spaces, we successfully adapt the Expectation Maximization Variable Selection (EMVS) algorithm to efficiently identify the posterior mode. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through extensive simulation studies and an application to follicular cell lymphoma data. Our performance metrics include the normalized difference between estimated and true nonlinear transition functions, as well as the difference in the probability of getting absorbed in one the final states, capturing the ability of our approach to predict long-term behaviors.</description>

      <title>Relaxed Gaussian process interpolation: a goal-oriented approach to Bayesian optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.03034v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a new procedure for obtaining predictive distributions in the context of Gaussian process (GP) modeling, with a relaxation of the interpolation constraints outside ranges of interest: the mean of the predictive distributions no longer necessarily interpolates the observed values when they are outside ranges of interest, but are simply constrained to remain outside. This method called relaxed Gaussian process (reGP) interpolation provides better predictive distributions in ranges of interest, especially in cases where a stationarity assumption for the GP model is not appropriate. It can be viewed as a goal-oriented method and becomes particularly interesting in Bayesian optimization, for example, for the minimization of an objective function, where good predictive distributions for low function values are important. When the expected improvement criterion and reGP are used for sequentially choosing evaluation points, the convergence of the resulting optimization algorithm is theoretically guaranteed (provided that the function to be optimized lies in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space attached to the known covariance of the underlying Gaussian process). Experiments indicate that using reGP instead of stationary GP models in Bayesian optimization is beneficial.</description>

      <title>Perspectives on locally weighted ensemble Kalman methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00027v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This manuscript derives locally weighted ensemble Kalman methods from the point of view of ensemble-based function approximation. This is done by using pointwise evaluations to build up a local linear or quadratic approximation of a function, tapering off the effect of distant particles via local weighting. This introduces a candidate method (the locally weighted Ensemble Kalman method for inversion) with the motivation of combining some of the strengths of the particle filter (ability to cope with nonlinear maps and non-Gaussian distributions) and the Ensemble Kalman filter (no filter degeneracy). We provide some numerical evidence for the accuracy of locally weighted ensemble methods, both in terms of approximation and inversion.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference for Uncertainty Quantification: an Analysis of Trade-offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13748v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an intractable distribution $p$, the problem of variational inference (VI) is to find the best approximation from some more tractable family $Q$. Commonly, one chooses $Q$ to be a family of factorized distributions (i.e., the mean-field assumption), even though~$p$ itself does not factorize. We show that this mismatch leads to an impossibility theorem: if $p$ does not factorize, then any factorized approximation $q\in Q$ can correctly estimate at most one of the following three measures of uncertainty: (i) the marginal variances, (ii) the marginal precisions, or (iii) the generalized variance (which can be related to the entropy). In practice, the best variational approximation in $Q$ is found by minimizing some divergence $D(q,p)$ between distributions, and so we ask: how does the choice of divergence determine which measure of uncertainty, if any, is correctly estimated by VI? We consider the classic Kullback-Leibler divergences, the more general $\alpha$-divergences, and a score-based divergence which compares $\nabla \log p$ and $\nabla \log q$. We provide a thorough theoretical analysis in the setting where $p$ is a Gaussian and $q$ is a (factorized) Gaussian. We show that all the considered divergences can be \textit{ordered} based on the estimates of uncertainty they yield as objective functions for~VI. Finally, we empirically evaluate the validity of this ordering when the target distribution $p$ is not Gaussian.</description>

      <title>Sparse-Group Boosting with Balanced Selection Frequencies: A Simulation-Based Approach and R Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.21037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.21037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework for reducing variable selection bias by balancing selection frequencies of base-learners in boosting and introduces the sgboost package in R, which implements this framework combined with sparse-group boosting. The group bias reduction algorithm employs a simulation-based approach to iteratively adjust the degrees of freedom for both individual and group base-learners, ensuring balanced selection probabilities and mitigating the tendency to over-select more complex groups. The efficacy of the group balancing algorithm is demonstrated through simulations. Sparse-group boosting offers a flexible approach for both group and individual variable selection, reducing overfitting and enhancing model interpretability for modeling high-dimensional data with natural groupings in covariates. The package uses regularization techniques based on the degrees of freedom of individual and group base-learners. Through comparisons with existing methods and demonstration of its unique functionalities, this paper provides a practical guide on utilizing sparse-group boosting in R, accompanied by code examples to facilitate its application in various research domains.</description>
