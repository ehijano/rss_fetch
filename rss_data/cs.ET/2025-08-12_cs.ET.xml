      <title>LSDTs: LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins for Adaptive Knowledge-Intensive Infrastructure Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06799v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital Twins (DTs) offer powerful tools for managing complex infrastructure systems, but their effectiveness is often limited by challenges in integrating unstructured knowledge. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) bring new potential to address this gap, with strong abilities in extracting and organizing diverse textual information. We therefore propose LSDTs (LLM-Augmented Semantic Digital Twins), a framework that helps LLMs extract planning knowledge from unstructured documents like environmental regulations and technical guidelines, and organize it into a formal ontology. This ontology forms a semantic layer that powers a digital twin-a virtual model of the physical system-allowing it to simulate realistic, regulation-aware planning scenarios. We evaluate LSDTs through a case study of offshore wind farm planning in Maryland, including its application during Hurricane Sandy. Results demonstrate that LSDTs support interpretable, regulation-aware layout optimization, enable high-fidelity simulation, and enhance adaptability in infrastructure planning. This work shows the potential of combining generative AI with digital twins to support complex, knowledge-driven planning tasks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Mega-Satellite Networks with Generative Semantic Communication: A Networking Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The advance of direct satellite-to-device communication has positioned mega-satellite constellations as a cornerstone of 6G wireless communication, enabling seamless global connectivity even in remote and underserved areas. However, spectrum scarcity and capacity constraints imposed by the Shannon's classical information theory remain significant challenges for supporting the massive data demands of multimedia-rich wireless applications. Generative Semantic Communication (GSC), powered by artificial intelligence-based generative foundation models, represents a paradigm shift from transmitting raw data to exchanging semantic meaning. GSC can not only reduce bandwidth consumption, but also enhance key semantic features in multimedia content, thereby offering a promising solution to overcome the limitations of traditional satellite communication systems. This article investigates the integration of GSC into mega-satellite constellations from a networking perspective. We propose a GSC-empowered satellite networking architecture and identify key enabling technologies, focusing on GSC-empowered network modeling and GSC-aware networking strategies. We construct a discrete temporal graph to model semantic encoders and decoders, distinct knowledge bases, and resource variations in mega-satellite networks. Based on this framework, we develop model deployment for semantic encoders and decoders and GSC-compatible routing schemes, and then present performance evaluations. Finally, we outline future research directions for advancing GSC-empowered satellite networks.</description>

      <title>Recommendation with Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models are a class of AI models capable of creating new instances of data by learning and sampling from their statistical distributions. In recent years, these models have gained prominence in machine learning due to the development of approaches such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational autoencoders (VAEs), and transformer-based architectures such as GPT. These models have applications across various domains, such as image generation, text synthesis, and music composition. In recommender systems, generative models, referred to as Gen-RecSys, improve the accuracy and diversity of recommendations by generating structured outputs, text-based interactions, and multimedia content. By leveraging these capabilities, Gen-RecSys can produce more personalized, engaging, and dynamic user experiences, expanding the role of AI in eCommerce, media, and beyond.
  Our book goes beyond existing literature by offering a comprehensive understanding of generative models and their applications, with a special focus on deep generative models (DGMs) and their classification. We introduce a taxonomy that categorizes DGMs into three types: ID-driven models, large language models (LLMs), and multimodal models. Each category addresses unique technical and architectural advancements within its respective research area. This taxonomy allows researchers to easily navigate developments in Gen-RecSys across domains such as conversational AI and multimodal content generation. Additionally, we examine the impact and potential risks of generative models, emphasizing the importance of robust evaluation frameworks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Privacy Indicators in Extended Reality: Multimodal Design for Situationally Impaired Bystanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Extended Reality (XR) devices become increasingly prevalent in everyday settings, they raise significant privacy concerns for bystanders: individuals in the vicinity of an XR device during its use, whom the device sensors may accidentally capture. Current privacy indicators, such as small LEDs, often presume that bystanders are attentive enough to interpret the privacy signals. However, these cues can be easily overlooked when bystanders are distracted or have limited vision. We define such individuals as situationally impaired bystanders. This study explores XR privacy indicator designs that are effective for situationally impaired bystanders. A focus group with eight participants was conducted to design five novel privacy indicators. We evaluated these designs through a user study with seven additional participants. Our results show that visual-only indicators, typical in commercial XR devices, received low ratings for perceived usefulness in impairment scenarios. In contrast, multimodal indicators were preferred in privacy-sensitive scenarios with situationally impaired bystanders. Ultimately, our results highlight the need to move toward adaptable, multimodal, and situationally aware designs that effectively support bystander privacy in everyday XR environments.</description>

      <title>Understanding NFTs from EIP Standards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the technical foundations of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) remain inadequately understood. Prior research has focused on market dynamics, user behavior, and isolated security incidents, yet systematic analysis of the standards underpinning NFT functionality is largely absent.
  We present the first study of NFTs through the lens of Ethereum Improvement Proposals (EIPs). We conduct a large-scale empirical analysis of 191 NFT-related EIPs and 10K+ Ethereum Magicians discussions (as of July, 2025). We integrate multi-dimensional analyses including the automated parsing of Solidity interfaces, graph-based modeling of inheritance structures, contributor profiling, and mining of community discussion data. We distinguish foundational from emerging standards, expose poor cross-version interoperability, and show that growing functional complexity heightens security risks.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Systematic Interoperability: Convergences and Mismatches between Web 3.0 and the EU Data Act</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interoperability is increasingly recognised as a foundational principle for fostering innovation, competition, and user autonomy in the evolving digital ecosystem. Existing research on interoperability predominantly focuses either on technological interoperability itself or on the legal regulations concerning interoperability, with insufficient exploration of their interdisciplinary intersection. This paper compares the technological interoperability in Web 3.0 with the theoretical framework of legal interoperability established by the EU Data Act, analysing the areas of convergence and mismatch. The goal is to align technical interoperability with legal concepts of interoperability, thereby enhancing the practical implementation of systematic interoperability in the next generation of the Web. This study finds that, firstly, Web 3.0's concept of interoperability spans data, systems, and applications, while the Data Act focuses solely on data. This narrow scope risks creating a fragmented ecosystem, where data exchange is possible, but full integration of systems and applications is hindered, leading to inefficiencies, and obstructing seamless data flow across platforms. Secondly, while Web 3.0 technically seeks to achieve interoperability through the integration of entire systems and decentralised applications, the compliance with Data Act might negatively limit such system and application interoperability through its data interoperability provisions. This paper suggests interdisciplinary recommendations to enhance the implementation and enforcement of interoperability. On one hand, the Data Act should broaden its concept of interoperability to encompass both the systems and applications layers. On the other hand, it is advisable to introduce provisions for standardised protocols through soft law mechanisms to address legal shortcomings and keep pace with technological advancements.</description>

      <title>DoorDet: Semi-Automated Multi-Class Door Detection Dataset via Object Detection and Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate detection and classification of diverse door types in floor plans drawings is critical for multiple applications, such as building compliance checking, and indoor scene understanding. Despite their importance, publicly available datasets specifically designed for fine-grained multi-class door detection remain scarce. In this work, we present a semi-automated pipeline that leverages a state-of-the-art object detector and a large language model (LLM) to construct a multi-class door detection dataset with minimal manual effort. Doors are first detected as a unified category using a deep object detection model. Next, an LLM classifies each detected instance based on its visual and contextual features. Finally, a human-in-the-loop stage ensures high-quality labels and bounding boxes. Our method significantly reduces annotation cost while producing a dataset suitable for benchmarking neural models in floor plan analysis. This work demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning and multimodal reasoning for efficient dataset construction in complex real-world domains.</description>

      <title>KIRETT: Knowledge-Graph-Based Smart Treatment Assistant for Intelligent Rescue Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the years, the need for rescue operations throughout the world has increased rapidly. Demographic changes and the resulting risk of injury or health disorders form the basis for emergency calls. In such scenarios, first responders are in a rush to reach the patient in need, provide first aid, and save lives. In these situations, they must be able to provide personalized and optimized healthcare in the shortest possible time and estimate the patients condition with the help of freshly recorded vital data in an emergency situation. However, in such a timedependent situation, first responders and medical experts cannot fully grasp their knowledge and need assistance and recommendation for further medical treatments. To achieve this, on the spot calculated, evaluated, and processed knowledge must be made available to improve treatments by first responders. The Knowledge Graph presented in this article as a central knowledge representation provides first responders with an innovative knowledge management that enables intelligent treatment recommendations with an artificial intelligence-based pre-recognition of the situation.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Domain Analysis of Time-Dependent Multiomic Data in Progressive Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Proposed Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach with Quaternionic Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge deterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and neuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting predictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that transforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and Laplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and employs quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct serves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis of neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations with three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in multifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture entangled neural dynamics \citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages quantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling outlier detection and frequency signature analysis. Potential clinical applications include identifying high-risk patients with rapid progression or therapy resistance using s-domain biomarkers, supported by quantum machine learning (QML) precedents achieving up to 99.89% accuracy in Alzheimer's classification \citep{Belay2024, Bhowmik2025}. This framework aims to lay the groundwork for redefining precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases through future validations.</description>

      <title>Robust Anomaly Detection in O-RAN: Leveraging LLMs against Data Manipulation Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The introduction of 5G and the Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture has enabled more flexible and intelligent network deployments. However, the increased complexity and openness of these architectures also introduce novel security challenges, such as data manipulation attacks on the semi-standardised Shared Data Layer (SDL) within the O-RAN platform through malicious xApps. In particular, malicious xApps can exploit this vulnerability by introducing subtle Unicode-wise alterations (hypoglyphs) into the data that are being used by traditional machine learning (ML)-based anomaly detection methods. These Unicode-wise manipulations can potentially bypass detection and cause failures in anomaly detection systems based on traditional ML, such as AutoEncoders, which are unable to process hypoglyphed data without crashing. We investigate the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection within the O-RAN architecture to address this challenge. We demonstrate that LLM-based xApps maintain robust operational performance and are capable of processing manipulated messages without crashing. While initial detection accuracy requires further improvements, our results highlight the robustness of LLMs to adversarial attacks such as hypoglyphs in input data. There is potential to use their adaptability through prompt engineering to further improve the accuracy, although this requires further research. Additionally, we show that LLMs achieve low detection latency (under 0.07 seconds), making them suitable for Near-Real-Time (Near-RT) RIC deployments.</description>

      <title>ELF: Efficient Logic Synthesis by Pruning Redundancy in Refactoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In electronic design automation, logic optimization operators play a crucial role in minimizing the gate count of logic circuits. However, their computation demands are high. Operators such as refactor conventionally form iterative cuts for each node, striving for a more compact representation - a task which often fails 98% on average. Prior research has sought to mitigate computational cost through parallelization. In contrast, our approach leverages a classifier to prune unsuccessful cuts preemptively, thus eliminating unnecessary resynthesis operations. Experiments on the refactor operator using the EPFL benchmark suite and 10 large industrial designs demonstrate that this technique can speedup logic optimization by 3.9x on average compared with the state-of-the-art ABC implementation.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of Privacy-Fairness-Accuracy Trade-offs in Federated Learning: A Step Towards Responsible AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16233v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training while preserving data privacy; however, balancing privacy preservation (PP) and fairness poses significant challenges. In this paper, we present the first unified large-scale empirical study of privacy-fairness-utility trade-offs in FL, advancing toward responsible AI deployment. Specifically, we systematically compare Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), and Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMC) with fairness-aware optimizers including q-FedAvg, q-MAML, Ditto, evaluating their performance under IID and non-IID scenarios using benchmark (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST) and real-world datasets (Alzheimer's MRI, credit-card fraud detection). Our analysis reveals HE and SMC significantly outperform DP in achieving equitable outcomes under data skew, although at higher computational costs. Remarkably, we uncover unexpected interactions: DP mechanisms can negatively impact fairness, and fairness-aware optimizers can inadvertently reduce privacy effectiveness. We conclude with practical guidelines for designing robust FL systems that deliver equitable, privacy-preserving, and accurate outcomes.</description>

      <title>HeadZoom: Hands-Free Zooming and Panning for 2D Image Navigation Using Head Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce \textit{HeadZoom}, a hands-free interaction technique for navigating two-dimensional visual content using head movements. HeadZoom enables fluid zooming and panning using only real-time head tracking. It supports natural control in applications such as map exploration, radiograph inspection, and image browsing, where physical interaction is limited. We evaluated HeadZoom in a within-subjects study comparing three interaction techniques-Static, Tilt Zoom, and Parallel Zoom-across spatial, error, and subjective metrics. Parallel Zoom significantly reduced total head movement compared to Static and Tilt modes. Users reported significantly lower perceived exertion for Parallel Zoom, confirming its suitability for prolonged or precision-based tasks. By minimizing movement demands while maintaining task effectiveness, HeadZoom advances the design of head-based 2D interaction in VR and creates new opportunities for accessible hands-free systems for image exploration.</description>
