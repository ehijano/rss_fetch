      <title>In-Orbit Processing or Not? Sunlight-Aware Task Scheduling for Energy-Efficient Space Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid evolution of space-borne capabilities, space edge computing (SEC) is becoming a new computation paradigm for future integrated space and terrestrial networks. Satellite edges adopt advanced on-board hardware, which not only enables new opportunities to perform complex intelligent tasks in orbit, but also involves new challenges due to the additional energy consumption in power-constrained space environment. In this paper, we present PHOENIX, an energy-efficient task scheduling framework for emerging SEC networks. PHOENIX exploits a key insight that in the SEC network, there always exist a number of sunlit edges which are illuminated during the entire orbital period and have sufficient energy supplement from the sun. PHOENIX accomplishes energy-efficient in-orbit computing by judiciously offloading space tasks to "sunlight-sufficient" edges or to the ground. Specifically, PHOENIX first formulates the SEC battery energy optimizing (SBEO) problem which aims at minimizing the average battery energy consumption while satisfying various task completion constraints. Then PHOENIX incorporates a sunlight-aware scheduling mechanism to solve the SBEO problem and schedule SEC tasks efficiently. Finally, we implement a PHOENIX prototype and build an SEC testbed. Extensive data-driven evaluations demonstrate that as compared to other state-of-the-art solutions, PHOENIX can effectively reduce up to 54.8% SEC battery energy consumption and prolong battery lifetime to 2.9$\times$ while still completing tasks on time.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Encrypted Application Traffic through Cellular Radio Interface Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern applications are end-to-end encrypted to prevent data from being read or secretly modified. 5G tech nology provides ubiquitous access to these applications without compromising the application-specific performance and latency goals. In this paper, we empirically demonstrate that 5G radio communication becomes the side channel to precisely infer the user's applications in real-time. The key idea lies in observing the 5G physical and MAC layer interactions over time that reveal the application's behavior. The MAC layer receives the data from the application and requests the network to assign the radio resource blocks. The network assigns the radio resources as per application requirements, such as priority, Quality of Service (QoS) needs, amount of data to be transmitted, and buffer size. The adversary can passively observe the radio resources to fingerprint the applications. We empirically demonstrate this attack by considering four different categories of applications: online shopping, voice/video conferencing, video streaming, and Over-The-Top (OTT) media platforms. Finally, we have also demonstrated that an attacker can differentiate various types of applications in real-time within each category.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Power Control for Secure Covert Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite progress in semantic communication (SemCom), research on SemCom security is still in its infancy. To bridge this gap, we propose a general covert SemCom framework for wireless networks, reducing eavesdropping risk. Our approach transmits semantic information covertly, making it difficult for wardens to detect. Given the aim of maximizing covert SemCom performance, we formulate a power control problem in covert SemCom under energy constraints. Furthermore, we propose a learning-based approach based on the soft actor-critic algorithm, optimizing the power of the transmitter and friendly jammer. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances the performance of covert SemCom.</description>

      <title>Joint UPF and Edge Applications Placement and Routing in 5G &amp; Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of 5G networks has enabled support for a vast number of applications with stringent traffic requirements, both in terms of communication and computation. Furthermore, the proximity of the entities, such as edge servers and User Plane Functions (UPFs) that provide these resources is of paramount importance. However, with the ever-increasing demand from these applications, operators often find their resources insufficient to accommodate all requests. Some of these demands can be forwarded to external entities, not owned by the operator. This introduces a cost, reducing the operator's profit. Hence, to maximize operator's profit, it is important to place the demands optimally in internal or external edge nodes. To this end, we formulate a constrained optimization problem that captures this objective and the inter-play between different parameters, which turns out to be NP-hard. Therefore, we resort to proposing a heuristic algorithm which ranks the demands according to their value to the operator and amount of resources they need. Results show that our approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms, deviating from the optimal solution by only ~3% on average.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Radio Environment Map Estimation Using Graph Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Environment Maps (REMs) are crucial for numerous applications in Telecom. The construction of accurate Radio Environment Maps (REMs) has become an important and challenging topic in recent decades. In this paper, we present a method to estimate REMs using Graph Neural Networks. This approach utilizes both physical cell information and sparse geo-located signal strength measurements to estimate REMs. The method first divides and encodes mobile network coverage areas into a graph. Then, it inputs sparse geo-located signal strength measurements, characterized by Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP) and Reference Signal Received Quality (RSRQ) metrics, into a Graph Neural Network Model to estimate REMs. The proposed architecture inherits the advantages of a Graph Neural Network to capture the spatial dependencies of network-wide coverage in contrast with network Radio Access Network node locations and spatial proximity of known measurements.</description>

      <title>HGFF: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Lifetime Maximization in Wireless Sensor Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planning the movement of the sink to maximize the lifetime in wireless sensor networks is an essential problem of great research challenge and practical value. Many existing mobile sink techniques based on mathematical programming or heuristics have demonstrated the feasibility of the task. Nevertheless, the huge computation consumption or the over-reliance on human knowledge can result in relatively low performance. In order to balance the need for high-quality solutions with the goal of minimizing inference time, we propose a new framework combining heterogeneous graph neural network with deep reinforcement learning to automatically construct the movement path of the sink. Modeling the wireless sensor networks as heterogeneous graphs, we utilize the graph neural network to learn representations of sites and sensors by aggregating features of neighbor nodes and extracting hierarchical graph features. Meanwhile, the multi-head attention mechanism is leveraged to allow the sites to attend to information from sensor nodes, which highly improves the expressive capacity of the learning model. Based on the node representations, a greedy policy is learned to append the next best site in the solution incrementally. We design ten types of static and dynamic maps to simulate different wireless sensor networks in the real world, and extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate and analyze our approach. The empirical results show that our approach consistently outperforms the existing methods on all types of maps.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Mobile Edge Generation (MEG) by Constrained Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel accelerated mobile edge generation (MEG) framework is proposed for generating high-resolution images on mobile devices. Exploiting a large-scale latent diffusion model (LDM) distributed across edge server (ES) and user equipment (UE), cost-efficient artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) is achieved by transmitting low-dimensional features between ES and UE. To reduce overheads of both distributed computations and transmissions, a dynamic diffusion and feature merging scheme is conceived. By jointly optimizing the denoising steps and feature merging ratio, the image generation quality is maximized subject to latency and energy consumption constraints. To address this problem and tailor LDM sub-models, a low-complexity MEG acceleration protocol is developed. Particularly, a backbone meta-architecture is trained via offline distillation. Then, dynamic diffusion and feature merging are determined in online channel environment, which can be viewed as a constrained Markov Decision Process (MDP). A constrained variational policy optimization (CVPO) based MEG algorithm is further proposed for constraint-guaranteed learning, namely MEG-CVPO. Numerical results verify that: 1) The proposed framework can generate 1024$\times$1024 high-quality images over noisy channels while reducing over $40\%$ latency compared to conventional generation schemes. 2) The developed MEG-CVPO effectively mitigates constraint violations, thus flexibly controlling the trade-off between image distortion and generation costs.</description>

      <title>Resource Allocation for Twin Maintenance and Computing Task Processing in Digital Twin Vehicular Edge Computing Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As a promising technology, vehicular edge computing (VEC) can provide computing and caching services by deploying VEC servers near vehicles. However, VEC networks still face challenges such as high vehicle mobility. Digital twin (DT), an emerging technology, can predict, estimate, and analyze real-time states by digitally modeling objects in the physical world. By integrating DT with VEC, a virtual vehicle DT can be created in the VEC server to monitor the real-time operating status of vehicles. However, maintaining the vehicle DT model requires ongoing attention from the VEC server, which also needs to offer computing services for the vehicles. Therefore, effective allocation and scheduling of VEC server resources are crucial. This study focuses on a general VEC network with a single VEC service and multiple vehicles, examining the two types of delays caused by twin maintenance and computational processing within the network. By transforming the problem using satisfaction functions, we propose an optimization problem aimed at maximizing each vehicle's resource utility to determine the optimal resource allocation strategy. Given the non-convex nature of the issue, we employ multi-agent Markov decision processes to reformulate the problem. Subsequently, we propose the twin maintenance and computing task processing resource collaborative scheduling (MADRL-CSTC) algorithm, which leverages multi-agent deep reinforcement learning. Through experimental comparisons with alternative algorithms, it demonstrates that our proposed approach is effective in terms of resource allocation.</description>

      <title>Joint Constellation Shaping Using Gradient Descent Approach for MU-MIMO Broadcast Channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a learning-based approach to optimize a joint constellation for a multi-user MIMO broadcast channel ($T$ Tx antennas, $K$ users, each with $R$ Rx antennas), with perfect channel knowledge. The aim of the optimizer (MAX-MIN) is to maximize the minimum mutual information between the  transmitter and each receiver, under a sum-power constraint. The proposed optimization method do neither impose the transmitter to use superposition coding (SC) or any other linear precoding, nor to use successive interference cancellation (SIC) at the receiver. Instead, the approach designs a joint constellation, optimized such that its projection into the subspace of each receiver $k$, maximizes the minimum mutual information $I(W_k;Y_k)$ between each transmitted binary input $W_k$ and the output signal at the intended receiver $Y_k$. The rates obtained by our method are compared to those achieved with linear precoders.</description>

      <title>An hybrid framework OTFS OFDM based on mobile speed estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Future wireless communication systems face the challenging task of simultaneously providing high quality of service (QoS) and broadband data transmission, while also minimizing power consumption, latency, and system complexity. Although Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing OFDM has been widely adopted in 4G and 5G systems, it struggles to cope with the significant delay and Doppler spread in high mobility scenarios. To address these challenges, a novel waveform called Orthogonal Time Frequency Space OTFS has emerged, aiming to outperform OFDM by closely aligning signals with the channel behaviour. In this paper, we propose a switching strategy that empowers operators to select the most appropriate waveform based on the estimated speed of the mobile user. This strategy enables the base station to dynamically choose the waveform that best suits the mobile users speed. Additionally, we suggest integrating an Integrated Sensing and Communication radar for accurate Doppler estimation, providing precise information to aid in waveform selection. By leveraging the switching strategy and harnessing the Doppler estimation capabilities of an ISAC radar, our proposed approach aims to enhance the performance of wireless communication systems in scenarios of high mobility. Considering the complexity of waveform processing, we introduce an optimized hybrid system that combines OTFS and OFDM, resulting in reduced complexity while still retaining performance benefits. This hybrid system presents a promising solution for improving the performance of wireless communication systems in scenarios with a high mobility. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its potential advantages for future wireless communication systems. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by simulation results as it will be shown.</description>

      <title>UAV-assisted Unbiased Hierarchical Federated Learning: Performance and Convergence Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of the sixth generation (6G) of wireless networks is bound to streamline the transition of computation and learning towards the edge of the network. Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) becomes, therefore, a key paradigm to distribute learning across edge devices to reach global intelligence. In HFL, each edge device trains a local model using its respective data and transmits the updated model parameters to an edge server for local aggregation. The edge server, then, transmits the locally aggregated parameters to a central server for global model aggregation. The unreliability of communication channels at the edge and backhaul links, however, remains a bottleneck in assessing the true benefit of HFL-empowered systems. To this end, this paper proposes an unbiased HFL algorithm for unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless networks that counteracts the impact of unreliable channels by adjusting the update weights during local and global aggregations at UAVs and terrestrial base stations (BS), respectively. To best characterize the unreliability of the channels involved in HFL, we adopt tools from stochastic geometry to determine the success probabilities of the local and global model parameter transmissions. Accounting for such metrics in the proposed HFL algorithm aims at removing the bias towards devices with better channel conditions in the context of the considered UAV-assisted network.. The paper further examines the theoretical convergence guarantee of the proposed unbiased UAV-assisted HFL algorithm under adverse channel conditions. One of the developed approach's additional benefits is that it allows for optimizing and designing the system parameters, e.g., the number of UAVs and their corresponding heights. The paper results particularly highlight the effectiveness of the proposed unbiased HFL scheme as compared to conventional FL and HFL algorithms.</description>

      <title>Science-Informed Deep Learning (ScIDL) With Applications to Wireless Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given the extensive and growing capabilities offered by deep learning (DL), more researchers are turning to DL to address complex challenges in next-generation (xG) communications. However, despite its progress, DL also reveals several limitations that are becoming increasingly evident. One significant issue is its lack of interpretability, which is especially critical for safety-sensitive applications. Another significant consideration is that DL may not comply with the constraints set by physics laws or given security standards, which are essential for reliable DL. Additionally, DL models often struggle outside their training data distributions, which is known as poor generalization. Moreover, there is a scarcity of theoretical guidance on designing DL algorithms. These challenges have prompted the emergence of a burgeoning field known as science-informed DL (ScIDL). ScIDL aims to integrate existing scientific knowledge with DL techniques to develop more powerful algorithms. The core objective of this article is to provide a brief tutorial on ScIDL that illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional DL. Furthermore, we discuss both recent applications of ScIDL and potential future research directions in the field of wireless communications.</description>

      <title>Advancing O-RAN to Facilitate Intelligence in V2X</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vehicular communications integrated with the Radio Access Network (RAN) are envisioned as a breakthrough application for the 6th generation (6G) cellular systems. However, traditional RANs lack the flexibility to enable sophisticated control mechanisms that are demanded by the strict performance requirements of the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) environment. In contrast, the features of Open RAN (O-RAN) can be exploited to support advanced use cases, as its core paradigms represent an ideal framework for orchestrating vehicular communication. Although the high potential stemming from their integration can be easily seen and recognized, the effective combination of the two ecosystems is an open issue. Conceptual and architectural advances are required for O-RAN to be capable of facilitating network intelligence in V2X. This article pioneers the integration of the two strategies for seamlessly incorporating V2X control within O-RAN ecosystem. First, an enabling architecture that tightly integrates V2X and O-RAN is proposed and discussed. Then, a set of key V2X challenges is identified, and O-RAN-based solutions are proposed, paired with extensive numerical analysis to support their effectiveness. Results showcase the superior performance of such an approach in terms of raw throughput, network resilience, and control overhead. Finally, these results validate the proposed enabling architecture and confirm the potential of O-RAN in support of V2X communications.</description>

Abstract: With 95% of Internet traffic now encrypted, an effective approach to classifying this traffic is crucial for network security and management. This paper introduces ECHO -- a novel optimization process for ML/DL-based encrypted traffic classification. ECHO targets both classification time and memory utilization and incorporates two innovative techniques.
  The first component, HO (Hyperparameter Optimization of binnings), aims at creating efficient traffic representations. While previous research often uses representations that map packet sizes and packet arrival times to fixed-sized bins, we show that non-uniform binnings are significantly more efficient. These non-uniform binnings are derived by employing a hyperparameter optimization algorithm in the training stage. HO significantly improves accuracy given a required representation size, or, equivalently, achieves comparable accuracy using smaller representations.
  Then, we introduce EC (Early Classification of traffic), which enables faster classification using a cascade of classifiers adapted for different exit times, where classification is based on the level of confidence. EC reduces the average classification latency by up to 90\%. Remarkably, this method not only maintains classification accuracy but also, in certain cases, improves it.
  Using three publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that the combined method, Early Classification with Hyperparameter Optimization (ECHO), leads to a significant improvement in classification efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Streaming algorithms are fundamental in the analysis of large and online datasets. A key component of many such analytic tasks is $q$-MAX, which finds the largest $q$ values in a number stream. Modern approaches attain a constant runtime by removing small items in bulk and retaining the largest $q$ items at all times. Yet, these approaches are bottlenecked by an expensive quantile calculation.
  This work introduces a quantile-sampling approach called SQUID and shows its benefits in multiple analytic tasks. Using this approach, we design a novel weighted heavy hitters data structure that is faster and more accurate than the existing alternatives. We also show SQUID's practicality for improving network-assisted caching systems with a hardware-based cache prototype that uses SQUID to implement the cache policy. The challenge here is that the switch's dataplane does not allow the general computation required to implement many cache policies, while its CPU is orders of magnitude slower. We overcome this issue by passing just SQUID's samples to the CPU, thus bridging this gap.
  In software implementations, we show that our method is up to 6.6x faster than the state-of-the-art alternatives when using real workloads. For switch-based caching, SQUID enables a wide spectrum of data-plane-based caching policies and achieves higher hit ratios than the state-of-the-art P4LRU.</description>
