      <title>LOTUS: Layer-ordered Temporally Unified Schedules For Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce LOTUS (Layer-Ordered Temporally-Unified Schedules), which is a framework that restructures QAOA from a high-dimensional, chaotic search into a low-dimensional dynamical system. By replacing independent layer-wise angles with a Hybrid Fourier-Autoregressive (HFA) mapping, LOTUS enforces global temporal coherence while maintaining local flexibility. LOTUS consistently outperforms standard optimizers, achieving up to a $27.2\%$ improvement in expectation values over L-BFGS-B and $20.8\%$ compared with COBYLA. Besides, our proposed method drastically reduces computational costs, requiring over $90\%$ fewer iterations than methods like Powell or SLSQP.</description>

      <title>Feature Entanglement-based Quantum Multimodal Fusion Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal learning aims to enhance perceptual and decision-making capabilities by integrating information from diverse sources. However, classical deep learning approaches face a critical trade-off between the high accuracy of black-box feature-level fusion and the interpretability of less outstanding decision-level fusion, alongside the challenges of parameter explosion and complexity. This paper discusses the accuracy-interpretablity-complexity dilemma under the quantum computation framework and propose a feature entanglement-based quantum multimodal fusion neural network. The model is composed of three core components: a classical feed-forward module for unimodal processing, an interpretable quantum fusion block, and a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for deep feature extraction. By leveraging the strong expressive power of quantum, we have reduced the complexity of multimodal fusion and post-processing to linear, and the fusion process also possesses the interpretability of decision-level fusion. The simulation results demonstrate that our model achieves classification accuracy comparable to classical networks with dozens of times of parameters, exhibiting notable stability and performance across multimodal image datasets.</description>

      <title>Fault-Tolerant Quantum Error Correction: Implementing Hamming-Based Codes with Advanced Syndrome Extraction Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building reliable quantum computers requires protecting fragile quantum states from inevitable environmental noise and operational errors. While quantum error correction codes like the Steane $[\![7,1,3]\!]$ code provide elegant theoretical solutions, their practical success hinges critically on how we measure errors - a process called syndrome extraction. The challenge lies in the ancilla qubits used for measurement: when they fail, errors can cascade across the entire quantum system, destroying the very information we're trying to protect. We address this fundamental problem by implementing and comparing three sophisticated syndrome measurement strategies: Shor's cat-state approach, which distributes measurements across multiple entangled ancillas achieving 85-92% preparation success; Steane's encoded-ancilla method using complete error-corrected logical qubits reaching 97.8% syndrome fidelity; and a flexible unified framework that adapts strategies based on hardware capabilities. Through extensive simulations using IBM's Qiskit platform spanning randomized benchmarking and T-heavy circuits, we demonstrate that intelligent ancilla management improves error suppression by up to 2.4$\times$ compared to standard approaches. Our implementations achieve logical error rates as low as $5.1 \times 10^{-5}$ under realistic noise conditions with physical error rates of $10^{-3}$, while maintaining near-unity logical fidelity (0.99997) even for deep circuits. The threshold analysis reveals robust performance across distance-3 to distance-13 codes with characteristic threshold curves showing exponential error suppression below the critical physical error rate. These results provide immediately deployable tools for near-term quantum devices and establish practical design principles for scaling toward fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Tackling Heterogeneity in Quantum Federated Learning: An Integrated Sporadic-Personalized Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum federated learning (QFL) emerges as a powerful technique that combines quantum computing with federated learning to efficiently process complex data across distributed quantum devices while ensuring data privacy in quantum networks. Despite recent research efforts, existing QFL frameworks struggle to achieve optimal model training performance primarily due to inherent heterogeneity in terms of (i) quantum noise where current quantum devices are subject to varying levels of noise due to varying device quality and susceptibility to quantum decoherence, and (ii) heterogeneous data distributions where data across participating quantum devices are naturally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID). To address these challenges, we propose a novel integrated sporadic-personalized approach called SPQFL that simultaneously handles quantum noise and data heterogeneity in a single QFL framework. It is featured in two key aspects: (i) for quantum noise heterogeneity, we introduce a notion of sporadic learning to tackle quantum noise heterogeneity across quantum devices, and (ii) for quantum data heterogeneity, we implement personalized learning through model regularization to mitigate overfitting during local training on non-IID quantum data distributions, thereby enhancing the convergence of the global model. Moreover, we conduct a rigorous convergence analysis for the proposed SPQFL framework, with both sporadic and personalized learning considerations. Theoretical findings reveal that the upper bound of the SPQFL algorithm is strongly influenced by both the number of quantum devices and the number of quantum noise measurements. Extensive simulation results in real-world datasets also illustrate that the proposed SPQFL approach yields significant improvements in terms of training performance and convergence stability compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Local Scale Invariance in Quantum Theory: Experimental Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the experimental predictions of the local scale invariant, non-Hermitian pilot-wave (de Broglie-Bohm) formulation of quantum theory introduced in arXiv:2601.03567. We use Weyl's definition of gravitational radius of charge to obtain the fine-structure constant for non-integrable scale effects $\alpha_S$. The minuteness of $\alpha_S$ relative to $\alpha$ ($\alpha_S/\alpha \sim 10^{-21}$) effectively hides the effects in usual quantum experiments. In an Aharonov-Bohm double-slit experiment, the theory predicts that the position probability density depends on which slit the particle trajectory crosses, due to a non-integrable scale induced by the magnetic flux. This experimental prediction can be realistically tested for an electrically neutral, heavy molecule with mass $m \sim 10^{-19} \text{g}$ at a $\sim 10^6 \text{ esu}$ flux regime. We analyse the Weyl-Einstein debate on the second-clock effect using the theory and show that spectral frequencies are history-independent. We thereby resolve Einstein's key objection against local scale invariance, and obtain two further experimental predictions. First, spectral intensities turn out to be history-dependent. Second, energy eigenvalues are modified by tiny imaginary corrections that modify spectral linewidths. We argue that the trajectory dependence of the probabilities renders our theory empirically distinguishable from other quantum formulations that do not use pilot-wave trajectories, or their mathematical equivalents, to derive experimental predictions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note bridges the gap between theoretical second quantization and practical quantum hardware by detailing the Jordan-Wigner mapping for the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz. Using the hydrogen molecule in a minimal basis as a case study, we explicitly derive the Pauli strings required for single and double excitations. Additionally, we discuss the translation of these operators into quantum circuits, with a focus on implementation nuances such as the difference between mathematical rotations and physical gates like the $\sqrt{X}$ (SX) gate.</description>

      <title>Bohmian mechanics: A legitimate hydrodynamic picture for quantum mechanics, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its inception, Bohmian mechanics has been surrounded by a halo of controversy. Originally proposed to bypass the limitations imposed by von Neumann's theorem on the impossibility of hidden-variable models in quantum mechanics, it faced strong opposition from the outset. Over time, however, its use in tackling specific problems across various branches of physics has led to a gradual shift in attitude, turning the early resistance into a more moderate acceptance. A plausible explanation for this change may be that, since the late 1990s and early 2000s, Bohmian mechanics has been taking on a more operational and practical role. The original hidden-variable idea has gradually faded from its framework, giving way to a more pragmatic approach that treats it as a suitable analytical and computational tool. This discussion explores how and why such a shift in perspective has occurred and, therefore, answers questions such as whether Bohmian mechanics should be considered once and for all a legitimate quantum representation (i.e., worth being taught in elementary quantum mechanics courses) or, by extension, whether these ideas can be transferred to and benefit other fields. Here, the Schr\"odinger equation and several specific numerical examples are re-examined in the light of a less restrictive view than the standard one usually adopted in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Data-driven learning of non-Markovian quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fault-tolerant quantum computing requires extremely precise knowledge and control of qubit dynamics during the application of a gate. We develop a data-driven learning protocol for characterizing quantum gates that builds off previous work on learning the Nakajima-Mori-Zwanzig (NMZ) formulation of open system dynamics from time series data, which allows detailed reconstruction of quantum evolution, including non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate this learning technique on three different systems: a simulation of a qubit whose dynamics are purely Markovian, a simulation of a driven qubit coupled to stochastic noise produced by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, and trapped-ion experimental data of a driven qubit whose noise environment is not characterized ahead of time. Our technique is able to learn the generators of time evolution, or the NMZ operators, in all three cases and can learn the timescale in which the qubit dynamics can no longer be accurately described by a purely Markovian model. Our technique complements existing quantum gate characterization methods such as gate set tomography by explicitly capturing non-Markovianity in the gate generator, thus allowing for more thorough diagnosis of noise sources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis formulates time evolution of operators through Lanczos coefficients. In practice, however, numerical instability and memory cost limit the number of coefficients that can be computed exactly. In response to these challenges, the standard approach relies on fitting early coefficients to asymptotic forms, but such procedures can miss subleading, history-dependent structures in the coefficients that subsequently affect reconstructed observables. In this work, we treat the Lanczos coefficients as a causal time sequence and introduce a transformer-based model to autoregressively predict future Lanczos coefficients from short prefixes. For both classical and quantum systems, our machine-learning model outperforms asymptotic fits, in both coefficient extrapolation and physical observable reconstruction, by achieving an order-of-magnitude reduction in error. Our model also transfers across system sizes: it can be trained on smaller systems and then be used to extrapolate coefficients on a larger system without retraining. By probing the learned attention patterns and performing targeted attention ablations, we identify which portions of the coefficient history are most influential for accurate forecasts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated theorem proving, or more broadly automated reasoning, aims at using computer programs to automatically prove or disprove mathematical theorems and logical statements. It takes on an essential role across a vast array of applications and the quest for enhanced theorem-proving capabilities remains a prominent pursuit in artificial intelligence. Here, we propose a generic framework for quantum automated theorem proving, where the intrinsic quantum superposition and entanglement features would lead to potential advantages. In particular, we introduce quantum representations of knowledge bases and propose corresponding reasoning algorithms for a variety of tasks. We show how automated reasoning can be achieved with quantum resolution in both propositional and first-order logic with quadratically reduced query complexity. In addition, we propose the quantum algebraic proving method for geometric theorems, extending Wu's algebraic approach beyond the classical setting. Through concrete examples, including geometry problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad, we demonstrate how a quantum computer may prove geometric theorems with quadratic better query complexity. Our results establish a primary approach towards building quantum automatic theorem provers, which would be crucial for practical applications of both near-term and future quantum technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger equation predicts interference when a beamsplitter's trajectory includes a segment where its speed exceeds the phase velocity of a free non-zero rest mass particle that is in a momentum eigenstate. Such interference is neither possible for electromagnetic waves nor for eigenstates of momentum in the non-relativistic limit of the Klein-Gordon equation since the speed of the beamsplitter cannot exceed the phase velocity of the wave. The dual behavior of reflection and transmission in this case is discussed for dielectric and diffracting beamsplitters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is one of the fundamental building blocks of digital quantum computation. The Quantum Lego formalism has introduced a systematic way of constructing new stabilizer codes out of basic lego-like building blocks, which in previous work we have used to generate improved error correcting codes via an automated reinforcement learning process. Here, we take this a step further and show the use of a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm. We combine classical reinforcement learning with calls to two commercial quantum devices to search for a stabilizer code to correct errors specific to the device, as well as an induced photon loss error.</description>

      <title>On measurement-dependent variance in quantum neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum circuits have become a widely used tool for performing quantum machine learning (QML) tasks on labeled quantum states. In some specific tasks or for specific variational ans\"atze, one may perform measurements on a restricted part of the overall input state. This is the case for, e.g., quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNNs), where after each layer of the circuit a subset of qubits of the processed state is measured or traced out, and at the end of the network one typically measures a local observable. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring observables with restricted support results in larger label prediction variance in regression QML tasks. We show that the reason for this is, essentially, the number of distinct eigenvalues of the observable one measures after the application of a variational circuit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Energetic Advantage before Computational Advantage in Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the energetic efficiency of quantum computers is essential for assessing their scalability and for determining whether quantum technologies can outperform classical computation beyond runtime alone. In this work, we analyze the energy required to solve the Boson Sampling problem, a paradigmatic task for quantum advantage, using a realistic photonic quantum computing architecture. Using the Metric-Noise-Resource methodology, we establish a quantitative connection between experimental control parameters, dominant noise processes, and energetic resources through a performance metric tailored to Boson Sampling. We estimate the energy cost per sample and identify operating regimes that optimize energetic efficiency. By comparing the energy consumption of quantum and state-of-the-art classical implementations, we demonstrate the existence of a quantum energetic advantage -- defined as a lower energy cost per sample compared to the best-known classical implementation -- that emerges before the onset of computational advantage, even in regimes where classical algorithms remain faster. Finally, we propose an experimentally feasible Boson Sampling architecture, including a complete noise and loss budget, that enables a near-term observation of quantum energetic advantage.</description>

      <title>Learning parameter curves in feedback-based quantum optimization algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback-based quantum algorithms (FQAs) operate by iteratively growing a quantum circuit to optimize a given task. At each step, feedback from qubit measurements is used to inform the next quantum circuit update. In practice, the sampling cost associated with these measurements can be significant. Here, we ask whether FQA parameter sequences can be predicted using classical machine learning, obviating the need for qubit measurements altogether. To this end, we train a teacher-student model to map a MaxCut problem instance to an associated FQA parameter curve in a single classical inference step. Numerical experiments show that this model can accurately predict FQA parameter curves across a range of problem sizes, including problem sizes not seen during model training. To evaluate performance, we compare the predicted parameter curves in simulation against FQA reference curves and linear quantum annealing schedules. We observe similar results to the former and performance improvements over the latter. These results suggest that machine learning can offer a heuristic, practical path to reducing sampling costs and resource overheads in quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Quantum observers can communicate across multiverse branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly thought that observers in distinct branches of an Everettian multiverse cannot communicate without violating the linearity of quantum theory. Here we show a counterexample, demonstrating that inter-branch communication is in fact possible, entirely within standard quantum theory. We do this by considering a Wigner's-friend scenario, where an observer (Wigner) can have quantum control over another observer (the friend). We present a thought experiment where the friend in superposition can receive a message written by a distinct copy of themselves in the multiverse, with the aid of Wigner. To maintain the unitarity of quantum theory, the observers must have no memory of the message that they sent. Our thought experiment challenges conventional wisdom regarding the ultimate limits of what is possible in an Everettian multiverse. It has a surprising potential application which involves using knowledge-creation paradoxes for testing Everettian quantum theory against single-world theories.</description>

      <title>Cost scaling of MPS and TTNS simulations for 2D and 3D systems with area-law entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor network states are an indispensable tool for the simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems. In recent years, tree tensor network states (TTNS) have been successfully used for two-dimensional systems and to benchmark quantum simulation approaches for condensed matter, nuclear, and particle physics. In comparison to the more traditional approach based on matrix product states (MPS), the graph distance of physical degrees of freedom can be drastically reduced in TTNS. Surprisingly, it turns out that, for large systems in $D&gt;1$ spatial dimensions, MPS simulations of low-energy states are nevertheless more efficient than TTNS simulations. With a focus on $D=2$ and 3, the scaling of computational costs for different boundary conditions is determined under the assumption that the system obeys an entanglement (log-)area law, implying that bond dimensions scale exponentially in the surface area of the associated subsystems.</description>

      <title>Dissipative ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a dissipative protocol for ground-state preparation of a quantum spin chain on a trapped-ion quantum computer. As a first step, we derive a Kraus representation of a dissipation channel for the protocol recently proposed by Ding et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 033147 (2024)] that still holds for arbitrary temporal discretization steps, extending the analysis beyond the Lindblad dynamics regime. The protocol guarantees that the fidelity with the ground state monotonically increases (or remains unchanged) under repeated applications of the channel to an arbitrary initial state, provided that the ground state is the unique steady state of the dissipation channel. Using this framework, we implement dissipative ground-state preparation of a transverse-field Ising chain for up to 19 spins on the trapped-ion quantum computer Reimei provided by Quantinuum. Despite the presence of hardware noise, the dynamics consistently converges to a low-energy state far away from the maximally mixed state even when the corresponding quantum circuits contain as many as 4110 entangling gates, demonstrating the intrinsic robustness of the protocol. By applying zero-noise extrapolation, the resulting energy expectation values are systematically improved to agree with noiseless simulations within statistical uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Discrimination Enhanced by FPGA-Based AI Engine Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying the state of a quantum bit (qubit), known as quantum state discrimination, is a crucial operation in quantum computing. However, it has been the most error-prone and time-consuming operation on superconducting quantum processors. Due to stringent timing constraints and algorithmic complexity, most qubit state discrimination methods are executed offline. In this work, we present an enhanced real-time quantum state discrimination system leveraging FPGA-based AI Engine technology. A multi-layer neural network has been developed and implemented on the AMD Xilinx VCK190 FPGA platform, enabling accurate in-situ state discrimination and supporting mid-circuit measurement experiments for multiple qubits. Our approach leverages recent advancements in architecture research and design, utilizing specialized AI/ML accelerators to optimize quantum experiments and reduce the use of FPGA resources.</description>

      <title>Reference-frame-independent Quantum secure direct communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current quantum secure direct communication (QSDC) protocols guarantee communication security by estimating the error rates of photons in the X and Z bases. This take the reference frame calibration between communicating parties as a necessary prerequisite. However, in mobile communications scenarios, achieving continuous and accurate reference frame calibration poses significant challenges. To address this issue, this paper proposes a reference-frame-independent (RFI) QSDC protocol. This protocol only requires ensuring the calibration accuracy of one direction of the reference frame, while allowing a misalignment angle $\beta$ in the other two directions. To improve the protocol's robustness against reference frame fluctuations, we introduce a $\beta$-independent parameter C into the security analysis framework and rederive the protocol's security bounds. Additionally, we construct a system model and optimize the pulse intensity of the signal states, enabling the protocol to achieve optimal performance under each level of channel attenuation. At an attenuation of 10 dB (corresponding to a communication distance of 25 km), the secrecy message capacities for $\beta= 0^{ \circ} $ and $45^{ \circ} $ are $8.765 \times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse and $4.150 \times10^{-6}$ bit/pulse, respectively. Compared with the single-photon-based QSDC, the communication distance of the protocol proposed in this paper is significantly extended. When $\beta= 0^{ \circ} $ and $45^{ \circ} $, the maximum transmission distances of the RFI QSDC protocol are 27.875 km and 26.750 km, which is about 155.9 % and 149.7 % of that of the single-photon-based QSDC protocol.</description>

      <title>Efficient and broadband quantum frequency comb generation in a monolithic AlGaAs-on-insulator microresonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of photonic systems for quantum information processing has generated widespread interest in multiple cutting-edge research fields. Photonic frequency encoding stands out as an especially viable approach, given its natural alignment with established optical communication technologies, including fiber networks and wavelength-division multiplexing systems. Substantial reductions in hardware resources and improvements in quantum performance can be expected by utilizing multiple frequency modes. The integration of nonlinear photonics with microresonators provides a compelling way for generating frequency-correlated photon pairs across discrete spectral modes. Here, by leveraging the high material nonlinearity and low nonlinear loss, we demonstrate an efficient chip-scale multi-wavelength quantum light source based on AlGaAs-on-insulator, featuring a free spectral range of approximately 200 GHz at telecom wavelengths. The optimized submicron waveguide geometry provides both high effective nonlinearity (~550 m$^{-1}$W$^{-1}$) and broad generation bandwidth, producing eleven distinct wavelength pairs across a 35.2 nm bandwidth with an average spectral brightness of 2.64 GHz mW$^{-2}$nm$^{-1}$. The generation of energy-time entanglement for each pair of frequency modes is verified through Franson interferometry, yielding an average net visibility of 93.1%. With its exceptional optical gain and lasing capabilities, the AlGaAs-on-insulator platform developed here shows outstanding potential for realizing fully integrated, ready-to-deploy quantum photonic systems on chip.</description>

      <title>A Preparation Nonstationarity Loophole in Superconducting-Qubit Bell Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell or Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) tests on superconducting quantum processors are commonly interpreted under the assumption that repeated circuit executions sample a single, stationary preparation ensemble. Here we show that this assumption can be violated on contemporary hardware, with direct implications for the interpretation of observed Bell violations. We introduce an ensemble-divergence framework in which slow temporal drift of the preparation process induces context-dependent effective ensembles, even when measurement independence and locality are preserved. This leads to a relaxed Bell bound $|S| \le 2 + 6\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$, where $\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$ quantifies preparation nonstationarity. Because $\delta_{\mathrm{ens}}$ is not directly observable, we develop an operational witness $\delta_{\mathrm{op}}$ based on bin-resolved outcome statistics for fixed measurement channels. Using Pauli-axis measurements on IBM superconducting processors, we observe statistically significant operational drift that persists after full two-qubit readout mitigation, ruling out measurement artifacts. In contrast, drift extracted from CHSH-optimal measurements is eliminated by mitigation, demonstrating that such settings are unsuitable for diagnosing preparation nonstationarity. We further show that the observed Bell violations imply only modest ensemble divergences, comparable in scale to those required in Hall-type measurement-dependence models, but arising here solely from preparation drift combined with experimental scheduling. Our results identify a preparation-dependent loophole relevant to Bell tests on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices and highlight the necessity of drift-aware protocols for reliable quantum certification.</description>

      <title>Extending Qubit Coherence Time via Hybrid Dynamical Decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical decoupling (DD) and bath engineering are two parallel techniques employed to mitigate qubit decoherence resulting from their unavoidable coupling to the environment. Here, we present a hybrid DD approach that integrates pulsed DD with bath spin polarization to enhance qubit coherence within the central spin model. This model, which can be realized using GaAs semiconductor quantum dots or analogous quantum simulators, demonstrates a significant extension of the central spin's coherence time by approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude that compared with the free-induced decay time, where the dominant contribution from DD and a moderate improvement from spin-bath polarization. This study, which integrates uniaxial dynamical decoupling and auxiliary bath-spin engineering, paves the way for prolonging coherence times in various practical quantum systems, including GaAs/AlGaAs, silicon and Si/SiGe. And this advancement holds substantial promise for applications in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum fluctuations of vacuum versus photon-pairs concerning Spontaneous-Parametric Down-Conversion and Four-Wave-Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The limit between the two regimes of spontaneous-parametric down-conversion (SPDC) or four-wave-mixing (FWM) regarding the pump intensity has been theoretically investigated using a semi-classical model and analytical calculations. A unitless quantity has been defined, corresponding to the photon-pairs flux per frequency unit: it has been found equal to 0.369 at this limit. The ratio between the magnitudes of the electric fields of the generated photons and of vacuum has been also calculated, equal to 1.718, and the pump intensity has been plotted as a function of the interaction length for different values of the second-order electric susceptibility in the case of SPDC and of the third-order electric susceptibility for FWM. These quantitative results confirm that below the limit, the nonlinear process can be truly considered as spontaneous, i.e. mainly seeded by the quantum fluctuations of vacuum, while the generated photons mainly govern the pump photon splitting above the limit, which corresponds more to an optical parametric amplification / difference frequency generation regime. Knowing quantitatively the limit between the two regimes thanks to the present calculations will be a useful guide for further quantum calculations and measurements from either side of the limit in order to catch the full quantum picture of SPDC and FWM from low to high pump intensities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify transverse spatial entanglement of photon-pairs generated in spontaneous parametric down conversion using a nonlinear interferometric technique without relying on any coincidence detection. We experimentally demonstrate the violation of the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen criterion and of the Mancini-Giovannetti-Vitali-Tombesi criterion using single photon interference of one of the photons of the pairs. We also provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis. The experimental results that we have obtained show good agreement with the theoretical values. Our method performs well under experimental losses and can be applied to highly non-degenerate sources, where there are no suitable detectors for one of the photons in the quantum state and our method could also be extended to the discrete degrees of freedom to certify high-dimensional (OAM) entanglement.</description>

      <title>A Methodological Analysis of Empirical Studies in Quantum Software Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum software engineering (QSE), quantum software testing (QST) has attracted increasing attention as quantum software systems grow in scale and complexity. Since QST evaluates quantum programs through execution under designed test inputs, empirical studies are widely used to assess the effectiveness of testing approaches. However, the design and reporting of empirical studies in QST remain highly diverse, and a shared methodological understanding has yet to emerge, making it difficult to interpret results and compare findings across studies. This paper presents a methodological analysis of empirical studies in QST through a systematic examination of 59 primary studies identified from a literature pool of size 384. We organize our analysis around ten research questions that cover key methodological dimensions of QST empirical studies, including objects under test, baseline comparison, testing setup, experimental configuration, and tool and artifact support. Through cross-study analysis along these dimensions, we characterize current empirical practices in QST, identify recurring limitations and inconsistencies, and highlight open methodological challenges. Based on our findings, we derive insights and recommendations to inform the design, execution, and reporting of future empirical studies in QST.</description>

      <title>A dataflow programming framework for linear optical distributed quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic systems offer a promising platform for interconnecting quantum processors and enabling scalable, networked architectures. Designing and verifying such architectures requires a unified formalism that integrates linear algebraic reasoning with probabilistic and control-flow structures. In this work, we introduce a graphical framework for distributed quantum computing that brings together linear optics, the ZX-calculus, and dataflow programming. Our language supports the formal analysis and optimization of distributed protocols involving both qubits and photonic modes, with explicit interfaces for classical control and feedforward, all expressed within a synchronous dataflow model with discrete-time dynamics. Within this setting, we classify entangling photonic fusion measurements, show how their induced Pauli errors can be corrected via a novel flow structure for fusion networks, and establish correctness proofs for new repeat-until-success protocols enabling arbitrary fusions. Layer by layer, we construct qubit architectures incorporating practical optical components such as beam splitters, switches, and photon sources, with graphical proofs that they are deterministic and support universal quantum computation. Together, these results establish a foundation for verifiable compilation and automated optimization in networked quantum computing.</description>

      <title>On-chip semi-device-independent quantum random number generator exploiting contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a semi-device-independent quantum random number generator (QRNG) based on the violation of a contextuality inequality, implemented by the integration of two silicon photonic chips. Our system combines a heralded single-photon source with a reconfigurable interferometric mesh to implement qutrit state preparation, transformations, and measurements suitable for testing a KCBS contextuality inequality. This architecture enables the generation of random numbers from the intrinsic randomness of single-photon interference in a complex optical network, while simultaneously allowing a quantitative certification of their security without requiring entanglement. We observe a contextuality violation exceeding the classical bound by more than 10{\sigma}, unambiguously confirming non-classical behavior. From this violation, we certify a conditional min-entropy per experimental round of Hmin = 0.077 +- 0.002, derived via a tailored semidefinite-programming-based security analysis. Each measurement outcome therefore contains at least 0.077 +- 0.002 bits of extractable genuine randomness, corresponding to an asymptotic generation rate of 21.7 +- 0.5 bits/s. These results establish a viable route towards general-purpose, untrusted quantum random number generators compatible with practical integrated photonic quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Rigorous phase-error-estimation security framework for QKD with correlated sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practical QKD modulators introduce correlations between consecutively emitted pulses due to bandwidth limitations, violating key assumptions underlying many security proof techniques. Here, we address this problem by introducing a simple yet powerful mathematical framework to directly extend phase-error-estimation-based security proofs for imperfect but uncorrelated sources to also incorporate encoding correlations. Our framework overcomes important limitations of previous approaches in terms of generality and rigor, significantly narrowing the gap between theoretical security guarantees and real-world QKD implementations.</description>

      <title>Toolchain for shuttling trapped-ion qubits in segmented traps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable trapped-ion quantum computing requires fast and reliable transport of ions through complex, segmented radiofrequency trap architectures without inducing excessive motional excitation. We present a numerical toolchain for the systematic generation of time-dependent electrode voltages enabling fast, low-excitation ion shuttling in segmented radiofrequency traps. Based on a model of the trap electrode geometry, the framework combines an electrostatic field solver, efficient unconstrained optimization, waveform postprocessing, and dynamical simulations of ion motion to compute voltage waveforms that realize prescribed transport trajectories while respecting experimental constraints such as voltage limits and bandwidth. The toolchain supports arbitrary trap geometries, including junctions and multi-zone layouts, and allows for the flexible incorporation of optimization objectives. We provide a detailed assessment of the accuracy of the framework by investigating its numerical stability and by comparing measured and predicted secular frequencies. The framework is optimized for numerical performance, enabling rapid numerical prototyping of trap architectures of increasing complexity. As application examples, we apply the framework to the transport of a potential well along a linear, uniformly segmented trap, and we compute a solution for shuttling a potential well around the corner of an X-type trap junction. The presented approach provides an extensible and highly efficient numerical foundation for designing and validating transport protocols in current and next-generation trapped-ion processors.</description>

      <title>MultiQ: Multi-Programming Neutral Atom Quantum Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are emerging as a popular quantum computing technology due to their large qubit counts and flexible connectivity. However, performance challenges arise as large circuits experience significant fidelity drops, while small circuits underutilize hardware and face initialization latency issues. To tackle these problems, we propose $\textit{multi-programming on neutral atom QPUs}$, allowing the co-execution of multiple circuits by logically partitioning the qubit array. This approach increases resource utilization and mitigates initialization latency while maintaining result fidelity. Currently, state-of-the-art compilers for neutral atom architectures do not support multi-programming.
  To fill this gap, we introduce MultiQ, the first system designed for this purpose. MultiQ addresses three main challenges: (i) it compiles circuits into a $\textit{virtual zone layout}$ to optimize spatio-temporal hardware utilization; (ii) it parallelizes the execution of co-located circuits, allowing single hardware instructions to operate on different circuits; and (iii) it includes an algorithm to verify the functional independence of the bundled circuits. MultiQ functions as a cross-layer system comprising a compiler, controller, and checker. Our compiler generates \emph{virtual zone layouts} to enhance performance, while the controller efficiently maps these layouts onto the hardware and resolves any conflicts. The checker ensures the correct bundling of circuits.
  Experimental results show a throughput increase from 3.8$\times$ to 12.3$\times$ when multi-programming 4 to 14 circuits, with fidelity largely maintained, ranging from a 1.3% improvement for four circuits to only a 3.5% loss for fourteen circuits. Overall, MultiQ facilitates concurrent execution of multiple quantum circuits, boosting throughput and hardware utilization.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Adapted State Preparation for Quantum Chemistry on Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present systematic and resource-efficient constructions of continuous symmetry projectors, particularly $U(1)$ particle number and $SU(2)$ total spin, tailored for fault-tolerant quantum computations. Our approach employs a linear combination of unitaries (LCU) as well as generalized quantum signal processing (GQSP and GQSVT) to implement projectors. These projectors can then be coherently applied as state filters prior to quantum phase estimation (QPE). We analyze their asymptotic gate complexities for explicit circuit realizations. For the particle number and $S_z$ symmetries, GQSP offers favorable resource usage features owing to its low ancilla qubit requirements and robustness to finite precision rotation gate synthesis. For the total spin projection, the structured decomposition of $\hat{P}_{S,M_S}$ reduces the projector T gate count. Numerical simulations show that symmetry filtering substantially increases the QPE success probability, leading to a lower overall cost compared to that of unfiltered approaches across representative molecular systems. Resource estimates further indicate that the cost of symmetry filtering is $3$ to $4$ orders of magnitude lower than that of the subsequent phase estimation step This advantage is especially relevant in large, strongly correlated systems, such as FeMoco, a standard strongly correlated open-shell benchmark. For FeMoco, the QPE cost is estimated at ${\sim}10^{10}$ T gates, while our symmetry projector requires only ${\sim}10^{6}$--$10^{7}$ T gates. These results establish continuous-symmetry projectors as practical and scalable tools for state preparation in quantum chemistry and provide a pathway toward realizing more efficient fault-tolerant quantum simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a framework for constructing Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes that support fault-tolerant logical transversal $Z$-rotations. Using this framework, we obtain asymptotically good CSS codes that fault-tolerantly realize the logical transversal Clifford group. Furthermore, investigating CSS-T codes, we: (a) demonstrate asymptotically good CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ realizes the logical transversal $S^{\dagger}$; (b) show that the condition $C_2 \ast C_1 \subseteq C_1^{\perp}$ is necessary but not sufficient for CSS-T codes; and (c) revise the characterizations of CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ implements the logical identity and the logical transversal $T$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing -- Strategic Recommendations for the Industry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This whitepaper surveys the current landscape and short- to mid-term prospects for quantum-enabled optimization and machine learning use cases in industrial settings. Grounded in the QCHALLenge program, it synthesizes hardware trajectories from different quantum architectures and providers, and assesses their maturity and potential for real-world use cases under a standardized traffic-light evaluation framework. We provide a concise summary of relevant hardware roadmaps, distinguishing superconducting and ion-trap technologies, their current states, modalities, and projected scaling trajectories. The core of the presented work are the use case evaluations in the domains of optimization problems and machine learning applications. For the conducted experiments, we apply a consistent set of evaluation criteria (model formulation, scalability, solution quality, runtime, and transferability) which are assessed in a shared system of three categories, ranging from optimistic (solutions produced by quantum computers are competitive with classical methods and/or a clear path to a quantum advantage is shown) to pessimistic (significant hurdles prevent practical application of quantum solutions now and potentially in the future). The resulting verdicts illuminate where quantum approaches currently offer promise, where hybrid classical-quantum strategies are most viable, and where classical methods are expected to remain superior.</description>

      <title>Phase-sensitive superposition of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the principle of superposition lies at the heart of quantum mechanics and is the root of almost all quantum phenomena such as coherence and entanglement, its quantification, except for that related to the resource theory of coherence and interference, remains relatively less studied. In this work, we address quantification of superposition from an information-theoretic perspective. We introduce a family of quantifiers of superposition, the phase-sensitive superposition, by taking into account the phases of amplitudes in the superposition of a fixed basis states (e.g., computational basis states). We establish a conservation relation for the phase-sensitive superposition, which is a kind of complementary relation and is reminiscent of wave-particle duality. We evaluate explicitly the second moment of phase-sensitive superposition and show that it is intrinsically related to the $l^2$-norm coherence. We characterize the dephasing channel induced by the maximally superposed states. We investigate the minimum and maximum superpositions, reveal their basic properties, and illustrate them through various examples. We further explore the dynamics of superposition in the Grover search algorithm, and demonstrate a complementary relation between superposition and success probability of the search algorithm. These results and quantifiers offer tools for analyzing structural features and implications of quantum superposition.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-swapping measurements for deterministic entanglement distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entanglement swapping is a key primitive for distributing entanglement across nodes in quantum networks. In standard protocols, the outcome of the intermediate measurement determines the resulting state, making the process inherently probabilistic and requiring postselection. In this work, we fully characterize those measurements under which entanglement swapping becomes deterministic: for arbitrary pure inputs, every measurement outcome produces local-unitarily equivalent states. We also show that an optimal measurement, maximizing a concurrence-type entanglement measure, is built from complex Hadamard matrices. For this optimal protocol, we provide a complete, dimension-dependent classification of deterministic entanglement-swapping measurements: unique in dimensions $d=2,3$, infinite for $d=4$, and comprising $72$ inequivalent classes for $d=5$. We further consider a general network with multiple swapping nodes and show that, for $d=2,3$ the resulting end-to-end state is independent of the order in which the repeaters perform the optimal measurements. Our results establish optimal entanglement-swapping schemes that are post-selection free, in the sense that they distribute entanglement across generic quantum network architectures without unfavorable measurement outcomes.</description>

      <title>Sample Complexity of Composite Quantum Hypothesis Testing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates symmetric composite binary quantum hypothesis testing (QHT), where the goal is to determine which of two uncertainty sets contains an unknown quantum state. While asymptotic error exponents for this problem are well-studied, the finite-sample regime remains poorly understood. We bridge this gap by characterizing the sample complexity -- the minimum number of state copies required to achieve a target error level. Specifically, we derive lower bounds that generalize the sample complexity of simple QHT and introduce new upper bounds for various uncertainty sets, including of both finite and infinite cardinalities. Notably, our upper and lower bounds match up to universal constants, providing a tight characterization of the sample complexity. Finally, we extend our analysis to the differentially private setting, establishing the sample complexity for privacy-preserving composite QHT.</description>

      <title>Open quantum spin chains with non-reciprocity: a theoretical approach based on the time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an open quantum spin chain with non-reciprocal dissipation using a theoretical approach known as time-dependent generalized Gibbs ensemble. In the regime of weak dissipation the system is fully characterized by its rapidity distribution and we derive a closed set of coupled differential equations governing their time evolution. We check the accuracy of this theory by benchmarking the results against numerical simulations. Using this framework we are able to compute both the magnetization density and current dynamics, identifying some relations between the two. The problem of the anomalous power-law exponents identified in a previous work is discussed. Our work constitutes a theoretical approach that is able to describe the physics of non-reciprocal open quantum spin chains beyond analyses based on non-interacting fermions.</description>

      <title>Fragility of Optimal Measurements due to Noise in Probe States for Quantum Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a given quantum state used in sensing, the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound (QCRB) sets a fundamental limit on the precision achievable by an unbiased estimator of an unknown parameter, determined by the inverse of the quantum Fisher information (QFI). The QFI serves as an upper bound on the classical Fisher information (CFI), representing the maximum extractable information about the unknown parameter from measurements on a physical system. Thus, a central goal in quantum parameter estimation is to find a measurement, described by a POVM, that saturates the QFI (achieves maximum CFI), and thereby achieves the QCRB. In the idealization that one uses pure states and unitary encodings for sensing, discontinuities can appear in the CFI but not the QFI. In this article, we demonstrate that these discontinuities are important features, quantifying how much Fisher information is lost in the presence of noise. We refer to this as the Fisher information "fragility". We present a simple framework for understanding how discontinuities increase fragility through Jensen's inequality, and demonstrate how one can use this framework to design more robust POVMs for quantum advantage in metrology.</description>

      <title>Kernel Learning for Regression via Quantum Annealing Based Spectral Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While quantum annealing (QA) has been developed for combinatorial optimization, practical QA devices operate at finite temperature and under noise, and their outputs can be regarded as stochastic samples close to a Gibbs--Boltzmann distribution. In this study, we propose a QA-in-the-loop kernel learning framework that integrates QA not merely as a substitute for Markov-chain Monte Carlo sampling but as a component that directly determines the learned kernel for regression. Based on Bochner's theorem, a shift-invariant kernel is represented as an expectation over a spectral distribution, and random Fourier features (RFF) approximate the kernel by sampling frequencies. We model the spectral distribution with a (multi-layer) restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), generate discrete RBM samples using QA, and map them to continuous frequencies via a Gaussian--Bernoulli transformation. Using the resulting RFF, we construct a data-adaptive kernel and perform Nadaraya--Watson (NW) regression. Because the RFF approximation based on $\cos(\bm{\omega}^{\top}\Delta\bm{x})$ can yield small negative values and cancellation across neighbors, the Nadaraya--Watson denominator $\sum_j k_{ij}$ may become close to zero. We therefore employ nonnegative squared-kernel weights $w_{ij}=k(\bm{x}_i,\bm{x}_j)^2$, which also enhances the contrast of kernel weights. The kernel parameters are trained by minimizing the leave-one-out NW mean squared error, and we additionally evaluate local linear regression with the same squared-kernel weights at inference. Experiments on multiple benchmark regression datasets demonstrate a decrease in training loss, accompanied by structural changes in the kernel matrix, and show that the learned kernel tends to improve $R^2$ and RMSE over the baseline Gaussian-kernel NW. Increasing the number of random features at inference further enhances accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing classical simulation with noisy quantum devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum devices continue to improve in scale and precision, a central challenge is how to effectively utilize noisy hardware for meaningful computation. Most existing approaches aim to recover noiseless circuit outputs from noisy ones through error mitigation or correction. Here, we show that noisy quantum devices can be directly leveraged as computational resources to enhance the classical simulation of quantum circuits. We introduce the Noisy-device-enhanced Classical Simulation (NDE-CS) protocol, which improves stabilizer-based classical Monte Carlo simulation methods by incorporating data obtained from noisy quantum hardware. Specifically, NDE-CS uses noisy executions of a target circuit together with noisy Clifford circuits to learn how the target circuit can be expressed in terms of Clifford circuits under realistic noise. The same learned relation can then be reused in the noiseless Clifford limit, enabling accurate estimation of ideal expectation values with substantially reduced sampling cost. Numerical simulations on Trotterized Ising circuits demonstrate that NDE-CS achieves orders-of-magnitude reductions in sampling cost compared to the underlying purely classical Monte Carlo approaches from which it is derived, while maintaining the same accuracy. We also compare NDE-CS with Sparse Pauli Dynamics (SPD), a powerful classical framework capable of simulating quantum circuits at previously inaccessible scales, and provide an example where the cost of SPD scales exponentially with system size, while NDE-CS scales much more favorably. These results establish NDE-CS as a scalable hybrid simulation approach for quantum circuits, where noise can be harnessed as a computational asset.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bosonic codes constitute a promising route to fault-tolerant quantum computing. {Existing Floquet protocols enable analytical construction of bosonic codes but typically rely on slow adiabatic ramps with thousands of driving periods.} In this work, we circumvent this bottleneck by introducing an analytical and deterministic Floquet method that directly synthesizes arbitrary unitaries within a single period. The phase-space unitary ensembles generated by our approach reproduce the Haar-random statistics, enabling practical pseudorandom unitaries in continuous-variable systems. We prepare various prototypical bosonic codes from vacuum and implement single-qubit logical gates with high fidelities using quantum lattice gates. By harnessing the full intrinsic nonlinearity of Josephson junctions, quantum lattice gates decompose quantum circuits into primitive operations for efficient continuous-variable quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Optimal logical Bell measurements on stabilizer codes with linear optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell measurements (BMs) are ubiquitous in quantum information and technology. They are basic elements for quantum commmunication, computation, and error correction. In particular, when performed on logical qubits encoded in physical photonic qubits, they allow for a read-out of stabilizer syndrome information to enhance loss tolerance in qubit-state transmission and fusion. However, even in an ideal setting without photon loss, BMs cannot be done perfectly based on the simplest experimental toolbox of linear optics. Here we demonstrate that any logical BM on stabilizer codes can always be mapped onto a single physical BM perfomed on any qubit pair from the two codes. As a necessary condition for the success of a logical BM, this provides a general upper bound on its success probability, especially ruling out the possibility that the stabilizer information obtainable from only partially succeeding, physical linear-optics BMs could be combined into the full logical stabilizer information. We formulate sufficient criteria to find schemes for which a single successful BM on the physical level will always allow to obtain the full logical information by suitably adapting the subsequent physical measurements. Our approach based on stabilizer group theory is generally applicable to any stabilizer code, which we demonstrate for quantum parity, five-qubit, standard and rotated planar surface, tree, and seven-qubit Steane codes. Our schemes attain the general upper bound for all these codes, while this bound had previously only been reached for the quantum parity code.</description>

Abstract: Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded.
  In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo to Las Vegas for Recursively Composed Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a (possibly partial) Boolean function $f\colon\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ as well as a query complexity measure $M$ which maps Boolean functions to real numbers, define the composition limit of $M$ on $f$ by $M^*(f)=\lim_{k\to\infty} M(f^k)^{1/k}$.
  We study the composition limits of general measures in query complexity. We show this limit converges under reasonable assumptions about the measure. We then give a surprising result regarding the composition limit of randomized query complexity: we show $R_0^*(f)=\max\{R^*(f),C^*(f)\}$. Among other things, this implies that any bounded-error randomized algorithm for recursive 3-majority can be turned into a zero-error randomized algorithm for the same task. Our result extends also to quantum algorithms: on recursively composed functions, a bounded-error quantum algorithm can be converted into a quantum algorithm that finds a certificate with high probability.
  Along the way, we prove various combinatorial properties of measures and composition limits.</description>

      <title>Multi-level charge fluctuations in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete charge fluctuations, routinely observed in semiconductor quantum dot devices, may contribute significantly to device drift and errors resulting from qubit miscalibration. Understanding the nature and origins of these discrete charge fluctuations may provide insights into material improvements or means of mitigating charge noise in semiconductor quantum dot devices. In this work, we measure multi-level charge fluctuations present in a Si/SiGe double quantum dot device over a range of device operating voltages and temperatures. To characterize the parameter-dependent dynamics of the underlying fluctuating degrees of freedom, we perform a detailed analysis of the measured noise timeseries. We perform algorithmically assisted drift detection and change point detection to detrend the data and remove a slow fluctuator component, as a preprocessing step. We perform model comparison on the post-processed time series between different $n$-level fluctuator ($n$LF) factorial hidden Markov models (FHMMs), finding that although at most sweep values the independent pair of 2LFs model would be preferred, in a particular region of voltage space the 4LF model outperforms the other models, indicating a conditional rate dependence between the two fluctuators. By tracking fluctuator transition rates, biases, and weights over a range of different device configurations, we estimate gate voltage and conductivity sensitivity. In particular, we fit a phenomenological, detailed balance model to the extracted independent 2LFs rate data, yielding lever arm estimates in the range of $-2 \mu$eV/mV up to $4 \mu$eV/mV between the two 2LFs and nearby gate electrodes. We expect that these characterization results may aid in subsequent spatial triangulation of the charge fluctuators.</description>

      <title>Vacuum-dressed superconductivity in NbN observed in a high-$Q$ terahertz cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging theoretical frameworks suggest that physical properties of matter can be altered within an optical cavity by harnessing quantum vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations, even in the total absence of external driving fields. Among the most intriguing predictions is the potential to noninvasively manipulate superconductivity. Here, we experimentally observe modified superconductivity in niobium nitride (NbN) thin films within high-quality-factor ($Q$) terahertz cavities. Using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy, we characterize the NbN response both in free space and within a high-$Q$ photonic-crystal cavity. Our analysis reveals significant cavity-induced modifications to the optical conductivity. A theoretical model indicates that these changes originate from a substantial ($\sim13\,\%$) reduction in the superfluid density and a minor ($\sim2\,\%$) reduction in the superconducting gap, driven by cavity vacuum fluctuations. These results demonstrate a platform for engineering ground states via vacuum--matter coupling, opening frontiers in cavity materials science.</description>

      <title>Critical quantum states and hierarchical spectral statistics in a Cantor potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectral statistics and wave-function properties of a one-dimensional quantum system subject to a Cantor-type fractal potential. By analyzing the nearest-neighbor level spacings, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and the scaling behavior of the integrated density of states (IDS), we demonstrate how the self-similar geometry of the potential is imprinted on the quantum spectrum. The energy-resolved level spacings form a hierarchical, filamentary structure, in sharp contrast to those of periodic and random systems. The normalized level-spacing distribution exhibits a bimodal structure, reflecting the deterministic recurrence of spectral gaps. A multifractal analysis of eigenstates reveals critical behavior: the generalized fractal dimensions $D_q$ lie strictly between the limits of extended and localized states, exhibiting a distinct $q$-dependence. Consistently, the IPR indicates the coexistence of quasi-extended and localized features, characteristic of critical wave functions. The IDS shows anomalous power-law scaling at low energies, with an exponent close to the Hausdorff dimension of the underlying Cantor set, indicating that the geometric fractality governs the spectral dimensionality. At higher energies, this scaling crosses over to the semiclassical Weyl law. Our results establish a direct connection between deterministic fractal geometry, hierarchical spectral statistics, and quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate thermalization in thermal first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) posits how isolated quantum many-body systems thermalize, assuming that individual eigenstates at the same energy density have identical expectation values of local observables in the limit of large systems. While the ETH apparently holds across a wide range of interacting quantum systems, in this work we show that it requires generalization in the presence of thermal first-order phase transitions. We introduce a class of all-to-all spin models, featuring first-order thermal phase transitions that stem from two distinct mean-field solutions (two ``branches'') that exchange dominance in the many-body density of states as the energy is varied. We argue that for energies in the vicinity of the thermal phase transition, eigenstate expectation values do not need to converge to the same thermal value. The system has a regime with coexistence of two classes of eigenstates corresponding to the two branches with distinct expectation values at the same energy density, and another regime with Schrodinger-cat-like eigenstates that are inter-branch superpositions; these two regimes are separated by an eigenstate phase transition. We support our results by semiclassical calculations and an exact diagonalization study of a microscopic spin model, and argue that the structure of eigenstates in the vicinity of thermal first-order phase transitions can be experimentally probed via non-equilibrium dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states in 2+1d: non-invertible symmetries, interfaces, and parameterized families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct 2+1-dimensional lattice models of symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases with non-invertible symmetries and investigate their properties using tensor networks. These models, which we refer to as generalized cluster models, are constructed by gauging a subgroup symmetry $H \subset G$ in models with a finite group 0-form symmetry $G$. By construction, these models have a non-invertible symmetry described by the group-theoretical fusion 2-category $\mathcal{C}(G; H)$. After identifying the tensor network representations of the symmetry operators, we study the symmetry acting on the interface between two generalized cluster states. In particular, we will see that the symmetry at the interface is described by a multifusion category known as the strip 2-algebra. By studying possible interface modes allowed by this symmetry, we show that the interface between generalized cluster states in different SPT phases must be degenerate. This result generalizes the ordinary bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, we construct parameterized families of generalized cluster states and study the topological charge pumping phenomena, known as the generalized Thouless pump. We exemplify our construction with several concrete cases, and compare them with known phases, such as SPT phases with $2\mathrm{Rep}((\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]}\times\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[1]})\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{[0]})$ symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a $G$-cluster Hamiltonian in 2+1 dimensions and analyze its properties. This model exhibits a $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, where the $2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$ sector realizes a non-invertible symmetry obtained by condensing appropriate algebra objects in $\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Using the symmetry interpolation method, we construct $S^1$- and $S^2$-parameterized families of short-range-entangled (SRE) states by interpolating an either invertible $0$-form or $1$-form symmetry contained in $G\times2\mathrm{Rep}(G)$. Applying an adiabatic evolution argument to this family, we analyze the pumped interface mode generated by this adiabatic process. We then explicitly construct the symmetry operator acting on the interface and show that the interface mode carries a nontrivial charge under this symmetry, thereby demonstrating the nontriviality of the parameterized family.</description>

      <title>Quantum CSS LDPC Codes based on Dyadic Matrices for Belief Propagation-based Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes provide a practical balance between error-correction capability and implementation complexity in quantum error correction (QEC). In this paper, we propose an algebraic construction based on dyadic matrices for designing both classical and quantum LDPC codes. The method first generates classical binary quasi-dyadic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 6. It is then extended to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, where the two component parity-check matrices are built to satisfy the compatibility condition required by the recently introduced CAMEL-ensemble quaternary belief propagation decoder. This compatibility condition ensures that all unavoidable cycles of length 4 are assembled in a single variable node, allowing the mitigation of their detrimental effects by decimating that variable node.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern Quantum optics largely remains quasi-stationary, far from intrinsic optical field timescales. Ultrafast quantum optics seeks to generate, shape, and measure quantum states of light on femtosecond and attosecond timescales. Here we introduce a quantum light field squeezer (QLFS) that enables the generation and attosecond control of ultrafast broadband squeezed light. Using degenerate four-wave mixing in a quasi-collinear focusing geometry, our approach overcomes conventional broadband phase-matching limits, producing intensity- and phase-squeezed states directly from few-cycle laser pulses. Our ultrafast quantum optical metrology reveals a time-dependent squeezing distribution across individual half-cycles of the electric field. Incorporating this time-dependent squeezing into strong-field simulations shows that the temporal redistribution of quantum uncertainty reshapes the high-harmonic emission. Moreover, by tuning the relative pulse delay and phase-matching angle, we achieve attosecond precision in controlling the squeezing characteristics by visualizing inferred effective Wigner representations of the quantum light field. Beyond characterization, we demonstrate that the quantum light-induced tunneling-current noise is sensitive to the nonclassical intensity-noise statistics of the driving squeezed light, with sub-femtosecond control. Together, these results extend the generation, control, and effective phase-space representation of squeezed light into the ultrafast and attosecond regime, opening new avenues for quantum optics in strong-field and solid-state systems.</description>

Abstract: Computing functional determinants of differential operators is central to any field-theoretical calculation relying on a saddle-point expansion. A variety of approaches is available for the computation that avoid having to know the eigenspectrum of the operator, and in particular the Gel'fand-Yaglom theorem and the Green's function method. In this note, we show how both approaches can be constructed using a contour integral argument and conclude that these are completely equivalent for computing ratios of determinants of one-dimensional operators. Furthermore, we comment on the presence of vanishing as well as negative eigenvalues and show how the Green's function method provides a natural prescription for handling them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Krylov complexity for quantum systems whose Hamiltonians factorise as tensor products. We prove that complexity is superadditive under tensor products, $C_{12}\ge C_1+C_2$, and identify a positive operator that quantifies the resulting excess complexity. The underlying mechanism is made transparent by introducing a Krylov graph representation in which tensor products generate a higher-dimensional lattice whose diagonal shells encode operator growth and binomial path multiplicities. In the continuum limit, Krylov dynamics reduces to diffusion on this graph, with superadditivity arising from geometric broadening across shells. Explicit examples illustrate how deviations from synchronous evolution generate bounded, oscillatory excess complexity.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to Explainable AI with Quantized Active Ingredients in Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems have shown good success at classifying. However, the lack of explainability is a true and significant challenge, especially in high-stakes domains, such as health and finance, where understanding is paramount. We propose a new solution to this challenge: an explainable AI framework based on our comparative study with Quantum Boltzmann Machines (QBMs) and Classical Boltzmann Machines (CBMs). We leverage principles of quantum computing within classical machine learning to provide substantive transparency around decision-making. The design involves training both models on a binarised and dimensionally reduced MNIST dataset, where Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied for preprocessing. For interpretability, we employ gradient-based saliency maps in QBMs and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in CBMs to evaluate feature attributions.QBMs deploy hybrid quantum-classical circuits with strongly entangling layers, allowing for richer latent representations, whereas CBMs serve as a classical baseline that utilises contrastive divergence. Along the way, we found that QBMs outperformed CBMs on classification accuracy (83.5% vs. 54%) and had more concentrated distributions in feature attributions as quantified by entropy (1.27 vs. 1.39). In other words, QBMs not only produced better predictive performance than CBMs, but they also provided clearer identification of "active ingredient" or the most important features behind model predictions. To conclude, our results illustrate that quantum-classical hybrid models can display improvements in both accuracy and interpretability, which leads us toward more trustworthy and explainable AI systems.</description>

      <title>Local Magnetometry from Measurement-Induced Dissipation</title>

Abstract: Magnetic phases are commonly identified through macroscopic magnetization, yet many ordered states, including antiferromagnets and altermagnets, possess a vanishing net moment despite distinct local spin structure. We show that such an order can be accessed through the measurement-induced steady state of a single primary qubit locally coupled to a spin lattice. Using a controlled primary-ancillary qubit protocol, we derive analytically that the steady state \emph{encodes} a locally weighted exchange field in a signed observable that is linear in the weak-coupling regime. Numerical simulations demonstrate lattice-scale resolution of antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic textures and robustness against short-correlated noise. Our results establish measurement-induced dissipation as a resource for detecting magnetic order through microscopic structure rather than through global moments.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Complexity of String Breaking in the Schwinger Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.08825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String breaking, the process by which flux tubes fragment into hadronic states, is a hallmark of confinement in strongly-interacting quantum field theories. We examine a suite of quantum complexity measures using Matrix Product States to dissect the string breaking process in the 1+1D Schwinger model. We demonstrate the presence of nonlocal quantum correlations along the string that may affect fragmentation dynamics, and show that entanglement and magic offer complementary perspectives on string formation and breaking beyond conventional observables.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mechanics from Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several recent studies have suggested that incompatible variables, which play an essential role in quantum mechanics (QM), are, somewhat surprisingly, not necessarily unique to QM. To investigate this possibility and obtain a better understanding of two central postulates of QM, namely the commutator postulate and the Born postulate, we introduce a classical probabilistic theoretical framework which is more general than QM and contains QM as a special case. We call this framework the General Incompatible Variables (GIV) theory, and we show that not only QM systems but also any probabilistic systems (classical or quantal) that possess incompatible variables will exhibit the quantal properties of uncertainty and interference, and we illustrate this with a roulette-like classical system (which we call the Arrow) that shows precisely these properties. We show that QM emerges naturally from the GIV framework when the fundamental variables are taken to be symmetries, so that the incompatibility of the QM variables is actually just the incompatibility of the corresponding symmetries (or their generators). Specifically, when the variables are taken to be the elements of the Poincare group (the symmetry of spacetime) we find that the commutator postulate and the Born postulate follow automatically, and are therefore no longer postulates. QM thus emerges as a special case of GIV theories for which the variables are symmetries.</description>

      <title>Universal Quantum Computation via Superposed Orders of Single-Qubit Gates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13654v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superposed orders of quantum channels have already been proved - both theoretically and experimentally - to enable unparalleled opportunities in the quantum communication domain. As a matter of fact, superposition of orders can be exploited within the quantum computing domain as well, by relaxing the (traditional) assumption underlying quantum computation about applying gates in a well-defined causal order. In this context, we address a fundamental question arising with quantum computing: whether superposed orders of single-qubit gates can enable universal quantum computation. As shown in this paper, the answer to this key question is a definitive "yes". Indeed, we prove that any two-qubit controlled quantum gate can be deterministically realized, including the so-called Barenco gate that alone enables universal quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a quantum phase space for rotational and nuclear-spin states of rigid molecules. For each nuclear spin isomer, we re-derive the isomer's admissible angular momentum states from molecular geometry and nuclear-spin data, introduce its angular position states using quantization theory, and develop a generalized Fourier transform converting between the two. We classify molecules into three types -- asymmetric, rotationally symmetric, and perrotationally symmetric -- with the last type having no macroscopic analogue due to nuclear-spin statistics constraints. We discuss two general features in perrotationally symmetric state spaces that are Hamiltonian-independent and induced solely by symmetry and spin statistics. First, we quantify when and how an isomer's state space is completely rotation-spin entangled, meaning that it does not admit any separable states. Second, we identify isomers whose position states house an internal pseudo-spin or "fiber" degree of freedom, and the fiber's Berry phase or matrix after adiabatic changes in position yields naturally robust operations, akin to braiding anyonic quasiparticles or realizing fault-tolerant quantum gates. We outline how the fiber can be used as a quantum error-correcting code and discuss scenarios where these features can be experimentally probed</description>

Abstract: Superconducting and photonic technologies are envisioned to play a key role in the Quantum Internet. However the hybridization of these technologies requires functional quantum transducers for converting superconducting qubits, exploited in quantum computation, into ``flying'' qubits, able to propagate through the network (and vice-versa). In this paper, quantum transduction is theoretically investigated for a key functionality of the Quantum Internet, namely, multipartite entanglement distribution. Different communication models for quantum transduction are provided, in order to make the entanglement distribution possible. The proposed models departs from the large heterogeneity of hardware solutions available in literature, abstracting from the particulars of the specific solutions with a communication engineering perspective. Then, a performance analysis of the proposed models is conducted through key communication metrics, such as quantum capacity and entanglement generation probability. The analysis reveals that -- although the considered communication metrics depend on transduction hardware parameters for all the proposed models -- the particulars of the considered transduction paradigm play a relevant role in the overall entanglement distribution performance.</description>

      <title>Classical periodic trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

      <title>Chasing shadows with Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00235v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the task of performing shadow tomography of a logical subsystem defined via the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) error correcting code. Our protocol does not require the input state to be a code state but is implemented by appropriate twirling of the measurement channel, such that the encoded logical tomographic information becomes encoded in the classical shadow. We showcase this protocol for measurements natural in continuous variable (CV) quantum computing. For heterodyne measurement, the protocol yields a probabilistic decomposition of any input state into Gaussian states that simulate the encoded logical information of the input relative to a fixed GKP code where we prove bounds on the Gaussian compressibility of states in this setting. For photon parity measurements, our protocol is equivalent to a Wigner sampling protocol for which we develop the appropriate sampling strategies. Finally, by randomizing over the reference GKP code, we show how Wigner samples of any input state relative to a random GKP codes can be used to estimate any sufficiently bounded observable.</description>

Abstract: The Quantum Internet would likely be composed of diverse qubit technologies that interact through a heterogeneous quantum network. Thus, quantum transduction has been identified as a key enabler of the Quantum Internet. To better study heterogeneous quantum networks, the integration of a quantum transducer component into quantum network simulators has become crucial. In this paper, we extend SeQUeNCe, an open-source, discrete-event simulator of quantum networks, with a quantum transduction component along with auxiliary hardware device models and protocols. Moreover, we explore two strategies for transmitting quantum information between superconducting nodes via optical channels, with a focus on the impact of quantum transduction on the transmission process. The performance of these strategies is analyzed and compared through simulations conducted using SeQUeNCe. Our results align with theoretical predictions, offering simulation-based validation of the strategies and providing a path to accurate, larger-scale simulations of heterogeneous quantum networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing compilation of error correction codes for 2xN quantum dot arrays and its NP-hardness</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09061v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The ability to physically move qubits within a register allows the design of hardware-specific error-correction codes, which can achieve fault-tolerance while respecting other constraints. In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. It is therefore timely to explore error correction architectures consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. Upon such an architecture, we develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a reduced number of shuttling operations. We demonstrate how column-regular qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that is exactly equal to the column weight of the code when Shor-style syndrome extraction is used. We provide tables stating the number of required shuttles for many contemporary codes of interest. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for general codes, even when using Shor syndrome extraction. We also discuss how one could get around this by placing blanks in the ancilla array to achieve minimal shuttles with Shor syndrome extraction on any CSS code, at the cost of longer ancilla arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17550v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magic is a quantum resource essential for universal quantum computation and represents the deviation of quantum states from those that can be simulated efficiently using classical algorithms. Using the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), we investigate two-qubit states with maximal magic, which are most distinct from classical simulability, and provide strong numerical evidence that the maximal second order SRE is $\ln (16/7)\approx 0.827$, establishing a tighter bound than the prior $\ln (5/2)\approx 0.916$. We identify 480 states saturating the new bound, which turn out to be the fiducial states for the mutually unbiased bases (MUBs) generated by the orbits of the Weyl-Heisenberg (WH) group, and conjecture that WH-MUBs are the maximal magic states for $n$-qubit, when $n\neq 1$ and 3. We also reveal a striking interplay between magic and entanglement: the entanglement of maximal magic states is restricted to two possible values, $1/2$ and $1/\sqrt{2}$, as quantified by the concurrence; none is maximally entangled.</description>

Abstract: The Cram\'er-Rao bound captures completely the performance of single-parameter quantum sensors. On the other hand, its extension to multiple parameters demands more caution. Different aspects need to be captured at once, including, critically, compatibility. In this article we consider compatibility in quantum interferometry for an important class of probe states, measured by double homodyne or photon counters, standard benchmarks for these applications. We include the presence of loss and phase diffusion in the estimation of a phase. Our results illustrate how different weighting of the precision on individual parameters affects their compatibility, adding to the list of considerations for quantum multiparameter estimation.</description>

Abstract: The complementary features of different qubit platforms for computing and communicating impose an intrinsic hardware heterogeneity in any quantum network, where nodes, while processing and storing quantum information, must also communicate through quantum links. Indeed, one of the most promising hardware platforms at quantum node scale for scalable and fast quantum computing is the superconducting technology, which operates at microwave frequencies. Whereas, for communicating at distances of practical interest beyond few meters, quantum links should operate at optical frequencies. Therefore, to allow the interaction between superconducting and photonic technologies, a quantum interface, known as quantum transducer, able to convert one type of qubit to another is required. This paper aims to provide a tutorial treatise on the fundamental research challenges of quantum transduction. The tutorial is structured around a communications engineering framework, thereby shedding light on its fundamental role in quantum network design and deployment -- a perspective often overlooked in existing literature. This framework allows us to categorize different transduction modalities and to reveal an unorthodox one where the transducer itself can act as an entanglement source. From this standpoint, it is possible to conceive different source-destination link archetypes, where transduction plays a crucial role in the communication performances. The analysis also translates the quantum transduction process into a proper functional block within a new communication system model for a quantum network.</description>

Abstract: Simulating Clifford and near-Clifford circuits using the extended stabilizer formalism has become increasingly popular, particularly in quantum error correction. Compared to the state-vector approach, the extended stabilizer formalism can solve the same problems with fewer computational resources, as it operates on stabilizers rather than full state vectors. Most existing studies on near-Clifford circuits focus on balancing the trade-off between the number of ancilla qubits and simulation accuracy, often overlooking performance considerations. Furthermore, in the presence of high-rank stabilizers, performance is limited by the sequential property of the stabilizer formalism. In this work, we introduce a parallelized version of the extended stabilizer formalism, enabling efficient execution on multi-core devices such as GPU. Experimental results demonstrate that, in certain scenarios, our Python-based implementation outperforms state-of-the-art simulators such as Qiskit and Pennylane.</description>

Abstract: Single-molecule magnets (SMMs) are molecules that can function as nanoscale magnets with potential use as magnetic memory bits. While SMMs can retain magnetization at low temperatures, characterizing them on surface and at room temperature remains challenging and requires specialized nanoscale techniques. Here, we use single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as highly sensitive, broadband magnetic field sensors to detect the magnetic noise of cobalt-based SMMs deposited on a diamond surface. We measure the NV relaxation and decoherence times at 296 K and at 5-8 K, observing a significant influence of the SMMs on them. From this, we can infer the SMMs' magnetic noise spectral density (NSD) and underlying magnetic properties. Moreover, we observe the effect of an applied magnetic field on the SMMs' NSD at low temperatures. The method provides nanoscale sensitivity for characterizing SMMs under realistic conditions relevant to their use as surface-bound memory units.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Quantum Thermal State Preparation via Local Driving: Lindbladian Simulation with Provable Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta} \propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved in principle by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F.~Chen \emph{et al.}, Nature \textbf{646}, pp.~561--566 (2025)] -- the implementation of these ``exact Gibbs samplers'' requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging \emph{in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices.
  Here, we propose a scheme for approximately simulating an exact Gibbs sampler that only requires the repeated implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous guarantees on the difference between the fixed point reached by our protocol and the exact thermal state, which only depend on parameters of the protocol and its \emph{mixing time}. The procedure is efficiently implementable on near-term devices if $H$ is local, and the mixing time scales mildly with both system size and protocol parameters. While guaranteeing the latter for Hamiltonians of interest remains an important problem for future work, here we lay the groundwork for developing fully efficient thermal state preparation protocols on quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>High-Performance Heterodyne Receiver for Quantum Information Processing in a Laser Written Integrated Photonic Platform</title>

Abstract: Continuous-Variable Quantum Key Distribution (CV-QKD) and Quantum Random Number Generation (CV-QRNG) are critical technologies for secure communication and high-speed randomness generation, exploiting shot-noise-limited coherent detection for their operation. Integrated photonic solutions are key to advancing these protocols, as they enable compact, scalable, and efficient system implementations. In this work, we introduce Femtosecond Laser Micromachining (FLM) on borosilicate glass as a novel platform for producing Photonic Integrated Circuits (PICs) realizing coherent detection suitable for quantum information processing. We exploit the specific features of FLM to produce a PIC designed for CV-QKD and CV-QRNG applications. The PIC features fully adjustable optical components that achieve precise calibration and reliable operation under protocol-defined conditions. The device exhibits low insertion losses ($\leq 1.28$ dB), polarization-insensitive operation, and a Common-Mode Rejection Ratio (CMRR) exceeding 73 dB. These characteristics allowed the experimental realization of a source-device-independent CV-QRNG with a secure generation rate of 42.74 Gbps and a QPSK-based CV-QKD system achieving a secret key rate of 3.2 Mbit/s. Our results highlight the potential of FLM technology as an integrated photonic platform, paving the way for scalable and high-performing quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Quantum Circuit Synthesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16641v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A reinforcement learning (RL) framework is introduced for the efficient synthesis of quantum circuits that generate specified target quantum states from a fixed initial state, addressing a central challenge in both the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era and future fault-tolerant quantum computing. The approach utilizes tabular Q-learning, based on action sequences, within a discretized quantum state space, to effectively manage the exponential growth of the space dimension.The framework introduces a hybrid reward mechanism, combining a static, domain-informed reward that guides the agent toward the target state with customizable dynamic penalties that discourage inefficient circuit structures such as gate congestion and redundant state revisits. This is a circuit-aware reward, in contrast to the current trend of works on this topic, which are primarily fidelity-based. By leveraging sparse matrix representations and state-space discretization, the method enables practical navigation of high-dimensional environments while minimizing computational overhead. Benchmarking on graph-state preparation tasks for up to seven qubits, we demonstrate that the algorithm consistently discovers minimal-depth circuits with optimized gate counts. Moreover, extending the framework to a universal gate set still yields low depth circuits, highlighting the algorithm robustness and adaptability. The results confirm that this RL-driven approach, with our completely circuit-aware method, efficiently explores the complex quantum state space and synthesizes near-optimal quantum circuits, providing a resource-efficient foundation for quantum circuit optimization.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Oscillator-Qudit Quantum Processors: stabilizer states, stabilizer codes, symplectic operations, and non-commutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.04819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct stabilizer states and error-correcting codes on combinations of discrete- and continuous-variable systems, generalizing the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) quantum lattice formalism. Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states.
  Simple hybrid codes can be thought of as subsystem GKP codes whose gauge factor is entangled with a qudit. Our numerical investigations suggest that such codes can sometimes outperform GKP codes against physical noise, and their decoders can be tuned to accommodate either more qudit or more oscillator errors. We also relate stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori, identifying that a general construction of such tori yields multi-mode multi-qudit extensions of GKP codes. We explicitly calculate these codes' logical dimension and logical operators by utilizing the Morita equivalence between their stabilizer and logical tori. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22958v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate efficient interfacing of a large number of atoms to an optical nanofiber using an optical lattice with tunable spacing ($0.88-1.5~\mu$m) projected onto the nanofiber. The lattice beam and reflections from the nanofiber yield trap potentials that provide tight confinement in all motional degrees of freedom $\approx 220$ nm above the nanofiber surface, enabling efficient atom-photon coupling. We achieve trapping of $\approx1300$ atoms in periodic trap sites with a trap lifetime of $\approx15$ ms. We also observe the effect of varied lattice periods on the atomic motional frequencies. Our new scheme is adaptable to other nanophotonic cold-atom systems and provides a versatile and scalable platform for studying photon-mediated long-range collective interactions.</description>

      <title>Classical Obfuscation of Quantum Circuits via Publicly-Verifiable QFHE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classical obfuscator for quantum circuits is a classical program that, given the classical description of a quantum circuit $Q$, outputs the classical description of a functionally equivalent quantum circuit $\hat{Q}$ that hides as much as possible about $Q$. Previously, the only known feasibility result for classical obfuscation of quantum circuits (Bartusek and Malavolta, ITCS 2022) was limited to circuits that always reject. On the other hand, if the obfuscator is allowed to compile the quantum circuit $Q$ into a quantum state $|\hat{Q}\rangle$, there exist feasibility results for obfuscating all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits (Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa, STOC 2023, Bartusek, Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan, STOC 2024), and all unitaries (Huang and Tang, FOCS 2025).
  We show that (relative to a classical oracle) there exists a classical obfuscator for all pseudo-deterministic quantum circuits. We do this by giving the first construction of a compact quantum fully-homomorphic encryption (QFHE) scheme that supports public verification of (pseudo-deterministic) quantum evaluation, relative to a classical oracle.
  To construct our QFHE scheme, we improve on the approach of Bartusek, Kitagawa, Nishimaki and Yamakawa (STOC 2023), which required ciphertexts that are both quantum and non-compact due to the use of quantum coset states and their publicly-verifiable properties. We introduce new techniques for analyzing coset states that can be generated ''on the fly'', by proving new cryptographic properties of the one-shot signature scheme of Shmueli and Zhandry (CRYPTO 2025). Our techniques allow us to produce QFHE ciphertexts that are purely classical, compact, and publicly-verifiable. This also yields the first classical verification of quantum computation protocol for BQP that simultaneously satisfies blindness and public-verifiability.</description>

      <title>Control of valence-electron motion in Xe cations using the stimulated-Raman-adiabatic-passage technique</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.22875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work theoretically investigates possibilities of using the Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP) and its variants to control a coherent superposition of quantum states. We present a generalization of the so-called fractional STIRAP (f-STIRAP), demonstrating precise control over the mixing ratio of quantum states in the wave packet. In contrast to conventional f-STIRAP, designed to drive a system from an eigenstate into a coherent superposition, our scheme enables arbitrary control over the composition of an already existing superposition state. We demonstrate that an approximate version of this technique -- where analytically designed laser pulses with composite envelopes are replaced by simple Gaussian pulses -- achieves comparable performance in controlling the dynamics of the wave packet. A limiting case of this scheme, utilizing two pulses with identical Gaussian envelopes and tuned delay and relative phase, is also explored, revealing experimentally accessible pathways for manipulating quantum coherence. We apply our developed techniques to control the ultrafast charge migration in the spin-orbit split ground electronic states of xenon cation via intermediate valence- and core-excited states. Finally, we propose concrete experimental realizations of the developed control schemes in combination with attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a method to probe the system.</description>

      <title>Basis dependence of Neural Quantum States for the Transverse Field Ising Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are powerful tools used to represent complex quantum many-body states in an increasingly wide range of applications. However, despite their popularity, at present only a rudimentary understanding of their limitations exists. In this work, we investigate the dependence of NQS on the choice of the computational basis, focusing on restricted Boltzmann machines. Considering a family of rotated Hamiltonians corresponding to the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model, we discuss the properties of ground states responsible for the dependence of NQS performance, namely the presence of ground state degeneracies as well as the uniformity of amplitudes and phases, carefully examining their interplay. We identify that the basis-dependence of the performance is linked to the convergence properties of a cluster or cumulant expansion of multi-spin operators -- providing a framework to directly connect physical, basis-dependent properties, to performance itself. Our results provide insights that may be used to gauge the applicability of NQS to new problems and to identify the optimal basis for numerical computations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13049v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) admits a topological \(\bar\theta\)-term that violates Charge-Parity \((CP)\) symmetry, yet experimental indicate that \(\bar\theta\) is nearly zero. To investigate this discrepancy in a controlled setting, we derive the Hamiltonian representation of the QCD Lagrangian and construct its \((1{+}1)\)-dimensional Schwinger-model analogue. By encoding fermionic and gauge degrees of freedom into qubits using the Jordan-Wigner and quantum-link schemes, we obtain a compact Pauli Hamiltonian that retains the relevant topological vacuum structure. Ground states are evaluated using a feedback-based quantum optimization protocol, enabling numerical evaluation of the vacuum energy \(E_0(\bar\theta)\) on a few-qubit simulator. Our results show a vacuum at \(\bar\theta = 0\ (\text{mod 2})\) in agreement with strong-interaction expectations, and demonstrate that introducing a dynamical axion field drives the system toward a \(\theta_{\rm eff}=0\), thereby realizing the Peccei-Quinn mechanism within a minimal quantum simulation. These results illustrate how quantum hardware can examine symmetry violation and its dynamical resolution in gauge theories.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computers pose a fundamental threat to widely deployed public-key cryptosystems, such as RSA and ECC, by enabling efficient integer factorization using Shor's algorithm. Theoretical resource estimates suggest that 2048-bit RSA keys could be broken using Shor's algorithm with fewer than a million noisy qubits. Although such machines do not yet exist, the availability of smaller, cloud-accessible quantum processors and open-source implementations of Shor's algorithm raises the question of what key sizes can realistically be factored with today's platforms. In this work, we experimentally investigate Shor's algorithm on several cloud-based quantum computers using publicly available implementations. Our results reveal a substantial gap between the capabilities of current quantum hardware and the requirements for factoring cryptographically relevant integers. In particular, we observe that circuit constructions still need to be highly specific for each modulus, and that machine fidelities are unstable, with high and fluctuating error rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Floquet codes have recently emerged as a new family of error-correcting codes, and have drawn significant interest across both theoretical and practical quantum computing. A central open question has been how to implement logical operations on these codes. In this work, we show how two techniques from static quantum error-correcting codes can also be implemented on Floquet codes. First, we present a way of implementing fold-transversal operations on Floquet codes in order to yield logical Hadamard and S gates. And second, we present a way of implementing logical CNOT gates on Floquet codes via Dehn twists. We discuss the requirements for these techniques, and show that they are applicable to a wide family of Floquet codes defined on colour code lattices. Through numerical benchmarking of the logical operations on the CCS Floquet code, we establish a logical-gate threshold of 0.25-0.35% and verify sub-threshold exponential error suppression. Our results show that these logical operations are robust, featuring a performance that is close to the baseline set by a quantum memory benchmark. Finally, we explain in detail how to implement logical gates on Floquet codes by operating on the embedded codes.</description>

      <title>Systematic Construction of Time-Dependent Hamiltonians for Microwave-Driven Josephson Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-dependent electromagnetic drives are fundamental for controlling complex quantum systems, including superconducting Josephson circuits. In these devices, accurate time-dependent Hamiltonian models are imperative for predicting their dynamics and designing high-fidelity quantum operations. Existing numerical methods, such as black-box quantization (BBQ) and energy-participation ratio (EPR), excel at modeling the static Hamiltonians of Josephson circuits. However, these techniques do not fully capture the behavior of driven circuits stimulated by external microwave drives, nor do they include a generalized approach to account for the inevitable noise and dissipation that enter through microwave ports. Here, we introduce novel numerical techniques that leverage classical microwave simulations that can be efficiently executed in finite element solvers, to obtain the time-dependent Hamiltonian of a microwave-driven superconducting circuit with arbitrary geometries. Importantly, our techniques do not rely on a lumped-element description of the superconducting circuit, in contrast to previous approaches to tackling this problem. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach by characterizing the driven properties of realistic circuit devices in complex electromagnetic environments, including coherent dynamics due to charge and flux modulation, as well as drive-induced relaxation and dephasing. Our techniques offer a powerful toolbox for optimizing circuit designs and advancing practical applications in superconducting quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in time-resolved cathodoluminescence have enabled ultrafast studies of single emitters in quantum materials with femtosecond temporal resolution. Here, we develop a quantum theory modeling the dynamics of free electrons interacting with quantum emitters in arbitrary initial states. Our analysis reveals that a free electron can induce transient coherent oscillations in the populations when the system is initially prepared in a coherent superposition of its states. Moreover, the electron energy spectrum exhibits a clear signature of the quantum coherence and sensitivity to the transition frequency of the emitter. These coherence effects manifest themselves as oscillations in the zero-loss peak of the spectral energy-loss probability. Our findings pave the way for characterization of quantum-coherent dynamics of individual quantum emitters by electron-probes.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Dunkl-Pauli Oscillator in the Presence of the Aharonov-Bohm Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03365v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an exact, time-dependent solution for a two-dimensional Pauli oscillator deformed by Dunkl operators in the presence of an Aharonov--Bohm (AB) flux. By replacing conventional momenta with Dunkl momenta and allowing arbitrary time dependence in both, mass and frequency, we derive a deformed Pauli Hamiltonian that encodes reflection symmetries and topological gauge phases. Employing the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method, we derive exact expressions for the eigenvalues and spinor eigenfunctions of the system. Crucially, the AB flux imposes symmetry constraints on the Dunkl parameters of the form $\nu_1 = \mp \nu_2 $, linking the reflection symmetry ($\epsilon = \pm 1 $) to the quantization of angular momentum. These constraints modify the energy spectrum and wavefunctions of the angular operator and the invariant operator. Our framework reveals novel spectral characteristics arising from the interplay between topology and Dunkl symmetry, with potential implications for quantum simulation in engineered systems such as cold atoms and quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Improved Lower Bounds for Learning Quantum Channels in Diamond Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04180v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that learning an unknown quantum channel with input dimension $d_A$, output dimension $d_B$, and Choi rank $r$ to diamond distance $\varepsilon$ requires $ \Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A= rd_B$, and $\Omega\!\left( \frac{d_A d_B r}{\varepsilon^2 \log(d_B r / \varepsilon)} \right)$ channel queries when $d_A\le rd_B/2$. These lower bounds improve upon the best previous $\Omega(d_A d_B r)$ bound by introducing explicit $\varepsilon$-dependence, and they are optimal up to logarithmic factors. The proof constructs ensembles of channels that are well separated in diamond norm yet admit Stinespring isometries that are close in operator norm.</description>

      <title>Nonadiabatic theory for subcycle ionic dynamics in multielectron tunneling ionization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07050v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multielectron tunneling ionization creates ionic coherence crucial for lasing and driving electron motion in molecules. While tunneling is well understood as a single active electron process, less emphasis has been placed on theoretical descriptions of bound electrons during tunneling. This work systematically investigates multielectron tunneling ionization based on the strong field approximation, establishing a theoretical foundation and demonstrating the equivalence of wave function and density matrix approaches for subcycle ionic dynamics. An accurate subcycle nonadiabatic ionization rate is also derived and incorporated into the theory to improve its quantitative accuracy. Applying the theory to N$_{2}$ and CO$_{2}$, this work showcases how an intense laser field can induce ionic coherence in molecules as observed in previous experiments. These findings encourage future investigations into multielectron tunneling ionization and its applications in lasing and in controlling chemical reactions.</description>

      <title>Finite-Memory Extension of Tegmark's Decoherence Bound in Biological Media</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tegmark's decoherence bound is derived under the assumption of a strictly memoryless environment. We show that this result corresponds to the singular limit of a finite-memory theory. For exponentially correlated environments decoherence is generically quadratic at short times and the decoherence time scales as the square root of the bath correlation time. For the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck bath we derive the exact non-Markovian coherence equation and verify the predicted scaling using an exact pseudomode mapping. Tegmark's bound is recovered only in the vanishing-memory limit.</description>

      <title>Computing quantum magic of state vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, also known as ``magic,'' quantifies how far a quantum state departs from the stabilizer set. It is a central resource behind quantum advantage and a useful probe of the complexity of quantum many-body states. Yet standard magic quantifiers, such as the stabilizer R\'enyi entropy (SRE) for qubits and the mana for qutrits, are costly to evaluate numerically, with the computational complexity growing rapidly with the number $N$ of qudits. Here we introduce efficient, numerically exact algorithms that exploit the fast Hadamard transform to compute the SRE for qubits ($d=2$) and the mana for qutrits ($d=3$) for pure states given as state vectors. Our methods compute SRE and mana at cost $O(N d^{2N})$, providing an exponential improvement over the naive $O(d^{3N})$ scaling, with substantial parallelism and straightforward GPU acceleration. We further show how to combine the fast Hadamard transform with Monte Carlo sampling to estimate the SRE of state vectors, and we extend the approach to compute the mana of mixed states. All algorithms are implemented in the open-source Julia package HadaMAG ( https://github.com/bsc-quantic/HadaMAG.jl/ ), which provides a high-performance toolbox for computing SRE and mana with built-in support for multithreading, MPI-based distributed parallelism, and GPU acceleration. The package, together with the methods developed in this work, offers a practical route to large-scale numerical studies of magic in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Divergent solutions are ubiquitous with perturbation methods. We use continued function such as continued exponential to converge divergent series in perturbation approaches for energy eigenvalues of Helium, Stark effect and Zeeman effect on Hydrogen. We observe that convergence properties are obtained similar to that of the Pad\'e approximation which is extensively used in literature. Free parameters are not used which influence the convergence and only first few terms in the perturbation series are implemented.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Integrated Quantum Photonic Logic Via Robust Directional Couplers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20069v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable quantum information processing with integrated photonics requires quantum logic operations with high fidelity and robustness. Directional couplers, the fundamental elements enabling quantum interference and logic operations, are inherently sensitive to fabrication imperfections and environmental fluctuations, leading to reduced gate fidelities. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a passive design strategy that mitigates these errors by exploiting a stationary geometrical configuration in uniform directional couplers, where first-order variations in the coupling coefficient are intrinsically suppressed. The robust geometry is implemented in a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip hosting two-photon controlled-NOT (CNOT) quantum gates and its performance is directly compared to a non-optimized design. Measurements indicate a mean gate fidelity of $93.30 \pm 0.11\%$, representing a clear improvement over the non-robust implementation mean fidelity of $91.93 \pm 0.17\%$, without any active tuning or footprint increase. This performance approaches the theoretical limit of $93.78\%$, imposed by the imperfect source. Monte Carlo simulations incorporating realistic fabrication noise confirm the observed enhancement and reveal consistent suppression of gate-level error rates. These results demonstrate a compact, fabrication-tolerant building block for scalable, fault-tolerant photonic quantum circuits and highlight the power of passive geometric error mitigation in quantum hardware design.</description>

      <title>Universal scaling of microwave dissipation in superconducting circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08953v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improving the coherence of superconducting qubits is essential for advancing quantum technologies. While superconductors are theoretically perfect conductors, they consistently exhibit residual energy dissipation when driven by microwave currents, limiting coherence times. Here, we report a universal scaling between microwave dissipation and the superfluid density, a bulk property of superconductors related to charge carrier density and disorder. Our analysis spans a wide range of superconducting materials and device geometries, from highly disordered amorphous films to ultra-clean systems with record-high quality factors, including resonators, 3D cavities, and transmon qubits. This scaling reveals an intrinsic bulk dissipation channel, independent of surface dielectric losses, that originates from a universal density of nonequilibrium quasiparticles trapped within disorder-induced spatial variations of the superconducting gap. Our findings identify an empirical coherence limit associated with intrinsic material properties and provide a data-driven basis for materials selection in future superconducting quantum circuits.</description>

      <title>Splitting of the three-body F\"orster resonance in Rb Rydberg atoms as a measure of dipole-dipole interaction strength</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three-body F\"orster resonances controlled by a dc electric field are of interest for the implementation of three-qubit quantum gates with single atoms in optical traps using their laser excitation into strongly interacting Rydberg states. In our recent theoretical paper [Zh. Eksper. Teor. Fiz. 168(1), 14 (2025)] it was found that the proposed earlier three-body F\"orster resonance $3\times nP_{3/2} \to nS_{1/2} +(n+1)S_{1/2} +nP_{1/2} $ in Rb Rydberg atoms has a splitting, with one of the split components having weaker dependence of the resonant electric field (and the corresponding dynamic shift) on the distance $R$ between the atoms. Here we study this effect in more detail, since such a resonance is the most suitable for performing experiments on observing coherent oscillations of populations of collective three-body states and implementing three-qubit quantum gates based on them. For a linear spatial configuration of three interacting Rydberg atoms, the physical mechanism of this phenomenon is revealed and analytical formulas are obtained that describe the behavior of split structure of the F\"orster resonance depending on $R$. It is found that the splitting is a measure of the energy of the resonant dipole-dipole exchange interaction with an excitation hopping between neighboring Rydberg states $S$ and $P$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry re-breaking in an effective theory of quantum coarsening</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simple theory accounting for two central observations in a recent experiment on quantum coarsening and collective dynamics on a programmable quantum simulator [T. Manovitz et al., Nature \textbf{638}, 86 (2025)]: an apparent speeding up of the coarsening process as the phase transition is approached; and persistent oscillations of the order parameter after quenches within the ordered phase. Our theory, based on the Hamiltonian structure of the equations of motion in the classical limit of the quantum model, finds a speeding up already deep within the ordered phase, with subsequent slowing down as the domain wall tension vanishes upon approaching the critical line. Further, the oscillations are captured within a mean-field treatment of the order parameter field. For quenches within the ordered phase, small spatially-varying fluctuations in the initial mean-field lead to a remarkable long-time effect, wherein the system dynamically destroys its long-range order and has to coarsen to re-establish it. We term this phenomenon \emph{symmetry re-breaking}, as the resulting late-time magnetization can have a sign opposite to the initial magnetization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Spectral Form Factor (SFF) is defined as the modulus squared of the partition function in complex temperature for hermitian matrices and a suitable generalisation has been given in the non hermitian case. In this work we compute the properties of the quenched SFF for hermitian and non hermitian random matrices. Despite the fact that the (annealed) SFF is not self-averaging the quenched SFF is self-averaging but these two averages coincide up to subleading constants (at least for high enough temperatures). The fluctuations of $\log \mathrm{SFF}$ are deep and one encounters thin spikes when moving close to a zero of the partition function. We study the partition function at late times by considering a suitable change of variable which turns out to be compatible with a Gumbel distribution. We note that the exponential tails of this distribution can be obtained by the deep spikes in the $\log \mathrm{SFF}$, namely the zeros of the partition function. We compare with the results obtained in isolated many-body systems and we show that same results hold at late times also for non-hermitian Hamiltonains and non-hermitian random matrices.</description>

      <title>Infinite-component $BF$ field theory: Nexus of fracton order, Toeplitz braiding, and non-Hermitian amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building on the infinite-component Chern-Simons theory of three-dimensional fracton phases by Ma et al. [Phys. Rev. B 105, 195124 (2022)] and the Toeplitz braiding of anyons by Li et al. [Phys. Rev. B 110, 205108 (2024)], we show that stacking $(3+1)$D $BF$ topological field theories along a fourth spatial direction gives rise to an exotic class of four-dimensional fracton phases. Their low-energy physics is governed by a new field-theoretic framework -- infinite-component $BF$ (i$BF$) theories -- characterized by asymmetric integer Toeplitz $K$ matrices. Under open boundary conditions, i$BF$ theories exhibit a striking phenomenon: \textit{Toeplitz particle-loop braiding}, where a particle and a loop placed on opposite three-dimensional boundaries acquire a finite braiding phase even at infinite separation. This nonlocal braiding admits a geometric interpretation: transporting the particle induces a winding boundary trajectory on the opposite boundary that encircles the loop. We show that this robustness originates from boundary zero singular modes (ZSMs) of Toeplitz $K$ matrices revealed by singular value decomposition (SVD), rather than from the eigenvalue zero modes responsible for previously known Toeplitz braiding of anyons. We analytically and numerically study representative i$BF$ theories with Hatano-Nelson-type and non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger--type $K$ matrices, establishing a universal correspondence between ZSMs and Toeplitz particle-loop braiding. Our results identify boundary zero singular modes as the mechanism behind Toeplitz particle-loop braiding and establish infinite-component $BF$ theory as a predictive framework for higher-dimensional fracton topological orders.</description>

      <title>Quantum open system description of a hybrid plasmonic cavity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified quantum open system framework for lossy plasmonic cavities in which coherent dynamics, relaxation, dephasing, and irreversible absorption are treated on equal footing. The Dyson equation for the cavity photon propagator in the random-phase approximation yields a complex self-energy S that accounts for both the renormalization and the damping of hybrid plasmon-photon modes (polaritons, in a quasi-particle description). Tracing out the electronic and photonic environments leads to a Liouvillian for the upper (UP) and lower (LP) polaritonic branches, incorporating leakage through the imaginary part of the self-energy, internal UP-LP scattering rates, and dephasing. Time evolution equations for polariton populations, interbranch coherence, and driven amplitudes in closed form also provide analytic expressions for their steady-state values, the quench rate of UP-LP oscillations and polaritonic lineshapes, valid in the limit of low polaritonic density, but covering light-matter ultrastrong coupling. The theory establishes a self-consistent description of dissipative polariton dynamics in plasmonic and nanophotonic cavities, directly applicable to response spectra, time-domain measurements, and dissipation engineering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a two-proton emitter with a diproton-correlated initial state can act as a source of spin-correlated proton pairs. Using a time-dependent three-body model, we investigate the two-proton emission of $^{16}$Ne ($^{14}$O$+2p$) and analyze the spin correlation of the emitted protons. We find that, when the emission proceeds as a democratic three-body process from an initial state containing a spin-singlet diproton correlation, the emitted protons exhibit a pronounced spin-correlation pattern exceeding the local-hidden-variable bound. This spin correlation closely resembles that of a pure spin-singlet pair. In contrast, this pattern is lost when the process is dominated by the sequential emission or when the initial diproton correlation is absent. These results demonstrate that a certain class of two-proton emitters can deliver spin-entangled proton pairs, and their spin correlation reflects the diproton correlation embedded in the initial state.</description>

Abstract: Adiabatic topological pumping enables robust transport of energy and information, yet its operational speed is fundamentally constrained by the instantaneous adiabatic condition, which necessitates prohibitively slow parameter variations. Here, we propose a paradigm shift from instantaneous to global adiabaticity. We derive a global adiabatic criterion (GAC) that establishes an absolute fidelity bound by controlling the root-mean-square nonadiabaticity. Building on this framework, we introduce a fluctuation-suppression acceleration criterion to minimize spatial inhomogeneity, allowing for a safe increase in mean nonadiabaticity without compromising fidelity. We experimentally demonstrate this principle in femtosecond-laser-written photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide arrays via scalable power-law coupling modulation. Our accelerated topological pumping achieves a fidelity of &gt;0.95 with a fivefold reduction in device length compared to conventional schemes, exhibits the predicted linear scaling with system size, and maintains robust performance across a bandwidth exceeding 400 nm. This GAC framework provides a universal design rule for fast, compact, and robust adiabatic devices across both quantum and classical topological platforms.</description>

      <title>Obstructions to Unitary Hamiltonians in Non-Unitary String-Net Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06821</link>

Abstract: The Levin-Wen string-net formalism provides a canonical mapping from spherical fusion categories to local Hamiltonians defining Topological Quantum Field Theories (TQFTs). While the topological invariance of the ground state is guaranteed by the pentagon identity, the realization of the model on a physical Hilbert space requires the category to be unitary. In this work, we investigate the obstructions arising when this construction is applied to non-unitary spherical categories, specifically the Yang-Lee model (the non-unitary minimal model $\mathcal{M}(2,5)$). We first validate our framework by explicitly constructing and verifying the Hamiltonians for rank-3 ($\text{Rep}(D_3)$), rank-5 ($\text{TY}(\mathbb{Z}_4)$), and Abelian ($\mathbb{Z}_7$) unitary categories. We then apply this machinery to the non-unitary Yang-Lee model. Using a custom gradient-descent optimization algorithm on the manifold of $F$-symbols, we demonstrate that the Yang-Lee fusion rules admit no unitary solution to the pentagon equations. We explain this failure analytically by proving that negative quantum dimensions impose an indefinite metric on the string-net space, realizing a Krein space rather than a Hilbert space. Finally, we invoke the theory of $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics to interpret the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, establishing that the obstruction is intrinsic to the fusion ring and cannot be removed by unitary gauge transformations.</description>
