      <title>From Faraday and Maxwell to Quantum Physics. The later story of the Electromagnetic Vector Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of quantum mechanics by Heisenberg in 1925 exactly a century ago, the quantization of the electromagnetic field became an important goal for our founding fathers, whom we are here to celebrate. It was realized very soon that a consistent picture of quantum electrodynamics (QED) requires the quantization of not just the electromagnetic field ${\bf A}({\bf r},t)$, but the electron field ${\bf \psi}({\bf r},t)$ as well. The electron field is now a Dirac spinor field and it becomes a major partner for the vector potential. Together these two fields form a duet which yearns for a unification which is not often emphasized in text books, but no one knows how to do this yet. The underlying structure appears to be a super-symmetric one where bosons and fermions live comfortably as a single field that could by some yet unknown process produce QED. This area is still at the forefront of current research with names like Super-symmetric Quantum Electrodynamics (SQED), strings and others. Ironically for a variety of reasons, the number of fields in SQED has to be increased and not decreased, defying the objective of an economical unification. Furthermore it is now known that Maxwell's theory is incomplete and that there are situations due to boundaries or topology that demand the vector potential must itself be gauge invariant.
  (This paper is dedicated to the celebration of 100 years of quantum mechanics, on the anniversary of Heisenberg's founding paper on the subject in July 1925, delivered by Miguel Ortu\~no at the IQSA 2025 Conference at Tropea in Calabria, Italy from 30 June to 4th July 2025. The proceedings will be published as a celebratory volume by World Scientific Publications, Singapore in 2026).</description>

      <title>Holistic Versus Fragmented Multiverses: Empirical Access via Causal and Grounding Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can multiverse hypotheses ever receive empirical support? Critics argue that multiverse scenarios posit unobservable entities, face severe underdetermination, or fall outside the bounds of science. This chapter challenges that view by offering a naturalistic metaphysical counterpoint to Bayesian approaches, distinguishing fragmented from holistic multiverses. Scientific proposals are almost always holistic: they embed universes within a unifying physical or metaphysical structure that can, in principle, leave empirical signatures inside the universes. I develop a typology of such signatures and show how it applies to leading scenarios from quantum theory, cosmology, and string theory. This framework clarifies why objections such as the `this universe' objection and a newly articulated generalization, the epistemic isolation objection, fail against scientifically motivated multiverses. The upshot is a qualified defence: while fragmented multiverses remain empirically inaccessible, certain holistic multiverses could, in principle, be supported by the same epistemic standards used elsewhere in physics.</description>

      <title>Blurred orbits and blurred particles: Heisenberg's 1926 helium atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04116v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work analyses the extent to which the "blurred orbits" of the current model for the atom, drafted by Heisenberg in 1926, fits the image of a bunch of wandering electrons around a nucleus. We will deal with early appearances of the concept of indistinguishable particles within the frame of quantum mechanics. There are few studies on the use of this concept in Heisenberg's 1926 papers on helium, in contrast with the large number of them on its use in Bose--Einstein's 1924 papers. We will discuss to what extent Heisenberg's approach leads to a purely statistical interpretation of this concept. We will also study the viewpoint of Dirac, who dealt with the same topic few months later. Although the indistinguishability of the electrons and indeterminacy are common explanations for the blurring of electron orbits, we argue that such an image is an oversimplification which masks interesting aspects of: a) the dynamics of bound electrons and b) the deeper implications of indistinguishability in quantum mechanics.</description>
