      <title>Near Stein-Weiss Groups in Characteristic Nearness Approximation Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces results for the characteristically near Stein-Weiss groups inherent in vector fields in the complex plane $\mathbb{C}$. Near groups are discerned in the context of characteristic nearness approximation spaces (cNASs). A characteristic of a Stein-Weiss group is a mapping $\varphi:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{C}$ defined by $\varphi(t)=e^{jt}$, which defines a vector field in the complex plane. All characteristic vectors emanate from the same fixed point in $\mathbb{C}$, namely, 0.</description>

      <title>A Novel Solution of the Quantum Measurement Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In spite of the innumerable attempts to resolve the quantum measurement problem, almost since its beginning a century ago, a satisfactory solution still remains elusive. However, after the advent of quantum entanglement leading to environmental decoherence studies, a substantial leap forward has been achieved by Zurek and his associates. Their investigation has led to the existence of sturdy pointer states that survive decoherence leading to classicality although still remaining entangled with the environment and the apparatus states. But in order to avoid the inexplicable collapse postulate, Zurek invokes Everett's many world conjecture, which is not accepted by many experts. In this article, we present the observation of entanglement sudden death (ESD), demonstrating that disentanglement of the pointer states is caused by the quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field. We reveal that the decoherence between the pointer states and the environment is consistent with unitary evolution when the vacuum modes are included in the calculation, in analogy to the unitary evolution of the whole system in the spontaneous emission process. However, the ultimate state of the system is still subject to the totally unpredictable nature of individual quantum fluctuations, causing the stochastic appearance of an arbitrary classical state in von Neumann's collapse axiom even when the entire system evolves unitarily. Therefore, we suggest that an acceptable solution of the long standing measurement problem has finally been achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate QCD matter using the two-flavor PNJL model and find that the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio {\eta}/s reaches a minimum while the bulk viscosity {\zeta}/s peaks near the chiral crossover line, particularly at large baryon chemical potential, indicating sensitivity to critical dynamics and offering potential signatures for the QCD critical endpoint in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>EPR Correlations Using Quaternion Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical simulation replicating the correlation observed in EPR coincidence experiments without needing non-local connectivity. We define spin coherence as a spin attribute that complements polarization by being anti-symmetric and generating helicity. Point particle spin becomes structured with two orthogonal magnetic moments, each with a spin of 1/2 these moments couple in free flight to create a spin-1 boson. Depending on its orientation in the field, when it encounters a filter, it either decouples into two independent fermion spins of 1/2 or it remains a boson and precedes without decoupling. The only variable in this study is the angle that orients a spin on the Bloch sphere, first identified in the 1920s. There are no hidden variables. The new features introduced in this work result from changing the spin symmetry from SU(2) to the quaternion group which complexifies the Dirac field. The transition from a free-flight boson to a measured fermion causes the observed violation of Bell's Inequalities and resolves the EPR paradox.</description>

      <title>Modular Debiasing for Discrete Sources and Quantum Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modular debiasing technique for discrete random sources, addressing the fundamental challenge of extracting high-quality randomness from imperfect physical processes. The method involves summing the outcomes of multiple independent trials from a biased source and reducing the sum modulo the number of possible outcomes, $m$. We provide a rigorous theoretical framework demonstrating that this simple operation guarantees the convergence of the output distribution to the ideal uniform distribution over $\{0, 1, \dots, m-1\}$. A key result is the method's remarkable robustness: convergence is proven for any initial bias (provided all outcomes have non-zero probability) and, critically, is maintained even under non-stationary conditions or time-dependent noise. Analytical bounds show an exponential rate of convergence, which is empirically validated by numerical simulations. This technique's simplicity, theoretical guarantees, robustness, and data efficiency make it particularly well-suited for practical implementation in quantum settings, such as spatial photon-detection-based Quantum Random Number Generators, enabling efficient extraction of high-quality randomness from experimentally imperfect sources.</description>

      <title>Fundamental physics asks philosophers new questions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern fundamental physics poses new questions for philosophy, which, as it seems to us, have not yet received appropriate attention from philosophers of science. This paper formulates a number of such questions in order to present them to the attention, first of all, of professional philosophers. A rough list of the main themes is as follows: 1) Cosmic variance problem and the meaning of theoretical cosmology; 2) Epistemological status of the concept of Multiverse in cosmology; 3) The operational status of quantum macrostates and the relation of this problem to cosmology; 4) The meaning of the physical reality in the ``final theory''; 5) Criticism of the string theory in the relation with the item 4 above.</description>

      <title>On the Notion of Dark Space-Time and Quantum Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of quantum nonlocality, as exemplified by entanglement, remains one of the deepest mysteries in quantum physics, challenging classical notions of causality and locality. In this work, we introduce the concept of dark space-time, a hidden geometric structure that coexists with ordinary space-time but may allow superluminal information transfer. We propose a modified space-time metric for dark space-time, in which the speed of causal influences exceeds the speed of light, thereby permitting nonlocal correlations to be naturally mediated through an unobservable channel. The framework is developed through a two-space-time quantum formalism, where entangled states evolve via interactions between ordinary and dark space-time sectors. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of dark space-time for ER=EPR conjecture and black hole information paradox. The notion of dark space-time is more fundamental than the dark energy and dark matter. Our results provide a novel approach to reconciling quantum mechanics with a deeper geometric foundation, offering insights into the fundamental nature of reality.</description>

      <title>Electron Wave-Spin Qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a wave-entity perspective of the electron spin qubit, treating the electron as a continuous physical wave rather than a point-like particle. In this framework, each spin qubit corresponds to a distinct current density configuration, resolving the paradox of a particle spinning both up and down simultaneously. We further identify the presence of a persistent, azimuthally asymmetric magnetic field associated with the wave-spin qubit, contrasting with the null magnetic field predicted by the particle-spin model. Importantly, the qubit's relative phase determines the orientation of both the current and the magnetic field, enabling direct, local interactions between qubits. This phase-dependent coupling provides a natural foundation for parallel quantum computing architectures, distinct from sequential, gate-based logic. By recognizing the electron wave as the sole physical entity, rather than a probabilistic abstraction, we propose a quantum framework that is deterministic, local, causal, and fully consistent with special relativity.</description>

Abstract: Using the spectral properties of orthogonal polynomials, we introduce a finite version of quantum field theory for elementary particles. Closed-loop integrals in the Feynman diagrams for computing transition amplitudes are finite. Consequently, no renormalization scheme is required in this theory.</description>

      <title>New entropy, thermodynamics of apparent horizon and cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we consider new nonadditive entropy of the apparent horizon $S_K=S_{BH}/(1+\gamma S_{BH})$ with $S_{BH}$ being the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy. This is an alternative of the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropies, that allow us by utilising the holographic principle to develop of a new model of holographic dark energy. When $\gamma\rightarrow 0$ our entropy becomes the Bekenstein--Hawking entropy $S_{BH}$. The generalised Friedmann's equations for Friedmann--Lema\^{i}tre--Robertson--Walker (FLRW) space-time for the barotropic matter fluid with $p=w\rho$ were obtained. We compute the dark energy pressure $p_D$, density energy $\rho_D$ and the deceleration parameter corresponding to our model. From the second modified Friedmann's equation a dynamical cosmological constant was obtained. We show that at some model parameters $w$ and $\gamma$ there are two phases, universe acceleration and deceleration or the phase of the eternal inflation. Thus, our model, by virtue of the holographic principle, can describe the universe inflation and late time of the universe acceleration. It is shown that entropic cosmology with our entropy proposed is equivalent to cosmology based on the teleparallel gravity with the function $F(T)$. The holographic dark energy model with the generalized entropy of the apparent horizon can be of interest for new cosmology.</description>
