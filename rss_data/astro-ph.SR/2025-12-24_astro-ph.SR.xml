      <title>The EUV Late-Phase: Statistical Results from 15 Years of Solar Dynamics Observatory Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since its launch in 2010, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) has provided continuous high-cadence, multi-wavelength observations of the Sun, capturing thousands of solar flares and offering new insights into coronal dynamics. Among the discoveries enabled by SDO is the EUV late-phase (ELP), characterised by a secondary enhancement in warm coronal emission occurring tens of minutes after the main flare. While recent work has demonstrated the relevance of the ELP for space weather, its statistical behaviour and physical origin remain poorly constrained. Here, we present the most comprehensive review of the ELP to date, based on 15 years of Fe XVI observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard SDO (SDO/AIA). From a sample of 5335 isolated flares between 2010 and 2025, we identify and validate 467 ELP events. The overall ELP occurrence rate is 8 percent, with no significant dependence on the solar cycle and only a modest enhancement in the low-to-mid M-class range. The ELP typically exhibits and onset delay of 19 minutes, a peak-to-peak delay of 88 minutes, and a duration of 93 minutes. Strong correlations are found between ELP rise and decay rates (p=0.76), and between flare and ELP impulsivity (p=0.61), while no significant correlation is observed between flare and ELP phases. A Principal Component Analysis revealed three dominant axes of variation, corresponding to a timescale component, an energy-release intensity axis, and a partitioning of energy between the flare and ELP. These results suggest that ELP evolution is governed by both flare loop properties and reconnection-driven energetics, likely modulated by a finite magnetic energy budget, and highlight the importance of SDO's long-term observations for understanding flare evolution and the Sun-Earth connection.</description>

      <title>Observation of Large-Scale Kelvin-Helmholtz Instability Wave Driven by a Coronal Mass Ejection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (KHI) can occur when there is a relative motion between two adjacent fluids. In the case of magnetized plasma, the shear velocity must exceed the local Alfv\'{e}n speed for the instability to develop. The KHI produces nonlinear waves that eventually roll up into vortices and contribute to turbulence and dissipation. In the solar atmosphere KHI has been detected in coronal mass ejections (CMEs), jets, and prominences, mainly in the low corona. Only a few studies have reported the KHI in the upper corona, and its vortex development there has not been previously observed. We report the event with large-scale KHI waves observed from $\sim 6$ to 14~$R_{\odot}$ on 2024-Feb-16 using SOHO/LASCO and STEREO-A coronagraphs. KHI appeared during the passage of a fast CME and evolved into the nonlinear stage showing evidence of vortices. A closely timed subsequent CME in the same region has further developed the fully nonlinear KHI waves along its flank. We find that the radial speed of the CMEs exceeds the estimated local Alfven speed obtained from in-situ Parker Solar Probe (PSP) magnetic field data at perihelia. We propose that such events are rare because the fast CME created specific conditions favorable for instability growth in its trailing edge, including radial elongation of magnetic-field lines, reduced plasma density, and enhanced velocity and magnetic-field shear along the developing interface. The observed growth rate of KHI wave is in qualitative agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Stable mass transfer in massive binaries leading to merging black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vast majority of massive binary systems in the universe is evidently unsuited to produce merging binary black holes. However, several narrow evolutionary paths of isolated massive binaries towards this goal have recently been identified. Due to the high degree of simplification and assumptions applied in previous modelling of these paths, conclusions remained vague so far. For one of these paths, the stable mass transfer channel, we now construct detailed binary evolution models which include internal differential rotation as well as mass and angular momentum transfer between the stars, all the way from the zero-age main sequence to the formation of the black holes, only skipping the rapid late burning stages. This allows us to follow the mass and chemical structure evolution of the mass accreting component, which turns out to have a key influence on the phase of reverse mass transfer, that allows the obtained black hole spins and mass ratios to naturally fall into the regime observed for the gravitational-wave source in the 10--25$M_\odot$ primary black hole mass range. As for this channel, also a large number of progenitor binaries are known, we conclude that it likely contributes to the observed population of gravitational wave sources.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Dual Nature of V1180 Cas: UXor-like Dips and EXor-like Bursts Across a Decade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the long-term photometric and spectroscopic evolution of V1180 Cas over a decade, aiming to identify the dominant mechanisms behind its variability. We combine multi-band light curves from 1999 to 2025 with over 30 epochs of optical to near-infrared spectroscopy (0.5-2.5 $\mu$m), analyzing variability patterns, color behavior, and emission line diagnostics. We investigate the temporal evolution of accretion and outflow indicators and their correlation with photometric states. The light curve reveals a transition from sporadic early dimming events to a quasi-periodic pattern since 2018, with eleven major dips showing asymmetry and stochastic sub-structure. Color-magnitude diagrams show classic UXor-like blueing during deep minima, while near-infrared and mid-infrared color changes indicate thermal evolution of disk. Spectroscopic analysis reveals persistent hydrogen, Ca II, He I, and forbidden line emission. Accretion diagnostics track photometric variability, and forbidden lines often intensify during dips, implying a physical link between extinction and outflows. Estimated accretion rates range from $\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}$ $M_\odot$yr$^{-1}$; the outflow rate and density diagnostics are consistent with disk winds and shock-excited jets. V1180 Cas demonstrates dual-mode variability driven by both variable circumstellar extinction and episodic accretion events. The hybrid UXor/EXor behavior, combined with evolving disk signatures and persistent outflows, suggests a young stellar object undergoing coupled accretion-extinction-outflow evolution. Continued monitoring will be essential to fully resolve the physical processes shaping its variability.</description>

      <title>Detection of dark companions via the combination of eclipse timing variation, Hipparcos and/or Gaia astrometry: the cases of V Puppis and CY Ari</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The third body is expected to shape the formation and evolution of close binary systems. In this work, we develop a method to detect and characterize the tertiary companion around eclipsing binaries through the combined analysis of eclipse timing variation, Hipparcos and/or Gaia astrometry. This method allows us to determine both the true mass and the inclination of the tertiary body that inferred from light-travel time effect. For the massive B-type binary V Pup, we do not confirm the previously reported 5.47-yr signal; instead, we identify a longer period of 14 yr. The orbital semi-major axis and mass of the outer body are revised to $a_C={17.88}_{-0.15}^{+0.15}$\,au and $M_C={7.73}_{-0.14}^{+0.14}\,M_\odot$, confirming it as a promising stellar-mass black-hole candidate for further follow-up study. For the tertiary of the contact binary CY Ari, we obtain $P_C=5.406_{-0.016}^{+0.017}$ yr, $e_C=0.526_{-0.027}^{+0.032}$, $I_C={85.6}_{-6.5}^{+7.8}$$^\circ$, and a true mass of $M_C=0.640_{-0.029}^{+0.029}\,M_\odot$, supporting the white dwarf hypothesis proposed in previous study. The orbits of both systems are nearly edge-on ($I=90^{\circ}$), implying that they may form in a coplanar environment. We highlight the advantages of our method for detecting dark companions in binary and triple systems.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'enic solar wind intervals observed by Solar Orbiter: Exploiting the capability of the SWA plasma suite and source region investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast and slow solar wind have distinct properties linked to their solar sources.Alfv\'enic slow wind complicates the usual speed-based classification, especially at intermediate speeds. Solar Orbiter's Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) offers unique capabilities to investigate how Alfv\'enic slow wind differs from fast wind and relate these differences to their solar origins. In September 2022, Solar Orbiter observed several Alfv\'enic streams: one fast wind, three Alfv\'enic slow wind (AS1, AS2, AS3), and a moderate fast (FH) interval. We analyze these streams, combining plasma parameters from all SWA sensors with magnetic field measurements from the Magnetometer (MAG). A spectral analysis of magnetic and velocity fluctuations is used to characterize Alfv\'enicity. The magnetic connectivity of each stream to its solar source is examined using Potential Field Source Surface extrapolation combined with ballistic backmapping from the spacecraft. Proton velocity distribution functions show anisotropies and field-aligned beams characteristic of Alfv\'enic streams, while electron pitch-angle distributions reveal clear strahl populations. Oxygen and carbon charge-state ratios are low in fast wind but higher in AS1-AS3, consistent with slow wind origins. Magnetic connectivity suggests the fast wind originates from a large coronal hole; AS1 links to a pseudostreamer with high expansion factor; AS2, AS3, and FH connect to a negative-polarity coronal hole whose field lines cross a pseudostreamer that later dissipates. Spectral analysis indicates near energy equipartition in all intervals except AS2. The combined SWA observations offer key insights into the physical processes shaping Alfv\'enic solar wind streams. Our results reinforce that the simple fast/slow wind classification is inadequate for linking solar wind to sources, and suggest that Alfv\'enicity relates to the solar source conditions.</description>

      <title>Formation of an optically thick shocked shell in the very fast nova V1674 Herculis: the origin of superbrightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V1674 Her is the fastest ($t_2\sim 1$ day) classical nova in our Galaxy and its absolute $V$ peak of $M_{V,\rm max}\sim -10.2$ is one magnitude brighter than typical very fast novae. Such a nova is sometimes called a superbright nova. Using our fully self-consistent nova outburst model combined with the optically thick winds on a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ white dwarf (WD) with a mass accretion rate of $1\times 10^{-11} ~M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, we have clarified that a strong reverse shock arises $0.3$ days after the outburst, which is just after the maximum expansion of the WD photosphere. The shocked shell is optically thick and expanding with the velocity of $\sim 3500$ km~s$^{-1}$. Its $V$ brightness reaches maximum of $M_{V,\rm max}=-10.2$ when the shocked shell expands to $R_{\rm shell}\sim 300 ~R_\odot$ on day $\sim 0.7$. After that, the shocked shell turns to optically thin and becomes fainter than the brightness of free-free emission from the nova wind. In chronological order, the optical brightness of free-free emission reaches maximum of $M_V=-9$ on day 0.3. However, it is overtaken on day 0.5--0.7 by the $\sim$1 mag brighter luminosity of the optically thick shocked shell. The GeV gamma-ray flux reaches maximum on day 0.4 because the gamma-rays are emitted by the shock that arises on day 0.3. Our model consistently explains both the superbrightness and chronological order that the gamma-ray peak precedes substantially before the optical $V$ peak. We also present a similar light curve model for another superbright nova V1500 Cyg.</description>

      <title>Deep learning-driven atmospheric parameter prediction for hot subdwarf stars with synthetic and observed spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a convolutional neural network (CNN) incorporating channel attention and spatial attention mechanisms to predict atmospheric parameters of hot subdwarfs. The experimental dataset comprises spectra at nine distinct signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels, with each SNR level containing 11 396 synthetic spectra and 945 observed spectra. The trained deep learning models achieves mean absolute errors (AME) in predicting hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters of 730 K for effective temperature (Teff ), 0.09 dex for surface gravity (log g), and 0.03 dex for helium abundance (log(nHe/nH)), respectively, which reaches the accuracy of traditional spectral fitting methods. Utilizing the trained deep learning models and low-resolution spectra from LAMOST DR12, we confirm 1512 hot subdwarfs from the catalog of hot subdwarf candidates, of which 291 are newly identified. Our results demonstrate that the deep learning model not only achieves accuracy comparable to traditional methods in obtaining hot subdwarf atmospheric parameters, but also far exceeds them in speed and efficiency, making it particularly suitable for the analysis of large datasets of hot subdwarf spectra.</description>

      <title>Presence of solar inner F-corona and coronal heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new source in solar corona scattering photospheric and chromospheric Fraunhofer spectral lines is detected below a height of one solar radius above solar limb, consisting of tenuous and cool neutral atoms and much fewer once ionized ions. It is demonstrated via maps at the sample Fraunhofer lines within the band from 516.38 to 539.89nm, reconstructed from one set of spatially successive raster scanning data. The dataset was obtained from a spectrograph during the total solar eclipse on April 8, 2024, at Oden, Arkansas, USA. It is revealed from these maps that both the scattering and its spatial distribution depend on spectral lines, yielded from different ionization and excitation states of neutral metal atoms and ions. The distributions show asymmetry and feature of diffusion originated from the photosphere and chromosphere. Ratio of the Fraunhofer line depth to the continuum intensity evaluated over the observational band peaks at 0.25$\%$ and has an average of 0.32$\%$. More discrete and weaker diffusion of emission counterparts of some Fraunhofer lines are detected simultaneously. These properties are critically different from those owned by that F-corona yielded via dust grain scattering beyond heights of about two and half solar radii. Hence a term 'inner F-corona' is dubbed for the assembly of scattering by this new particle source. It becomes definite now that the solar corona consists of not only free electrons and ions but also much fewer yet non-negligible neutral atoms. It is emphasized that global distributions of the outward neutral atom fluxes and coronal magnetic loops can make the abnormal Cowling resistance the most primary mechanism responsible for the coronal heating, via collisions of the neutral atoms injected with ions in the coronal loops. This likes the heating process in Tokamak with neutral beam injection(NBI).</description>

      <title>Revisiting the near infrared Calcium triplet as metallicity indicator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The near-infrared Calcium II Triplet (CaT), around 850nm, is a key metallicity indicator for red giant stars. We present a revised [Fe/H] calibration as a function of CaT line strengths and four luminosity indicators, including the $Gaia$ $G$-band, together with the classical $V$, $I$, and $K_s$ bandpasses. For this purpose, we used a sample of 366 red giant stars belonging to 25 globular and open clusters, complemented by 52 extremely metal-poor field giant stars. The CaT line strengths are determined by fitting Gaussian-Lorentzian combination profiles using the Python lmfit package, which utilises the algorithms implemented therein. The derived calibration is valid for a wide metallicity range, $-4$\,dex$ \lesssim \mathrm{[Fe/H]} \lesssim +0.15$, and for ages older than $\sim$200 Myr. In addition, we performed a detailed assessment of how factors such as spectral resolution, spectral quality (expressed through the signal-to-noise ratio), and the algorithms used to constrain the line profiles affect the measured line strengths and the resulting metallicities.</description>

      <title>New and updated timing models for seven young energetic X-ray pulsars, including the Big Glitcher PSR J0537-6910</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new timing models and update our previous ones for the rotational evolution of seven young energetic pulsars, including four of the top five in spin-down luminosity Edot among all known pulsars. For each of the six pulsars that were monitored on a regular basis by NICER, their rotation phase-connected timing model covers the entire period of NICER observations, in many cases from 2017-2025. For PSR J0058-7218, which was only identified in 2021, we extend the baseline of its timing model by 3 years and report detections of its first three glitches. The timing model for PSR J0537-6910 over the entire 8 years of NICER monitoring is presented, including a total of 23 glitches; we also report its spin frequency and pulsed spectrum from a 2016 NuSTAR observation. For PSR B0540-69, its complete timing model from 2015-2025 is provided, including a braking index evolution from near 0 to 1.6 during this period. The 8-year timing model for PSR J1412+7922 (also known as Calvera) is reported, which includes a position that is consistent with that measured from imaging. For PSR J1811-1925, we present its 3.5-year timing model. For PSR J1813-1749, its incoherent timing model is extended through early 2025 using new Chandra observations. For PSR J1849-0001, its 7-year timing model is provided, including a position that is consistent with and more accurate than its imaging position and its first glitch that is one of the largest ever measured. Our timing models of these seven X-ray pulsars enable their study at other energies and in gravitational wave data.</description>

Abstract: We model anisotropic neutron stars using three distinct prescriptions for pressure anisotropy, the Horvat, Bowers-Liang, and Covariant models, and three equations of state with different particle compositions, each described by a piecewise polytropic parametrization with continuous sound speed. The stability of these configurations is assessed through their dynamical evolution using a fully non-linear relativistic code. For stable configurations, we compute the oscillation spectrum and identify the fundamental mode frequency. We found that, while the isotropic and Horvat models become unstable close to the maximum-mass point, the Bowers-Liang and Covariant models become unstable at lower central densities, indicating that the standard turning-point criterion may not reliably predict the onset of dynamical instability in anisotropic stars. Based on our results, we also determine the neutral-stability line and verify that configurations lying to the right of this line are indeed unstable under radial perturbations and collapse. Overall, given an equation of state, pressure anisotropy can increase the maximum mass of an stable configuration by up to ~30 % compared to the isotropic case. It also allows for more compact stable configurations that may collapse on longer timescales once they become unstable. Finally, we show that these compact stars could initially mimic a black hole's gravitational-wave ringdown. However, the production of subsequent echoes is not guaranteed by high compactness; instead, it depends critically on the star's specific internal structure and equation of state.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Wave Activation at Relativistic Magnetized Shocks</title>

Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic radio transients, some are generated in magnetar magnetospheres and winds. Despite a growing number of observations, their emission mechanisms remain elusive. It has recently been proposed that Alfv\'enic perturbations can convert into superluminal O-modes at magnetized shocks and propagate in the downstream as a radio signal. We validate this superluminal wave activation mechanism using pair-plasma theory and particle-in-cell simulations. Theory predicts two different downstream modes: non-propagating Alfv\'enic perturbations and propagating superluminal O-modes. Superluminal wave activation occurs if the frequency of upstream perturbations in the shock frame exceeds the downstream plasma frequency. 1D particle-in-cell simulations confirm wavenumber and frequency jumps across the shock for upstream perturbations with frequencies well above the plasma frequency. Our simulations model both monochromatic upstream waves and broadband spectra with the downstream plasma frequency acting like a high-pass filter for superluminal O-modes. We discuss implications for FRB generation in relativistic magnetized winds.</description>

      <title>The Solirad (So) as a Convenient Unit for Quoting Astronomical Irradiances for Planetary Insolations and Exoplanetary Instellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurements of physical parameters for stars and (exo)planets are often quoted in units normalized to the Sun and/or Earth. The nominal total solar irradiance, ${S}^{\rm N}_{\odot}$, while based on a current best estimate with uncertainties, was adopted to be an exact reference value of 1361 W m$^{-2}$ by IAU 2015 Resolution B3, corresponding to ``the mean total electromagnetic energy from the Sun, integrated over all wavelengths, incident per unit area per unit time at distance 1 au''. In the planetary and exoplanetary science literature, the units employed for ``flux'', ``insolation'', ``instellation'', etc., are often cumbersome or inconsistent. To simplify the quoting of irradiance units for astronomical applications, we introduce the portmanteau solirad, short for solar irradiance, as an abbreviated version of the longer IAU term ``nominal total solar irradiance''. The solirad (So) is a unit of irradiance, where 1 solirad = 1 So = 1361 W m$^{-2}$, equivalent to the IAU nominal total solar irradiance, and to an apparent bolometric magnitude of $m_{bol}$ = -26.832 mag (per IAU 2015 Resolution B2).</description>

      <title>Impact of 3D macro physics and nuclear physics on the p nuclei in O-C shell mergers</title>

Abstract: O-C shell mergers in massive stars are a site for producing the p nuclei by the $\gamma$ process, but 1D stellar models rely on mixing length theory, which does not match the radial velocity profiles of 3D hydrodynamic simulations. We investigate how 3D macro physics informed mixing impacts the nucleosynthesis of p nuclei. We post-process the O-shell of the $M_\mathrm{ZAMS} = 15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$, $Z = 0.02$ model from the NuGrid stellar data set. Applying a downturn to velocities at the boundary and increasing velocities across the shell as obtained in previous results, we find non-linear, non-monotonic increase in p-nuclei production with a spread of 0.96 dex, and find that isotopic ratios can change. Reducing C-shell ingestion rates as found in 3D simulations suppresses production, with spreads of 1.22-1.84 dex across MLT and downturn scenarios. Applying dips to the diffusion profile to mimic quenching events also suppresses production, with a 0.51 dex spread. We analyze the impact of varying all photo-disintegration rates of unstable n-deficient isotopes from Se-Po by a factor of 10 up and down. The nuclear physics variations for the MLT and downturn cases have a spread of 0.56-0.78 dex. We also provide which reaction rates are correlated with the p nuclei, and find few correlations shared between mixing scenarios. Our results demonstrate that uncertainties in mixing arising from uncertain 3D macro physics are as significant as nuclear physics and are crucial for understanding p-nuclei production during O-C shell mergers quantitatively.</description>

      <title>200,000+ Deep Learning-inferred Periods of Stellar Variability from the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae</title>

Abstract: Stars exhibit a range of variability periods that depend on their mass, age, and evolutionary stage. For space-based photometric data, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in recovering and measuring periodic variability from photometric missions like Kepler and TESS. All-sky ground-based surveys can have similar if not longer baselines than space-based missions; however, these datasets are more challenging to work with due to irregular sampling, more complex systematics, and larger data gaps. In this work, we demonstrate that CNNs can be used to derive variability periods from ground-based surveys. From the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae, we recover 208,260 variability periods between 1 and 30 days, approximately 60% of which are new detections. We recover periods for active RSCVn, anomalous sub-subgiants, and cool dwarfs that are consistent with previously measured rotation periods, while periods for stars above the Kraft break are generally spurious. We also identify periodic signals in tens of thousands of giant stars that correspond to frequencies of stellar oscillations rather than rotation. Our results highlight that CNNs can be used on sparsely sampled ground-based photometry to recover periodicity. We conclude that the findings of our work are very promising for the potential recovery of hundreds of thousands of stellar rotation periods in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescopes Galactic Bulge Time Domain Survey.</description>

      <title>3D Macro Physics and Light Odd-Z Element Production in O-C Shell Mergers: Implications for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ production and radiogenic heating inventories of rocky exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The light odd-Z elements P, Cl, K, and Sc are underproduced in galactic chemical evolution models compared to spectroscopic observations of stars in the Milky Way. The most promising solution to this puzzle is that some massive stars experience O-C shell mergers boosting their yields through dynamic, convective-reactive nucleosynthesis. We report how convective macro physics based on 3D $4\pi$ hydrodynamic simulations impacts production in the O shell by post-processing the $\mathrm{M_{ZAMS}}=15~\mathrm{M_\odot}$ $Z=0.02$ model from the NuGrid dataset. We explore a mixing downturn, boosted velocities, reduced ingestion rate, and convective quenching. Across 24 mixing cases, the pre-explosive yields for [P/Fe], [Cl/Fe], [K/Fe], and [Sc/Fe] are modified by $[-0.33,0.23]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.84,0.64]~\mathrm{dex}$, $[-0.78,1.48]~\mathrm{dex}$, and $[-0.36,1.29]~\mathrm{dex}$, respectively. Cases with a convective downturn with the fastest ingestion rate have the largest enhancement, and production is non-monotonic with boosted velocities. Which reactions are most important for the convective-reactive element production pathways depends on the mixing. We parameterize production of $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ ($t_{1/2} = 1.248~\mathrm{Gyr}$), an important radiogenic heat source for younger ($2{-}3~\mathrm{Gyr}$) rocky planets and find a yield variation exceeding three orders of magnitude. This range of initial abundances for $^{40}\mathrm{K}$ implies the early geodynamic behaviour of silicate mantles in rocky planets can differ greatly from that of Earth. These results underscore the importance of investigating the 3D macro physics of shell merger convection through hydrodynamic simulations to develop a predictive understanding of the origin and variability of the light odd-Z elements and the $^{40}\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{K}$ ratio in planet host stars.</description>

      <title>JWST Observations of SN 2024ggi II: NIRSpec Spectroscopy and CO Modeling at 285 and 385 Days Past the Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09600v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) NIRSpec observations of SN~2024ggi, spanning wavelengths of 1.7--5.5 micron at +285.51 and +385.27 days post-explosion. These nebular spectra are dominated by asymmetric emission lines from atomic species including H, Ca, Ar, C, Mg, Ni, Co, and Fe, indicative of an aspherical explosion. The other strong features are molecular CO vibrational bands from the fundamental and first overtone. We introduce a novel, data-driven approach using non-LTE 3D radiative transfer simulations to model the CO emission with high fidelity. This method enables us to constrain the three-dimensional CO distribution and its radial temperature structure. CO formation is found to occur prior to day +285, with subsequent evolution characterized by progressive evaporation. The CO mass decreases from approximately 8.7 to 1.3*E-3 Mo, while the average temperature drops from about 2900 K to 2500 K. Concurrently, the CO distribution transitions from nearly homogeneous to highly clumped (density contrast increasing from fc=1.2 to 2). The minimum velocity of the CO-emitting region remains nearly constant (v1 = 1200 to 1100 km/s), significantly above the receding photosphere velocity (v(ph) = 500 km/s), suggesting the photosphere resides within Si-rich layers. However, the temperature profile indicates that only a narrow zone reaches the conditions necessary for SiO formation. Due to a lack of observational constraints, SiO clumping is not modeled, and thus, synthetic SiO profiles for mass estimates are not highlighted. We discuss the implications of these findings for dust formation processes in SN~2024ggi.</description>

      <title>Pre-supernova O-C shell mergers could produce more $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ than the explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formation of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ in massive stars is thought to occur during explosive nucleosynthesis, however recent studies have shown it can be produced during O-C shell mergers prior to core collapse. We investigate how mixing according to 3D macro physics derived from hydrodynamic simulations impacts the pre-supernova O-C shell merger nucleosynthesis and if it can dominate the explosive supernova production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive isotopes. We compare a range of observations and models of explosive $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ yields to pre-explosive multi-zone mixing-burning nucleosynthesis simulations of an O-C shell merger in a $15~\mathrm{M}_\odot$ stellar model with mixing conditions corresponding to different 3D hydro mixing scenarios. Radioactive species produced in the O shell have a spread in their pre-explosive yields predictions across different 3D mixing scenarios of 2.14 dex on average. $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ has the largest spread of 4.78 dex. The pre-explosive production of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ can be larger than the production of all massive star models in the NuGrid data set where $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ is dominated by the explosive nucleosynthesis contribution, as well all other massive star and supernova models. We conclude that quantitative predictions of $^{44}\mathrm{Ti}$ and other radioactive species more broadly require an understanding of the 3D hydrodynamic mixing conditions present during the O-C shell merger.</description>
