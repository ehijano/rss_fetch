      <title>A Coq-based Axiomatization of Tarski's Mereogeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the last decade, the domain of Qualitative Spatial Reasoning, has known a renewal of interest for mereogeometry, a theory that has been initiated by Tarski. Mereogeometry relies on mereology, the Lesniewski's theory of parts and wholes that is further extended with geometrical primitives and appropriate definitions. However, most approaches (i) depart from the original Lesniewski's mereology which does not assume usual sets as a basis, (ii) restrict the logical power of mereology to a mere theory of part-whole relations and (iii) require the introduction of a connection relation. Moreover, the seminal paper of Tarki shows up unclear foundations and we argue that mereogeometry as it is introduced by Tarski, can be more suited to extend the whole theory of Lesniewski. For that purpose, we investigate a type-theoretical representation of space more closely related with the original ideas of Lesniewski and expressed with the Coq language. We show that (i) it can be given a more clear foundation, (ii) it can be based on three axioms instead of four and (iii) it can serve as a basis for spatial reasoning with full compliance with Lesniewski's systems.</description>

      <title>Tableau methodology for propositional logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We set out a general methodology for producing tableau systems for propositional logics via a tableau metatheory that provides general and formal notions for different tableau systems that vary by semantics or formulae. Moreover, by dint of these general notions, some facts, independent of their applications to a particular propositional logic, can be proved. One of the examples is the tableau metatheorem that simplifies the process of constructing a complete tableau system for a given logic, just reducing it to checking specific properties of the tableau rules within the analyzed, particular system. In our paper we generalize an abstract consistency property proposed by R. Smullyan and M. Fitting from the modal case to the others. Such a methodology is essential for a deeper and universal treatment of tableau methods for various propositional languages and semantics.</description>

      <title>Cubical coherent confluence, cubical $\omega$-groupoids and the cube equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the confluence property of abstract rewriting systems internal to cubical categories. We introduce cubical contractions, a higher-dimensional generalisation of reductions to normal forms, and employ them to construct cubical polygraphic resolutions of convergent rewriting systems. Within this categorical framework, we establish cubical proofs of fundamental rewriting results -- Newman's lemma, the Church-Rosser theorem, and Squier's coherence theorem -- via the pasting of cubical coherence cells. We moreover derive, in purely categorical terms, the cube law known from the $\lambda$-calculus and Garside theory. As a consequence, we show that every convergent abstract rewriting system freely generates an acyclic cubical groupoid, in which higher-dimensional generators can be replaced by degenerate cells beyond dimension two.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Computational Framework for Discrete Fuzzy Numbers Based on Total Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete fuzzy numbers, and in particular those defined over a finite chain $L_n = \{0, \ldots, n\}$, have been effectively employed to represent linguistic information within the framework of fuzzy systems. Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \{0, 1, \ldots, n\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \{ 0 = y_1 &lt; y_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; y_{m-1} &lt; y_m = 1 \}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \in \mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values. The results demonstrate that this formulation substantially reduces computational cost and enables the efficient implementation of algebraic operations -- such as aggregation and implication -- on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Sets of Theories That Can Be Disjointly Combined</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties that allow first-order theories to be disjointly combined, including stable infiniteness, shininess, strong politeness, and gentleness. Specifically, we describe a Galois connection between sets of decidable theories, which picks out the largest set of decidable theories that can be combined with a given set of decidable theories. Using this, we exactly characterize the sets of decidable theories that can be combined with those satisfying well-known theory combination properties. This strengthens previous results and answers in the negative several long-standing open questions about the possibility of improving existing theory combination methods to apply to larger sets of theories. Additionally, the Galois connection gives rise to a complete lattice of theory combination properties, which allows one to generate new theory combination methods by taking meets and joins of elements of this lattice. We provide examples of this process, introducing new combination theorems. We situate both new and old combination methods within this lattice.</description>

      <title>Combinatory Completeness in Structured Multicategories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a general notion of combinatory completeness with respect to a faithful cartesian club and use it systematically to obtain characterisations of a number of different kinds of applicative system. Each faithful cartesian club determines a notion of structured multicategory, with the different notions of structured multicategory obtained in this way giving different notions of polynomial over an applicative system, which in turn give different notions of combinatory completeness. We obtain the classical characterisation of combinatory algebras as combinatory complete applicative systems as a specific instance.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and updates for conjunctive linear algebra queries through expressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04118v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the importance of linear algebra and matrix operations in data analytics, there is significant interest in using relational query optimization and processing techniques for evaluating (sparse) linear algebra programs. In particular, in recent years close connections have been established between linear algebra programs and relational algebra that allow transferring optimization techniques of the latter to the former. In this paper, we ask ourselves which linear algebra programs in MATLANG correspond to the free-connex and q-hierarchical fragments of conjunctive first-order logic. Both fragments have desirable query processing properties: free-connex conjunctive queries support constant-delay enumeration after a linear-time preprocessing phase, and q-hierarchical conjunctive queries further allow constant-time updates. By characterizing the corresponding fragments of MATLANG, we hence identify the fragments of linear algebra programs that one can evaluate with constant-delay enumeration after linear-time preprocessing and with constant-time updates. To derive our results, we improve and generalize previous correspondences between MATLANG and relational algebra evaluated over semiring-annotated relations. In addition, we identify properties on semirings that allow to generalize the complexity bounds for free-connex and q-hierarchical conjunctive queries from Boolean annotations to general semirings.</description>
