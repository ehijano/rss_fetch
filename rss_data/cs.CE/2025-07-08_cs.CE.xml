      <title>Modeling Membrane Degradation in PEM Electrolyzers with Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyzers are pivotal for sustainable hydrogen production, yet their long-term performance is hindered by membrane degradation, which poses reliability and safety challenges. Therefore, accurate modeling of this degradation is essential for optimizing durability and performance. To address these concerns, traditional physics-based models have been developed, offering interpretability but requiring numerous parameters that are often difficult to measure and calibrate. Conversely, data-driven approaches, such as machine learning, offer flexibility but may lack physical consistency and generalizability. To address these limitations, this study presents the first application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to model membrane degradation in PEM electrolyzers. The proposed PINN framework couples two ordinary differential equations, one modeling membrane thinning via a first-order degradation law and another governing the time evolution of the cell voltage under membrane degradation. Results demonstrate that the PINN accurately captures the long-term system's degradation dynamics while preserving physical interpretability with limited noisy data. Consequently, this work introduces a novel hybrid modeling approach for estimating and understanding membrane degradation mechanisms in PEM electrolyzers, offering a foundation for more robust predictive tools in electrochemical system diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Mechanics Simulation with Implicit Neural Representations of Complex Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), characterized by neural network-encoded signed distance fields, provide a powerful means to represent complex geometries continuously and efficiently. While successful in computer vision and generative modeling, integrating INRs into computational analysis workflows, such as finite element simulations, remains underdeveloped. In this work, we propose a computational framework that seamlessly combines INRs with the Shifted Boundary Method (SBM) for high-fidelity linear elasticity simulations without explicit geometry transformations. By directly querying the neural implicit geometry, we obtain the surrogate boundaries and distance vectors essential for SBM, effectively eliminating the meshing step. We demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our approach through elasticity simulations on complex geometries (Stanford Bunny, Eiffel Tower, gyroids) sourced from triangle soups and point clouds. Our method showcases significant computational advantages and accuracy, underscoring its potential in biomedical, geophysical, and advanced manufacturing applications.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction in Transformers for Interpreting TCR-pMHC Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CD8+ "killer" T cells and CD4+ "helper" T cells play a central role in the adaptive immune system by recognizing antigens presented by Major Histocompatibility Complex (pMHC) molecules via T Cell Receptors (TCRs). Modeling binding between T cells and the pMHC complex is fundamental to understanding basic mechanisms of human immune response as well as in developing therapies. While transformer-based models such as TULIP have achieved impressive performance in this domain, their black-box nature precludes interpretability and thus limits a deeper mechanistic understanding of T cell response. Most existing post-hoc explainable AI (XAI) methods are confined to encoder-only, co-attention, or model-specific architectures and cannot handle encoder-decoder transformers used in TCR-pMHC modeling. To address this gap, we propose Quantifying Cross-Attention Interaction (QCAI), a new post-hoc method designed to interpret the cross-attention mechanisms in transformer decoders. Quantitative evaluation is a challenge for XAI methods; we have compiled TCR-XAI, a benchmark consisting of 274 experimentally determined TCR-pMHC structures to serve as ground truth for binding. Using these structures we compute physical distances between relevant amino acid residues in the TCR-pMHC interaction region and evaluate how well our method and others estimate the importance of residues in this region across the dataset. We show that QCAI achieves state-of-the-art performance on both interpretability and prediction accuracy under the TCR-XAI benchmark.</description>

      <title>A Concept for Autonomous Problem-Solving in Intralogistics Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving greater autonomy in automation systems is crucial for handling unforeseen situations effectively. However, this remains challenging due to technological limitations and the complexity of real-world environments. This paper examines the need for increased autonomy, defines the problem, and outlines key enabling technologies. A structured concept is proposed, consisting of three main steps: context enrichment, situation analysis, and generation of solution strategies. By following this approach, automation systems can make more independent decisions, reducing the need for human intervention. Additionally, possible realizations of the concept are discussed, especially the use of Large Language Models. While certain tasks may still require human assistance, the proposed approach significantly enhances the autonomy of automation systems, enabling more adaptive and intelligent problem-solving capabilities.</description>

      <title>Model-Based Control for Power-to-X Platforms: Knowledge Integration for Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offshore Power-to-X platforms enable flexible conversion of renewable energy, but place high demands on adaptive process control due to volatile operating conditions. To face this challenge, using Digital Twins in Power-to-X platforms is a promising approach. Comprehensive knowledge integration in Digital Twins requires the combination of heterogeneous models and a structured representation of model information. The proposed approach uses a standardized description of behavior models, semantic technologies and a graph-based model understanding to enable automatic adaption and selection of suitable models. It is implemented using a graph-based knowledge representation with Neo4j, automatic data extraction from Asset Administration Shells and port matching to ensure compatible model configurations.</description>

      <title>Operator-based machine learning framework for generalizable prediction of unsteady treatment dynamics in stormwater infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stormwater infrastructures are decentralized urban water-management systems that face highly unsteady hydraulic and pollutant loadings from episodic rainfall-runoff events. Accurately evaluating their in-situ treatment performance is essential for cost-effective design and planning. Traditional lumped dynamic models (e.g., continuously stirred tank reactor, CSTR) are computationally efficient but oversimplify transport and reaction processes, limiting predictive accuracy and insight. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) resolves detailed turbulent transport and pollutant fate physics but incurs prohibitive computational cost for unsteady and long-term simulations. To address these limitations, this study develops a composite operator-based neural network (CPNN) framework that leverages state-of-the-art operator learning to predict the spatial and temporal dynamics of hydraulics and particulate matter (PM) in stormwater treatment. The framework is demonstrated on a hydrodynamic separator (HS), a common urban treatment device. Results indicate that the CPNN achieves R2 &gt; 0.8 for hydraulic predictions in 95.2% of test cases; for PM concentration predictions, R2 &gt; 0.8 in 72.6% of cases and 0.4 &lt; R2 &lt; 0.8 in 22.6%. The analysis identifies challenges in capturing dynamics under extreme low-flow conditions, owing to their lower contribution to the training loss. Exploiting the automatic-differentiation capability of the CPNN, sensitivity analyses quantify the influence of storm event loading on PM transport. Finally, the potential of the CPNN framework for continuous, long-term evaluation of stormwater infrastructure performance is discussed, marking a step toward robust, climate-aware planning and implementation.</description>

      <title>Continual Gradient Low-Rank Projection Fine-Tuning for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continual fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) is hampered by the trade-off between efficiency and expressiveness. Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) offers efficiency but constrains the model's ability to learn new tasks and transfer knowledge due to its low-rank nature and reliance on explicit parameter constraints. We propose GORP (Gradient LOw Rank Projection) for Continual Learning, a novel training strategy that overcomes these limitations by synergistically combining full and low-rank parameters and jointly updating within a unified low-rank gradient subspace. GORP expands the optimization space while preserving efficiency and mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on continual learning benchmarks demonstrate GORP's superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/Wcxwcxw/GORP.</description>

      <title>Controllable diffusion-based generation for multi-channel biological data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02902v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial profiling technologies in biology, such as imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST), generate high-dimensional, multi-channel data with strong spatial alignment and complex inter-channel relationships. Generative modeling of such data requires jointly capturing intra- and inter-channel structure, while also generalizing across arbitrary combinations of observed and missing channels for practical application. Existing diffusion-based models generally assume low-dimensional inputs (e.g., RGB images) and rely on simple conditioning mechanisms that break spatial correspondence and ignore inter-channel dependencies. This work proposes a unified diffusion framework for controllable generation over structured and spatial biological data. Our model contains two key innovations: (1) a hierarchical feature injection mechanism that enables multi-resolution conditioning on spatially aligned channels, and (2) a combination of latent-space and output-space channel-wise attention to capture inter-channel relationships. To support flexible conditioning and generalization to arbitrary subsets of observed channels, we train the model using a random masking strategy, enabling it to reconstruct missing channels from any combination of inputs. We demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across both spatial and non-spatial prediction tasks, including protein imputation in IMC and gene-to-protein prediction in single-cell datasets, and show strong generalization to unseen conditional configurations.</description>

      <title>MolProphecy: Bridging Medicinal Chemists' Knowledge and Molecular Pre-Trained Models via a Multi-Modal Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MolProphecy is a human-in-the-loop (HITL) multi-modal framework designed to integrate chemists' domain knowledge into molecular property prediction models. While molecular pre-trained models have enabled significant gains in predictive accuracy, they often fail to capture the tacit, interpretive reasoning central to expert-driven molecular design. To address this, MolProphecy employs ChatGPT as a virtual chemist to simulate expert-level reasoning and decision-making. The generated chemist knowledge is embedded by the large language model (LLM) as a dedicated knowledge representation and then fused with graph-based molecular features through a gated cross-attention mechanism, enabling joint reasoning over human-derived and structural features. Evaluated on four benchmark datasets (FreeSolv, BACE, SIDER, and ClinTox), MolProphecy outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, achieving a 15.0 percent reduction in RMSE on FreeSolv and a 5.39 percent improvement in AUROC on BACE. Analysis reveals that chemist knowledge and structural features provide complementary contributions, improving both accuracy and interpretability. MolProphecy offers a practical and generalizable approach for collaborative drug discovery, with the flexibility to incorporate real chemist input in place of the current simulated proxy--without the need for model retraining. The implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangruochi/MolProphecy.</description>

      <title>Flow-Through Tensors: A Unified Computational Graph Architecture for Multi-Layer Transportation Network Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern transportation network modeling increasingly involves the integration of diverse methodologies including sensor-based forecasting, reinforcement learning, classical flow optimization, and demand modeling that have traditionally been developed in isolation. This paper introduces Flow Through Tensors (FTT), a unified computational graph architecture that connects origin destination flows, path probabilities, and link travel times as interconnected tensors. Our framework makes three key contributions: first, it establishes a consistent mathematical structure that enables gradient-based optimization across previously separate modeling elements; second, it supports multidimensional analysis of traffic patterns over time, space, and user groups with precise quantification of system efficiency; third, it implements tensor decomposition techniques that maintain computational tractability for large scale applications. These innovations collectively enable real time control strategies, efficient coordination between multiple transportation modes and operators, and rigorous enforcement of physical network constraints. The FTT framework bridges the gap between theoretical transportation models and practical deployment needs, providing a foundation for next generation integrated mobility systems.</description>

      <title>LANTERN: A Machine Learning Framework for Lipid Nanoparticle Transfection Efficiency Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03209v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of new ionizable lipids for efficient lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-mediated RNA delivery remains a critical bottleneck for RNA-based therapeutics development. Recent advances have highlighted the potential of machine learning (ML) to predict transfection efficiency from molecular structure, enabling high-throughput virtual screening and accelerating lead identification. However, existing approaches are hindered by inadequate data quality, ineffective feature representations, low predictive accuracy, and poor generalizability. Here, we present LANTERN (Lipid nANoparticle Transfection Efficiency pRedictioN), a robust ML framework for predicting transfection efficiency based on ionizable lipid representation. We benchmarked a diverse set of ML models against AGILE, a previously published model developed for transfection prediction. Our results show that combining simpler models with chemically informative features, particularly count-based Morgan fingerprints, outperforms more complex models that rely on internally learned embeddings, such as AGILE. We also show that a multi-layer perceptron trained on a combination of Morgan fingerprints and Expert descriptors achieved the highest performance ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.8161, r = 0.9053), significantly exceeding AGILE ($\text{R}^2$ = 0.2655, r = 0.5488). We show that the models in LANTERN consistently have strong performance across multiple evaluation metrics. Thus, LANTERN offers a robust benchmarking framework for LNP transfection prediction and serves as a valuable tool for accelerating lipid-based RNA delivery systems design.</description>

      <title>Real-time prediction of plasma instabilities with sparse-grid-accelerated optimized dynamic mode decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parametric data-driven reduced-order models (ROMs) that embed dependencies in a large number of input parameters are crucial for enabling many-query tasks in large-scale problems. These tasks, including design optimization, control, and uncertainty quantification, are essential for developing digital twins in real-world applications. However, standard training data generation methods are computationally prohibitive due to the curse of dimensionality, as their cost scales exponentially with the number of inputs.This paper investigates efficient training of parametric data-driven ROMs using sparse grid interpolation with (L)-Leja points, specifically targeting scenarios with higher-dimensional input parameter spaces. (L)-Leja points are nested and exhibit slow growth, resulting in sparse grids with low cardinality in low-to-medium dimensional settings, making them ideal for large-scale, computationally expensive problems. Focusing on gyrokinetic simulations of plasma micro-instabilities in fusion experiments as a representative real-world application, we construct parametric ROMs for the full 5D gyrokinetic distribution function via optimized dynamic mode decomposition (optDMD) and sparse grids based on (L)-Leja points. We perform detailed experiments in two scenarios: First, the Cyclone Base Case benchmark assesses optDMD ROM prediction capabilities beyond training time horizons and across variations in the binormal wave number. Second, for a real-world electron temperature gradient driven micro-instability simulation featuring six input parameters, we demonstrate that an accurate parametric optDMD ROM can be constructed at a cost of only $28$ high-fidelity gyrokinetic simulations thanks to sparse grids. In the broader context of fusion research, these results demonstrate the potential of sparse grid-based parametric ROMs to enable otherwise intractable many-query tasks.</description>

      <title>Noise-robust multi-fidelity surrogate modelling for parametric partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of constructing noise-robust surrogate models for quantities of interest (QoIs) arising from parametric partial differential equations (PDEs), using multi-fidelity collocation techniques; specifically, the Multi-Index Stochastic Collocation (MISC). In practical scenarios, the PDE evaluations used to build a response surface are often corrupted by numerical noise, especially for the low-fidelity models. This noise, which may originate from loose solver tolerances, coarse discretisations, or transient effects, can lead to overfitting in MISC, degrading surrogate quality through nonphysical oscillations and loss of convergence, thereby limiting its utility in downstream tasks like uncertainty quantification, optimisation, and control. To correct this behaviour, we propose an improved version of MISC that can automatically detect the presence of solver noise during the surrogate model construction and then ignore the exhausted fidelities. Our approach monitors the spectral decay of the surrogate at each iteration, identifying stagnation in the coefficient spectrum that signals the onset of noise. Once detected, the algorithm selectively halts the use of noisy fidelities, focusing computational resources on those fidelities that still provide meaningful information. The effectiveness of this approach is numerically validated on two challenging test cases: a parabolic advection--diffusion PDE with uncertain coefficients, and a parametric turbulent incompressible Navier--Stokes problem. The results showcase the accuracy and robustness of the resulting multi-fidelity surrogate and its capability to extract relevant information, even from under-resolved meshes not suitable for reliable single-fidelity computations.</description>

      <title>Willchain: Decentralized, Privacy-Preserving, Self-Executing, Digital Wills</title>

Abstract: This work presents a novel decentralized protocol for digital estate planning that integrates advances distributed computing, and cryptography. The original proof-of-concept was constructed using purely solidity contracts. Since then, we have enhanced the implementation into a layer-1 protocol that uses modern interchain communication to connect several heterogeneous chain types. A key contribution of this research is the implementation of several modern cryptographic primitives to support various forms of claims for information validation. These primitives introduce an unmatched level of privacy to the process of digital inheritance. We also demonstrate on a set of heterogeneous smart contracts, following the same spec, on each chain to serve as entry points, gateways, or bridge contracts that are invoked via a path from the will module on our protocol, to the contract. This ensures a fair and secure distribution of digital assets in accordance with the wishes of the decedent without the requirement of moving their funds. This research further extends its innovations with a user interaction model, featuring a check-in system and account abstraction process, which enhances flexibility and user-friendliness without compromising on security. By developing a dedicated permissionless blockchain that is secured by a network of validators, and interchain relayers, the proposed protocol signifies a transformation in the digital estate planning industry and illustrates the potential of blockchain technology in revolutionizing traditional legal and personal spheres. Implementing a cryptoeconomic network at the core of inheritance planning allows for unique incentive compatible economic mechanisms to be constructed.</description>

      <title>From Query to Explanation: Uni-RAG for Multi-Modal Retrieval-Augmented Learning in STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In AI-facilitated teaching, leveraging various query styles to interpret abstract educational content is crucial for delivering effective and accessible learning experiences. However, existing retrieval systems predominantly focus on natural text-image matching and lack the capacity to address the diversity and ambiguity inherent in real-world educational scenarios. To address this limitation, we develop a lightweight and efficient multi-modal retrieval module, named Uni-Retrieval, which extracts query-style prototypes and dynamically matches them with tokens from a continually updated Prompt Bank. This Prompt Bank encodes and stores domain-specific knowledge by leveraging a Mixture-of-Expert Low-Rank Adaptation (MoE-LoRA) module and can be adapted to enhance Uni-Retrieval's capability to accommodate unseen query types at test time. To enable natural language educational content generation, we integrate the original Uni-Retrieval with a compact instruction-tuned language model, forming a complete retrieval-augmented generation pipeline named Uni-RAG. Given a style-conditioned query, Uni-RAG first retrieves relevant educational materials and then generates human-readable explanations, feedback, or instructional content aligned with the learning objective. Experimental results on SER and other multi-modal benchmarks show that Uni-RAG outperforms baseline retrieval and RAG systems in both retrieval accuracy and generation quality, while maintaining low computational cost. Our framework provides a scalable, pedagogically grounded solution for intelligent educational systems, bridging retrieval and generation to support personalized, explainable, and efficient learning assistance across diverse STEM scenarios.</description>

      <title>Efficiency through Evolution, A Darwinian Approach to Agent-Based Economic Forecast Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel Darwinian Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) methodology formacroeconomic forecasting that leverages evolutionary principles to achieve remarkablecomputational efficiency and emergent realism. Unlike conventional DSGE and ABM approachesthat rely on complex behavioral rules derived from large firm analysis, our framework employssimple "common sense" rules representative of small firms directly serving final consumers. Themethodology treats households as the primary drivers of economic dynamics, with firms adaptingthrough market-based natural selection within limited interaction neighborhoods. We demonstrate that this approach, when constrained by Input-Output table structures,generates realistic economic patterns including wealth distributions, firm size distributions, andsectoral employment patterns without extensive parameter calibration. Using FIGARO Input-Output tables for 46 countries and focusing on Austria as a case study, we show that the modelreproduces empirical regularities while maintaining computational efficiency on standard laptopsrather than requiring supercomputing clusters. Key findings include: (1) emergence of realistic firm and employment distributions fromminimal behavioral assumptions, (2) accurate reproduction of the initial Social Accounting Matrixvalues through evolutionary dynamics, (3) successful calibration using only 5-6 country-specificparameters to complement the FIGARO data, and (4) computational performance enabling fullsimulations on consumer hardware. These results suggest that evolutionary ABM approaches canprovide robust policy insights by capturing decentralized market adaptations while avoiding thecomputational complexity of traditional DSGE and comprehensive ABM models.</description>

      <title>From Autonomy to Agency: Agentic Vehicles for Human-Centered Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomy, from the Greek autos (self) and nomos (law), refers to the capacity to operate according to internal rules without external control. Accordingly, autonomous vehicles (AuVs) are defined as systems capable of perceiving their environment and executing preprogrammed tasks independently of external input. However, both research and real-world deployments increasingly showcase vehicles that demonstrate behaviors beyond this definition (including the SAE levels 1 to 6), such as interaction with humans and machines, goal adaptation, contextual reasoning, external tool use, and long-term planning, particularly with the integration of large language models (LLMs) and agentic AI systems. These developments reveal a conceptual gap between technical autonomy and the broader cognitive and social capabilities needed for future human-centered mobility systems. To address this, we introduce the concept of agentic vehicles (AgVs), referring to vehicles that integrate agentic AI to reason, adapt, and interact within complex environments. This paper presents a systems-level framework to characterize AgVs, focusing on their cognitive and communicative layers and differentiating them from conventional AuVs. It synthesizes relevant advances in agentic AI, robotics, multi-agent systems, and human-machine interaction, and highlights how agentic AI, through high-level reasoning and tool use, can function not merely as computational tools but as interactive agents embedded in mobility ecosystems. The paper concludes by identifying key challenges in the development and governance of AgVs, including safety, real-time control, public acceptance, ethical alignment, and regulatory frameworks.</description>

      <title>Predicting Tweet Posting Behavior on Citizen Security: A Hawkes Point Process Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03378v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Perception of Security (PoS) refers to people's opinions about security or insecurity in a place or situation. While surveys have traditionally been the primary means to capture such perceptions, they need to be improved in their ability to offer real-time monitoring or predictive insights into future security perceptions. Recent evidence suggests that social network content can provide complementary insights into quantifying these perceptions. However, the challenge of accurately predicting these perceptions, with the capacity to anticipate them, still needs to be explored. This article introduces an innovative approach to PoS within short time frames using social network data. Our model incorporates external factors that influence the publication and reposting of content related to security perceptions. Our results demonstrate that this proposed model achieves competitive predictive performance and maintains a high degree of interpretability regarding the factors influencing security perceptions. This research contributes to understanding how temporal patterns and external factors impact the anticipation of security perceptions, providing valuable insights for proactive security planning.</description>

      <title>Collaborative and parametric insurance on the Ethereum blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a blockchain-based insurance scheme that integrates parametric and collaborative elements. A pool of investors, referred to as surplus providers, locks funds in a smart contract, enabling blockchain users to underwrite parametric insurance contracts. These contracts automatically trigger compensation when predefined conditions are met. The collaborative aspect is embodied in the generation of tokens, which are distributed to surplus providers. These tokens represent each participant's share of the surplus and grant voting rights for management decisions. The smart contract is developed in Solidity, a high-level programming language for the Ethereum blockchain, and deployed on the Sepolia testnet, with data processing and analysis conducted using Python. In addition, open-source code is provided and main research challenges are identified, so that further research can be carried out to overcome limitations of this first proof of concept.</description>

      <title>An approach to the timetabling problem in deregulated railway markets based on metaheuristic algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The train timetabling problem in liberalized railway markets represents a challenge to the coordination between infrastructure managers and railway undertakings. Efficient scheduling is critical to maximizing infrastructure capacity and utilization while adhering as closely as possible to the requests of railway undertakings. These objectives ultimately contribute to maximizing the infrastructure manager's revenues. This paper sets out a modular simulation framework to reproduce the dynamics of deregulated railway systems. Ten metaheuristic algorithms using the MEALPY Python library are then evaluated in order to optimize train schedules in the liberalized Spanish railway market. In addition, an analysis of the scalability of the problem has been carried out by comparing the results with those obtained with a classical mathematical model such as SCIP in Pyomo. The results show that the Genetic Algorithm outperforms others in revenue optimization, convergence speed, and schedule adherence. Alternatives, such as Particle Swarm Optimization and Ant Colony Optimization Continuous, show slower convergence and higher variability. The results emphasize the trade-off between scheduling more trains and adhering to requested times, providing insights into solving complex scheduling problems in deregulated railway systems.</description>

      <title>FinBERT2: A Specialized Bidirectional Encoder for Bridging the Gap in Finance-Specific Deployment of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In natural language processing (NLP), the focus has shifted from encoder-only tiny language models like BERT to decoder-only large language models(LLMs) such as GPT-3. However, LLMs' practical application in the financial sector has revealed three limitations: (1) LLMs often perform worse than fine-tuned BERT on discriminative tasks despite costing much higher computational resources, such as market sentiment analysis in financial reports; (2) Application on generative tasks heavily relies on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) methods to provide current and specialized information, with general retrievers showing suboptimal performance on domain-specific retrieval tasks; (3) There are additional inadequacies in other feature-based scenarios, such as topic modeling. We introduce FinBERT2, a specialized bidirectional encoder pretrained on a high-quality, financial-specific corpus of 32b tokens. This represents the largest known Chinese financial pretraining corpus for models of this parameter size. As a better backbone, FinBERT2 can bridge the gap in the financial-specific deployment of LLMs through the following achievements: (1) Discriminative fine-tuned models (Fin-Labelers) outperform other (Fin)BERT variants by 0.4%-3.3% and leading LLMs by 9.7%-12.3% on average across five financial classification tasks. (2) Contrastive fine-tuned models (Fin-Retrievers) outperform both open-source (e.g., +6.8\% avg improvement over BGE-base-zh) and proprietary (e.g., +4.2\% avg improvement over OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) embedders across five financial retrieval tasks; (3) Building on FinBERT2 variants, we construct the Fin-TopicModel, which enables superior clustering and topic representation for financial titles. Our work revisits financial BERT models through comparative analysis with contemporary LLMs and offers practical insights for effectively utilizing FinBERT in the LLMs era.</description>
