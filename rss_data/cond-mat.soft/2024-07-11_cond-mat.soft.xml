      <title>Equilibrium states of a liquid bridge between flexible sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study equilibrium states of a drop between flexible sheets clamped on both ends. Revisiting first the case of parallel sheets, we find multiple equilibria which we classify in a parameter space. In solution branching diagrams we identify hysteresis cycles and folds indicating abrupt transitions, yet not necessarily leading to channel collapse. Between nonparallel sheets, a drop can stay in equilibrium away from the ends even when the liquid is totally wetting, which is impossible between nonparallel rigid plates. We also show that nonparallel sheets can delay or prevent collapse in comparison to straight channels, suggesting thus a mechanism that protects slender structures inside micro-devices from damage by surface tension.</description>

      <title>Modelling brain tissue elasticity with the Ogden model and an alternative family of constitutive models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ogden model is often considered as a standard model in the literature for application to the deformation of brain tissue. Here we show that, in some of those applications, the use of the Ogden model leads to non-convexity of the strain-energy function and mis-prediction of the correct concavity of the experimental stress-stretch curves over a range of the deformation domain. By contrast, we propose a family of models which provides a favourable fit to the considered datasets while remaining free from the highlighted shortcomings of the Ogden model. While, as we discuss, those shortcomings might be due to the artefacts of the testing protocols, the proposed family of models proves impervious to such artefacts.</description>

      <title>Membrane protein clustering from tension and multibody interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The point-curvature model for membrane protein inclusions is shown to capture multibody interactions very well. Using this model, we find that the interplay between membrane tension and multibody interactions results in a collective attraction of oppositely curved inclusions tending to form antiferromagnetic structures with a square lattice. This attraction can produce a phase separation between curved and non-curved proteins, resulting in the clustering of curved proteins. We also show that the many-body repulsion between identical curved proteins is enhanced by membrane tension. This can lead to the dissolution of clusters stabilized by short-range forces when the tension is increased. These new phenomena are biologically relevant and could be investigated experimentally</description>

      <title>Theory for the Anomalous Phase Behavior of Inertial Active Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to equilibrium systems, inertia can profoundly impact the phase behavior of active systems. This has been made particularly evident in recent years, with motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) exhibiting several intriguing dependencies on translational inertia. Here we report extensive simulations characterizing the phase behavior of inertial active matter and develop a mechanical theory for the complete phase diagram without appealing to equilibrium notions. Our theory qualitatively captures all aspects of liquid-gas coexistence, including the critical value of inertia above which MIPS ceases. Notably, our findings highlight that particle softness, and not inertia, is responsible for the MIPS reentrance effect at the center of a proposed active refrigeration cycle.</description>

      <title>3D E-textile for Exercise Physiology and Clinical Maternal Health Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic textiles (E-textiles) offer great wearing comfort and unobtrusiveness, thus holding potential for next-generation health monitoring wearables. However, the practical implementation is hampered by challenges associated with poor signal quality, substantial motion artifacts, durability for long-term usage, and non-ideal user experience. Here, we report a cost-effective E-textile system that features 3D microfiber-based electrodes for greatly increasing the surface area. The soft and fluffy conductive microfibers disperse freely and securely adhere to the skin, achieving a low impedance at the electrode-skin interface even in the absence of gel. A superhydrophobic fluorinated self-assembled monolayer was deposited on the E-textile surface to render it waterproof while retaining the electrical conductivity. Equipped with a custom-designed motion-artifact canceling wireless data recording circuit, the E-textile system could be integrated into a variety of smart garments for exercise physiology and health monitoring applications. Real-time multimodal electrophysiological signal monitoring, including electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG), was successfully carried out during strenuous cycling and even underwater swimming activities. Furthermore, a multi-channel E-textile was developed and implemented in clinical patient studies for simultaneous real-time monitoring of maternal ECG and uterine EMG signals, incorporating spatial-temporal potential mapping capabilities.</description>

      <title>Force-dependence of the rigid-body motion for an arbitrarily shaped particle in a forced, incompressible Stokes flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When a particle moves in a Newtonian flow at low Reynolds number, inertia is irrelevant and a linear relationship exists between velocities and forces. For incompressible flows, any force distribution $\mathbf{f}(\mathbf{r})$ acting in the fluid bulk induces flow and motion only through its solenoidal component. For force distributions that are spatially localized (i.e., vanish sufficiently fast at infinity), we derive the representation of the rigid body motion as an explicit linear functional of $\nabla\times\mathbf{f}$, which complements the usual representation in terms of $\mathbf{f}$. We illustrate the utility of this alternative representation, which has the advantage of having the incompressibility constraint built-in, in avoiding certain ambiguities that arise, e.g., when implementing approximations for swimmers.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear vibration and stability of a dielectric elastomer balloon based on a strain-stiffening model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limiting chain extensibility is a characteristic that plays a vital role in the stretching of highly elastic materials. The Gent model has been widely used to capture this behaviour, as it performs very well in fitting stress-stretch data in simple tension, and involves two material parameters only. Recently, Anssari-Benam and Bucchi [Int. J. Non. Linear. Mech. 2021, 128, 103626] introduced a different form of generalised neo-Hookean model, focusing on the molecular structure of elastomers, and showed that their model encompasses all ranges of deformations, performing better than the Gent model in many respects, also with only two parameters. Here we investigate the nonlinear vibration and stability of a dielectric elastomer balloon modelled by that strain energy function. We derive the deformation field in spherical coordinates and the governing equations by the Euler-Lagrange method, assuming that the balloon retains its spherical symmetry as it inflates. We consider in turn that the balloon is under two types of voltages, a pure DC voltage and a DC voltage superimposed on an AC voltage. We analyse the dynamic response of the balloon and identify the influential parameters in the model. We find that the molecular structure of the material, as tracked by the number of segments in a single chain, can control the instability and the pull-in/snap-through critical voltage, as well as chaos and quasi-periodicity. The main result is that balloons made of materials exhibiting early strain-stiffening effects are more stable and less prone to generate chaotic nonlinear vibrations than softer materials, such as those modelled by the neo-Hookean strain-energy density function.</description>

      <title>Swimming Efficiently by Wrapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.04243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single flagellated bacteria are ubiquitous in nature. They exhibit various swimming modes using their flagella to explore complex surroundings such as soil and porous polymer networks. Some single-flagellated bacteria swim with two distinct modes, one with its flagellum extended away from its body and another with its flagellum wrapped around it. The wrapped mode has been observed when bacteria swim under tight confinements or in highly viscous polymeric melts. In this study we investigate the hydrodynamics of these two modes inside a circular pipe. We find that the wrapped mode is slower than the extended mode in bulk but more efficient under strong confinement due to a hydrodynamic increase of its flagellum translation-rotation coupling and an Archimedes' screw-like configuration that helps to move the fluid along the pipe.</description>

      <title>Thermotropic reentrant isotropy and antiferroelectricity in the ferroelectric nematic realm: Comparing RM734 and DIO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17400v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The current intense study of ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals was initiated by the observation of the same ferroelectric nematic phase in two independently discovered organic rod-shaped mesogenic compounds, RM734 and DIO. We recently reported that the compound RM734 also exhibits a monotropic, low-temperature, antiferroelectric phase having reentrant isotropic symmetry (the $I_A$ phase), the formation of which is facilitated to a remarkable degree by doping with small (below $1\%$) amounts of the ionic liquid ${\rm BMIM-PF}_6$. Here we report similar phenomenology in DIO, showing that this reentrant isotropic behavior is not only a property of RM734 but is rather a more general, material-independent feature of ferroelectric nematic mesogens. We find that the reentrant isotropic phases observed in RM734 and DIO are similar but not identical, adding two new phases to the ferroelectric nematic realm. The two $I_A$ phases exhibit similar, strongly peaked, diffuse x-ray scattering in the WAXS range $(1&lt;q&lt;2 \, \AA^{-1})$ indicative of a distinctive mode of short-ranged, side-by-side molecular packing. The scattering of the $I_A$ phases at small $q$ is quite different in the two materials, however, with RM734 exhibiting a strong, single, diffuse peak at $q \sim 0.08 \,\AA ^{-1}$ indicating mesoscale modulation with $\sim 80 \,\AA$ periodicity, and DIO a sharper diffuse peak at $q \sim 0.27 \,\AA ^{-1} \sim (2\pi/{\rm molecular length})$, with second and third harmonics, indicating that in the $I_A$ phase of DIO, short-ranged molecular positional correlation is smectic layer-like.</description>

      <title>Large FCC colloidal crystals under microgravity</title>

Abstract: Here we report the results of microgravity experiments performed on the International Space Station (ISS) to study crystallized, metastable colloidal liquids in the region of the hard sphere phase diagram that has been found to be glassy on Earth. Using confocal microscopy, we observed the self-assembly of high density, three-dimensional colloidal crystals from micron-size hard spheres suspended within a fluid medium. The largest face-centered cubic (FCC) phase measured 27 x 1.5 x 0.15 mm. From a practical aspect, the fact that a single, topological defect-free FCC colloidal crystal can be grown in microgravity and the crystal returned from orbit suggests new routes for manufacturing colloidal devices, particularly optical elements in space.</description>

      <title>Quasi-one-dimensional hydrogen bonding in nanoconfined ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bernal-Fowler ice rules stipulate that each water molecule in an ice crystal should form four hydrogen bonds. However, in extreme or constrained conditions, the arrangement of water molecules deviates from conventional ice rules, resulting in properties significantly different from bulk water. In this study, we employ machine learning-driven first-principles simulations to identify a new stabilization mechanism in nanoconfined ice phases beyond conventional ice rules. Instead of forming four hydrogen bonds, nanoconfined crystalline ice can form a quasi-one-dimensional hydrogen-bonded structure that exhibits only two hydrogen bonds per water molecule. These structures consist of strongly hydrogen-bonded linear chains of water molecules that zig-zag along one dimension, stabilized by van der Waals interactions that stack these chains along the other dimension. The unusual interplay of hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions in nanoconfined ice results in atypical proton behavior such as potential ferroelectric behavior, low dielectric response, and long-range proton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Irreversible Monte Carlo algorithms for hard disk glasses: from event-chain to collective swaps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equilibrium sampling of the configuration space in disordered systems requires algorithms that bypass the glassy slowing down of the physical dynamics. Irreversible Monte Carlo algorithms breaking detailed balance successfully accelerate sampling in some systems. We first implement an irreversible event-chain Monte Carlo algorithm in a model of polydisperse hard disks. The effect of collective translational moves marginally affects the dynamics and results in a modest speedup that decreases with density. We then propose an irreversible algorithm performing collective particle swaps which outperforms all known Monte Carlo algorithms. We show that these collective swaps can also be used to prepare very dense jammed packings of disks.</description>

      <title>Link to Densify: Topological Transitions and Origin of Hysteresis During the (De)Compression of Amorphous Ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this Letter we study the phase transition between amorphous ices and the nature of the hysteresis cycle separating them. We discover that a topological transition takes place as the system transforms from low-density amorphous ice (LDA) at low pressures, to high-density amorphous ice (HDA) at high pressures. Specifically, we uncover that the hydrogen bond network (HBN) displays qualitatively different topologies in the LDA and HDA phases: the former characterised by disentangled loop motifs, while the latter displaying topologically complex and metastable Hopf-linked and knotted configurations. At the phase transition, the transient opening of the HBN topological motifs yields mechanical fragility on the macroscale. Our results provide a detailed microscopic description of the topological nature of the phase transition and the hysteresis cycle between amorphous ices. We argue that the topological transition discovered in this work may not only improve our understanding of amorphous ices but represent a generic mechanism for the densification of network-forming materials.</description>
