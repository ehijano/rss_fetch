      <title>A new social welfare function with a number of desirable properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By relaxing the dominating set in three ways (e.g., from "each member beats every non-member" to "each member beats or ties every non-member, with an additional requirement that at least one member beat every non-member"), we propose a new social welfare function, which satisfies a number of desirable properties including Condorcet winner principle, Condorcet loser principle, strong Gehrlein-stability (hence Smith set principle), anonymity, neutrality, weak Pareto, strong Pareto, non-dictatorship, and [independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) when the pairwise majority relation is an ordering on the alternative set]. If the pairwise majority relation is complete and transitive, the proposed method yields a collective preference relation that coincides with the input majority relation. It thus shares the same collective preference function on the dichotomous domain with the approval voting and the majority voting. It runs in polynomial time and thus possesses a competitive advantage over a number of computationally intractable voting rules such as the Dodgson's rule, the Kemeny's rule, the Slater's rule, the Banks rule, and the Schwartz's tournament equilibrium set (TEQ) rule. When it is used in tournaments, its winner belongs to the uncovered set, the top cycle set, the Smith set, and the Schwartz set. In addition, in a tournament where the number of alternatives is not more than 4, its winner set is a subset, sometimes proper, of the Copeland winner set. Whether this attractive argument is still valid in four-more-alternative tournaments remains an open question.</description>

      <title>Endogenous Fragility in Opaque Supply Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the role of supply chain unobservability in generating endogenously fragile production networks. In a simple production game, in which firms need to multisource to hedge against suppliers' risk under unobservability, firms underdiversify vis-a-vis the social optimum. The unobservability of suppliers' relations is the driver behind this. In production networks where upstream risk is highly correlated and supplier relationships are not observable, the marginal risk reduction of adding an additional supplier is low, because this additional supplier's risk is likely to be correlated to that of existing suppliers. This channel reduces firm incentives to diversify, which gives rise to inefficiently fragile production networks. By solving the social planner problem, I show that, if the risk reduction experienced downstream resulting from upstream diversification were to be internalised by upstream firms, endogenous production networks would be resilient to most levels of risk. Furthermore, I show that the opaqueness of the supply chain yields less fragile but more inefficient production networks. Despite its stylised form,the model identifies the trade-off firms face when diversifying risk and isolates the mechanism that aggregates these decisions into a production network. Furthermore, it maps the conditions of the trade-off, such as expected profits of the firm or the pairing costs, to the properties of the production network.</description>

      <title>Single-token vs Two-token Blockchain Tokenomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider long-term equilibria that arise in the tokenomics design of proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain systems that comprise of users and validators, both striving to maximize their own utilities. Validators are system maintainers who get rewarded with tokens for performing the work necessary for the system to function properly, while users compete and pay with such tokens for getting a desired system service level.
  We study how the system service provision and suitable rewards schemes together can lead to equilibria with desirable characteristics (1) viability: the system keeps parties engaged, (2) decentralization: multiple validators are participating, (3) stability: the price path of the underlying token used to transact with the system does not change widely over time, and (4) feasibility: the mechanism is easy to implement as a smart contract, i.e., it does not require fiat reserves on-chain for buy back of tokens or to perform bookkeeping of exponentially growing token holdings. Furthermore, we consider both the common single-token PoS model and a less widely used two-token approach (that roughly, utilizes one token for the users to pay the transaction fees and a different token for the validators to participate in the PoS protocol and get rewarded). Our approach demonstrates, for the first time to our knowledge, concrete advantages of the two-token approach in terms of the ability of the mechanism to reach equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Economics and the Second-Order Economic Theory. What is it?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.04566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The economic and financial variables of economic agents determine macroeconomic variables. Current models consider agents' variables that are determined by the sums of values and volumes of agents' trades during some time interval {\Delta}. We call them first-order economic variables. We describe how the volatilities and correlations of market trade values and volumes determine price volatility. We argue that such a link requests consideration of agents' economic variables of the second order that are composed of sums of squares of agents' transactions during {\Delta}. Almost any variable of the first order should be complemented by its second-order pair. Respectively, the sums of agents' second-order variables introduce macroeconomic variables of the second order. The description of the first- and second-order macroeconomic variables establishes the subject of second-order economic theory. We highlight that the complexity of second-order economic theory essentially restricts any hopes for precise predictions of price probability and, at best, could provide estimates of price volatility. That limits the predictions of price probability to Gauss's approximations only.</description>
