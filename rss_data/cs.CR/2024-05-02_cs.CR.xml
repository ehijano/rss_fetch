      <title>Research and application of artificial intelligence based webshell detection model: A literature review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Webshell, as the "culprit" behind numerous network attacks, is one of the research hotspots in the field of cybersecurity. However, the complexity, stealthiness, and confusing nature of webshells pose significant challenges to the corresponding detection schemes. With the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology, researchers have started to apply different intelligent algorithms and neural network architectures to the task of webshell detection. However, the related research still lacks a systematic and standardized methodological process, which is confusing and redundant. Therefore, following the development timeline, we carefully summarize the progress of relevant research in this field, dividing it into three stages: Start Stage, Initial Development Stage, and In-depth Development Stage. We further elaborate on the main characteristics and core algorithms of each stage. In addition, we analyze the pain points and challenges that still exist in this field and predict the future development trend of this field from our point of view. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that details the research related to AI-based webshell detection. It is also hoped that this paper can provide detailed technical information for more researchers interested in AI-based webshell detection tasks.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Spectre-PHT using Speculation Barriers in Linux BPF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-performance IO demands low-overhead communication between user- and kernel space. This demand can no longer be fulfilled by traditional system calls. Linux's extended Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) avoids user-/kernel transitions by just-in-time compiling user-provided bytecode and executing it in kernel mode with near-native speed. To still isolate BPF programs from the kernel, they are statically analyzed for memory- and type-safety, which imposes some restrictions but allows for good expressiveness and high performance. However, to mitigate the Spectre vulnerabilities disclosed in 2018, defenses which reject potentially-dangerous programs had to be deployed. We find that this affects 24% to 54% of programs in a dataset with 844 real-world BPF programs from popular open-source projects. To solve this, users are forced to disable the defenses to continue using the programs, which puts the entire system at risk.
  To enable secure and expressive untrusted Linux kernel extensions, we propose Berrify, an enhancement to the kernel's Spectre defenses that reduces the number of BPF application programs rejected from 54% to zero. We measure Berrify's overhead for all mainstream performance-sensitive applications of BPF (i.e., event tracing, profiling, and packet processing) and find that it improves significantly upon the status-quo where affected BPF programs are either unusable or enable transient execution attacks on the kernel.</description>

      <title>Rolling in the Shadows: Analyzing the Extraction of MEV Across Layer-2 Rollups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of decentralized finance has transformed asset trading on the blockchain, making traditional financial instruments more accessible while also introducing a series of exploitative economic practices known as Maximal Extractable Value (MEV). Concurrently, decentralized finance has embraced rollup-based Layer-2 solutions to facilitate asset trading at reduced transaction costs compared to Layer-1 solutions such as Ethereum. However, rollups lack a public mempool like Ethereum, making the extraction of MEV more challenging. In this paper, we investigate the prevalence and impact of MEV on Ethereum and prominent rollups such as Arbitrum, Optimism, and zkSync over a nearly three-year period. Our analysis encompasses various metrics including volume, profits, costs, competition, and response time to MEV opportunities. We discover that MEV is widespread on rollups, with trading volume comparable to Ethereum. We also find that, although MEV costs are lower on rollups, profits are also significantly lower compared to Ethereum. Additionally, we examine the prevalence of sandwich attacks on rollups. While our findings did not detect any sandwiching activity on popular rollups, we did identify the potential for cross-layer sandwich attacks facilitated by transactions that are sent across rollups and Ethereum. Consequently, we propose and evaluate the feasibility of three novel attacks that exploit cross-layer transactions, revealing that attackers could have already earned approximately 2 million USD through cross-layer sandwich attacks.</description>

      <title>Constrained Decoding for Secure Code Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have been increasingly used by developers to boost productivity, but they often generate vulnerable code. Thus, there is an urgent need to ensure that code generated by Code LLMs is correct and secure. Previous research has primarily focused on generating secure code, overlooking the fact that secure code also needs to be correct. This oversight can lead to a false sense of security. Currently, the community lacks a method to measure actual progress in this area, and we need solutions that address both security and correctness of code generation.
  This paper introduces a new benchmark, CodeGuard+, along with two new metrics, secure-pass@k and secure@$k_{\text{pass}}$, to measure Code LLMs' ability to generate both secure and correct code. Using our new evaluation methods, we show that the state-of-the-art defense technique, prefix tuning, may not be as strong as previously believed, since it generates secure code but sacrifices functional correctness. We also demonstrate that different decoding methods significantly affect the security of Code LLMs.
  Furthermore, we explore a new defense direction: constrained decoding for secure code generation. We propose new constrained decoding techniques to generate code that satisfies security and correctness constraints simultaneously. Our results reveal that constrained decoding is more effective than prefix tuning to improve the security of Code LLMs, without requiring a specialized training dataset. Moreover, constrained decoding can be used together with prefix tuning to further improve the security of Code LLMs.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Release of Israel's National Registry of Live Births</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In February 2024, Israel's Ministry of Health released microdata of live births in Israel in 2014. The dataset is based on Israel's National Registry of Live Births and offers substantial value in multiple areas, such as scientific research and policy-making. At the same time, the data was processed so as to protect the privacy of 2014's mothers and newborns. The release was co-designed by the authors together with stakeholders from both inside and outside the Ministry of Health. This paper presents the methodology used to obtain that release. It also describes the considerations involved in choosing the methodology and the process followed.
  We used differential privacy as our formal measure of the privacy loss incurred by the released dataset. More concretely, we prove that the released dataset is differentially private with privacy loss budget \varepsilon = 9.98. We extensively used the private selection algorithm of Liu and Talwar (STOC 2019) to bundle together multiple steps such as data transformation, model generation algorithm, hyperparameter selection, and evaluation. The model generation algorithm selected was PrivBayes (Zhang et al., SIGMOD 2014). The evaluation was based on a list of acceptance criteria, which were also disclosed only approximately so as to provide an overall differential privacy guarantee. We also discuss concrete challenges and barriers that appear relevant to the next steps of this pilot project, as well as to future differentially private releases.</description>

      <title>The Reversing Machine: Reconstructing Memory Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing anti-malware software and reverse engineering toolkits struggle with stealthy sub-OS rootkits due to limitations of run-time kernel-level monitoring. A malicious kernel-level driver can bypass OS-level anti-virus mechanisms easily. Although static analysis of such malware is possible, obfuscation and packing techniques complicate offline analysis. Moreover, current dynamic analyzers suffer from virtualization performance overhead and create detectable traces that allow modern malware to evade them.
  To address these issues, we present \textit{The Reversing Machine} (TRM), a new hypervisor-based memory introspection design for reverse engineering, reconstructing memory offsets, and fingerprinting evasive and obfuscated user-level and kernel-level malware. TRM proposes two novel techniques that enable efficient and transparent analysis of evasive malware: hooking a binary using suspended process creation for hypervisor-based memory introspection, and leveraging Mode-Based Execution Control (MBEC) to detect user/kernel mode transitions and memory access patterns. Unlike existing malware detection environments, TRM can extract full memory traces in user and kernel spaces and hook the entire target memory map to reconstruct arrays, structures within the operating system, and possible rootkits.
  We perform TRM-assisted reverse engineering of kernel-level structures and show that it can speed up manual reverse engineering by 75\% on average. We obfuscate known malware with the latest packing tools and successfully perform similarity detection. Furthermore, we demonstrate a real-world attack by deploying a modified rootkit onto a driver that bypasses state-of-the-art security auditing tools. We show that TRM can detect each threat and that, out of 24 state-of-the-art AV solutions, only TRM can detect the most advanced threats.</description>

      <title>FPGA Digital Dice using Pseudo Random Number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this project is to design a digital dice that displays dice numbers in real-time. The number is generated by a pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) using XORshift algorithm that is implemented in Verilog HDL on an FPGA. The digital dice is equipped with tilt sensor, display, power management circuit, and rechargeable battery hosted in a 3D printed dice casing. By shaking the digital dice, the tilt sensor signal produces a seed for the PRNG. This digital dice demonstrates a set of possible random numbers of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 20, 100 that simulate the number of dice sides. The kit is named SUTDicey.</description>

      <title>Metric geometry of the privacy-utility tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic data are an attractive concept to enable privacy in data sharing. A fundamental question is how similar the privacy-preserving synthetic data are compared to the true data. Using metric privacy, an effective generalization of differential privacy beyond the discrete setting, we raise the problem of characterizing the optimal privacy-accuracy tradeoff by the metric geometry of the underlying space. We provide a partial solution to this problem in terms of the "entropic scale", a quantity that captures the multiscale geometry of a metric space via the behavior of its packing numbers. We illustrate the applicability of our privacy-accuracy tradeoff framework via a diverse set of examples of metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Certified Adversarial Robustness of Machine Learning-based Malware Detectors via (De)Randomized Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based malware detection systems are vulnerable to adversarial EXEmples - carefully-crafted malicious programs that evade detection with minimal perturbation. As such, the community is dedicating effort to develop mechanisms to defend against adversarial EXEmples. However, current randomized smoothing-based defenses are still vulnerable to attacks that inject blocks of adversarial content. In this paper, we introduce a certifiable defense against patch attacks that guarantees, for a given executable and an adversarial patch size, no adversarial EXEmple exist. Our method is inspired by (de)randomized smoothing which provides deterministic robustness certificates. During training, a base classifier is trained using subsets of continguous bytes. At inference time, our defense splits the executable into non-overlapping chunks, classifies each chunk independently, and computes the final prediction through majority voting to minimize the influence of injected content. Furthermore, we introduce a preprocessing step that fixes the size of the sections and headers to a multiple of the chunk size. As a consequence, the injected content is confined to an integer number of chunks without tampering the other chunks containing the real bytes of the input examples, allowing us to extend our certified robustness guarantees to content insertion attacks. We perform an extensive ablation study, by comparing our defense with randomized smoothing-based defenses against a plethora of content manipulation attacks and neural network architectures. Results show that our method exhibits unmatched robustness against strong content-insertion attacks, outperforming randomized smoothing-based defenses in the literature.</description>

      <title>Inferring State Machine from the Protocol Implementation via Large Langeuage Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State machines play a pivotal role in augmenting the efficacy of protocol analyzing to unveil more vulnerabilities. However, the task of inferring state machines from network protocol implementations presents significant challenges. Traditional methods based on dynamic analysis often overlook crucial state transitions due to limited coverage, while static analysis faces difficulties with complex code structures and behaviors. To address these limitations, we propose an innovative state machine inference approach powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). Utilizing text-embedding technology, this method allows LLMs to dissect and analyze the intricacies of protocol implementation code. Through targeted prompt engineering, we systematically identify and infer the underlying state machines. Our evaluation across six protocol implementations demonstrates the method's high efficacy, achieving an accuracy rate exceeding 90% and successfully delineating differences on state machines among various implementations of the same protocol. Importantly, integrating this approach with protocol fuzzing has notably enhanced AFLNet's code coverage by 10% over RFCNLP, showcasing the considerable potential of LLMs in advancing network protocol security analysis. Our proposed method not only marks a significant step forward in accurate state machine inference but also opens new avenues for improving the security and reliability of protocol implementations.</description>

      <title>Trust Driven On-Demand Scheme for Client Deployment in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Containerization technology plays a crucial role in Federated Learning (FL) setups, expanding the pool of potential clients and ensuring the availability of specific subsets for each learning iteration. However, doubts arise about the trustworthiness of devices deployed as clients in FL scenarios, especially when container deployment processes are involved. Addressing these challenges is important, particularly in managing potentially malicious clients capable of disrupting the learning process or compromising the entire model. In our research, we are motivated to integrate a trust element into the client selection and model deployment processes within our system architecture. This is a feature lacking in the initial client selection and deployment mechanism of the On-Demand architecture. We introduce a trust mechanism, named "Trusted-On-Demand-FL", which establishes a relationship of trust between the server and the pool of eligible clients. Utilizing Docker in our deployment strategy enables us to monitor and validate participant actions effectively, ensuring strict adherence to agreed-upon protocols while strengthening defenses against unauthorized data access or tampering. Our simulations rely on a continuous user behavior dataset, deploying an optimization model powered by a genetic algorithm to efficiently select clients for participation. By assigning trust values to individual clients and dynamically adjusting these values, combined with penalizing malicious clients through decreased trust scores, our proposed framework identifies and isolates harmful clients. This approach not only reduces disruptions to regular rounds but also minimizes instances of round dismissal, Consequently enhancing both system stability and security.</description>

Abstract: Computing is still under a significant threat from ransomware, which necessitates prompt action to prevent it. Ransomware attacks can have a negative impact on how smart grids, particularly digital substations. In addition to examining a ransomware detection method using artificial intelligence (AI), this paper offers a ransomware attack modeling technique that targets the disrupted operation of a digital substation. The first, binary data is transformed into image data and fed into the convolution neural network model using federated learning.

      <title>On the Potential of RIS in the Context of PLA in Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Re-configurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) technology has proven itself a promising candidate for the next generation of wireless networks through its enhanced performance in terms of throughput, spectral, and energy efficiency. However, the broadcast nature of RIS-assisted wireless communication makes it vulnerable to malicious attacks at the physical layer. On the other hand, physical layer authentication is an emerging area in the security domain to thwart different attacks such as cloning, spoofing, and impersonation by using the random features of the physical layer. In this paper, we investigate RIS-assisted wireless communication systems to unlock the potential of using RIS for physical layer authentication (PLA). Specifically, we exploit two distinct features of the physical layer: pathloss and channel impulse response (CIR) for PLA in RIS-assisted wireless communication. We construct hypothesis tests for the estimated features and derive the closed-form errors' expressions. Further, we chose the critical error, i.e., missed detection as our objective function for minimization by optimizing the phase shift of the RIS pannel. We compare the performance of our proposed mechanisms with baseline mechanisms which are PLA schemes using the same features but with no RIS assistance. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate our proposed schemes using performance metrics such as the probability of false alarm (PFA), the probability of missed detection (PMD), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The results demonstrate the significant positive impact of RIS on PLA, as it effectively reduces PMD values to zero when determining the optimal phase shift.</description>

      <title>Modeling Linear and Non-linear Layers: An MILP Approach Towards Finding Differential and Impossible Differential Propagations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetric key cryptography stands as a fundamental cornerstone in ensuring security within contemporary electronic communication frameworks. The cryptanalysis of classical symmetric key ciphers involves traditional methods and techniques aimed at breaking or analyzing these cryptographic systems. In the evaluation of new ciphers, the resistance against linear and differential cryptanalysis is commonly a key design criterion. The wide trail design technique for block ciphers facilitates the demonstration of security against linear and differential cryptanalysis. Assessing the scheme's security against differential attacks often involves determining the minimum number of active SBoxes for all rounds of a cipher. The propagation characteristics of a cryptographic component, such as an SBox, can be expressed using Boolean functions. Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) proves to be a valuable technique for solving Boolean functions. We formulate a set of inequalities to model a Boolean function, which is subsequently solved by an MILP solver. To efficiently model a Boolean function and select a minimal set of inequalities, two key challenges must be addressed. We propose algorithms to address the second challenge, aiming to find more optimized linear and non-linear components. Our approaches are applied to modeling SBoxes (up to six bits) and EXOR operations with any number of inputs. Additionally, we introduce an MILP-based automatic tool for exploring differential and impossible differential propagations within a cipher. The tool is successfully applied to five lightweight block ciphers: Lilliput, GIFT64, SKINNY64, Klein, and MIBS.</description>

      <title>PackVFL: Efficient HE Packing for Vertical Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an essential tool of secure distributed machine learning, vertical federated learning (VFL) based on homomorphic encryption (HE) suffers from severe efficiency problems due to data inflation and time-consuming operations. To this core, we propose PackVFL, an efficient VFL framework based on packed HE (PackedHE), to accelerate the existing HE-based VFL algorithms. PackVFL packs multiple cleartexts into one ciphertext and supports single-instruction-multiple-data (SIMD)-style parallelism. We focus on designing a high-performant matrix multiplication (MatMult) method since it takes up most of the ciphertext computation time in HE-based VFL. Besides, devising the MatMult method is also challenging for PackedHE because a slight difference in the packing way could predominantly affect its computation and communication costs. Without domain-specific design, directly applying SOTA MatMult methods is hard to achieve optimal.
  Therefore, we make a three-fold design: 1) we systematically explore the current design space of MatMult and quantify the complexity of existing approaches to provide guidance; 2) we propose a hybrid MatMult method according to the unique characteristics of VFL; 3) we adaptively apply our hybrid method in representative VFL algorithms, leveraging distinctive algorithmic properties to further improve efficiency. As the batch size, feature dimension and model size of VFL scale up to large sizes, PackVFL consistently delivers enhanced performance. Empirically, PackVFL propels existing VFL algorithms to new heights, achieving up to a 51.52X end-to-end speedup. This represents a substantial 34.51X greater speedup compared to the direct application of SOTA MatMult methods.</description>

      <title>JNI Global References Are Still Vulnerable: Attacks and Defenses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: System services and resources in Android are accessed through IPC based mechanisms. Previous research has demonstrated that they are vulnerable to the denial-of-service attack (DoS attack). For instance, the JNI global reference (JGR), which is widely used by system services, can be exhausted to cause the system reboot (hence the name JGRE attack). Even though the Android team tries to fix the problem by enforcing security checks, we find that it is still possible to construct a JGR exhaustion DoS attack in the latest Android system.
  In this paper, we propose a new JGR exhaustion DoS attack, which is effective in different Android versions, including the latest one (i.e., Android 10). Specifically, we developed JGREAnalyzer, a tool that can systematically detect JGR vulnerable services APIs via a call graph analysis and a forwarding reachability analysis. We applied this tool to different Android versions and found multiple vulnerabilities. In particular, among 148 system services in Android 10, 12 of them have 21 vulnerabilities. Among them, 9 can be successfully exploited without any permissions. We further analyze the root cause of the vulnerabilities and propose a new defense to mitigate the JGRE attack by restricting resource consumption via global reference counting.</description>

      <title>Byzantine-Secure Relying Party for Resilient RPKI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To protect against prefix hijacks, Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) has been standardized. To enjoy the security guarantees of RPKI validation, networks need to install a new component, the relying party validator, which fetches and validates RPKI objects and provides them to border routers. However, recent work shows that relying parties experience failures when retrieving RPKI objects and are vulnerable to attacks, all of which can disable RPKI validation. Therefore even the few adopters are not necessarily secure.
  We make the first proposal that significantly improves the resilience and security of RPKI. We develop BRP, a Byzantine-Secure relying party implementation. In BRP the relying party nodes redundantly validate RPKI objects and reach a global consensus through voting. BRP provides an RPKI equivalent of public DNS, removing the need for networks to install, operate, and upgrade their own relying party instances while avoiding the need to trust operators of BRP nodes.
  We show through simulations and experiments that BRP, as an intermediate RPKI service, results in less load on RPKI publication points and a robust output despite RPKI repository failures, jitter, and attacks. We engineer BRP to be fully backward compatible and readily deployable - it does not require any changes to the border routers and the RPKI repositories.
  We demonstrate that BRP can protect many networks transparently, with either a decentralized or centralized deployment. BRP can be set up as a network of decentralized volunteer deployments, similarly to NTP and TOR, where different operators participate in the peering process with their node, and provide resilient and secure relying party validation to the Internet. BRP can also be hosted by a single operator as a centralized service, e.g., on one cloud or CDN, and provides RPKI validation benefits even when hosted on a single network.</description>

      <title>Unbundle-Rewrite-Rebundle: Runtime Detection and Rewriting of Privacy-Harming Code in JavaScript Bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents Unbundle-Rewrite-Rebundle (URR), a system for detecting privacy-harming portions of bundled JavaScript code, and rewriting that code at runtime to remove the privacy harming behavior without breaking the surrounding code or overall application. URR is a novel solution to the problem of JavaScript bundles, where websites pre-compile multiple code units into a single file, making it impossible for content filters and ad-blockers to differentiate between desired and unwanted resources. Where traditional content filtering tools rely on URLs, URR analyzes the code at the AST level, and replaces harmful AST sub-trees with privacy-and-functionality maintaining alternatives.
  We present an open-sourced implementation of URR as a Firefox extension, and evaluate it against JavaScript bundles generated by the most popular bundling system (Webpack) deployed on the Tranco 10k. We measure the performance, measured by precision (1.00), recall (0.95), and speed (0.43s per-script) when detecting and rewriting three representative privacy harming libraries often included in JavaScript bundles, and find URR to be an effective approach to a large-and-growing blind spot unaddressed by current privacy tools.</description>

      <title>Service Level Agreements and Security SLA: A Comprehensive Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Service Level Agreement (SLA) is a formal contract between a service provider and a consumer, representing a crucial instrument to define, manage, and maintain relationships between these two parties. The SLA's ability to define the Quality of Service (QoS) expectations, standards, and accountability helps to deliver high-quality services and increase client confidence in disparate application domains, such as Cloud computing and the Internet of Things. An open research direction in this context is related to the possible integration of new metrics to address the security and privacy aspects of services, thus providing protection of sensitive information, mitigating risks, and building trust. This survey paper identifies state of the art covering concepts, approaches, and open problems of SLA management with a distinctive and original focus on the recent development of Security SLA (SecSLA). It contributes by carrying out a comprehensive review and covering the gap between the analyses proposed in existing surveys and the most recent literature on this topic, spanning from 2017 to 2023. Moreover, it proposes a novel classification criterium to organize the analysis based on SLA life cycle phases. This original point of view can help both academics and industrial practitioners to understand and properly locate existing contributions in the advancement of the different aspects of SLA technology. The present work highlights the importance of the covered topics and the need for new research improvements to tackle present and demanding challenges.</description>

      <title>Lazy Layers to Make Fine-Tuned Diffusion Models More Traceable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Foundational generative models should be traceable to protect their owners and facilitate safety regulation. To achieve this, traditional approaches embed identifiers based on supervisory trigger-response signals, which are commonly known as backdoor watermarks. They are prone to failure when the model is fine-tuned with nontrigger data. Our experiments show that this vulnerability is due to energetic changes in only a few 'busy' layers during fine-tuning. This yields a novel arbitrary-in-arbitrary-out (AIAO) strategy that makes watermarks resilient to fine-tuning-based removal. The trigger-response pairs of AIAO samples across various neural network depths can be used to construct watermarked subpaths, employing Monte Carlo sampling to achieve stable verification results. In addition, unlike the existing methods of designing a backdoor for the input/output space of diffusion models, in our method, we propose to embed the backdoor into the feature space of sampled subpaths, where a mask-controlled trigger function is proposed to preserve the generation performance and ensure the invisibility of the embedded backdoor. Our empirical studies on the MS-COCO, AFHQ, LSUN, CUB-200, and DreamBooth datasets confirm the robustness of AIAO; while the verification rates of other trigger-based methods fall from ~90% to ~70% after fine-tuning, those of our method remain consistently above 90%.</description>

      <title>Growth in products of matrices: fastest, average, and generic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let A and B be 2x2 matrices (over reals). Let w(A, B) be a word of length n. After evaluating w(A, B) as a product of matrices, we get a 2x2 matrix, call it W. What is the largest (by the absolute value) possible entry of W, over all w(A, B) of length n, as a function of n? What is the expected absolute value of the largest (by the absolute value) entry in a random product of n matrices, where each matrix is A or B with probability 0.5? What is the Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give partial answer to the first of these questions and an essentially complete answer to the second question. For the third question (the most difficult of the three), we offer a very simple method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent in the case where all entries of the matrices A and B are nonnegative.</description>

      <title>Quantum cryptographic protocols with dual messaging system via 2D alternate quantum walks and genuine single particle entangled states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-particle entangled states (SPES) can offer a more secure way of encoding and processing quantum information than their multi-particle counterparts. The SPES generated via a 2D alternate quantum-walk setup from initially separable states can be either 3-way or 2-way entangled. This letter shows that the generated genuine three-way and nonlocal two-way SPES can be used as cryptographic keys to securely encode two distinct messages simultaneously. We detail the message encryption-decryption steps and show the resilience of the 3-way and 2-way SPES-based cryptographic protocols against eavesdropper attacks like intercept-and-resend and man-in-the-middle. We also detail how these protocols can be experimentally realized using single photons, with the three degrees of freedom being OAM, path, and polarization. These have unparalleled security for quantum communication tasks. The ability to simultaneously encode two distinct messages using the generated SPES showcases the versatility and efficiency of the proposed cryptographic protocol. This capability could significantly improve the throughput of quantum communication systems.</description>

      <title>SoK: Rowhammer on Commodity Operating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02986v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rowhammer has drawn much attention from both academia and industry in the past years as rowhammer exploitation poses severe consequences to system security. Since the first comprehensive study of rowhammer in 2014, a number of rowhammer attacks have been demonstrated against dynamic random access memory (DRAM)-based commodity systems to break software confidentiality, integrity and availability. Accordingly, numerous software defenses have been proposed to mitigate rowhammer attacks on commodity systems of either legacy (e.g., DDR3) or recent DRAM (e.g., DDR4). Besides, multiple hardware defenses (e.g., Target Row Refresh) from the industry have been deployed into recent DRAM to eliminate rowhammer, which we categorize as production defenses.
  In this paper, we systematize rowhammer attacks and defenses with a focus on DRAM-based commodity systems. Particularly, we have established a unified framework demonstrating how a rowhammer attack affects a commodity system. With the framework, we characterize existing attacks, shedding light on new attack vectors that have not yet been explored. We further leverage the framework to categorize software and production defenses, generalize their key defense strategies and summarize their key limitations, from which potential defense strategies are identified.</description>

      <title>Evaluation Methodologies in Software Protection Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07300v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Man-at-the-end (MATE) attackers have full control over the system on which the attacked software runs, and try to break the confidentiality or integrity of assets embedded in the software. Both companies and malware authors want to prevent such attacks. This has driven an arms race between attackers and defenders, resulting in a plethora of different protection and analysis methods. However, it remains difficult to measure the strength of protections because MATE attackers can reach their goals in many different ways and a universally accepted evaluation methodology does not exist. This survey systematically reviews the evaluation methodologies of papers on obfuscation, a major class of protections against MATE attacks. For 571 papers, we collected 113 aspects of their evaluation methodologies, ranging from sample set types and sizes, over sample treatment, to performed measurements. We provide detailed insights into how the academic state of the art evaluates both the protections and analyses thereon. In summary, there is a clear need for better evaluation methodologies. We identify nine challenges for software protection evaluations, which represent threats to the validity, reproducibility, and interpretation of research results in the context of MATE attacks and formulate a number of concrete recommendations for improving the evaluations reported in future research papers.</description>

      <title>REED: Chiplet-Based Accelerator for Fully Homomorphic Encryption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02885v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) enables privacy-preserving computation and has many applications. However, its practical implementation faces massive computation and memory overheads. To address this bottleneck, several Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) FHE accelerators have been proposed. All these prior works put every component needed for FHE onto one chip (monolithic), hence offering high performance. However, they suffer from practical problems associated with large-scale chip design, such as inflexibility, low yield, and high manufacturing cost.
  In this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind multi-chiplet-based FHE accelerator `REED' for overcoming the limitations of prior monolithic designs. To utilize the advantages of multi-chiplet structures while matching the performance of larger monolithic systems, we propose and implement several novel strategies in the context of FHE. These include a scalable chiplet design approach, an effective framework for workload distribution, a custom inter-chiplet communication strategy, and advanced pipelined Number Theoretic Transform and automorphism design to enhance performance.
  Experimental results demonstrate that REED 2.5D microprocessor consumes 96.7 mm$^2$ chip area, 49.4 W average power in 7nm technology. It could achieve a remarkable speedup of up to 2,991x compared to a CPU (24-core 2xIntel X5690) and offer 1.9x better performance, along with a 50% reduction in development costs when compared to state-of-the-art ASIC FHE accelerators. Furthermore, our work presents the first instance of benchmarking an encrypted deep neural network (DNN) training. Overall, the REED architecture design offers a highly effective solution for accelerating FHE, thereby significantly advancing the practicality and deployability of FHE in real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Graphene: Infrastructure Security Posture Analysis with AI-generated Attack Graphs</title>

Abstract: The rampant occurrence of cybersecurity breaches imposes substantial limitations on the progress of network infrastructures, leading to compromised data, financial losses, potential harm to individuals, and disruptions in essential services. The current security landscape demands the urgent development of a holistic security assessment solution that encompasses vulnerability analysis and investigates the potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities as attack paths. In this paper, we propose Graphene, an advanced system designed to provide a detailed analysis of the security posture of computing infrastructures. Using user-provided information, such as device details and software versions, Graphene performs a comprehensive security assessment. This assessment includes identifying associated vulnerabilities and constructing potential attack graphs that adversaries can exploit. Furthermore, Graphene evaluates the exploitability of these attack paths and quantifies the overall security posture through a scoring mechanism. The system takes a holistic approach by analyzing security layers encompassing hardware, system, network, and cryptography. Furthermore, Graphene delves into the interconnections between these layers, exploring how vulnerabilities in one layer can be leveraged to exploit vulnerabilities in others. In this paper, we present the end-to-end pipeline implemented in Graphene, showcasing the systematic approach adopted for conducting this thorough security analysis.</description>

      <title>Noisy Measurements Are Important, the Design of Census Products Is Much More Important</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: McCartan et al. (2023) call for "making differential privacy work for census data users." This commentary explains why the 2020 Census Noisy Measurement Files (NMFs) are not the best focus for that plea. The August 2021 letter from 62 prominent researchers asking for production of the direct output of the differential privacy system deployed for the 2020 Census signaled the engagement of the scholarly community in the design of decennial census data products. NMFs, the raw statistics produced by the 2020 Census Disclosure Avoidance System before any post-processing, are one component of that design-the query strategy output. The more important component is the query workload output-the statistics released to the public. Optimizing the query workload-the Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File, specifically-could allow the privacy-loss budget to be more effectively managed. There could be fewer noisy measurements, no post-processing bias, and direct estimates of the uncertainty from disclosure avoidance for each published statistic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15735v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Proof-of-Work (PoW) blockchains have emerged as a robust and effective consensus mechanism in open environments like the Internet, leading to widespread deployment with numerous cryptocurrency platforms and substantial investments. However, the current PoW implementation primarily focuses on validating the discovery of a winning nonce. Exploring the notion of replacing cryptographic puzzles with useful computing tasks becomes compelling, given the substantial computational capacity of blockchain networks and the global pursuit of a more sustainable IT infrastructure. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the prerequisites for alternative classes of tasks, examining proposed designs from existing literature in light of these requirements. We distill pertinent techniques and address gaps in the current state-of-the-art, providing valuable insights into the evolution of consensus mechanisms beyond traditional PoW.</description>

      <title>Jolteon and Ditto: Network-Adaptive Efficient Consensus with Asynchronous Fallback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2106.10362v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing committee-based Byzantine state machine replication (SMR) protocols, typically deployed in production blockchains, face a clear trade-off: (1) they either achieve linear communication cost in the happy path, but sacrifice liveness during periods of asynchrony, or (2) they are robust (progress with probability one) but pay quadratic communication cost. We believe this trade-off is unwarranted since existing linear protocols still have asymptotic quadratic cost in the worst case. We design Ditto, a Byzantine SMR protocol that enjoys the best of both worlds: optimal communication on and off the happy path (linear and quadratic, respectively) and progress guarantee under asynchrony and DDoS attacks. We achieve this by replacing the view-synchronization of partially synchronous protocols with an asynchronous fallback mechanism at no extra asymptotic cost. Specifically, we start from HotStuff, a state-of-the-art linear protocol, and gradually build Ditto. As a separate contribution and an intermediate step, we design a 2-chain version of HotStuff, Jolteon, which leverages a quadratic view-change mechanism to reduce the latency of the standard 3-chain HotStuff. We implement and experimentally evaluate all our systems. Notably, Jolteon's commit latency outperforms HotStuff by 200-300ms with varying system size. Additionally, Ditto adapts to the network and provides better performance than Jolteon under faulty conditions and better performance than VABA (a state-of-the-art asynchronous protocol) under faultless conditions. This proves our case that breaking the robustness-efficiency trade-off is in the realm of practicality.</description>

      <title>Sui Lutris: A Blockchain Combining Broadcast and Consensus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sui Lutris is the first smart-contract platform to sustainably achieve sub-second finality. It achieves this significant decrease by employing consensusless agreement not only for simple payments but for a large variety of transactions. Unlike prior work, Sui Lutris neither compromises expressiveness nor throughput and can run perpetually without restarts. Sui Lutris achieves this by safely integrating consensuless agreement with a high-throughput consensus protocol that is invoked out of the critical finality path but ensures that when a transaction is at risk of inconsistent concurrent accesses, its settlement is delayed until the total ordering is resolved. Building such a hybrid architecture is especially delicate during reconfiguration events, where the system needs to preserve the safety of the consensusless path without compromising the long-term liveness of potentially misconfigured clients. We thus develop a novel reconfiguration protocol, the first to provably show the safe and efficient reconfiguration of a consensusless blockchain. Sui Lutris is currently running in production and underpins the Sui smart-contract platform. Combined with the use of Objects instead of accounts it enables the safe execution of smart contracts that expose objects as a first-class resource. In our experiments Sui Lutris achieves latency lower than 0.5 seconds for throughput up to 5,000 certificates per second (150k ops/s with transaction blocks), compared to the state-of-the-art real-world consensus latencies of 3 seconds. Furthermore, it gracefully handles validators crash-recovery and does not suffer visible performance degradation during reconfiguration.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Difference-of-Convex Solver for Privacy Funnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04778v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient solver for the privacy funnel (PF) method, leveraging its difference-of-convex (DC) structure. The proposed DC separation results in a closed-form update equation, which allows straightforward application to both known and unknown distribution settings. For known distribution case, we prove the convergence (local stationary points) of the proposed non-greedy solver, and empirically show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in characterizing the privacy-utility trade-off. The insights of our DC approach apply to unknown distribution settings where labeled empirical samples are available instead. Leveraging the insights, our alternating minimization solver satisfies the fundamental Markov relation of PF in contrast to previous variational inference-based solvers. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed solver with MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results show that under a comparable reconstruction quality, an adversary suffers from higher prediction error from clustering our compressed codes than that with the compared methods. Most importantly, our solver is independent to private information in inference phase contrary to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Towards Lifecycle Unlearning Commitment Management: Measuring Sample-level Approximate Unlearning Completeness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By adopting a more flexible definition of unlearning and adjusting the model distribution to simulate training without the targeted data, approximate machine unlearning provides a less resource-demanding alternative to the more laborious exact unlearning methods. Yet, the unlearning completeness of target samples-even when the approximate algorithms are executed faithfully without external threats-remains largely unexamined, raising questions about those approximate algorithms' ability to fulfill their commitment of unlearning during the lifecycle.
  In this paper, we introduce the task of Lifecycle Unlearning Commitment Management (LUCM) for approximate unlearning and outline its primary challenges. We propose an efficient metric designed to assess the sample-level unlearning completeness. Our empirical results demonstrate its superiority over membership inference techniques in two key areas: the strong correlation of its measurements with unlearning completeness across various unlearning tasks, and its computational efficiency, making it suitable for real-time applications. Additionally, we show that this metric is able to serve as a tool for monitoring unlearning anomalies throughout the unlearning lifecycle, including both under-unlearning and over-unlearning.
  We apply this metric to evaluate the unlearning commitments of current approximate algorithms. Our analysis, conducted across multiple unlearning benchmarks, reveals that these algorithms inconsistently fulfill their unlearning commitments due to two main issues: 1) unlearning new data can significantly affect the unlearning utility of previously requested data, and 2) approximate algorithms fail to ensure equitable unlearning utility across different groups. These insights emphasize the crucial importance of LUCM throughout the unlearning lifecycle. We will soon open-source our newly developed benchmark.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Robustness of In-Context Learning with Noisy Labels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18191v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the mysterious In-Context Learning (ICL) ability exhibited by Transformer architectures, especially in large language models (LLMs), has sparked significant research interest. However, the resilience of Transformers' in-context learning capabilities in the presence of noisy samples, prevalent in both training corpora and prompt demonstrations, remains underexplored. In this paper, inspired by prior research that studies ICL ability using simple function classes, we take a closer look at this problem by investigating the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels. Specifically, we first conduct a thorough evaluation and analysis of the robustness of Transformers against noisy labels during in-context learning and show that they exhibit notable resilience against diverse types of noise in demonstration labels. Furthermore, we delve deeper into this problem by exploring whether introducing noise into the training set, akin to a form of data augmentation, enhances such robustness during inference, and find that such noise can indeed improve the robustness of ICL. Overall, our fruitful analysis and findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the resilience of Transformer models against label noises during ICL and provide valuable insights into the research on Transformers in natural language processing.

      <title>Why You Should Not Trust Interpretations in Machine Learning: Adversarial Attacks on Partial Dependence Plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) across industries has led to the widespread use of complex black-box models and interpretation tools for decision making. This paper proposes an adversarial framework to uncover the vulnerability of permutation-based interpretation methods for machine learning tasks, with a particular focus on partial dependence (PD) plots. This adversarial framework modifies the original black box model to manipulate its predictions for instances in the extrapolation domain. As a result, it produces deceptive PD plots that can conceal discriminatory behaviors while preserving most of the original model's predictions. This framework can produce multiple fooled PD plots via a single model. By using real-world datasets including an auto insurance claims dataset and COMPAS (Correctional Offender Management Profiling for Alternative Sanctions) dataset, our results show that it is possible to intentionally hide the discriminatory behavior of a predictor and make the black-box model appear neutral through interpretation tools like PD plots while retaining almost all the predictions of the original black-box model. Managerial insights for regulators and practitioners are provided based on the findings.</description>
