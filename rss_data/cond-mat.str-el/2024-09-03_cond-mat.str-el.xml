      <title>Theory of Lee-Naughton-Lebed's Oscillations in Moderately Strong Electric Fields in Layered Quasi-One-Dimensional Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In framework of some extension of the quasi-classical Boltzmann kinetic equation, we show that a moderately strong electric field splits the so-called Lee-Naughton-Lebed's magnetoconductivity maxima in a layered quasi-one-dimensional conductor, if we use some reasonable approximation to the equation. By means of the above mentioned approximation, we obtain analytical formula for conductivity in high magnetic and moderately high electric fields and show that it coincides with the hypothetical formula as well as adequately describes the pioneering experimental data by Kobayashi et al. [K. Kobayashi, M. Saito, E. Omichi, and T. Osada, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{96}, 126601 (2006)].</description>

      <title>Capturing spin fluctuations in CaCuO\textsubscript{2}: \textit{Ab initio} QMC calculations with multi-determinant wave functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an advanced \textit{ab initio} quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculation of the ground state of undoped CaCuO\textsubscript{2}. We extend the traditional single-determinant Slater-Jastrow approach to include multi-determinant wave functions, inhomogeneous Jastrow factors, and orbital optimization. Our results demonstrate not only an improvement in the variational bound of the ground state energy -- 2.3 eV per formula unit lower than previous state of the art techniques -- but also confirm the presence of spin fluctuations in multi-determinant wave functions in a strongly correlated cuprate system, which is integral to understanding high-$T_c$ superconductivity. This is the first demonstration of capturing spin fluctuations in QMC wave functions on a cuprate, establishing the groundwork for new studies on doped cuprates in the superconducting state, where spin fluctuations require more accurate characterization.</description>

      <title>Quantum Theory of Lee-Naughton-Lebed's Angular Effect in Strong Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some time ago, Kobayashi et al. experimentally studied the so-called Lee-Naughton-Lebed's (LNL) angular effect in strong electric fields [K. Kobayashi, M. Saito, E. Omichi, and T. Osada, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{96}, 126601 (2006)]. They found that strong electric fields split the LNL conductivity maxima in $\alpha$-(ET)$_2$-based organic conductor and hypothetically introduced the corresponding equation for conductivity. In this Letter, for the first time we suggest quantum mechanical theory of the LNL angular oscillations in moderately strong electric fields. In particular, we demonstrate that the obtained by us approximate theoretical formula coincides with the hypothetical one and well describes the above mentioned experiments.</description>

      <title>Quantum Fluctuations in the van der Walls material $\rm NiPS_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the magnetic excitation spectrum of the quantum magnet $\rm NiPS_3$ near the zig-zag ground state of a minimal honeycomb spin Hamiltonian that includes bilinear and biquadratic spin interactions. Our analysis, using a multi-boson generalized spin wave theory suited for spin S=1 systems, revealed two normal modes at the linear level. The one at lower energy corresponds to a single magnon mode, consistent with results from spectroscopy experiments. Without single-ion anisotropy, this mode features a Goldstone mode at the corner of the Brillouin zone. When single ion anisotropy is introduced, the zig-zag phase's global U(1) invariance is broken, resulting in a gap. The higher energy mode corresponds to two-magnon fluctuations, which appear at the harmonic level in the generalized spin wave theory. This mode forms a gapped flat band due to bilinear spin interactions and becomes dispersive when biquadratic interactions are considered. The higher energy dispersion is related to quadrupolar fluctuations, which are feasible in magnets where the order parameter fluctuates in the SU(3) space. The spectrum analysis yielded quantum corrections to the order parameter and detected instabilities in the $\rm NiPS_3$ dipolar phases. Identifying the highest energy branch in experiments could provide insight into hidden nematic orders in $\rm NiPS_3$ and other van der Waals magnets.</description>

      <title>Potential of Raman scattering in probing magnetic excitations and their coupling to lattice dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Raman scattering is an excellent method for simultaneously determining the dynamics of lattice, spin, and charge degrees of freedom. Furthermore, polarization selection rules in Raman scattering enable momentum-resolved quasiparticle dynamics. In this review, we highlight the potential of Raman scattering in probing magnetic quasiparticles or excitations in various magnetic materials. We demonstrate how temperature-dependent Raman scattering data can confirm the existence of magnons in long-range ordered magnets and fractionalized excitations in Kitaev spin liquid candidates. To make this review easily understandable to novices, we provide background information on magnons and fractionalized excitations, and explain how they become visible in the Raman scattering process. We also show how to estimate magnetic exchange interactions from the data. For both types of magnetic materials, we discuss the impact of spin-phonon coupling on the lineshape of the phonon modes. In terms of materials, we present magnetic Raman scattering data of antiferromagnetic Sr2IrO4 and La2CuO4, ferromagnetic CrI3 monolayers, and Kitaev spin liquid candidates {\alpha}-RuCl3 and \b{eta}-Li2IrO3. Overall, our review demonstrates the versatility of the Raman scattering technique in probing quasiparticles in magnetic quantum materials. The review aims to inform young experimental researchers about the potential of Raman scattering, thereby motivating them to use this technique in their research.</description>

      <title>Chemical pressure due to impurities in trigonal compounds Eu$T_2Pn_2$ ($T =$ Cd, Zn; $Pn =$ P, As, Sb)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a review of crystal growth, crystal structure, compositional details, magnetism, thermodynamic, and transport behavior in the family of the trigonal intermetallic systems Eu$T_2Pn_2$ ($T=$ Cd, Zn; $Pn=$ P, As, Sb; space group $P\overline{3}m1$, No.164). The physical properties observed in these materials, and how these change depending on the growth conditions are discussed. In particular, the case of EuCd$_2$As$_2$ is considered where data from many sources are available. The possible small contamination of the material during crystal growth experiments is hard to verify as it is often below the detection limit of the standard characterization techniques. It turns out that samples from different sources exhibit variations in the lattice parameters exceeding the experimental errors. The review of these parameters reveals that they are very similar for antiferromagnetic samples grown from Sn flux in Al$_2$O$_3$ crucibles, while there is a wider spread for samples grown from salt flux grown in SiO$_2$ ampules, which are mostly ferromagnetic. The influence of the different experimental setups with regard to possible impurities in the samples is discussed.</description>

      <title>Unified Investigation of Rapid Hall Coefficient Changes in Cuprates: Pseudogap and Fermi Surface Influences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-$T_c$ cuprates are characterized by strong spin fluctuations, which give rise to antiferromagnetic and pseudogap phases and may be key to the high superconducting critical temperatures observed in these materials. Experimental studies have revealed significant changes in the Hall coefficient $R_H$ across these phases, a phenomenon closely related to both spin fluctuations and changes in the Fermi surface morphology. Using the perturbation correction to Gaussian approximation (PCGA), we investigate the two-dimensional(2D) square-lattice single-band Hubbard model and obtain the self-energy with a finite imaginary part due to scattering. We calculate the density dependence of the Hall number $n_H=1/(qR_H)$. For small hole (or electron) doping $p$ (or $x$), our numerical results show that $n_H$ transitions from $p$ to $1+p$ for hole-doped systems, and from $-x$ to $1-x$ for electron-doped systems -- both in agreement with experimental findings. Furthermore, we discuss the correlation between phase boundaries and the observed peculiar changes in the Hall number.</description>

      <title>Non-Landau quantum phase transition in modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the quantum phase transition in modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chains. In the odd-N case, the transition separates a trivial non-degenerate phase to a doubly-degenerate gapped chiral PSU(N) symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase which breaks spontaneously the inversion symmetry. The transition is not an Ising transition associated to the breaking of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ inversion symmetry, but is governed by the delocalization of the edge states of the SPT phase. In this respect, a modulated SU(N) Heisenberg spin chain provides a simple example in one dimension of a non-Landau phase transition which is described by the SU(N)$_1$ conformal field theory. We show that the chiral SPT phase exhibits fractionalized spinon excitations, which can be confined by changing the model parameters slightly.</description>

      <title>Variation of Electron-electron interaction in pyrochlore structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We conduct a comprehensive \textit{ab initio} investigation of electron-electron interactions within the pyrochlore structures of R$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$, R$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, Ca$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$, and Cd$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$, where R denotes a rare-earth element. Utilizing a multiorbital Hubbard model, we systematically explore the effects of various rare-earth elements and applied high pressure on the correlation strength in these compounds. Our calculations on the Coulomb interaction parameter $U$ and the bandwidth $W$ reveal that the chemical pressure for R$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and R$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ leads to an unusual increase in $U/W$ ratio, hence, increase in correlation strength. Contrary to conventional understanding of bandwidth control, our study identifies that the Hubbard $U$ is more influential than the bandwidth $W$ behind the metal-insulator landscape of R$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and R$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, leading to an interaction-controlled metal-insulator transition. We also find unexpected behavior in physical pressure. Whereas physical pressure leads to a decrease in the correlation strength $U/W$ as usual in R$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$, the effect is notably small in Ca$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$ and Cd$_2$Ru$_2$O$_7$, which provides an important clue to understanding unusual pressure-induced metal-insulator transition observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>Striped magnetization plateau and chirality-reversible anomalous Hall effect in a magnetic kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kagome materials with magnetic frustration in two-dimensional networks are known for their exotic properties, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) with non-collinear spin textures. However, the effects of one-dimensional (1D) spin chains within these networks are less understood. Here, we report a distinctive AHE in the bilayer-distorted kagome material GdTi$_3$Bi$_4$, featuring 1D Gd zigzag spin chains, a one-third magnetization plateau, and two successive metamagnetic transitions. At these metamagnetic transitions, Hall resistivity shows abrupt jumps linked to the formation of stripe domain walls, while within the plateau, the absence of detectable domain walls suggests possible presence of skyrmion phase. Reducing the sample size to a few microns reveals additional Hall resistivity spikes, indicating domain wall skew scattering contributions. Magnetic atomistic spin dynamics simulations reveal that the magnetic textures at these transitions have reverse chirality, explaining the evolution of AHE and domain walls with fields. These results underscore the potential of magnetic and crystal symmetry interplay, and magnetic field-engineered spin chirality, for controlling domain walls and tuning transverse properties, advancing spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Jahn-Teller effect in the strong spin-orbit coupling regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exotic quantum phases, arising from a complex interplay of charge, spin, lattice and orbital degrees of freedom, are of immense interest to a wide research community. A well-known example of such an entangled behavior is the Jahn-Teller effect, where the lifting of orbital degeneracy proceeds through lattice distortions, often accompanied by ordering of spins and metal-insulator transitions. Static distortions, including cooperative behavior, have been associated with colossal magneto-resistance, multiferroicity, high-$T_\mathrm{C}$ superconductivity and other correlated phenomena. Realizations of the dynamic Jahn-Teller effect, on the other hand, are scarce since the preservation of vibronic symmetries requires subtle tuning of the local environment. Here we demonstrate that a highly-symmetrical 5d$^1$ double perovskite Ba$_2$MgReO$_6$, comprising of a 3D array of isolated ReO$_6$ octahedra, fulfils these requirements, resulting in a unique case of a dynamic Jahn-Teller system with strong spin-orbit coupling. Thermodynamic and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering experiments undoubtedly show that the Jahn-Teller instability leads to a ground-state doublet, invoking a paradigm shift for this family of compounds. The restoration of vibronic degrees of freedom arises from a quantum-mechanical zero-point motion, as revealed by detailed quantum chemistry calculations. The dynamic state of ReO$_6$ octahedra persists down to the lowest temperatures, where a multipolar order sets in, allowing for investigations of the interplay between a dynamic JT effect and strongly correlated electron behavior.</description>

      <title>Lee-Yang formalism for phase transitions of interacting fermions using tensor networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predicting the phase diagram of interacting quantum many-body systems is a challenging problem in condensed matter physics. Strong interactions and correlation effects may lead to exotic states of matter, such as quantum spin liquids and unconventional superconductors, that often compete with other symmetry broken states including ordered magnets and charge density waves. Here, we put forward a formalism for determining the phase diagram of fermionic systems that combines recent progress in the field of Lee-Yang theories of phase transitions with many-body tensor-network methods. Using this strategy, we map out the phase diagram of a fermionic chain, where charge density waves form due to strong repulsion. Specifically, from the high cumulants of the order parameter, we extract the dominant zeros of the moment generating function in chains of finite size. By extrapolating their positions to the thermodynamic limit, we determine the boundaries between competing phases. Our formalism provides a strategy for determining critical points in fermionic systems, and it is based on fluctuations of the order parameter, which are measurable quantities.</description>

      <title>Robust analytic continuation using sparse modeling approach imposed by semi-positive definiteness for multi-orbital systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analytic continuation (AC) from imaginary-time Green's function to spectral function is essential in the numerical analysis of dynamical properties in quantum many-body systems. However, this process faces a fundamental challenge: it is an ill-posed problem, leading to unstable spectra against the noise in the Green's function. This instability is further complicated in multi-orbital systems with hybridization between spin-orbitals, where off-diagonal Green's functions yield a spectral matrix with off-diagonal elements, necessitating the matrix's semi-positive definiteness to satisfy the causality. We propose an advanced AC method using sparse modeling for multi-orbital systems, which reduces the effect of noise and ensures the matrix's semi-positive definiteness. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by contrasting it with the conventional sparse modeling method, focusing on handling Green's functions with off-diagonal elements, thereby demonstrating our proposed method's enhanced stability and precision.</description>

      <title>Proximity to an orbital order with charge disorder state in optimally-doped \textit{RE}\textsubscript{5/8}Ca\textsubscript{3/8}MnO\textsubscript{3} perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of charge and orbital ordering phenomena in optimally-doped \textit{RE}\textsubscript{5/8}Ca\textsubscript{3/8}MnO\textsubscript{3} (RECMO, \textit{RE} $=$ rare-earth) manganite perovskites has been investigated through average structure synchrotron x-ray and neutron powder diffraction techniques. We demonstrate the intricate relationship between the \textit{B}O\textsubscript{6} octahedral rotation magnitude and lattice strain distortions acting in this series and how they tune macroscopic signatures describing ordering behavior. Through careful symmetry-motivated crystallographic analysis, we show that for the range of RECMO compositions which famously contain maxima in the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) response, their lattice strain states are in close proximity to that associated with a novel orbital order:charge disordered state we have recently unveiled in the quadruple manganite perovskites Na\textsubscript{1-\textit{x}}Ca\textsubscript{\textit{x}}Mn\textsubscript{7}O\textsubscript{12}. We establish that this order is the primary state which competes with the ferromagnetic metallic state which ultimately leads to phase coexistence and the emergence of CMR. Our results lend themselves to aiding a further understanding of how particular chemical complexities can control charge and orbital ordering phenomena, and also the general properties of manganite perovskites and other related systems \textit{via} strain effects.</description>

      <title>Magnetic properties of single-, multilayer, and bulk CrTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate magnetic properties of CrTe$_2$ within the density functional theory (DFT) approach in ferromagnetic phase and combination of DFT and dynamical mean field theory (DFT+DMFT) approach in paramagnetic phase. We show that few layer CrTe$_2$ possesses well formed local magnetic moments. In the single layer CrTe$_2$ we find antiferromagnetic exchange with 120\degree antiferromagnetic structure most preferable. In the bilayer and trilayer systems electronic correlations in DFT+DMFT approach yield ferromagnetic exchange interaction within each layer, but the interaction between the layers is antiferromagnetic, such that alternation of the direction of magnetization of the layers is expected. In bulk CrTe$_2$ we find the tendency to ferromagnetic order at low temperature, but with increase of temperature antiferromagnetic correlations between the layers dominate. Determination of the critical number of layers at which the interlayer antiferromagnetic order changes to the ferromagnetic one, requires consideration of the non-local Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>Dualization of ingappabilities through Hilbert-space extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Duality in various dimensions is understood through a Hilbert-space extension method. We rigorously dualize the quantum ingappabilities to discrete height model in one dimension which is inaccessible by earlier work such as flux-insertion arguments. It turns out that the ingappabilities of quantum discrete height model is protected by an exotic ``modulating'' translation symmetry, which is a combination of modulating internal symmetry transformation and the conventional lattice translation. It can be also generalize to higher-form gauge fields in arbitrary dimensions, e.g., $\mathbb{Z}$-gauge theory in two dimensions with $\mathbb{Z}$ one-form symmetry and a modulating translation symmetry.</description>

Abstract: We introduced a family of bold-line series, assisted with 1/$\mathrm{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. The method was benchmarked with exact diagonalization for $3\times3$ Hubbard square, which was then applied to $60\times60$ lattice. We showed its exponential convergence for half-filled non-fermi liquids phase at $\beta\mathrm{t}=4$ and presented several exemplary parameters away from half-filling, including $\mathrm{U}/\mathrm{t}=9$.</description>

      <title>Periodic classical trajectories and quantum scars in many-spin systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the stability of exceptional periodic classical trajectories in rather generic chaotic many-body systems and explore a possible connection between these trajectories and exceptional nonthermal quantum eigenstates known as "quantum many-body scars". The systems considered are chaotic spin chains with short-range interactions, both classical and quantum. On the classical side, the chosen periodic trajectories are such that all spins instantaneously point in the same direction, which evolves as a function of time. We find that the largest Lyapunov exponents characterising the stabillity of these trajectories have surprisingly strong and nontrivial dependencies on the interaction constants and chain lengths. In particular, we identify rather long spin chains, where the above periodic trajectories are Lyapunov-stable on many-body energy shells overwhelmingly dominated by chaotic motion. We also find that instabilities around periodic trajectories in modestly large spin chains develop into a transient nearly quasiperiodic non-ergodic regime. In some cases, the lifetime of this regime is extremely long, which we interpret as a manifestation of Arnold diffusion in the vicinity of integrable dynamics. On the quantum side, we numerically investigate the dynamics of quantum states starting with all spins initially pointing in the same direction: these are the quantum counterparts of the initial conditions for the above periodic classical trajectories. Our investigation reveals the existence of quantum many-body scars for numerically accessible finite chains of spins 3/2 and higher. The dynamic thermalisation process dominated by quantum scars is shown to exhibit a slowdown in comparison with generic thermalisation at the same energy. Finally, we identify quantum signatures of the proximity to a classical separatrix of the periodic motion.</description>

      <title>Bonding Interactions Can Drive Topological Phase Transitions in a Zintl Antiferromagnetic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While $\sim$30% of materials are reported to be topological, topological insulators are rare. Magnetic topological insulators (MTI) are even harder to find. Identifying crystallographic features that can host the coexistence of a topological insulating phase with magnetic order is vital for finding intrinsic MTI materials. Thus far, most materials that are investigated for the determination of an MTI are some combination of known topological insulators with a magnetic ion such as MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Motivated by the recent success of EuIn$_{2}$As$_{2}$, we investigate the role of chemical pressure on topologically trivial insulator, Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ via Ga substitution. Eu$_5$Ga$_2$Sb$_6$ is predicted to be topological but is synthetically difficult to stabilize. We look into the intermediate compositions between Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ and Eu$_5$Ga$_2$Sb$_6$ through theoretical works to explore a topological phase transition and band inversion mechanism. We attribute the band inversion mechanism to changes in Eu-Sb hybridization as Ga is substituted for In due to chemical pressure. We also synthesize Eu$_{5}$In$_{4/3}$Ga$_{2/3}$Sb$_{6}$, the highest Ga concentration in Eu$_{5}$In$_{2-x}$Ga$_{x}$Sb$_{6}$, and report the thermodynamic, magnetic, transport, and Hall properties. Overall, our work paints a picture of a possible MTI via band engineering and explains why Eu-based Zintl compounds are suitable for the co-existence of magnetism and topology.</description>

      <title>Directly visualizing nematic superconductivity driven by the pair density wave in NbSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair density wave (PDW) is a distinct superconducting state characterized by a periodic modulation of its order parameter in real space. Its intricate interplay with the charge density wave (CDW) state is a continuing topic of interest in condensed matter physics. While PDW states have been discovered in cuprates and other unconventional superconductors, the understanding of diverse PDWs and their interactions with different types of CDWs remains limited. Here, utilizing scanning tunneling microscopy, we unveil the subtle correlations between PDW ground states and two distinct CDW phases -- namely, anion-centered-CDW (AC-CDW) and hollow-centered-CDW (HC-CDW) -- in 2H-NbSe$_2$. In both CDW regions, we observe coexisting PDWs with a commensurate structure that aligns with the underlying CDW phase. The superconducting gap size, $\Delta(r)$, related to the pairing order parameter is in phase with the charge density in both CDW regions. Meanwhile, the coherence peak height, $H(r)$, qualitatively reflecting the electron-pair density, exhibits a phase difference of approximately $2\pi/3$ relative to the CDW. The three-fold rotational symmetry is preserved in the HC-CDW region but is spontaneously broken in the AC-CDW region due to the PDW state, leading to the emergence of nematic superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Generating Approximate Ground States of Strongly Correlated Quantum Many-Body Systems Through Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most quantum algorithms designed to generate or probe properties of the ground state of a quantum many-body system require as input an initial state with a large overlap with the desired ground state. One approach for preparing such a ground state is Imaginary Time Evolution (ITE). Recent work by [Motta, M., Sun, C., Tan, A.T.K. et al. (2020)] introduced an algorithm -- which we will refer to as Quantum Imaginary Time Evolution (QITE) -- that shows how ITE can be approximated by a sequence of unitary operators, making QITE potentially implementable on early fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we provide a heuristic study of the capabilities of the QITE algorithm in approximating the ITE of lattice and molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. We numerically study the performance of the QITE algorithm when provided with a good classical initial state for a large class of systems, some of which are of interest to industrial applications, and check if QITE is able to qualitatively replicate the ITE behavior and improve over a classical mean-field solution. The systems we consider in this work range from one- and two-dimensional lattice systems of various lattice geometries displaying short- and long-range interactions, to active spaces of molecular electronic structure Hamiltonians. In addition to the comparison of QITE and ITE, we explicitly show how imaginary time evolved fermionic Gaussian states can serve as initial states which can be efficiently computed on classical computers and efficiently implemented on quantum computers for generic spin Hamiltonians in arbitrary lattice geometries and dimensions, which can be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Noise of Driven Controlled Field Using the Central Spin Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01375v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the coherence dynamics of a central spin coupled to a spin chain with a time-dependent noisy magnetic field, focusing on how noise influences the system's decoherence. Our results show that decoherency due to the nonequilibrium critical dynamics of the environment is amplified in the presence of uncorrelated and correlated Gaussian noise. We demonstrate that decoherence factor consistently signals the critical points, and exhibits exponential scaling with the system size, the square of noise intensity, and the noise correlation time at the critical points. We find that strong coupling between the qubit and the environment allows partial revivals of coherence, which diminish with increasing noise intensity or decreasing noise correlation time. In contrast, weak coupling leads to monotonic enhanced decoherence. The numerical results illustrate that, the revivals decay and scale exponentially with noise intensity. Moreover, the revivals increase and indicate linear or power law scaling with noise correlation time depends on how the correlated noise is fast or slow. Additionally, we explore the non-Markovianity of the dynamics, finding that it decays in the presence of noise but increases as the noise correlation time grows. Our findings have potential applications in the noise spectroscopy of external signals.</description>

      <title>Meron-mediated phase transitions in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets with easy-plane anisotropy: successive transformation of the hexagonal skyrmion lattice into the square lattice and into the tilted FM state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I revisit the well-known structural transition between hexagonal and square skyrmion lattices induced by increasing easy-plane anisotropy in quasi-two-dimensional chiral magnets. I show that the hexagonal skyrmion order, by the first-order phase transition, transforms into a distorted (rhombic) skyrmion lattice. The transition is mediated by merons and anti-merons emerging within the boundaries between skyrmion cells. Since the energy density associated with anti-merons is highly positive owing to the wrong rotational sense, one anti-meron per unit cell annihilates: anti-merons are squeezed by the pairs of approaching merons at the opposite sides of the hexagonal unit cell. Further, in a narrow range of anisotropy values, the distorted skyrmion lattice gradually transforms into a perfect square order of skyrmions (alternatively called "a square meron-antimeron crystal") when two merons eventually merge into one. Thus, within the square skyrmion lattice, there is one meron and two anti-merons per unit cell, which underlie the subsequent first-order phase transition into the tilted ferromagnetic state. A pair of oppositely charged merons mutually annihilates, whereas a remaining anti-meron couples with an anti-meron occupying the center of the unit cell. As an outcome, the tilted ferromagnetic state contains bimeron clusters (chains) with the attracting inter-soliton potential. Moreover, domain-wall merons are actively involved in dynamic responses of the square skyrmion lattices. As an example, I theoretically study spin-wave modes and their excitations by ac magnetic fields. Two found resonance peaks are the result of the complex dynamics of domain-wall merons: whereas in the high-frequency mode, merons rotate counterclockwise as one might expect, in the low-frequency mode, merons are created and annihilated consistently with the rotational motion of the domain boundaries.</description>

      <title>Consecutive Flat Chern Bands and Correlated States in Monolayer Re(Ag$X_3$)$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically propose that van der Waals monolayer Re(Ag$X_3$)$_2$ ($X=$ Cl, Br, I) have four consecutive flat Chern bands in the 120$^\circ$ spiral antiferromagnetic ground state. The nontrivial topology of these Chern bands emerges from the synergy between Re $t_{2g}$ band folding with non-collinear spin configuration and spin-orbit coupling. By constructing maximally localized Wannier functions directly from first-principles calculations, the tight-binding model is developed to describe the consecutive Chern bands. Exact diagonalization suggests that $1/3$ filling of these Chern bands host correlated states such as fractional Chern insulator and charge density wave state. Interestingly, the spin configurations and band topology of Chern bands are tunable by external magnetic field. The general physics from the $d$ orbitals here applies to a large class materials such as Re(Cu$X_3$)$_2$ and Re(Au$X_3$)$_2$. These interesting predictions, if realized experimentally, could greatly promote the research and application of topological quantum physics at elevated temperature.</description>

Abstract: Complex materials, characterized by geometrical or electronic complexities, catalyze the emergence of various intriguing functionalities. At the atomic level, these materials typically feature intricate and competing bond orders associated with d-orbitals, providing a rich test bed for assessing the capabilities of density functional theory (DFT). The Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional has been shown to outperform traditional density functionals in modeling a diverse range of chemical bonds, marking a significant advancement in DFT. Here, we investigate the effectiveness of SCAN in simulating the electronic properties of displacive ferroelectrics, magnetoelectric multiferroics, and cuprate high-temperature superconductors, which encompass a broad spectrum of bonding characteristics. We demonstrate how SCAN addresses challenging simulations involving (1) anisotropic bonding with geometrical symmetry breaking, (2) bonding hybridization of localized open d-shells, and (3) variable electronic states on the boundary of localization-insulator to itinerant-metal transitions. We also show how the advanced functional captures the complex bonds by analyzing the intricate electron densities, offering an intuitive understanding of SCAN's operational principles. Our insights have practical implications for the computational materials science community, potentially guiding the broader adoption of SCAN in modeling complex functional materials.</description>

Abstract: We study structural, magnetic and magneto-thermal properties of GdRhIn compound. The room temperature X-ray diffraction measurements show hexagonal crystal structure. Temperature and field dependence of magnetization suggest two magnetic transitions antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic at 16 K and ferromagnetic to paramagnetic at 34. The heat capacity measurements confirm both the magnetic transitions in GdRhIn. The magnetization data was used to calculate isothermal magnetic entropy change and refrigerant capacity in GdRhIn, which was found to be 10.3 J/Kg-K for the field change of 70 kOe and 282 J/Kg for the field change of 50 kOe, respectively. The large magnetocaloric effect in GdRhIn suggests that the material could be used for magnetic refrigeration at low temperatures.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the electronic structure of Ni, using the density functional theory (DFT) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for the theoretical description of its electronic structure properties along with finite-temperature magnetism. Our study provides a comprehensive account of electronic and magnetic properties with the same set of Coulomb interaction parameters, $U$($J$)=5.78(1.1) $eV$ calculated using first-principles approach. The nature of theoretical magnetization curves obtained from DFT \&amp; DFT+DMFT as well as the experimental curve show deviation from the standard models of magnetism, $viz$ Stoner and spin fluctuation model. The temperature dependent DFT approach is found to well describe the finite-temperature M(T) of Ni below critical temperature ($T$ $\leq$ 631 K). The study finds significant Pauli-spin susceptibility contribution to paramagnetic spin susceptibility. Excluding the Pauli-spin response yields a linear Curie-Weiss dependence of the inverse paramagnetic susceptibility at higher temperatures. Also, the presence of mixed valence electronic configuration (3$d^8$, 3$d^9$ and 3$d^7$) is noted. The competing degrees of both the itinerant and localized moment picture of 3$d$ states are found to dictate the finite-temperature magnetization of the system. Furthermore, the quasiparticle scattering rate is found to exhibit strong deviation from $T^2$ behavior in temperature leading to the breakdown of conventional Fermi-liquid theory. In addition to the 6 $eV$ feature, our calculated electronic excitation spectrum confirms the satellite feature extending $\sim$10 $eV$ binding energy, being consistent with experimental observation.
  Interestingly, our $G_0W_0$ results find the presence of plasmonic excitation contribution to the intensity of famous 6 $eV$ satellite along with the electronic correlation effects,paving way for its reinterpretation.</description>

      <title>Mixed-valence state in the dilute-impurity regime of La-substituted SmB$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05706v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homogeneous mixed-valence (MV) behaviour is one of the most intriguing phenomena of $f$-electron systems. Despite extensive efforts, a fundamental aspect which remains unsettled is the determination of the limiting cases for which MV emerges. Here we address this question for SmB$_6$, a prototypical MV system characterized by two nearly-degenerate Sm$^{2+}$ and Sm$^{3+}$ configurations. By combining angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), we track the evolution of the mean Sm valence, $v_{Sm}$, in the Sm$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$ series. Upon substitution of Sm ions with trivalent La, we observe a linear decrease of valence fluctuations to an almost complete suppression at $x$$\,$=$\,$0.2, with $v_{Sm}$$\,$$\sim$$\,$2; surprisingly, by further reducing $x$, a re-entrant increase of $v_{Sm}$ develops, approaching the value of $v_{imp}$$\,$$\sim$$\,$2.35 in the dilute-impurity limit. Such observation departs from a monotonic evolution of $v_{Sm}$ across the whole series, as well as from the expectation of its convergence to an integer value for $x$$\,$$\rightarrow$$\,$0. Our ARPES and XAS results, complemented by a phenomenological model, demonstrate an unconventional evolution of the MV character in the Sm$_x$La$_{1-x}$B$_6$ series, paving the way to further theoretical and experimental considerations on the concept of MV itself, and its influence on the macroscopic properties of rare-earth compounds in the dilute-to-intermediate impurity regime.</description>

      <title>Resummation-based Quantum Monte Carlo for Entanglement Entropy Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01490v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the recently developed resummation-based quantum Monte Carlo method for the SU($N$) spin and loop-gas models, we develop a new algorithm, dubbed ResumEE, to compute the entanglement entropy (EE) with greatly enhanced efficiency. Our ResumEE exponentially speeds up the computation of the exponentially small value of the $\langle e^{-S^{(2)}}\rangle$, where $S^{(2)}$ is the 2nd order R\'enyi EE, such that the $S^{(2)}$ for a generic 2D quantum SU($N$) spin models can be readily computed with high accuracy. We benchmark our algorithm with the previously proposed estimators of $S^{(2)}$ on 1D and 2D SU($2$) Heisenberg spin systems to reveal its superior performance and then use it to detect the entanglement scaling data of the N\'eel-to-VBS transition on 2D SU($N$) Heisenberg model with continuously varying $N$. Our ResumEE algorithm is efficient for precisely evaluating the entanglement entropy of SU($N$) spin models with continuous $N$ and reliable access to the conformal field theory data for the highly entangled quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.07813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Here, we investigate the fractal-lattice Hubbard model using various numerical methods: exact diagonalization, the self-consistent diagonalization of a (mean-field) Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian and state-of-the-art Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo. We focus on the Sierpinski triangle with Hausdorff dimension $1.58$ and consider several generations. In the tight-binding limit, we find compact localised states, which are also explained in terms of symmetry and linked to the formation of a ferrimagnetic phase at weak interaction. Simulations at half-filling revealed the persistence of this type of magnetic order for every value of interaction strength and a Mott transition for U/t $\sim$ 4.5. In addition, we found a remarkable dependence on the Hausdorff dimension regarding $i)$ the number of compact localised states in different generations, $ii)$ the scaling of the total many-body ground-state energy in the tight-binding limit, and $iii)$ the density of the states at the corners of the lattice for specific values of electronic filling. Moreover, in the presence of an intrinsic spin-orbit coupling, the zero-energy compact localized states become entangled and give rise to inner and outer corner modes.</description>

      <title>Competing Gauge Fields and Entropically-Driven Spin Liquid to Spin Liquid Transition in non-Kramers Pyrochlores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16682v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge theories are powerful tools in theoretical physics, allowing complex phenomena to be reduced to simple principles, and are used in both high-energy and condensed matter physics. In the latter context, gauge theories are becoming increasingly popular for capturing the intricate spin correlations in spin liquids, exotic states of matter in which the dynamics of quantum spins never ceases, even at absolute zero temperature. We consider a spin system on a three-dimensional pyrochlore lattice where emergent gauge fields not only describe the spin liquid behaviour at zero temperature but crucially determine the system's temperature evolution, with distinct gauge fields giving rise to different spin liquid phases in separate temperature regimes. Focusing first on classical spins, in an intermediate temperature regime, the system shows an unusual coexistence of emergent vector and matrix gauge fields where the former is known from classical spin ice systems while the latter has been associated with fractonic quasiparticles, a peculiar type of excitation with restricted mobility. Upon cooling, the system transitions into a low-temperature phase where an entropic selection mechanism depopulates the degrees of freedom associated with the matrix gauge field, rendering the system spin ice like. We further provide numerical evidence that in the corresponding quantum model, a spin liquid with coexisting vector and matrix gauge fields has a finite window of stability in the parameter space of spin interactions down to zero temperature. Finally, we discuss the relevance of our findings for non-Kramers pyrochlore materials.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ hyperkagome-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $S=1/2$ hyperkagome-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet allows to study the interplay of geometrical frustration and quantum as well as thermal fluctuations in three dimensions. We use 16 terms of a high-temperature series expansion complemented by the entropy-method interpolation to examine the specific heat and the uniform susceptibility of this model. We obtain thermodynamic quantities for several possible scenarios determined by the behavior of the specific heat as $T\to 0$: A power-law decay with the exponent $\alpha=1,2$ and also $3$ (gapless energy spectrum) or an exponential decay (gapped energy spectrum). All scenarios give rise to a low-temperature peak in $c(T)$ (almost a shoulder for $\alpha=1$) at $T&lt;0.05$, i.e., well below the main high-temperature peak. The functional form of the uniform susceptibility $\chi(T)$ below about $T=0.5$ depends strongly not only on the chosen scenario but also on an input parameter $\chi_0\equiv\chi(T=0)$. An estimate for the ground-state energy $e_0$ depends on the adopted specific scenario but is expected to lie between $-0.441$ and $-0.435$. In addition to the entropy-method interpolation we use the finite-temperature Lanczos method to calculate $c(T)$ and $\chi(T)$ for finite lattices of $N=24$ and $36$ sites. A combined view on both methods leads us to favor the gapless scenario with $\alpha=2$ (but $\alpha=1$ cannot be excluded) and finite $\chi_0$ around $0.1$.</description>

      <title>Stripe magnetic order and field-induced quantum criticality in the perfect triangular-lattice antiferromagnet CsCeSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13143v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The two-dimensional triangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) is a textbook example of frustrated magnetic systems. Despite its simplicity, the TLAF model exhibits a highly rich and complex magnetic phase diagram, featuring numerous distinct ground states that can be stabilized through frustrated next-nearest-neighbor couplings or anisotropy. In this paper, we report low-temperature magnetic properties of the TLAF material CsCeSe$_2$. The inelastic neutron scattering (INS) together with specific heat measurements and density functional theory calculations of crystalline electric field suggest that the ground state of Ce ions is a Kramers doublet with strong easy-plane anisotropy. Elastic neutron scattering measurements demonstrate the presence of stripe-$yz$ magnetic order that develops below $T_{\rm N} = 0.35$ K, with the zero-field ordered moment of $m_{\rm Ce} \approx 0.65~\mu_{\rm B}$. Application of magnetic field first increases the ordering temperature by about 20% at the intermediate field region and eventually suppresses the stripe order in favor of the field-polarized ferromagnetic state via a continuous quantum phase transition (QPT). The field-induced response demonstrates sizable anisotropy for different in-plane directions, $\mathbf{B}\parallel{}\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{B}\perp{}\mathbf{a}$, which indicates the presence of bond-dependent coupling in the spin Hamiltonian. We further show theoretically that the presence of anisotropic bond-dependent interactions can change the universality class of QPT for $\mathbf{B}\parallel{}\mathbf{a}$ and $\mathbf{B}\perp{}\mathbf{a}$.</description>

      <title>Quantum Spin Dynamics Due to Strong Kitaev Interactions in the Triangular-Lattice Antiferromagnet CsCeSe$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extraordinary properties of the Kitaev model have motivated an intense search for new physics in materials that combine geometrical and bond frustration. In this work, we employ inelastic neutron scattering, spin wave theory, and exact diagonalization to study the spin dynamics in the perfect triangular-lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) CsCeSe$_2$. This material orders into a stripe phase, which is demonstrated to arise as a consequence of the off-diagonal bond-dependent terms in the spin Hamiltonian. By studying the spin dynamics at intermediate fields, we identify an interaction between the single-magnon state and the two-magnon continuum that causes decay of coherent magnon excitations, level repulsion, and transfer of spectral weight to the continuum that are controlled by the strength of the magnetic field. Our results provide a microscopic mechanism for the stabilization of the stripe phase in TLAF and show how complex many-body physics can be present in the spin dynamics in a magnet with strong Kitaev coupling even in an ordered ground state.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06236v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mean-field theories have proven to be efficient tools for exploring diverse phases of matter, complementing alternative methods that are more precise but also more computationally demanding. Conventional mean-field theories often fall short in capturing quantum fluctuations, which restricts their applicability to systems with significant quantum effects. In this article, we propose an improved mean-field theory, density-matrix mean-field theory (DMMFT). DMMFT constructs effective Hamiltonians, incorporating quantum environments shaped by entanglements, quantified by the reduced density matrices. Therefore, it offers a systematic and unbiased approach to account for the effects of fluctuations and entanglements in quantum ordered phases. As demonstrative examples, we show that DMMFT can not only quantitatively evaluate the renormalization of order parameters induced by quantum fluctuations, but can also detect the topological quantum phases. Additionally, we discuss the extensions of DMMFT for systems at finite temperatures and those with disorders. Our work provides an efficient approach to explore phases exhibiting unconventional quantum orders, which can be particularly beneficial for investigating frustrated spin systems in high spatial dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03650v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We synthesized the ferromagnetic EuAgP semiconductor and conducted a comprehensive study of its crystalline, magnetic, heat capacity, band gap, and magnetoresistance properties. Our investigation utilized a combination of X-ray diffraction, optical, and PPMS DynaCool measurements. EuAgP adopts a hexagonal structure with the $P6_3/mmc$ space group. As the temperature decreases, it undergoes a magnetic phase transition from high-temperature paramagnetism to low-temperature ferromagnetism. We determined the ferromagnetic transition temperature to be $T_{\textrm{C}} =$ 16.45(1) K by fitting the measured magnetic susceptibility using a Curie-Weiss law. Heat capacity analysis of EuAgP considered contributions from electrons, phonons, and magnons, revealing $\eta$ = 0.03 J/mol/$\textrm{K}^\textrm{2}$, indicative of semiconducting behavior. Additionally, we calculated a band gap of $\sim$ 1.324(4) eV based on absorption spectrum measurements. The resistivity versus temperature of EuAgP measured in the absence of an applied magnetic field shows a pronounced peak around $T_{\textrm{C}}$, which diminishes rapidly with increasing applied magnetic fields, ranging from 1 to 14 T. An intriguing phenomenon emerges in the form of a distinct magnetoresistance transition, shifting from positive (e.g., 1.95\% at 300 K and 14 T) to negative (e.g., -30.73\% at 14.25 K and 14 T) as the temperature decreases. This behavior could be attributed to spin-disordered scattering.</description>

Abstract: Anomaly analysis has been an important and powerful tool in studying nonperturbative physics for decades. The anomaly inflow mechanism provides an intuitive interpretation of the bulk-boundary correspondence in topological systems. In this work, we study global anomalies in systems with symmetry-preserving Luttinger surfaces, i.e. the manifolds of fermionic Green's function zeros in the momentum space at zero energy, described by nonlocal effective theories. We view the nonlocal effective theories as a result of integrating out some low energy states. Assuming that the states integrated out do not make extra contributions to the anomalies, we discuss the simplest Lagrangian describing a gapless Dirac zero and a two-pole variant, their global anomalies, and the bulk-boundary correspondence. We then consider the constraints on possible phases with Green's function zeros of Dirac type, such as non-Fermi liquids and emergent gapless quasiparticles on Luttinger surfaces. We also provide some perspectives on why the nonlocal fermionic effective theory discussed by Golterman and Shamir (arXiv: 2311.12790) is not a suitable starting point for a symmetrically gapped phase.</description>

      <title>The Role of Quantum Metastability and the Perspective of Quantum Glassiness in Kitaev Fractional Spin Dynamics: An NMR Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The suppression of magnetic order and the detection of a half-quantized thermal Hall effect in {\alpha}-RuCl3 under an external magnetic field have sparked significant debate, whether these phenomena point to spin fractionalization, as posited by the Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) model, or if they arise from a more conventional mechanism in an antiferromagnetically ordered spin state. Here, through 23Na NMR relaxation measurements on the layered cobaltate Na2Co2TeO6 at two distinct magnetic fields (4.7 and 9.4 Tesla), we provide compelling evidence supporting a variant interpretation. While upon cooling, the NMR relaxation times align with the temperature dependence predicted by Kitaev fractional spin excitations, below 10 K, a dynamically heterogeneous state is detected with Quantum Spin Glass (QSG) characteristics. In this state, the spin fractionalization dynamics unfold over markedly different time scales, and are characterized by quantum metastability, inducing prolonged equilibration as T-&gt;0. This observation challenges the prevailing view of a primarily homogeneous QSL state, as the ground state of tangible Kitaev systems.</description>

      <title>Charge and spin instabilities in superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.07154v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure, we explore its potential charge and spin instabilities through combined model analysis and first-principles calculations. Taking into account the small charge-transfer nature of high valence nickel, a fully correlated two-cluster model identifies a lattice-coupled charge instability characterized by substantial short-range fluctuations of oxygen holes. This instability is corroborated by density-functional-theory plus $U$ calculations that also reveal a strong tendency towards concurrent antiferromagnetic ordering. The charge, spin, and associated lattice instabilities are significantly suppressed with increasing external pressure, contributing to the emergence of superconductivity in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Carrier doping is found to effectively suppress these instabilities, suggesting a viable strategy to stabilize a superconducting phase under ambient pressure.</description>

Abstract: Flocks of animals represent a fascinating archetype of collective behavior in the macroscopic classical world, where the constituents, such as birds, concertedly perform motions and actions as if being one single entity. Here, we address the outstanding question of whether flocks can also form in the microscopic world at the quantum level. For that purpose, we introduce the concept of active quantum matter by formulating a class of models of active quantum particles on a one-dimensional lattice. We provide both analytical and large-scale numerical evidence that these systems can give rise to quantum flocks. A key finding is that these flocks, unlike classical ones, exhibit distinct quantum properties by developing strong quantum coherence over long distances. We propose that quantum flocks could be experimentally observed in Rydberg atom arrays. Our work paves the way towards realizing the intriguing collective behaviors of biological active particles in quantum matter systems. We expect that this opens up a path towards a yet totally unexplored class of nonequilibrium quantum many-body systems with unique properties.</description>

      <title>Post-experiment coincidence detection techniques for direct detection of two-body correlations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.16746v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is one challenge to develop experimental techniques for direct detection of the many-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons, which exhibit a variety of unsolved mysteries. In this article, we present a post-experiment coincidence counting method and propose two post-experiment coincidence detection techniques, post-experiment coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and post-experiment coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS). By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the post-experiment coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The post-experiment coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the pulse-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with pulse photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Multiferroic kinks and spin-flop transition in Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$ from first principles</title>

Abstract: Magnetoelectric multiferroics are key materials for next-generation spintronic devices due to their entangled magnetic and ferroelectric properties. Spiral multiferroics possess ferroelectric polarization and are particularly promising for electric control of magnetism and magnetic control of ferroelectricity. In this work, we uncover long-period incommensurate states characterized by unique multiferroic kinks in corundum nickelate Ni$_{2}$InSbO$_6$, a member of a promising family of polar magnets. Utilizing a 2-orbital $S=1$ model, we derive formulas for Heisenberg and anisotropic magnetic exchanges and magnetically-induced polarization, enabling their calculations from first principles. We use these parameters in Monte Carlo and Landau theory-based calculations to reproduce experimentally observed magnetic structures and polarization dependence on the magnetic field. We predict magnetic phase transitions between flat spiral, conical spiral, canted antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states under increasing magnetic fields. Kinks in the spiral phases repel each other through a Yukawa-like potential arising from exchange of massive magnons. We also find that suitably directed electric fields can be used to stabilize the ferromagnetic and spiral states. The findings open a new pathway to predictive first-principles modelling of multiferroics and will inspire experiments and technological applications based on multiferroic kinks.</description>

      <title>Correlation-induced Fermi surface evolution and topological crystalline superconductivity in CeRh2As2</title>

Abstract: Locally noncentrosymmetric structures in crystals are attracting much attention owing to emergent phenomena associated with the sublattice degree of freedom. The newly discovered heavy fermion superconductor CeRh$_2$As$_2$ is considered to be an excellent realization of this class. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy experiments recently observed low-energy spectra of electron and hole bands and characteristic Van Hove singularities, stimulating us to explore the electronic correlation effect on the band structure. In this Letter, we theoretically study the electronic state and topological superconductivity from first principles. Owing to the Coulomb repulsion $U$ of Ce 4$f$ electrons, the low-energy band structure is modified in accordance with the experimental result. We show that Fermi surfaces change significantly from a complicated three-dimensional structure to a simple two-dimensional one. Fermi surface formulas for one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariants in class D indicate topological crystalline superconductivity protected by the glide symmetry in a broad region for $U$. The classification of superconducting gap structure reveals topologically protected excitation gap and node. Our findings of the correlation-induced evolution of electronic structure provide a basis to clarify the unusual phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$ including superconductivity, magnetic order, and quadrupole density wave, and accelerate the search for topological superconductivity in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

      <title>CdTe and HgTe doped with V, Cr, and Mn -- prospects for the quantum anomalous Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using first principle calculations we examine properties of (Cd,V)Te, (Cd,Cr)Te, (Hg,V)Te, and (Hg,Cr)Te relevant to the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), such as the position of V- and Cr- derived energy levels and the exchange interactions between magnetic ions. We consider CdTe and HgTe, containing 12.5% of cation-substitutional V or Cr ions in comparison to the well-known case of (Cd,Mn)Te and (Hg,Mn)Te, and examine their suitability for the fabrication of ferromagnetic barriers or ferromagnetic topological quantum wells, respectively. To account for the strong correlation of transition metal d electrons we employ hybrid functionals with different mixing parameters aHSE focusing on aHSE = 0.32, which better reproduces the experimental band gaps in HgTe, CdTe, Hg0.875Mn0.125Te, and Cd0.875Mn0.125Te. We find that Cr, like Mn, acts as an isoelectronic dopant but V can be an in-gap donor in CdTe and a resonant donor in HgTe, similar to the case of Fe in HgSe. From the magnetic point of view, Cr-doping results in a ferromagnetic phase within the general gradient approximation (GGA) but interactions become antiferromagnetic within hybrid functionals. However, (Hg,V)Te is a ferromagnet within both exchange-correlation functionals in a stark contrast to (Hg,Mn)Te for which robust antiferromagnetic coupling is found theoretically and experimentally. Furthermore, we establish that the Jahn-Teller effect is relevant only in the case of Cr-doping. Considering lower defect concentrations in HgTe-based quantum wells compared to (Bi,Sb)3Te2 layers, our results imply that HgTe quantum wells or (Cd,Hg)Te barriers containing either V or Cr show advantages over (Bi,Sb,Cr,V)3Te2-based QAHE systems but whether (i) ferromagnetic coupling will dominate in the Cr case and (ii) V will not introduce too many electrons to the quantum well is to be checked experimentally</description>

      <title>Higgs-Confinement Transitions in QCD from Symmetry Protected Topological Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16898v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gauge theories with fundamental matter there is typically no sharp way to distinguish confining and Higgs regimes, e.g. using generalized global symmetries acting on loop order parameters. It is standard lore that these two regimes are continuously connected, as has been explicitly demonstrated in certain lattice and continuum models. We point out that Higgsing and confinement sometimes lead to distinct symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases -- necessarily separated by a phase transition -- for ordinary global symmetries. We present explicit examples in 3+1 dimensions, obtained by adding elementary Higgs fields and Yukawa couplings to QCD while preserving parity P and time reversal T. In a suitable scheme, the confining phases of these theories are trivial SPTs, while their Higgs phases are characterized by non-trivial P- and T-invariant theta-angles $\theta_f, \theta_g = \pi$ for flavor or gravity background gauge fields, i.e. they are topological insulators or superconductors. Finally, we consider conventional three-flavor QCD (without elementary Higgs fields) at finite $U(1)_B$ baryon-number chemical potential $\mu_B$, which preserves P and T. At very large $\mu_B$, three-flavor QCD is known to be a completely Higgsed color superconductor that also spontaneously breaks $U(1)_B$. We argue that this high-density phase is in fact a gapless SPT, with a gravitational theta-angle $\theta_g = \pi$ that safely co-exists with the $U(1)_B$ Nambu-Goldstone boson. We explain why this SPT motivates unexpected transitions in the QCD phase diagram, as well as anomalous surface modes at the boundary of quark-matter cores inside neutron stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16631v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The presence of quantum noises inherent to real physical systems can strongly impact the physics in hybrid quantum circuits with local random unitaries and mid-circuit measurements. The quantum noises with a size-independent occurring probability can lead to the disappearance of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition and the emergence of a single area-law phase. In this work, we investigate the effects of quantum noises with size-dependent probabilities $q=p/L^{\alpha}$ where $\alpha$ represents the scaling exponent. We have identified a noise-induced entanglement phase transition from a volume law to a power (area) law in the presence (absence) of measurements as $p$ increases when $\alpha=1$. With the help of an effective statistical model, we reveal that the phase transition is of first-order arising from the competition between two types of spin configurations and shares the same analytical understanding as the noise-induced coding transition. This unified picture further deepens the understanding of the connection between entanglement behavior and the capacity of information protection. When $\alpha \neq 1$, one spin configuration always dominates regardless of $p$ and thus the phase transition disappears. Moreover, we highlight the difference between the effects of size-dependent bulk noise and boundary noises. We validate our analytical predictions with extensive numerical results from stabilizer circuit simulations.</description>

      <title>Towards Quantum Simulation of Non-Markovian Open Quantum Dynamics: A Universal and Compact Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-Markovianity, the intricate dependence of an open quantum system on its temporal evolution history, holds tremendous implications across various scientific disciplines. However, accurately characterizing the complex non-Markovian effects has posed a formidable challenge for numerical simulations. While quantum computing technologies show promise, a universal theory enabling practical quantum algorithm implementation has been elusive. We address this gap by introducing the dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation in second quantization (DQME-SQ). This exact and compact theory offers two key advantages: representability by quantum circuits and universal applicability to any Gaussian environment. We demonstrate these capabilities through digital quantum simulations of non-Markovian dissipative dynamics in both bosonic and fermionic environments. The DQME-SQ framework opens a new horizon for the efficient exploration of complex open quantum systems by leveraging the rapidly advancing quantum computing technologies.</description>

      <title>Holographic dual effective field theory for an SYK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12097v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an emergent holographic dual description in the Luttinger-Ward functional approach, where the renormalization group (RG) flows of collective bi-local fields appear manifestly in the bulk effective action with an emergent extra dimension. This holographic dual effective field theory reproduces $1/N$ quantum corrections in a self-consistent manner when we take the UV limit in the bulk effective action. Going into the IR regime in the extra dimension, we observe that a partial class of the field theoretic $1/N$, $1/N^{2}$, ... quantum corrections are resummed in the all-loop order and reorganized to form a holographic dual effective field theory in a large $N$ fashion living on the one-higher dimensional spacetime. In this study, we apply this theoretical framework into an Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Taking the large $N$ limit in the holographic dual effective field theory, we obtain nonlinearly coupled second-order bulk differential equations of motion for the three bi-local order-parameter fields of fermion self-energy, Green's function, and polarization function. Here, both UV and IR boundary conditions are derived self-consistently from the boundary effective action. We solve these highly intertwined nonlinear differential equations based on the so called matching method. Our ansatz for the bi-local order-parameter fields coincide with the conformally invariant solution of the field theoretic large $N$ limit in the UV limit, but their overall coefficients $RG-flow$ along the extra dimensional space, respectively, reflecting effects of higher-order quantum corrections. As a result, we find an insulating behavior, where the self-energy diverges at IR. ...</description>

Abstract: We study SU(4)-symmetric ultracold fermionic mixture in the cubic optical lattice with the variable tunneling amplitude along one particular crystallographic axis in the crossover region from the two- to three-dimensional spatial geometry. To theoretically analyze emerging magnetic phases and physical observables, we describe the system in the framework of the Fermi-Hubbard model and apply dynamical mean-field theory. We show that in two limiting cases of anisotropy there are two phases with different antiferromagnetic orderings in the zero temperature limit and determine a region of their coexistence. We also study the stability regions of different magnetically-ordered states and density profiles of the gas in the harmonic optical trap.</description>

      <title>Quantum Many-Body Scars for Arbitrary Integer Spin in 2+1D Abelian Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08892v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of Quantum Many-Body Scars, which prevents thermalization from certain initial states after a long time, has been established across different quantum many-body systems. These include gauge theories corresponding to spin-1/2 quantum link models. Establishing quantum scars in gauge theories with high spin is not accessible with existing numerical methods, which rely on exact diagonalization. We systematically identify scars for pure gauge theories with arbitrarily large integer spin $S$ in $2+1$D, where the electric field is restricted to $2S+1$ states per link. Through an explicit analytic construction, we show that the presence of scars is widespread in $2+1$D gauge theories for arbitrary integer spin. We confirm these findings numerically for small truncated spin and $S=1$ quantum link models. Our analytic construction establishes the presence of scars far beyond volumes and spins that can be probed with existing numerical methods and can guide quantum simulation experiments toward interesting non-equilibrium phenomena, inaccessible otherwise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14145v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Artificial quantum systems have emerged as indispensable platforms to realize exotic topological matter in a well-controlled manner. Here, we demonstrate topological quantum Heisenberg spin lattices, engineered with spin chains and two-dimensional spin arrays using spin 1/2 atoms on insulating films in a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM). We engineered with atomic precision both topological and trivial phases of the quantum spin model, realizing first- and second-order topological quantum magnets. Their many-body excitations were probed by single-atom electron spin resonance with ultrahigh energy resolution. The atomically-localized magnetic field of the STM tip allows us to directly visualize various topological bound modes including topological edge states, topological defects, and higher-order corner modes. Our results provide an important bottom-up approach to simulating exotic quantum many-body phases of interacting spins.</description>

Abstract: We study the operator algebra of extended conformal defects in more than two spacetime dimensions. Such algebra structure encodes the combined effect of multiple impurities on physical observables at long distances as well as the interactions among the impurities. These features are formalized by a fusion product which we define for a pair of defects, after isolating divergences that capture the effective potential between the defects, which generalizes the usual Casimir energy. We discuss general properties of the corresponding fusion algebra and contrast with the more familiar cases that involve topological defects. We also describe the relation to a different defect setup in the shape of a wedge. We provide explicit examples to illustrate these properties using line defects and interfaces in the Wilson-Fisher CFT and the Gross-Neveu(-Yukawa) CFT and determine the defect fusion data thereof.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Confinement/deconfinement, captivating attributes of high-energy elementary particles, have recently garnered wide attention in quantum simulations based on cold atoms. Yet, the partial confinement, an intermediate state between the confinement and deconfinement, remains underexplored. The partial confinement encapsulates the phenomenon that the confining behavior of charged particles is contingent upon their relative positions. In this paper, we demonstrate that the spin-1 quantum link model provides an excellent platform for exploring partial confinement. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the physics emerging from partial confinement in both the context of equilibrium and non-equilibrium dynamics. Potential experimental setups using cold atoms are also discussed. Our work offers a simple and feasible routine for the study of confinement-related physics in the state-of-the-art artificial quantum systems subject to gauge symmetries.</description>

      <title>Generalized cluster states from Hopf algebras: non-invertible symmetry and Hopf tensor network representation</title>

Abstract: Cluster states are crucial resources for measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC). It exhibits symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order, thus also playing a crucial role in studying topological phases. We present the construction of cluster states based on Hopf algebras. By generalizing the finite group valued qudit to a Hopf algebra valued qudit and introducing the generalized Pauli-X operator based on the regular action of the Hopf algebra, as well as the generalized Pauli-Z operator based on the irreducible representation action on the Hopf algebra, we develop a comprehensive theory of Hopf qudits. We demonstrate that non-invertible symmetry naturally emerges for Hopf qudits. Subsequently, for a bipartite graph termed the cluster graph, we assign the identity state and trivial representation state to even and odd vertices, respectively. Introducing the edge entangler as controlled regular action, we provide a general construction of Hopf cluster states. To ensure the commutativity of the edge entangler, we propose a method to construct a cluster lattice for any triangulable manifold. We use the 1d cluster state as an example to illustrate our construction. As this serves as a promising candidate for SPT phases, we construct the gapped Hamiltonian for this scenario and provide a detailed discussion of its non-invertible symmetries. We demonstrate that the 1d cluster state model is equivalent to the quasi-1d Hopf quantum double model with one rough boundary and one smooth boundary. We also discuss the generalization of the Hopf cluster state model to the Hopf ladder model through symmetry topological field theory. Furthermore, we introduce the Hopf tensor network representation of Hopf cluster states by integrating the tensor representation of structure constants with the string diagrams of the Hopf algebra, which can be used to solve the Hopf cluster state model.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11719v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in 2+1d. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in 5+1d with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We use a Peierls argument to demonstrate the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probablistic local cellular-automaton decoder.</description>

      <title>Dissipative electrically driven fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider entropy generating flows for fluids that achieve a steady state in the presence of a driving electric field. Having chosen one among the space of stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and momentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we find that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent conductivity must be identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to the observable AC or DC charge conductivities.</description>

      <title>Observation of vortex stripes in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum vortices are fundamentally important for properties of superconductors. In conventional type-II superconductor they determine the magnetic response of the system and tend to form regular lattices. UTe$_2$ is a recently discovered heavy fermion superconductor exhibiting many anomalous macroscopic behaviors. However, the question whether it has a multicomponent order parameter remains open. Here, we study magnetic properties of UTe$_2$ by employing scanning superconducting quantum interference device microscopy. We find vortex behavior which is very different from that in ordinary superconductors. We imaged vortices generated by cooling in magnetic field applied along different crystalline directions. While a small out-of-plane magnetic field produces typical isolated vortices, higher field generates vortex stripe patterns which evolve with vortex density. The stripes form at different locations and along different directions in the surface plane when the vortices are crystalized along the crystalline b or c axes. The behavior is reproduced by our simulation based on an anisotropic two-component order parameter. This study shows that UTe$_2$ has a nontrivial disparity of multiple length scales, placing constraints on multicomponent superconductivity. The tendency of vortex stripe formation and their control by external field may be useful in fluxonics applications.</description>

      <title>Representation Theory of Solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solitons in two-dimensional quantum field theory exhibit patterns of degeneracies and associated selection rules on scattering amplitudes. We develop a representation theory that captures these intriguing features of solitons. This representation theory is based on an algebra we refer to as the "strip algebra", $\textrm{Str}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M})$, which is defined in terms of the non-invertible symmetry, $\mathcal{C},$ a fusion category, and its action on boundary conditions encoded by a module category, $\mathcal{M}$. The strip algebra is a $C^*$-weak Hopf algebra, a fact which can be elegantly deduced by quantizing the three-dimensional Drinfeld center TQFT, $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}),$ on a spatial manifold with corners. These structures imply that the representation category of the strip algebra is also a unitary fusion category which we identify with a dual category $\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}.$ We present a straightforward method for analyzing these representations in terms of quiver diagrams where nodes are vacua and arrows are solitons and provide examples demonstrating how the representation theory reproduces known degeneracies and selection rules of soliton scattering. Our analysis provides the general framework for analyzing non-invertible symmetry on manifolds with boundary and applies both to the case of boundaries at infinity, relevant to particle physics, and boundaries at finite distance, relevant in conformal field theory or condensed matter systems.</description>
