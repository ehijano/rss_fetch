      <title>Optimal Insurance in a Monopoly: Dual Utilities with Hidden Risk Attitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a monopoly insurance market with a risk-neutral profit-maximizing insurer and a consumer with Yaari Dual Utility preferences that distort the given continuous loss distribution. The insurer observes the loss distribution but not the risk attitude of the consumer, proxied by a distortion function drawn from a continuum of types. We characterize the profit-maximizing, incentive-compatible, and individually rational menus of insurance contracts, show that equilibria are separating, and provide key properties thereof. Notably, insurance coverage and premia are monotone in the level of risk aversion; the most risk-averse consumer receives full insurance $(\textit{efficiency at the top})$; the monopoly absorbs all surplus from the least-risk averse consumer; and consumers with a higher level of risk aversion induce a higher expected profit for the insurer. Under certain regularity conditions, equilibrium contracts can be characterized in terms of the marginal loss retention per type of consumer, and they consist of menus of layered deductible contracts, where each such layered structure is determined by the risk type of the consumer. In addition, we examine the effect of a fixed insurance provision cost on equilibria. We show that if the fixed cost is prohibitively high, then there will be no $\textit{ex ante}$ gains from trade. However, when trade occurs, separating equilibrium contracts always outperform pooling equilibrium contracts, and they are identical to those obtained in the absence of fixed costs, with the exception that only part of the menu is excluded. The excluded contracts are those designed for consumers with relatively lower risk aversion, who are less valuable to the insurer. Finally, we characterize incentive-efficient menus of contracts in the context of an arbitrary type space.</description>

      <title>Ordered Probabilistic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel perspective by linking ordered probabilistic choice to copula theory, a mathematical framework for modeling dependencies in multivariate distributions. Each representation of ordered probabilistic choice behavior can be associated with a copula, enabling the analysis of representations through established results from copula theory. We provide functional forms to describe the "extremal" representations of an ordered probabilistic choice behavior and their distinctive structural properties. The resulting functional forms act as an "identification method" that uniquely generates heterogeneous choice types and their weights. These results provide valuable tools for analysts to identify micro-level behavioral heterogeneity from macro-level observable data.</description>

      <title>Matching, Unanticipated Experiences, Divorce, Flirting, Rematching, Etc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study dynamic decentralized two-sided matching in which players may encounter unanticipated experiences. As they become aware of these experiences, they may change their preferences over players on the other side of the market. Consequently, they may get ``divorced'' and rematch again with other agents, which may lead to further unanticipated experiences etc. A matching is stable if there is absence of pairwise common belief in blocking. Stable matchings can be destabilized by unanticipated experiences. Yet, we show that there exist self-confirming outcomes that are stable and do not lead to further unanticipated experiences. We introduce a natural decentralized matching process that, at each period assigns probability $1 - \varepsilon$ to the satisfaction of a mutual optimal blocking pair (if it exists) and picks any optimal blocking pair otherwise. The parameter $\varepsilon$ is interpreted as a friction of the matching market. We show that for any decentralized matching process, frictions are necessary for convergence to stability even without unawareness. Our process converges to self-confirming stable outcomes. Further, we allow for bilateral communication/flirting that changes the awareness and say that a matching is flirt-proof stable if there is absence of communication leading to pairwise common belief in blocking. We show that our natural decentralized matching process converges to flirt-proof self-confirming outcomes.</description>

      <title>Revealed Bayesian Persuasion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When is random choice generated by a decision maker (DM) who is Bayesian-persuaded by a sender? In this paper, I consider a DM whose state-dependent preferences are known to an analyst, yet chooses stochastically as a function of the state. I provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the dataset to be consistent with the DM being Bayesian persuaded by an unobserved sender who generates a distribution of signals to ex-ante optimize the sender's expected payoff.</description>

      <title>Graphon games and an idealized limit of large network games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphon games are a class of games with a continuum of agents, introduced to approximate the strategic interactions in large network games. The first result of this study is an equilibrium existence theorem in graphon games, under the same conditions as those in network games. We prove the existence of an equilibrium in a graphon game with an infinite-dimensional strategy space, under the continuity and quasi-concavity of the utility functions. The second result characterizes Nash equilibria in graphon games as the limit points of asymptotic Nash equilibria in large network games. If a sequence of large network games converges to a graphon game, any convergent sequence of asymptotic Nash equilibria in these large network games also converges to a Nash equilibrium of the graphon game. In addition, for any graphon game and its equilibrium, there exists a sequence of large network games that converges to the graphon game and has asymptotic Nash equilibria converging to the equilibrium. These results suggest that the concept of a graphon game is an idealized limit of large network games as the number of players tends to infinity.</description>

      <title>Local non-bossiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01398v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The student-optimal stable mechanism (DA), the most popular mechanism in school choice, is the only one that is stable and strategy-proof. However, when DA is implemented, a student can change the schools of others without changing her own. We show that this drawback is limited: a student cannot change her schoolmates while remaining in the same school. We refer to this new property as local non-bossiness and use it to provide a new characterization of DA that does not rely on stability. Furthermore, we show that local non-bossiness plays a crucial role in providing incentives to be truthful when students have preferences over their colleagues. As long as students first consider the school to which they are assigned and then their schoolmates, DA induces the only stable and strategy-proof mechanism. There is limited room to expand this preference domain without compromising the existence of a stable and strategy-proof mechanism.</description>
