      <title>Effective description of Taylor dispersion in strongly corrugated channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Taylor dispersion in periodic but highly corrugated channels is studied. Exact analytical expressions for the long-time diffusion constant and drift along the channel are derived to next-to-leading order in the limit of small channel period. Using these results we show how an effective model for Taylor dispersion in tortuous porous media can be framed in terms of dispersion in a uniform channel with absorption/desorption at its surface, an effective slip length for the flow at the surface and an effective, universal, diffusion constant on the surface. This work thus extends the concept of an effective slip-length for hydrodynamics flows to Taylor dispersion by those flows. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations, and present a robust method to understand and upscale the transport properties of flows in porous media.</description>

      <title>Force-free kinetic inference of entropy production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating entropy production, which quantifies irreversibility and energy dissipation, remains a significant challenge despite its central role in nonequilibrium physics. We propose a novel method for estimating the mean entropy production rate $\sigma$ that relies solely on position traces, bypassing the need for flux or microscopic force measurements. Starting from a recently introduced variance sum rule, we express $\sigma$ in terms of measurable steady-state correlation functions which we link to previously studied kinetic quantities, known as traffic and inflow rate. Under realistic constraints of limited access to dynamical degrees of freedom, we derive efficient bounds on $\sigma$ by leveraging the information contained in the system's traffic, enabling partial but meaningful estimates of $\sigma$. We benchmark our results across several orders of magnitude in $\sigma$ using two models: a linear stochastic system and a nonlinear model for spontaneous hair-bundle oscillations. Our approach offers a practical and versatile framework for investigating entropy production in nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic stresses in a multi-species suspension of active Janus colloids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A realistic description of active particles should include interactions with the medium, commonly a momentum-conserving simple fluid, in which they are suspended. In this work, we consider a multi-species suspension of self-diffusiophoretic Janus colloids interacting via chemical and hydrodynamic fields. Through a systematic coarse-graining of the microscopic dynamics, we calculate the multi-component contribution to the hydrodynamic stress tensor of the incompressible Stokesian fluid in which the particles are immersed. For a single species, we find that the strength of the stress produced by the gradients of the number density field is determined by the particles' self-propulsion and chemotactic alignment, and can be tuned to be either contractile or extensile. For a multi-species system, we unveil how different forms of activity modify the stress tensor, and how non-reciprocity in hydrodynamic interactions emerges in an active binary mixture.</description>

      <title>Critically slow Hilbert-space ergodicity in quantum morphic drives</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The maximum entropy principle is foundational for statistical analyses of complex dynamics. This principle has been challenged by the findings of a previous work [Phys. Rev. X 7, 031034 (2017)], where it was argued that a quantum system driven in time by a certain aperiodic sequence without any explicit symmetries, dubbed the Thue-Morse drive, gives rise to emergent nonergodic steady states which are underpinned by effective conserved quantities. Here, we resolve this apparent tension. We rigorously prove that the Thue-Morse drive achieves a very strong notion of quantum ergodicity in the long-time limit: the time evolution of any initial state uniformly visits every corner of its Hilbert space. On the other hand, we find the dynamics also approximates a Floquet drive for arbitrarily long albeit finite periods of time with no characteristic timescale, resulting in a scale-free ergodic dynamics we call critically slow complete Hilbert-space ergodicity (CS-CHSE). Furthermore, numerical studies reveal that CS-CHSE is not specific to the Thue-Morse drive and is in fact exhibited by many other aperiodic drives derived from morphic sequences, i.e., words derived from repeatedly applying substitution rules on basic characters. Our work presents a new class of dynamics in time-dependent quantum systems where full ergodicity is eventually attained, but only after astronomically long times.</description>

      <title>Gradient Flows and the Curvature of Theory Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06940v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The metric and potential associated with the gradient property of renormalisation group flow in multiscalar models in $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions are studied. The metric is identified with the Zamolodchikov metric of nearly marginal operators on the sphere. An explicit form for the associated Ricci scalar in $d=4-\varepsilon$ is derived, which shows that the space of multiscalar field theories is curved. The potential is identified with a quantity $\widetilde{F}$ that was previously proposed as a weakly monotonic function interpolating between the $a$-theorem in four dimensions and the $F$-theorem in three dimensions. This implies that the $\widetilde{F}$-theorem can be extended perturbatively to a theorem about gradient flow in $d=4-\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Individual particle persistence antagonizes global ordering in populations of nematically-aligning self-propelled particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from individual to collective motion plays a significant role in many biological processes. While the implications of different types of particle-particle interactions for the emergence of particular modes of collective motion have been well studied, it is unclear how particular types of individual migration patterns influence collective motion. Here, motivated by swarming bacteria Myxococcus xanthus, we investigate the combined effects of the individual pattern of migration and of particle-particle interactions, on the emergence of collective migration. We analyze the effects of a feature of individual pattern migration, the persistence of motion, on the collective properties of the system that emerge from interactions among individuals; in particular, when nematic velocity alignment interaction mediates collective dynamics. We find, through computer simulations and mathematical analysis, that an initially disordered migratory state can become globally ordered by increasing either, the particle-particle alignment interaction strength or the persistence of individual migration. In contrast, we find that persistence prevents the emergence of global nematic order when both persistence and nematic alignment are comparatively high. We conclude that behavior at the population level does not only depend on interactions between individuals but also on the individuals' own intrinsic behavior.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Enabled Entropy Accumulation in Open Quantum Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In closed quantum many-body systems, initially localized information spreads throughout the system and becomes highly complex. This phenomenon, known as information scrambling, is closely related to entropy growth and quantum thermalization. Recent studies have shown that dissipation in open systems can hinder information scrambling, driving the system into a dissipative phase when the system-bath coupling is strong. However, the signature of this scrambling transition in entropy dynamics remains unexplored. In this work, we unveil a novel phenomenon in open quantum systems, termed entropy accumulation, which occurs exclusively within the scrambling phase. We consider a setup in which a probe is weakly coupled to a system that is already interacting with a bath. We calculate the increase in the second R\'enyi entropy induced by an external impulse on the system, after tracing out the probe. Despite the system-probe coupling being weak, the entropy continues to increase and eventually saturates at a finite value due to operator growth. In contrast, the entropy increase is limited by the coupling strength in the dissipative phase. The theoretical prediction is derived from both general arguments and an explicit example using generalized Boltzmann equations. Our results offer new insights into the intriguing relationship between entropy dynamics and information scrambling in open quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: Diabatic quantum annealing aims to mitigate the challenges posed by small energy gaps and decoherence in quantum optimization by exploiting nonadiabatic transitions. In this paper, we compare the performance of two diabatic protocols in a realistic, dissipative setting using the maximum weighted independent set problem as a test case, showing that the potential advantages of diabatic protocols are strongly reduced in the presence of dissipation. Our results highlight the importance of evaluating quantum annealing strategies under practical conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While hard-sphere models form the foundation of theoretical condensed matter physics, real systems often exhibit some degree of softness. We present a theoretical and numerical study of a class of nearly hard-sphere systems, generalized Hertzian hyperspheres, where particles interact via a finite-range repulsive potential that allows slight overlaps. Well-studied examples of this class include particles with harmonic repulsions, Hertzian spheres, and Hertzian disks. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic properties, coexistence pressures, and scaling laws governing structure and dynamics. The theory predicts how quantities scale with temperature, density, spatial dimension, and potential softness. These theoretical predictions are tested through numerical simulations in dimensions ranging from one to eight.</description>

      <title>Effective grand-canonical description of condensation in negative-temperature regimes</title>

Abstract: The observation of negative-temperature states in the localized phase of the Discrete Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DNLS) equation has challenged statistical mechanics for a long time. For isolated systems, they can emerge as stationary extended states through a large-deviation mechanism occurring for finite sizes, while they are formally unstable in grand-canonical setups, being associated to an unlimited growth of the condensed fraction. Here, we show that negative-temperature states in open setups are metastable and their lifetime $\tau$ is exponentially long with the temperature, $\tau \approx \exp(\lambda |T|)$ (for $T&lt;0$). A general expression for $\lambda$ is obtained in the case of a simplified stochastic model of non-interacting particles. In the DNLS model, the presence of an adiabatic invariant, makes $\lambda$ even larger because of the resulting freezing of the breather dynamics. This mechanism, based on the existence of two conservation laws, provides a new perspective over the statistical description of condensation processes.</description>

      <title>Efficient Optimization of Variational Autoregressive Networks with Natural Gradient</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Estimating free energy is a fundamental problem in statistical mechanics. Recently, machine-learning-based methods, particularly the variational autoregressive networks (VANs) have been proposed to minimize variational free energy and to approximate the Boltzmann distribution. VAN enjoys notable advantages, including the exact computation of the normalized joint distribution and fast sampling, which are critical features often missing in Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. However, VAN also faces significant computational challenges. These include difficulties in the optimization of variational free energy in a complicated parameter space and slow convergence of learning. In this work, we introduce an optimization technique based on natural gradients to the VAN framework, namely ng-VAN, to enhance the learning efficiency and accuracy of the conventional VAN. The method has computational complexity cubic in the batch size rather than in the number of model parameters, hence it can be efficiently implemented for a large VAN model. We carried out extensive numerical experiments on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, spin glasses on random graphs, and the two-dimensional Ising model. Our results indicate that compared with the conventional VAN, ng-VAN significantly improves the accuracy in estimating free energy and converges much faster with shorter learning time. This allows extending the VAN framework's applicability to challenging statistical mechanics problems that were previously not accessible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the thermodynamic analysis of thermoelectric devices, typical irreversibilities are for the processes of finite-rate heat transfer and Joule heating. Approximate analyses often focus on either internal or external irreversibility, yielding well-known expressions for the efficiency at maximum power (EMP), such as the Curzon-Ahlborn value for endoreversible model and the Schmiedl-Seifert form for exoreversible model. Within the Constant Properties model, we formulate a scenario that incorporates internal as well as external irreversibilities simultaneously. We employ the approximation of a symmetric and small external irreversibility (SEI), confining to the regime where the external conductance of the heat exchangers is large in comparison to the internal thermal conductance of the thermoelectric material. This approach allows us to derive a general expression for EMP, which depends on the ratio of internal to external conductance, apart from the figure of merit and ratio of temperatures. Extending our study to thermoelectric refrigerators under the similar assumptions, we also analyze the efficiency at maximum cooling power.</description>

Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) hinders the thermalization of quantum many-body systems in the presence of strong disorder. In this work, we study the MBL regime in bond-disordered spin-1/2 XXZ spin chain, finding the multimodal distribution of entanglement entropy in eigenstates, sub-Poissonian level statistics, and revealing a relation between operators and initial states required for examining the breakdown of thermalization in the time evolution of the system. We employ a real space renormalization group scheme to identify these phenomenological features of the MBL regime that extend beyond the standard picture of local integrals of motion relevant for systems with disorder coupled to on-site operators. Our results pave the way for experimental probing of MBL in bond-disordered spin chains.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12214v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that driving optical phonons above a threshold fluence induces spatiotemporal orders, where material properties oscillate at an incommensurate wavevector $q_0$ in space and at half the drive frequency in time. The order is robust against temperature on timescales much larger than the lifetime of the excited modes and can be accompanied by a static $2q_0$ modulation. We make predictions for time-resolved diffraction and provide estimates for candidate materials. Our results show the possibility of using THz waves in solids to realize tunable incommensurate order on the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed state topological order in a stabilizer system under stochastic decoherence: Strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking from percolation point of view</title>

Abstract: Discovering quantum orders in mixed many-body systems is an ongoing issue. Very recently, the notion of an intrinsic mixed state topologically-ordered (IMTO) state was proposed. As a concrete example, we observe the emergence of IMTO by studying the toric code system under stochastic maximal decoherence by $ZX$-diagonal type projective measurement without monitoring. We study how the toric code state changes to an IMTO state at the level of the averaged quantum trajectories. This phase transition is understood from the viewpoint of spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) of 1-form weak symmetry, that is, the IMTO is characterized by the symmetry restoration from the SSB, which comes from the proliferation of anyons. To understand the emergent IMTO, order and disorder parameters of 1-form symmetry are numerically studied by stabilizer simulation. The present study clarifies the existence of two distinct microscopic string operators for the fermionic anyons, that leads to distinct fermionic strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and also the obtained critical exponents indicate strong relation between IMTO and percolation.</description>

      <title>Disentangling critical quantum spin chains with Clifford circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12683v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Clifford circuits can be utilized to disentangle quantum states with polynomial cost, thanks to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Based on this idea, the Clifford circuits augmented matrix product states (CAMPS) method, which is a seamless integration of Clifford circuits within the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm, was proposed recently and was shown to be able to reduce entanglement in various quantum systems. In this work, we further explore the power of the CAMPS method in critical spin chains described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the scaling limit. We find that the optimized disentanglers correspond to {\it duality} transformations, which significantly reduce the entanglement entropy in the ground state. For the critical quantum Ising spin chain governed by the Ising CFT with self-duality, the Clifford circuits found by CAMPS coincide with the duality transformation, i.e., the Kramers-Wannier self-duality in the critical Ising chain. It reduces the entanglement entropy by mapping the free conformal boundary condition to the fixed one. In the more general case of the XXZ chain, the CAMPS gives rise to a duality transformation mapping the model to the quantum Ashkin-Teller spin chain. Our results highlight the potential of the framework as a versatile tool for uncovering hidden dualities and simplifying the entanglement structure of critical quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories: A pedagogical overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The different large $N$ limits of supersymmetric quantum field theories in three, four, and five dimensions are reviewed. We distinguish between the planar limit of SQCD theories, the M-theory limit suited in three and five dimensions, and the long quiver limit. The method to solve exactly the sphere partition functions in each type of limit is spelled out in a pedagogical way. After a comprehensive general treatment of the saddle point approximation in the large $N$ limit, we present an extensive list of examples and detail the calculations. The scope of this overview is to provide an entry-level, computation-oriented understanding of the techniques featured in the field theory side of the AdS/CFT correspondence.</description>
