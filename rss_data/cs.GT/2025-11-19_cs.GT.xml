      <title>Game-theoretic Decentralized Coordination for Airspace Sector Overload Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized air traffic management systems offer a scalable alternative to centralized control, but often assume high levels of cooperation. In practice, such assumptions frequently break down since airspace sectors operate independently and prioritize local objectives. We address the problem of sector overload in decentralized air traffic management by proposing a mechanism that models self-interested behaviors based on best response dynamics. Each sector adjusts the departure times of flights under its control to reduce its own congestion, without any shared decision making. A tunable cooperativeness factor models the degree to which each sector is willing to reduce overload in other sectors. We prove that the proposed mechanism satisfies a potential game structure, ensuring that best response dynamics converge to a pure Nash equilibrium, under a mild restriction. In addition, we identify a sufficient condition under which an overload-free solution corresponds to a global minimizer of the potential function. Numerical experiments using 24 hours of European flight data demonstrate that the proposed algorithm substantially reduces overload even with only minimal cooperation between sectors, while maintaining scalability and matching the solution quality of centralized solvers.</description>

      <title>Fair-GNE : Generalized Nash Equilibrium-Seeking Fairness in Multiagent Healthcare Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14135v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enforcing a fair workload allocation among multiple agents tasked to achieve an objective in learning enabled demand side healthcare worker settings is crucial for consistent and reliable performance at runtime. Existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches steer fairness by shaping reward through post hoc orchestrations, leaving no certifiable self-enforceable fairness that is immutable by individual agents at runtime. Contextualized within a setting where each agent shares resources with others, we address this shortcoming with a learning enabled optimization scheme among self-interested decision makers whose individual actions affect those of other agents. This extends the problem to a generalized Nash equilibrium (GNE) game-theoretic framework where we steer group policy to a safe and locally efficient equilibrium, so that no agent can improve its utility function by unilaterally changing its decisions. Fair-GNE models MARL as a constrained generalized Nash equilibrium-seeking (GNE) game, prescribing an ideal equitable collective equilibrium within the problem's natural fabric. Our hypothesis is rigorously evaluated in our custom-designed high-fidelity resuscitation simulator. Across all our numerical experiments, Fair-GNE achieves significant improvement in workload balance over fixed-penalty baselines (0.89 vs.\ 0.33 JFI, $p &lt; 0.01$) while maintaining 86\% task success, demonstrating statistically significant fairness gains through adaptive constraint enforcement. Our results communicate our formulations, evaluation metrics, and equilibrium-seeking innovations in large multi-agent learning-based healthcare systems with clarity and principled fairness enforcement.</description>

      <title>Look-Ahead Reasoning on Learning Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: On many learning platforms, the optimization criteria guiding model training reflect the priorities of the designer rather than those of the individuals they affect. Consequently, users may act strategically to obtain more favorable outcomes, effectively contesting the platform's predictions. While past work has studied strategic user behavior on learning platforms, the focus has largely been on strategic responses to a deployed model, without considering the behavior of other users. In contrast, look-ahead reasoning takes into account that user actions are coupled, and -- at scale -- impact future predictions. Within this framework, we first formalize level-$k$ thinking, a concept from behavioral economics, where users aim to outsmart their peers by looking one step ahead. We show that, while convergence to an equilibrium is accelerated, the equilibrium remains the same, providing no benefit of higher-level reasoning for individuals in the long run. Then, we focus on collective reasoning, where users take coordinated actions by optimizing through their joint impact on the model. By contrasting collective with selfish behavior, we characterize the benefits and limits of coordination; a new notion of alignment between the learner's and the users' utilities emerges as a key concept. We discuss connections to several related mathematical frameworks, including strategic classification, performative prediction, and algorithmic collective action.</description>

      <title>Market Design for Capacity Sharing in Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03994v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a market mechanism that sets edge prices to incentivize strategic agents to efficiently share limited network capacity. In this market, agents form coalitions, with each coalition sharing a unit capacity of a selected route and making payments to cover edge prices. Our focus is on the existence and computation of market equilibrium, where challenges arise from the interdependence between coalition formation among strategic agents with heterogeneous preferences and route selection that induces a network flow under integral capacity constraints. To address this interplay between coalition formation and network capacity utilization, we introduce a novel approach based on combinatorial auction theory and network flow theory. We establish sufficient conditions on the network topology and agents' preferences that guarantee both the existence and polynomial-time computation of a market equilibrium. Additionally, we identify a particular market equilibrium that maximizes utilities for all agents and the outcome is equivalent to the classical Vickrey-Clarke-Groves mechanism. Furthermore, we extend our results to multi-period settings and general networks, showing that when the sufficient conditions are not met, an equilibrium may still exist but requires more complex, path-based pricing mechanisms that set differentiated prices based on agents' preference parameters.</description>

      <title>A Sequence-Form Characterization and Differentiable Path-Following Method for Computing Normal-Form Perfect Equilibria in Extensive-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13827v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sequence form, owing to its compact and holistic strategy representation, has demonstrated significant efficiency in computing normal-form perfect equilibria for two-player extensive-form games with perfect recall. Nevertheless, the examination of $n$-player games remains underexplored. To tackle this challenge, we present a sequence-form characterization of normal-form perfect equilibria for $n$-player extensive-form games, achieved through a class of perturbed games formulated in sequence form. Based on this characterization, we develop a differentiable path-following method for computing normal-form perfect equilibria and prove its convergence. This method formulates an artificial logarithmic-barrier game in sequence form, introducing an additional variable to regulate the impact of logarithmic-barrier terms on the payoff functions, as well as the transition of the strategy space. We prove the existence of a smooth equilibrium path defined by the artificial game, starting from an arbitrary positive realization plan and converging to a normal-form perfect equilibrium of the original game as the additional variable approaches zero. Furthermore, we extend Harsanyi's linear and logarithmic tracing procedures to the sequence form and develop two alternative methods for computing normal-form perfect equilibria. Numerical experiments further substantiate the effectiveness and computational efficiency of our methods.</description>

      <title>On Three-Layer Data Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09697v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a three-layer data market comprising users (data owners), platforms, and a data buyer. Each user benefits from platform services in exchange for data, incurring privacy loss when their data, albeit noisily, is shared with the buyer. The user chooses platforms to share data with, while platforms decide on data noise levels and pricing before selling to the buyer. The buyer selects platforms to purchase data from. We model these interactions via a multi-stage game, focusing on the subgame Nash equilibrium. We find that when the buyer places a high value on user data (and platforms can command high prices), all platforms offer services to the user who joins and shares data with every platform. Conversely, when the buyer's valuation of user data is low, only large platforms with low service costs can afford to serve users. In this scenario, users exclusively join and share data with these low-cost platforms. Interestingly, increased competition benefits the buyer, not the user: as the number of platforms increases, the user utility does not necessarily improve while the buyer utility improves. However, increasing the competition improves the overall utilitarian welfare. Building on our analysis, we then study regulations to improve the user utility. We discover that banning data sharing maximizes user utility only when all platforms are low-cost. In mixed markets of high- and low-cost platforms, users prefer a minimum noise mandate over a sharing ban. Imposing this mandate on high-cost platforms and banning data sharing for low-cost ones further enhances user utility.</description>

      <title>ElementaryNet: A Non-Strategic Neural Network for Predicting Human Behavior in Normal-Form Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05925v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Behavioral game theory models serve two purposes: yielding insights into how human decision-making works, and predicting how people would behave in novel strategic settings. A system called GameNet represents the state of the art for predicting human behavior in the setting of unrepeated simultaneous-move games, combining a simple "level-k" model of strategic reasoning with a complex neural network model of non-strategic "level-0" behavior. Although this reliance on well-established ideas from cognitive science ought to make GameNet interpretable, the flexibility of its level-0 model raises the possibility that it is able to emulate strategic reasoning. In this work, we prove that GameNet's level-0 model is indeed too general. We then introduce ElementaryNet, a novel neural network that is provably incapable of expressing strategic behavior. We show that these additional restrictions are empirically harmless, with ElementaryNet and GameNet having statistically indistinguishable performance. We then show how it is possible to derive insights about human behavior by varying ElementaryNet's features and interpreting its parameters, finding evidence of iterative reasoning, learning about the depth of this reasoning process, and showing the value of a rich level-0 specification.</description>

      <title>Who Gets the Reward, Who Gets the Blame? Evaluation-Aligned Training Signals for Multi-LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10687v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) in multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown promise for complex tasks, yet current training methods lack principled ways to connect system-level evaluation with agent-level and message-level learning. We propose a theoretical framework that unifies cooperative game-theoretic attribution with process reward modeling to transform system evaluation into agent credit and then into response-level signals. Unlike prior approaches that rely only on attribution (e.g., Shapley) or step-level labels (e.g., PRM), our method produces local, signed, and credit-conserving signals. In success cases, Shapley-based credit assignment fairly allocates outcomes across agents and is refined into per-message rewards that promote cooperation while discouraging redundancy or sabotage. In failure cases, first-error localization yields repair-aware preferences that penalize harmful steps while rewarding corrective attempts. The resulting signals are bounded, cooperative, and directly compatible with reinforcement-based or preference-based post-training, providing a unified and auditable pathway from global evaluation to local supervision in LLM multi-agent training. Our contribution is conceptual: we present a theoretical foundation and training signals, leaving empirical validation for future work.</description>
