      <title>Hemodynamic Markers: CFD-Based Prediction of Cerebral Aneurysm Rupture Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10524v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of aneurysm evolution on hemodynamic characteristics within the sac region. Using computational fluid dynamics (CFD), blood flow through the parent vessel and aneurysm sac was analyzed to assess the impact on wall shear stress (WSS), time-averaged wall shear stress (TAWSS), and the oscillatory shear index (OSI), key indicators of rupture risk. Additionally, Relative Residence Time (RRT) and Endothelial Cell Activation Potential (ECAP) were examined to provide a broader understanding of the aneurysm's hemodynamic environment. Six distinct cerebral aneurysm (CA) models, all from individuals of the same gender, were selected to minimize gender-related variability.
  Results showed that unruptured cases exhibited higher WSS and TAWSS, along with lower OSI and RRT values patterns consistent with stable flow conditions supporting vascular integrity. In contrast, ruptured cases had lower WSS and TAWSS, coupled with elevated OSI and RRT, suggesting disturbed and oscillatory flow commonly linked to aneurysm wall weakening. ECAP was also higher in ruptured cases, indicating increased endothelial activation under unstable flow. Notably, areas with the highest OSI and RRT often aligned with vortex centers, reinforcing the association between disturbed flow and aneurysm instability.
  These findings highlight the value of combining multiple hemodynamic parameters for rupture risk assessment. Including RRT and ECAP provides deeper insight into flow endothelium-interactions, offering a stronger basis for evaluating aneurysm stability and guiding treatment decisions.</description>

      <title>BioChemInsight: An Open-Source Toolkit for Automated Identification and Recognition of Optical Chemical Structures and Activity Data in Scientific Publications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automated extraction of chemical structures and their bioactivity data is crucial for accelerating drug discovery and enabling data-driven pharmaceutical research. Existing optical chemical structure recognition (OCSR) tools fail to autonomously associate molecular structures with their bioactivity profiles, creating a critical bottleneck in structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis. Here, we present BioChemInsight, an open-source pipeline that integrates: (1) DECIMER Segmentation and MolVec for chemical structure recognition, (2) Qwen2.5-VL-32B for compound identifier association, and (3) PaddleOCR with Gemini-2.0-flash for bioactivity extraction and unit normalization. We evaluated the performance of BioChemInsight on 25 patents and 17 articles. BioChemInsight achieved 95% accuracy for tabular patent data (structure/identifier recognition), with lower accuracy in non-tabular patents (~80% structures, ~75% identifiers), plus 92.2 % bioactivity extraction accuracy. For articles, it attained &gt;99% identifiers and 78-80% structure accuracy in non-tabular formats, plus 97.4% bioactivity extraction accuracy. The system generates ready-to-use SAR datasets, reducing data preprocessing time from weeks to hours while enabling applications in high-throughput screening and ML-driven drug design (https://github.com/dahuilangda/BioChemInsight).</description>

      <title>FLOWR: Flow Matching for Structure-Aware De Novo, Interaction- and Fragment-Based Ligand Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce FLOWR, a novel structure-based framework for the generation and optimization of three-dimensional ligands. FLOWR integrates continuous and categorical flow matching with equivariant optimal transport, enhanced by an efficient protein pocket conditioning. Alongside FLOWR, we present SPINDR, a thoroughly curated dataset comprising ligand-pocket co-crystal complexes specifically designed to address existing data quality issues. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FLOWR surpasses current state-of-the-art diffusion- and flow-based methods in terms of PoseBusters-validity, pose accuracy, and interaction recovery, while offering a significant inference speedup, achieving up to 70-fold faster performance. In addition, we introduce FLOWR.multi, a highly accurate multi-purpose model allowing for the targeted sampling of novel ligands that adhere to predefined interaction profiles and chemical substructures for fragment-based design without the need of re-training or any re-sampling strategies</description>

      <title>Automatic Raman Measurements in a High-Throughput Bioprocess Development Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a collection of physical devices and software services that fully automate Raman spectra measurements for liquid samples within a robotic facility. This method is applicable to various fields, with demonstrated efficacy in biotechnology, where Raman spectroscopy monitors substrates, metabolites, and product-related concentrations. Our system specifically measures 50 $\micro L$ samples using a liquid handling robot capable of taking 8 samples simultaneously. We record multiple Raman spectra for 10s each. Furthermore, our system takes around 20s for sample handling, cleaning, and preparation of the next measurement. All spectra and metadata are stored in a database, and we use a machine learning model to estimate concentrations from the spectra. This automated approach enables gathering spectra for various applications under uniform conditions in high-throughput fermentation processes, calibration procedures, and offline evaluations. This allows data to be combined to train sophisticated machine learning models with improved generalization. Consequently, we can develop accurate models more quickly for new applications by reusing data from prior applications, thereby reducing the need for extensive calibration data.</description>

      <title>Cryo-em images are intrinsically low dimensional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</description>

      <title>A conceptual synthesis of causal assumptions for causal discovery and inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a conceptual synthesis of causal discovery and inference frameworks, with a focus on how foundational assumptions -- causal sufficiency, causal faithfulness, and the causal Markov condition -- are formalized and operationalized across methodological traditions. Through structured tables and comparative summaries, I map core assumptions, tasks, and analytical choices from multiple causal frameworks, highlighting their connections and differences. The synthesis provides practical guidance for researchers designing causal studies, especially in settings where observational or experimental constraints challenge standard approaches. This guide spans all phases of causal analysis, including question formulation, formalization of background knowledge, selection of appropriate frameworks, choice of study design or algorithm, and interpretation. It is intended as a tool to support rigorous causal reasoning across diverse empirical domains.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Design Space of Multimodal Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11454v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal protein language models (PLMs) integrate sequence and token-based structural information, serving as a powerful foundation for protein modeling, generation, and design. However, the reliance on tokenizing 3D structures into discrete tokens causes substantial loss of fidelity about fine-grained structural details and correlations. In this paper, we systematically elucidate the design space of multimodal PLMs to overcome their limitations. We identify tokenization loss and inaccurate structure token predictions by the PLMs as major bottlenecks. To address these, our proposed design space covers improved generative modeling, structure-aware architectures and representation learning, and data exploration. Our advancements approach finer-grained supervision, demonstrating that token-based multimodal PLMs can achieve robust structural modeling. The effective design methods dramatically improve the structure generation diversity, and notably, folding abilities of our 650M model by reducing the RMSD from 5.52 to 2.36 on PDB testset, even outperforming 3B baselines and on par with the specialized folding models.</description>

      <title>Topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptide prediction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08974v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, therapeutic peptides have demonstrated great promise for cancer treatment. To explore powerful anticancer peptides, artificial intelligence (AI)-based approaches have been developed to systematically screen potential candidates. However, the lack of efficient featurization of peptides has become a bottleneck for these machine-learning models. In this paper, we propose a topology-enhanced machine learning model (Top-ML) for anticancer peptides prediction. Our Top-ML employs peptide topological features derived from its sequence "connection" information characterized by vector and spectral descriptors. Our Top-ML model, employing an Extra-Trees classifier, has been validated on the AntiCP 2.0 and mACPpred 2.0 benchmark datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance or results comparable to existing deep learning models, while providing greater interpretability. Our results highlight the potential of leveraging novel topology-based featurization to accelerate the identification of anticancer peptides.</description>

      <title>JanusDDG: A Thermodynamics-Compliant Model for Sequence-Based Protein Stability via Two-Fronts Multi-Head Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how residue variations affect protein stability is crucial for designing functional proteins and deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying disease-related mutations. Recent advances in protein language models (PLMs) have revolutionized computational protein analysis, enabling, among other things, more accurate predictions of mutational effects. In this work, we introduce JanusDDG, a deep learning framework that leverages PLM-derived embeddings and a bidirectional cross-attention transformer architecture to predict $\Delta \Delta G$ of single and multiple-residue mutations while simultaneously being constrained to respect fundamental thermodynamic properties, such as antisymmetry and transitivity. Unlike conventional self-attention, JanusDDG computes queries (Q) and values (V) as the difference between wild-type and mutant embeddings, while keys (K) alternate between the two. This cross-interleaved attention mechanism enables the model to capture mutation-induced perturbations while preserving essential contextual information. Experimental results show that JanusDDG achieves state-of-the-art performance in predicting $\Delta \Delta G$ from sequence alone, matching or exceeding the accuracy of structure-based methods for both single and multiple mutations.

      <title>Beyond Boolean networks: new tools for the steady state analysis of multivalued networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16760v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boolean networks can be viewed as functions on the set of binary strings of a given length, described via logical rules. They were introduced as dynamic models into biology, in particular as logical models of intracellular regulatory networks involving genes, proteins, and metabolites. Since genes can have several modes of action depending on their expression levels, binary variables are often not sufficiently rich, requiring the use of multivalued networks instead.
  In this paper, we explore the multivalued generalization of Boolean networks by writing the standard $(\wedge, \vee, \lnot)$ operations on $\{0, 1\}$ in terms of the operations $(\odot, \oplus, \neg)$ on $\big\{0,\frac{1}{m}, \frac{2}{m}, \dots, \frac{m-1}{m}, 1\big\}$ from multivalued logic. We recall the basic theory of this mathematical framework, and give a novel algorithm for computing the fixed points that in many cases has essentially the same complexity as in the binary case. Our approach provides a biologically intuitive representation of the network. Furthermore, it uses tools to compute lattice points in rational polytopes, tapping a rich area of algebraic combinatorics as a source for combinatorial algorithms for network analysis. An implementation of the algorithm is provided.</description>

      <title>Molecular Signal Reception in Complex Vessel Networks: The Role of the Network Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of synthetic molecular communication (MC) refers to the transmission of information via molecules and is largely foreseen for use within the human body, where traditional electromagnetic wave (EM)-based communication is impractical. MC is anticipated to enable innovative medical applications, such as early-stage tumor detection, targeted drug delivery, and holistic approaches like the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Many of these applications involve parts of the human cardiovascular system (CVS), here referred to as networks, posing challenges for MC due to their complex, highly branched vessel structures. To gain a better understanding of how the topology of such branched vessel networks affects the reception of a molecular signal at a target location, e.g., the network outlet, we present a generic analytical end-to-end model that characterizes molecule propagation and reception in linear branched vessel networks (LBVNs). We specialize this generic model to any MC system employing superparamagnetic iron-oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) as signaling molecules and a planar coil as receiver (RX). By considering components that have been previously established in testbeds, we effectively isolate the impact of the network topology and validate our theoretical model with testbed data. Additionally, we propose two metrics, namely the molecule delay and the multi-path spread, that relate the LBVN topology to the molecule dispersion induced by the network, thereby linking the network structure to the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the target location. This allows the characterization of the SNR at any point in the network solely based on the network topology. Consequently, our framework can, e.g., be exploited for optimal sensor placement in the CVS or identification of suitable testbed topologies for given SNR requirements.</description>

      <title>Accuracy versus Predominance: Reassessing the validity of the quasi-steady-state approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06406v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The application of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation to the Michaelis--Menten reaction mechanism is a textbook example of biochemical model reduction, derived using singular perturbation theory. However, determining the specific biochemical conditions that dictate the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation remains a challenging endeavor. Emerging research suggests that the accuracy of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation improves as the ratio of the initial enzyme concentration, $e_0$, to the Michaelis constant, $K_M$, decreases. In this work, we examine this ratio and its implications for the accuracy and validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation as compared to other quasi-steady-state reductions in its proximity. Using standard tools from the analysis of ordinary differential equations, we show that while $e_0/K_M$ provides an indication of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's asymptotic accuracy, the standard quasi-steady-state approximation's predominance relies on a small ratio of $e_0$ to the Van Slyke-Cullen constant, $K$. Here, we define the predominance of a quasi-steady-state reduction when it offers the highest approximation accuracy among other well-known reductions with overlapping validity conditions. We conclude that the magnitude of $e_0/K$ offers the most accurate measure of the validity of the standard quasi-steady-state approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing antibody sequences to better resemble those observed in natural human repertoires is a key challenge in biologics development. We introduce IgCraft: a multi-purpose model for paired human antibody sequence generation, built on Bayesian Flow Networks. IgCraft presents one of the first unified generative modeling frameworks capable of addressing multiple antibody sequence design tasks with a single model, including unconditional sampling, sequence inpainting, inverse folding, and CDR motif scaffolding. Our approach achieves competitive results across the full spectrum of these tasks while constraining generation to the space of human antibody sequences, exhibiting particular strengths in CDR motif scaffolding (grafting) where we achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of humanness and preservation of structural properties. By integrating previously separate tasks into a single scalable generative model, IgCraft provides a versatile platform for sampling human antibody sequences under a variety of contexts relevant to antibody discovery and engineering. Model code and weights are publicly available at https://github.com/mgreenig/IgCraft.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in the data-driven medicine approach, which integrates ethically managed and explainable artificial intelligence into clinical decision support systems (CDSS), are critical to ensure reliable and effective patient care. This paper focuses on comparing novel agent system designs that use modular agents to analyze laboratory results, vital signs, and clinical context, and to predict and validate results. We implement our agent system with the eICU database, including running lab analysis, vitals-only interpreters, and contextual reasoners agents first, then sharing the memory into the integration agent, prediction agent, transparency agent, and a validation agent. Our results suggest that the multi-agent system (MAS) performed better than the single-agent system (SAS) with mortality prediction accuracy (59%, 56%) and the mean error for length of stay (LOS)(4.37 days, 5.82 days), respectively. However, the transparency score for the SAS (86.21) is slightly better than the transparency score for MAS (85.5). Finally, this study suggests that our agent-based framework not only improves process transparency and prediction accuracy but also strengthens trustworthy AI-assisted decision support in an intensive care setting.</description>
