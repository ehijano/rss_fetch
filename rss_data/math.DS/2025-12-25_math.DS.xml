      <title>Sparse identification of delay equations with distributed memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel extension of the SINDy framework to delay differential equations with {\it distributed delays} and {\it renewal equations}, where typically the dependence from the past manifests via integrals in which the history is weighted through specific functions that are in general nonautonomous. Using sparse regression following the application of suitable quadrature formulas, the proposed methodology aims at directly reconstructing these kernel functions, thereby capturing the dynamics of the underlying infinite-dimensional systems. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the presented approach in identifying accurate and interpretable models, thus advancing data-driven discovery towards systems with distributed memory.</description>

      <title>The Patterson-Sullivan construction and global leaf geometry for Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the measure of maximal entropy for transitive Anosov flows through a method analogous to the construction of Patterson-Sullivan measures in negative curvature. In order to carry out our procedure we prove several new results concerning the global geometry of the leaves of the center-unstable foliation of an Anosov flow. We show that the universal covers of the center-unstable leaves are Gromov hyperbolic in the induced Riemannian metric and their relative Gromov boundaries canonically identify with the unstable leaves within in such a way that the Hamenst\"adt metrics on these leaves correspond to visual metrics on the relative Gromov boundary. These center-unstable leaves are then uniformized according to a technique inspired by methods of Bonk-Heinonen-Koskela which, in addition to its utility in the construction itself, also leads to rich analytic properties for these uniformized leaves such as supporting a Poincar\'e inequality. As a corollary we obtain that the fundamental group of a closed Riemannian manifold with Anosov geodesic flow must be Gromov hyperbolic.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior for a class of damped second-order gradient systems via Lyapunov method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the asymptotic behavior of a class of damped second-order gradient systems $$ \ddot{u}(t) + a\dot{u}(t) + \nabla W(u(t)) = 0, $$ under assumptions ensuring local convexity of the potential near equilibrium and coercivity at infinity. By introducing a Lyapunov functional adapted to the geometry of the system, we establish uniform asymptotic stability of the equilibrium for all $a \in (0,a_0]$, together with exponential decay when the potential satisfies a quadratic control near its minimum. Furthermore, complementary arguments based on semigroup theory reveal the existence of a global attractor. We also present numerical simulations for some $W$ potentials that illustrate the behavior of trajectories near equilibrium, in both dissipative and conservative regimes.</description>

      <title>Analytic and Variational Stability of Deep Learning Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified analytic and variational framework for studying stability in deep learning systems viewed as coupled representation-parameter dynamics. The central object is the Learning Stability Profile, which tracks the infinitesimal response of representations, parameters, and update mechanisms to perturbations along the learning trajectory. We prove a Fundamental Analytic Stability Theorem showing that uniform boundedness of these stability signatures is equivalent, up to norm equivalence, to the existence of a Lyapunov-type energy that dissipates along the learning flow. In smooth regimes, the framework yields explicit stability exponents linking spectral norms, activation regularity, step sizes, and learning rates to contractivity of the learning dynamics. Classical spectral stability results for feedforward networks, a discrete CFL-type condition for residual architectures, and parametric and temporal stability laws for stochastic gradient methods arise as direct consequences. The theory extends to non-smooth learning systems, including ReLU networks, proximal and projected updates, and stochastic subgradient flows, by replacing classical derivatives with Clarke generalized derivatives and smooth energies with variational Lyapunov functionals. The resulting framework provides a unified dynamical description of stability across architectures and optimization methods, clarifying how architectural and algorithmic choices jointly govern robustness and sensitivity to perturbations. It also provides a foundation for further extensions to continuous-time limits and geometric formulations of learning dynamics.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{K}$-Lorentzian Polynomials, Semipositive Cones, and Cone-Stable EVI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lorentzian and completely log-concave polynomials have recently emerged as a unifying framework for negative dependence, log-concavity, and convexity in combinatorics and probability. We extend this theory to variational analysis and cone-constrained dynamics by studying $K$-Lorentzian and $K$-completely log-concave polynomials over a proper convex cone $K\subset\mathbb{R}^n$. For a $K$-Lorentzian form $f$ and $v\in\operatorname{int}K$, we define an open cone $K^\circ(f,v)$ and a closed cone $K(f,v)$ via directional derivatives along $v$, recovering the usual hyperbolicity cone when $f$ is hyperbolic. We prove that $K^\circ(f,v)$ is a proper cone and equals $\operatorname{int}K(f,v)$. If $f$ is $K(f,v)$-Lorentzian, then $K(f,v)$ is convex and maximal among convex cones on which $f$ is Lorentzian.
  Using the Rayleigh matrix $M_f(x)=\nabla f(x)\nabla f(x)^T - f(x)\nabla^2 f(x)$, we obtain cone-restricted Rayleigh inequalities and show that two-direction Rayleigh inequalities on $K$ are equivalent to an acuteness condition for the bilinear form $v^T M_f(x) w$. This yields a cone-restricted negative-dependence interpretation linking the curvature of $\log f$ to covariance properties of associated Gibbs measures. For determinantal generating polynomials, we identify the intersection of the hyperbolicity cone with the nonnegative orthant as the classical semipositive cone, and we extend this construction to general proper cones via $K$-semipositive cones. Finally, for linear evolution variational inequality (LEVI) systems, we show that if $q(x)=x^T A x$ is (strictly) $K$-Lorentzian, then $A$ is (strictly) $K$-copositive and yields Lyapunov (semi-)stability on $K$, giving new Lyapunov criteria for cone-constrained dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2101.07796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently ,mathematicians have been interested in studying the theory of discrete dynamical system, specifically difference equation, such that considerable works about discussing the behavior properties of its solutions (boundedness and unboundedness) are discussed and published in many areas of mathematics which involves several interesting results and applications in applied mathematics and physics ,One of the most important discrete dynamics which is became of interest for researchers in the field is the rational dynamical system .In this paper we give a negative answer to the eight open conjecture in rational dynamical system proposed by G.Ladas and Palladino many years ago which states :
  Assume $\alpha,\beta, \lambda \in [0,\infty)$. Then every positive solution of the difference equation \\:
  \begin{align*} z_{n+1}=\frac{\alpha+z_{n}\beta +z_{n-1}\lambda}{z_{n-2}},\quad n=0,1,\ldots \end{align*} is bounded if and only if $\beta=\lambda$.
  We will use a construction of subenergy function and some properties of Todd's difference equation to disprove that conjecture in general.Some new results (Chebychev approximation) and analysis regarding that open conjecture are presented.</description>

      <title>Turing-Turing Bifurcation and Normal Form in a Predator-Prey Model with Predator-Taxis and Prey Refuge</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates a predator-prey reaction-diffusion model incorporating predator-taxis and a prey refuge mechanism, subject to homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions. Our primary focus is the analysis of codimension-two Turing-Turing bifurcation and the calculation of its associated normal form for this model. Firstly, employing the maximum principle and Amann's theorem, we rigorously prove the local existence and uniqueness of classical solutions. Secondly, utilizing linear stability theory and bifurcation theory, we conduct a thorough analysis of the existence and stability properties of the positive constant steady state. Furthermore, we derive precise conditions under which the model undergoes a Turing-Turing bifurcation. Thirdly, by applying center manifold reduction and normal form theory, we derive the method for calculating the third-truncated normal form characterizing the dynamics near the Turing-Turing bifurcation point. Finally, we present numerical simulations to validate the theoretical findings, confirming the correctness of the analytical results concerning the bifurcation conditions and the derived normal form.</description>

      <title>FitzHugh-Nagumo equation: bifurcations, slow-fast system and dynamics near infinity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01623v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on the qualitative analysis of the phase portraits arising in the three-parameter FitzHugh-Nagumo system and its compactified form. The investigation is split into three parameter-dependent cases.
  In one of these cases, the system displays a double-zero bifurcation with Z2-symmetry, a singularity of codimension two. For this case, we provide explicit descriptions of the bifurcation and transition curves unfolding the singularity, including pitchfork, Hopf, Belyakov, and double homoclinic bifurcations. Furthermore, we present the corresponding bifurcation diagrams. We bridge this analysis with the theory on the framework of slow-fast family and to the presence of canards.
  We complete our study with an analysis of the dynamics near infinity for the family under consideration. This study complements the work summarized in Georgescu, Rocsoreanu, and Giurgiteanu, Global Bifurcations in the FitzHugh-Nagumo Model, Trends in Mathematics: Bifurcations, Symmetry and Patterns (2003).</description>

      <title>The Complex Dimensions of Every Sierpinski Carpet Modification of Dust Type</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15496v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate modified Sierpi\'nski Carpet fractals, constructed by dividing a square into a square $n \times n$ grid, removing a subset of the squares at each step, and then repeating that process for each square remaining in that grid. If enough squares are removed and in the proper places, we get ``Dust Type'' carpets, which have a path-connected complement and are themselves not path-connected. We study these fractals using the Fractal Zeta Functions, first introduced by Michel Lapidus, Goran Radunovi\'c, and Darko \vZubrini\'c in their book \emph{Fractal Zeta Functions and Fractal Drums}, from which we devised an analytical and combinatorial algorithm to compute the complex dimensions of every Sierpi\'nski Carpet modification of Dust Type.</description>

      <title>h-dichotomies via noncritical uniformity and expansiveness for evolution families</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.03453v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent paper (Math. Ann. 393 (2025), 1769--1795), Elorreaga et al. have obtained a complete characterization of the notion of a $h$-dichotomy for ordinary differential equations on a finite-dimensional space in terms of the notions of $h$-expansiveness and $h$-noncriticality. Their results extended the previous results of Coppel and Palmer, which dealt with exponential dichotomies. The main objective of this note is to extend the results of Elorreaga et al. to arbitrary invertible evolution families that act on Banach spaces. We emphasize that our approach is completely different and considerably simpler from the one developed by Elorreaga et al. It is based on the time-rescaling method introduced by Dragicevic and Silva.</description>

Abstract: We show that there is a set which is not a set of multiple recurrence despite being a set of recurrence for nil-Bohr sets. This answers Huang, Shao, and Ye's \enquote{higher-order} version of Katznelson's Question on Bohr recurrence and topological recurrence in the negative. Equivalently, we construct a set $S$ so that there is a finite coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ without three-term arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$, but so that $S$ lacks the usual polynomial obstacles to arithmetic progressions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze a generalization of the self-affine carpets of Bedford and McMullen where the defining iterated function system includes coordinate reflections. We prove that the Hausdorff dimension is invariant under such reflections. The argument is framed within a probabilistic context, utilizing the thermodynamic formalism for self-affine measures. We derive the upper bound using the standard covering argument and the lower bound via the variational principle and the Ledrappier-Young formula. A key step in our analysis is the rigorous treatment of the symbolic factor entropy associated with the projection onto the less contracted coordinate. We demonstrate that this entropic quantity is invariant under the action of the reflection group, provided the grid structure satisfies the Strong Separation Condition. We provide a complete derivation of the dimension formula, optimizing the dimension over Bernoulli measures on the symbolic space.</description>

Abstract: Graphs are pervasive in our everyday lives, with relevance to biology, the internet, and infrastructure, as well as numerous other applications. It is thus necessary to have an understanding as to how quickly a graph disintegrates, whether by random failure or by targeted attack. While much of the interest in this subject has been focused on targeted removal of nodes, there has been some recent interest in targeted edge removal. Here, we focus on how robust a graph is against edge removal. We define a measure of network fragility that relates the fraction of edges removed to the largest connected component. We construct a class of graphs that is robust to edge removal. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that graphs generally disintegrate faster than would be anticipated by greedy targeted attack. Finally it is shown that our fragility measure as demonstrated real and natural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05292v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a mathematical model of city formation by migration of firms and workers. The Core-Periphery model in the new economic geography, which considers the single migration of workers driven by real wage inequality among regions, is extended to incorporate the migration of firms driven by real profit inequality among regions. In this dual migration model, it is found that the behavior of the solutions is qualitatively similar to that of solutions of the single migration model, which is frequently used in the new economic geography (NEG). That is, 1) spatially homogeneous distributions of firms and workers become destabilized and eventually form several cities where both firms and workers agglomerate; 2) The number of cities decreases as transport costs decrease. The results have provided a more general theoretical justification for the use of the single migration models in NEG.</description>

      <title>Learning from Imperfect Data: Robust Inference of Dynamic Systems using Simulation-based Generative Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: System inference for nonlinear dynamic models, represented by ordinary differential equations (ODEs), remains a significant challenge in many fields, particularly when the data are noisy, sparse, or partially observable. In this paper, we propose a Simulation-based Generative Model for Imperfect Data (SiGMoID) that enables precise and robust inference for dynamic systems. The proposed approach integrates two key methods: (1) physics-informed neural networks with hyper-networks that constructs an ODE solver, and (2) Wasserstein generative adversarial networks that estimates ODE parameters by effectively capturing noisy data distributions. We demonstrate that SiGMoID quantifies data noise, estimates system parameters, and infers unobserved system components. Its effectiveness is validated validated through realistic experimental examples, showcasing its broad applicability in various domains, from scientific research to engineered systems, and enabling the discovery of full system dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonholonomic Robot Parking by Feedback -- Part I: Modular Strict CLF Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been known in the robotics literature since about 1995 that, in polar coordinates, the nonholonomic unicycle is asymptotically stabilizable by smooth feedback, even globally. We introduce a modular design framework that selects the forward velocity to decouple the radial coordinate, allowing the steering subsystem to be stabilized independently. Within this structure, we develop families of feedback laws using passivity, backstepping, and integrator forwarding. Each law is accompanied by a strict control Lyapunov function, including barrier variants that enforce angular constraints. These strict CLFs provide constructive class KL convergence estimates and enable eigenvalue assignment at the target equilibrium. The framework generalizes and extends prior modular and nonmodular approaches, while preparing the ground for inverse optimal and adaptive redesigns in the sequel paper.</description>

      <title>$2$-large sets are sets of Bohr recurrence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha_1, \cdots, \alpha_d$ be real numbers, and let $S$ be the set of integers $s$ so that $||\alpha_i s||_{\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}}&gt;\delta$ for some $i$ and some fixed $\delta&gt;0$. We prove $S$ is not \enquote{$2$-large}, i.e. there is a $2$-coloring of $\mathbb{N}$ that avoids arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions with common differences in $S$.</description>
