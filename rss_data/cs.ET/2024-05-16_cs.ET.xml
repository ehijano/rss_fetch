      <title>Evaluation of a Multi-Molecule Molecular Communication Testbed Based on Spectral Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a novel flow-based molecular communication (MC) testbed using spectral sensing and ink concentration estimation to enable real-time multi-molecule (MUMO) transmission. MUMO communication opens up crucial opportunities for increased throughput as well as implementing more complex coding, modulation, and resource allocation strategies for MC testbeds. A concentration estimator using non-invasive spectral sensing at the receiver is proposed based on a simple absorption model. We conduct in-depth channel impulse response (CIR) measurements and a preliminary communication performance evaluation. Additionally, a simple analytical model is used to check the consistency of the CIRs. The results indicate that by utilizing MUMO transmission, on-off-keying, and a simple difference detector, the testbed can achieve up to 3 bits per second for near-error-free communication, which is on par with comparable testbeds that utilize more sophisticated coding or detection methods. Our platform lays the ground for implementing MUMO communication and evaluating various physical layer and networking techniques based on multiple molecule types in future MC testbeds in real time.</description>

      <title>Fusion Intelligence: Confluence of Natural and Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Problem-Solving Efficiency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces Fusion Intelligence (FI), a bio-inspired intelligent system, where the innate sensing, intelligence and unique actuation abilities of biological organisms such as bees and ants are integrated with the computational power of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This interdisciplinary field seeks to create systems that are not only smart but also adaptive and responsive in ways that mimic the nature. As FI evolves, it holds the promise of revolutionizing the way we approach complex problems, leveraging the best of both biological and digital worlds to create solutions that are more effective, sustainable, and harmonious with the environment. We demonstrate FI's potential to enhance agricultural IoT system performance through a simulated case study on improving insect pollination efficacy (entomophily).</description>

      <title>Automated Federated Learning via Informed Pruning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) represents a pivotal shift in machine learning (ML) as it enables collaborative training of local ML models coordinated by a central aggregator, all without the need to exchange local data. However, its application on edge devices is hindered by limited computational capabilities and data communication challenges, compounded by the inherent complexity of Deep Learning (DL) models. Model pruning is identified as a key technique for compressing DL models on devices with limited resources. Nonetheless, conventional pruning techniques typically rely on manually crafted heuristics and demand human expertise to achieve a balance between model size, speed, and accuracy, often resulting in sub-optimal solutions.
  In this study, we introduce an automated federated learning approach utilizing informed pruning, called AutoFLIP, which dynamically prunes and compresses DL models within both the local clients and the global server. It leverages a federated loss exploration phase to investigate model gradient behavior across diverse datasets and losses, providing insights into parameter significance. Our experiments showcase notable enhancements in scenarios with strong non-IID data, underscoring AutoFLIP's capacity to tackle computational constraints and achieve superior global convergence.</description>

      <title>Impact of unreliable devices on stability of quantum computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices are valuable platforms for testing the tenets of quantum computing, but these devices are susceptible to errors arising from de-coherence, leakage, cross-talk and other sources of noise. This raises concerns regarding the stability of results when using NISQ devices since strategies for mitigating errors generally require well-characterized and stationary error models. Here, we quantify the reliability of NISQ devices by assessing the necessary conditions for generating stable results within a given tolerance. We use similarity metrics derived from device characterization data to derive and validate bounds on the stability of a 5-qubit implementation of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm. Simulation experiments conducted with noise data from IBM Washington, spanning January 2022 to April 2023, revealed that the reliability metric fluctuated between 41% and 92%. This variation significantly surpasses the maximum allowable threshold of 2.2% needed for stable outcomes. Consequently, the device proved unreliable for consistently reproducing the statistical mean in the context of the Bernstein-Vazirani circuit.</description>
