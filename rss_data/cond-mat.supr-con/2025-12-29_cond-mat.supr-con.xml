      <title>Criticality as a Universal Thermodynamic Requirement for Perfect Intrinsic Superconducting Diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting diodes promise dissipation-less rectification, yet intrinsic platforms invariably have very low efficiencies. We reveal a fundamental thermodynamic origin of this behavior that is independent of microscopic details. Denoting $\epsilon = I_c^-/I_c^+$, where $I_c^\pm$ are critical current magnitudes in opposite directions with $I_c^+&gt;I_c^-$ by convention, we show that $\epsilon=0$ is impossible without fine-tuning, while $\epsilon\to0$ can occur but only upon tuning to a critical point \emph{within} the superconducting state. Away from such internal instabilities, using general Landau theory, we derive a lower bound on $\epsilon$ that limits intrinsic diode performance. We illustrate these ideas in a minimal superconductor-Ising model, where the strong nonreciprocity can be seen explicitly. In particular, if the internal transition is continuous, we show that the scaling of $\epsilon$ near the transition is locked to known critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Necessary conditions for spin-resolved Josephson diode effect across strongly spin-polarized magnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of necessary conditions for the appearance of charge and spin Josephson diode effects across strongly spin-polarized inhomogeneous magnetic materials (FM) placed between two spin-singlet superconductors. Noncoplanarity of the FM's spin texture gives rise to quantum geometric phases, $\Delta\varphi'$, that enter the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR) similarly to the superconducting phase difference, resulting in charge and spin Josephson diode effects. Our study shows that such effects appear if the CPR possesses no phase-inversion center, achieved under the following conditions. First, noncoplanarity of the spin texture is necessary to break the spatial inversion symmetry. Second, both spin bands have to contribute to the transport, i.e., the effect is absent in half-metallic junctions. Third, different band-specific densities of states are required, and this condition is ensured by the strong spin polarization of the FM. Finally, higher harmonics in the CPR are necessary, i.e., the effect is absent in the tunneling limit. However, even in this case, the CPR must not have a phase-inversion center, which is ensured by the restriction of the quantum geometric phase to values $\Delta\varphi'\neq k\pi/2, k\in\mathbb{Z}$. We formulate a minimal phenomenological model that incorporates all these points, qualitatively illustrating our theory.</description>

      <title>Beyond on-site Hubbard interaction in charge dynamics of cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this review, we first present compelling evidence from resonant inelastic x-ray scattering data that highlights the significance of the long-range Coulomb interaction in cuprate charge dynamics, particularly around the in-plane momentum q=(0,0). We show that these experimental observations are well-captured by the layered t-J-V model, which extends the standard t-J framework to include the long-range Coulomb interaction V and the layered structure.
  This new perspective elucidates how charge dynamics renormalizes one-particle excitation properties, leading to several profound and often counterintuitive consequences. We demonstrate that the electron dispersion does not exhibit a sharp kink, and Landau quasiparticles persist in the low-energy limit despite a significant suppression of their spectral weight. We further show that while charge fluctuations alone cannot fully account for the pseudogap, they are a crucial component for understanding its formation. Additionally, we reveal that optical plasmon excitations generate fermionic quasiparticles, known as plasmarons, which give rise to a distinct, incoherent replica band.
  We argue that accurately describing these plasmonic effects requires a three-dimensional theoretical approach. This perspective on plasmon excitations may offer a critically new clue to a long-standing puzzle: why multi-layer cuprate superconductors, containing more than two CuO2 layers per unit cell, consistently exhibit a higher critical temperature Tc than their single-layer counterparts. Finally, we review the spin-fluctuation mechanism of superconductivity suffers from the "self-restraint effect" and show how important the screened Coulomb interaction is in the spin-fluctuation mechanism to realize high-Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Theoretical perspectives on charge dynamics in high-temperature cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review recent theoretical progress on the charge dynamics of doped carriers in high-temperature cuprate superconductors. Advances in this field have clarified that doped charges in cuprates exhibit remarkably rich collective behavior, governed by the combined effects of strong electronic correlations, the intrinsic layered crystal structure, and long-range Coulomb interaction. First, the emergence of acousticlike plasmons has been firmly established through quantitative analyses of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra based on the t-J-V model -- an extension of the conventional t-J model that incorporates the layered crystal structure and the long-range Coulomb interaction V. These acousticlike plasmons arise near the in-plane momentum q=(0,0) and possess characteristic energies far below the well-known ~ 1 eV optical plasmon. This behavior is found to be universal across both hole- and electron-doped cuprates, including multilayer systems. Second, in electron-doped cuprates, a pronounced tendency toward d-wave bond-charge order develops near q=(0.5pi, 0), as revealed by resonant x-ray scattering (RXS) and RIXS. As a result, the charge dynamics acquires a dual structure, in which low-energy bond-charge excitations coexist with relatively high-energy plasmons. Third, analogous signatures of charge-order tendency have also been reported in hole-doped cuprates. However, a direct application of the d-wave bond-charge-order framework fails to account for experimental observations. Similarly, the charge-stripe order in La-based cuprates remains unresolved within existing theoretical approaches. Assuming that mobile carriers behave in a largely universal manner across electron- and hole-doped systems, we discuss a possible scenario that may reconcile these diverse experimental findings.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in magnon Bose-Einstein condensate: non-reciprocal superfluidity, exceptional points and Majorana bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a ferroelectric instability of a magnon Bose-Einstein condensate, mediated by its interaction with an electric field through a geometric Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. A distinct feature of the system is the positive feedback loop in which an electric field induces magnon orbital motion via the AC phase, generating electric polarization that in turn enhances the original field. Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point. The corresponding eigenvector is an equally weighted superposition of bosonic quasiparticle and quasihole states and is invariant under particle-hole transformation, allowing it to be interpreted as a bosonic analog of a Majorana fermion.</description>

      <title>Extreme orbital ab-plane upper critical fields far beyond Pauli limit in 4Hb-Ta(S, Se)2 bulk crystals</title>

Abstract: Transition metal disulfides 4Hb-Ta(S, Se)2 with natural heterostructure of 1T- and 1H-Ta(S, Se)2 layers have became the focus of correlated materials their unique combinations of Mott physics and possible topological superconductivity. In this work, we study the upper critical fields mu0Hc2 of 4Hb-TaS2 and 4Hb-TaS1.99Se0.01 single crystals systematically. Transport measurements up to 35 T show that both of ab-plane and c-axis upper critical fields (mu0Hc2,ab and mu0Hc2,c) for 4Hb-TaS2 and 4Hb-TaS1.99Se0.01 exhibit a linear temperature dependent behavior down to 0.3 K, suggesting the three-dimensional superconductivity with dominant orbital depairing mechanism in bulk 4Hb-Ta(S, Se)2. However, the zero-temperature mu0Hc2,ab(0) for both crystals are far beyond the Pauli paramagnetic limit mu0HP. It could be explained by the effects of spin-momentum locking in 1H-Ta(S, Se)2 layers with local inversion symmetry broken and the relatively weak intersublattice interaction between 1H layers due to the existence of 1T layers.</description>

      <title>Andreev qubit readout from dynamic interference supercurrent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nondemolition protocols use ancilla qubits to identify the fragile quantum state of a qubit without destroying its encoded information, thus playing a crucial role in nondestructive quantum measurements particularly relevant for quantum error correction. However, the multitude of ancilla preparations, information transfers, and ancilla measurements in these protocols create an intrinsic overhead for information processing. Here we consider an Andreev qubit defined in a quantum-dot Josephson junction and show that the macroscopic time-dependent oscillatory supercurrent arising from the quantum interference of the many-body eigenstates, can be used to probe the qubit itself-arbitrarily close to the nondestructive limit-under currently available experimental capabilities. This readout of arbitrary superposition states of Andreev qubits avoids ancillae altogether and significantly reduces experimental overhead as no repetitive qubit reinitialization is needed. Our prediction of an AC-like Josephson effect without an applied external voltage, which enables the nondestructive qubit readout, is a unique macroscopic manifestation of the microscopic dynamics of the Andreev quantum state. Our findings should have an unprecedented impact on advancing research and applications involving Andreev dots, thus positioning them as promising qubit contenders for quantum processing and technologies.</description>

      <title>$p$-wave superconductivity and Josephson current in $p$-wave unconventional magnet/$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the surface density of states in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems ($p$-wave unconventional magnetic superconductors), by using the effective $p$-wave unconventional magnet model [B. Brekke, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236703 (2024)]. Owing to the noncollinear spin structure along the $x$-direction, the quasiparticle energy dispersion has the spin-triplet $p_x$-wave energy gap structure, and then zero-energy flat bands emerge at the [100] edge. Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains. We also demonstrate the Josephson current in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnet-conventional $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems. By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge. Our calculations provide the possible superconducting phenomena and transport properties in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Spin-Depairing-Induced Exceptional Fermionic Superfluidity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19525v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the non-Hermitian (NH) attractive Hubbard model with spin depairing, which is a spin-resolved asymmetric hopping that nonreciprocally operates spins in the opposite direction. We find that spin depairing stabilizes a superfluid state unique to the NH system. This phase is characterized not only by a finite order parameter, but also by the emergence of exceptional points (EPs) in the momentum space - a feature that starkly contrasts with previously discussed NH fermionic superfluidity, where EPs are absent within the superfluid state and emerge only at the onset of the superfluid breakdown. We uncover the rich mechanism underlying this ``exceptional fermionic superfluidity'' by analyzing the interplay between EPs and the effective density of states of the complex energy dispersion. Furthermore, we reveal that the exceptional superfluid state breaks down induced by strong spin depairing on the cubic lattice, while it remains robust on the square lattice.</description>

      <title>Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.</description>
