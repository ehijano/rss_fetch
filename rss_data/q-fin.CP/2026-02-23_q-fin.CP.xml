      <title>Beyond the Numbers: Causal Effects of Financial Report Sentiment on Bank Profitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study establishes the causal effects of market sentiment on firm profitability, moving beyond traditional correlational analyses. It leverages a causal forest machine learning methodology to control for numerous confounding variables, enabling systematic analysis of heterogeneity and non-linearities often overlooked. A key innovation is the use of a pre-trained FinancialBERT to generate sentiment scores from quarterly reports, which are then treated as causal interventions impacting profitability dynamics like returns and volatilities. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset from NEPSE, NRB, and individual financial institutions, the research employs SHAP analysis to identify influential profit predictors. A two-pronged causal analysis further explores how sentiment's impact is conditioned by Loan Portfolio/Asset Composition and Balance Sheet Strength/Leverage. Average Treatment Effect analyses, combined with SHAP insights, reveal statistically significant causal associations between certain balance sheet and expense management variables and profitability. This advanced causal machine learning framework significantly extends existing literature, providing a more robust understanding of how financial sentiment truly impacts firm performance.</description>

      <title>The Information Dynamics of Insider Intent: How Reporting Inversions (Form 144) Mask Informational Rents in Insider Sales (Form 4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study identifies and quantifies a significant informational friction embedded in the SEC Form 144 disclosure regime, characterized as predictive decoupling. Drawing on a theoretical foundation of welfare economics, the article argues that the current reporting inversion -- where trade execution (Form 4) frequently precedes the public notice of intent (Form 144) -- violates the conditions for Pareto efficiency by inducing non-symmetric pricing. Utilizing an event-study framework of intent-to-sell windows, the analysis examines cases where insiders file a notice of proposed sale but fail to execute within the statutory 90-day period. The machine learning audit reveals a persistent 52.4 percent opacity rate, where aborted signals remain statistically indistinguishable from routine executions, creating a structural information ceiling that prevents the market from exhausting the signal's informational content. Contrary to the traditional small-firm effect, the study documents a large-cap significance paradox: while small-cap portfolios yield higher absolute abnormal returns (32.21 bps), statistically significant alpha is concentrated in large-cap firms (14.49 bps, $p = 0.021$). The results suggest that Institutional Salience enables more reliable processing of this negative non-event when reputational costs are maximized. Cross-sectional tests confirm that prior idiosyncratic volatility serves as a signal amplifier, with causal estimators identifying an illiquidity jump of up to 2.63 times. To mitigate this market failure, the study proposes a mandatory execution confirmation (Form 144-A) to transition the regime toward bilateral accountability, converting a predictive blind spot into a verifiable data stream and restoring the informational symmetry requisite for efficient capital allocation.</description>

      <title>The Strategic Gap: How AI-Driven Timing and Complexity Shape Investor Trust in the Age of Digital Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional models of market efficiency assume that equity prices incorporate information based on content alone, often neglecting the structural influence of reporting timing and cadence. This study introduces the Autonomous Disclosure Regulator, a multi-node AI framework designed to audit the intersection of disclosure complexity and filing unpredictability. Analyzing a population of 484,796 regulatory filings, the research identifies a structural Strategic Gap: a state where companies use confusing language and unpredictable timing to slow down how fast the market learns the truth by 60%. The results demonstrate a fundamental computational asymmetry in contemporary capital markets. While investors are now good at spotting "copy-paste" text, they remain vulnerable to strategic timing that obscures structural deterioration. The framework isolates 39 high-priority failures where the convergence of dense text and temporal surprises facilitated significant information rent extraction by insiders. By implementing a recursive agentic audit, the system identifies a cumulative welfare recovery potential of over 360\% and demonstrates near-perfect resilience against technical data interruptions. The study concludes by proposing a transition toward an agentic regulatory state, arguing that as information integration costss rise, infrastructure must evolve from passive data repositories into active auditing nodes capable of real-time synthesis to preserve market integrity.</description>

      <title>A Monotone Limit Approach to Entropy-Regularized American Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in continuous-time optimal stopping have been driven by entropy-regularized formulations of randomized stopping problems, with most existing approaches relying on partial differential equation methods. In this paper, we propose a fully probabilistic framework based on the Doob-Meyer-Mertens decomposition of the Snell envelope and its representation through reflected backward stochastic differential equations. We introduce an entropy-regularized penalization scheme yielding a monotone approximation of the value function and establish explicit convergence rates under suitable regularity assumptions. In addition, we develop a policy improvement algorithm based on linear backward stochastic differential equations and illustrate its performance through a simple numerical experiment for an American-style max call option</description>

      <title>Weak error approximation for rough and Gaussian mean-reverting stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a class of stochastic models with Gaussian and rough mean-reverting volatility that embeds the genuine rough Stein-Stein model, we study the weak approximation rate when using a Euler type scheme with integrated kernels. Our first result is a weak convergence rate for the discretised rough Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, that is essentially in $\min(3\alpha-1,1)$, where $\frac{t^{\alpha-1}}{\Gamma(\alpha)} $ is the fractional convolution kernel with $\alpha \in (1/2,1)$. Then, our main result is to obtain the same convergence rate for the corresponding stochastic rough volatility model with polynomial test functions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Signal Extraction from Order Flow: A Matched Filter Perspective on Normalization and Market Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a general matched filter principle for order flow normalization: optimal normalization must match the scaling behaviour of the signal-generating process. For capacity-constrained institutional investors, market capitalization normalization ($S^{MC}$) is the matched filter; for volume-targeting traders (e.g., VWAP/TWAP algorithms), trading value normalization ($S^{TV}$) is optimal. Monte Carlo simulations confirm this principle works bidirectionally, with matched filters achieving up to $1.99\times$ higher signal correlation. Empirical validation using 2.7 million stock-day observations from the Korean market (2020--2024) reveals symmetric normalization dominance across investor types: domestic institutional flows predict next-day returns significantly under $S^{MC}$ ($t = 9.65$), while foreign flows exhibit stronger predictability under $S^{TV}$ ($t = 16.35$) -- with no sign reversal at longer horizons, indicating durable private information rather than temporary price impact. These findings motivate the ``Informed Executor'' hypothesis: sophisticated foreign investors possess genuine private information but employ volume-targeting algorithms for stealth execution -- volume-scaling reflects execution methodology, not absence of information. Information-theoretic validation using KL divergence independently corroborates these results. The matched filter principle generalises to any market where signal scaling varies across trader types, with implications for trading algorithms, factor construction, and market microstructure methodology.</description>
