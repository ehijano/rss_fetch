      <title>Impacts of Data Splitting Strategies on Parameterized Link Prediction Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Link prediction is a fundamental problem in network science, aiming to infer potential or missing links based on observed network structures. With the increasing adoption of parameterized models, the rigor of evaluation protocols has become critically important. However, a previously common practice of using the test set during hyperparameter tuning has led to human-induced information leakage, thereby inflating the reported model performance. To address this issue, this study introduces a novel evaluation metric, Loss Ratio, which quantitatively measures the extent of performance overestimation. We conduct large-scale experiments on 60 real-world networks across six domains. The results demonstrate that the information leakage leads to an average overestimation about 3.6\%, with the bias reaching over 15\% for specific algorithms. Meanwhile, heuristic and random-walk-based methods exhibit greater robustness and stability. The analysis uncovers a pervasive information leakage issue in link prediction evaluation and underscores the necessity of adopting standardized data splitting strategies to enable fair and reproducible benchmarking of link prediction models.</description>

      <title>Sequential Causal Normal Form Games: Theory, Computation, and Strategic Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can classical game-theoretic frameworks be extended to capture the bounded rationality and causal reasoning of AI agents? We investigate this question by extending Causal Normal Form Games (CNFGs) to sequential settings, introducing Sequential Causal Multi-Agent Systems (S-CMAS) that incorporate Pearl's Causal Hierarchy across leader-follower interactions. While theoretically elegant -- we prove PSPACE-completeness, develop equilibrium refinements, and establish connections to signaling theory -- our comprehensive empirical investigation reveals a critical limitation: S-CNE provides zero welfare improvement over classical Stackelberg equilibrium across all tested scenarios. Through 50+ Monte Carlo simulations and hand-crafted synthetic examples, we demonstrate that backward induction with rational best-response eliminates any strategic advantage from causal layer distinctions. We construct a theoretical example illustrating conditions where benefits could emerge ($\epsilon$-rational satisficing followers), though implementation confirms that even relaxed rationality assumptions prove insufficient when good instincts align with optimal play. This negative result provides valuable insight: classical game-theoretic extensions grounded in rational choice are fundamentally incompatible with causal reasoning advantages, motivating new theoretical frameworks beyond standard Nash equilibrium for agentic AI.</description>
