      <title>Evaluation of large language models for discovery of gene set function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04019v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gene set analysis is a mainstay of functional genomics, but it relies on curated databases of gene functions that are incomplete. Here we evaluate five Large Language Models (LLMs) for their ability to discover the common biological functions represented by a gene set, substantiated by supporting rationale, citations and a confidence assessment. Benchmarking against canonical gene sets from the Gene Ontology, GPT-4 confidently recovered the curated name or a more general concept (73% of cases), while benchmarking against random gene sets correctly yielded zero confidence. Gemini-Pro and Mixtral-Instruct showed ability in naming but were falsely confident for random sets, whereas Llama2-70b had poor performance overall. In gene sets derived from 'omics data, GPT-4 identified novel functions not reported by classical functional enrichment (32% of cases), which independent review indicated were largely verifiable and not hallucinations. The ability to rapidly synthesize common gene functions positions LLMs as valuable 'omics assistants.</description>

      <title>Stability distillation hypothesis for the origin of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The essence of life is a frequency distribution conversion process of molecules accompanied by changes in information. In wet-dry cycling hot springs, RNA of different sequences continuously undergoes polymerization and decomposition reactions, products with stable configurations will accumulate their frequency among all RNA molecules and finally become an important source of DNA coding and non-coding regions in primitive cells. This periodic extreme environmental change narrows the frequency distribution of macromolecules through the distillation process and new potential catalysts are searched. When enough macromolecules are accumulated and reliable reaction pathways are built, phospholipids randomly wrap the macromolecules in the hot springs which I would call it the pioneer pools, and these protocells become parallel calculators of molecule frequency distribution. Through the selective permeability of the cell membrane to different molecular weights and properties, cells with appropriate distribution have more opportunities to absorb small molecule substances and increase its intracellular frequencies of molecules. This will strongly induce the occurrence of macromolecules that can widely catalyze the synthesis of other macromolecules or themselves, such as ribosomes, etc. Rupture and fusion during cell division make all protocells share the same frequency distribution of molecules during the origin of life, thus ensuring that all present cells have very similar genetic materials and protein translation systems. This also suggests that viruses may have originated and evolved together with cells.</description>
