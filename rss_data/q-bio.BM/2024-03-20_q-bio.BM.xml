      <title>When SMILES have Language: Drug Classification using Text Classification Methods on Drug SMILES Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex chemical structures, like drugs, are usually defined by SMILES strings as a sequence of molecules and bonds. These SMILES strings are used in different complex machine learning-based drug-related research and representation works. Escaping from complex representation, in this work, we pose a single question: What if we treat drug SMILES as conventional sentences and engage in text classification for drug classification? Our experiments affirm the possibility with very competitive scores. The study explores the notion of viewing each atom and bond as sentence components, employing basic NLP methods to categorize drug types, proving that complex problems can also be solved with simpler perspectives. The data and code are available here: https://github.com/azminewasi/Drug-Classification-NLP.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Specificity in SBDD: Leveraging Delta Score and Energy-Guided Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD), deep learning-based generative models have achieved outstanding performance in terms of docking score. However, further study shows that the existing molecular generative methods and docking scores both have lacked consideration in terms of specificity, which means that generated molecules bind to almost every protein pocket with high affinity. To address this, we introduce the Delta Score, a new metric for evaluating the specificity of molecular binding. To further incorporate this insight for generation, we develop an innovative energy-guided approach using contrastive learning, with active compounds as decoys, to direct generative models toward creating molecules with high specificity. Our empirical results show that this method not only enhances the delta score but also maintains or improves traditional docking scores, successfully bridging the gap between SBDD and real-world needs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Scale Protein Language Model for Unified Molecular Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein language models have demonstrated significant potential in the field of protein engineering. However, current protein language models primarily operate at the residue scale, which limits their ability to provide information at the atom level. This limitation prevents us from fully exploiting the capabilities of protein language models for applications involving both proteins and small molecules. In this paper, we propose ms-ESM (multi-scale ESM), a novel approach that enables multi-scale unified molecular modeling. ms-ESM achieves this by pre-training on multi-scale code-switch protein sequences and utilizing a multi-scale position encoding to capture relationships among residues and atoms. Experimental results indicate that ms-ESM surpasses previous methods in protein-molecule tasks, demonstrating the full utilization of protein language models. Further investigations reveal that through unified molecular modeling, ms-ESM not only gains molecular knowledge but also retains its understanding of proteins.</description>

      <title>Leap: molecular synthesisability scoring with intermediates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assessing whether a molecule can be synthesised is a primary task in drug discovery. It enables computational chemists to filter for viable compounds or bias molecular generative models. The notion of synthesisability is dynamic as it evolves depending on the availability of key compounds. A common approach in drug discovery involves exploring the chemical space surrounding synthetically-accessible intermediates. This strategy improves the synthesisability of the derived molecules due to the availability of key intermediates. Existing synthesisability scoring methods such as SAScore, SCScore and RAScore, cannot condition on intermediates dynamically. Our approach, Leap, is a GPT-2 model trained on the depth, or longest linear path, of predicted synthesis routes that allows information on the availability of key intermediates to be included at inference time. We show that Leap surpasses all other scoring methods by at least 5% on AUC score when identifying synthesisable molecules, and can successfully adapt predicted scores when presented with a relevant intermediate compound.</description>

      <title>Effective model of protein--mediated interactions in chromatin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein-mediated interactions are ubiquitous in the cellular environment, and particularly in the nucleus, where they are responsible for the structuring of chromatin. We show through molecular--dynamics simulations of a polymer surrounded by binders that the strength of the binder-polymer interaction separates an equilibrium from a non-equilibrium regime. In the equilibrium regime, the system can be efficiently described by an effective model in which the binders are traced out. Even in this case, the polymer display features that are different from those of a standard homopolymer interacting with two-body interactions. We then extend the effective model to deal with the case where binders cannot be regarded as in equilibrium and a new phenomenology appears, including local blobs in the polymer. Providing an effective description of the system can be useful in clarifying the fundamental mechanisms governing chromatin structuring.</description>

      <title>A detailed field theory for RNA-like molecules with periodic base sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work examines a field theory for RNA-like molecules in a good solvent. The field theory is based on a lattice model for single- and double-strand RNA with a periodic base sequence, and otherwise contains all known relevant details (polymer types, polymer lengths and interactions). As for the somewhat less explicit $O\left(n\right)$-symmetric model there is a close relation to the conventional one-component branched polymer and the associated Lee-Yang problem. We further elucidate this relation. We derive exact results in the limiting cases of nearly complete denaturation and nearly complete renaturation. The single-strand critical exponent $\nu_{\varphi}$ is calculated in two-loop order.</description>

      <title>Strangers in a foreign land: 'Yeastizing' plant enzymes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12912v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Expressing plant metabolic pathways in microbial platforms is an efficient, cost-effective solution for producing many desired plant compounds. As eukaryotic organisms, yeasts are often the preferred platform. However, expression of plant enzymes in a yeast frequently leads to failure because the enzymes are poorly adapted to the foreign yeast cellular environment. Here we first summarize current engineering approaches for optimizing performance of plant enzymes in yeast. A critical limitation of these approaches is that they are labor-intensive and must be customized for each individual enzyme, which significantly hinders the establishment of plant pathways in cellular factories. In response to this challenge, we propose the development of a cost-effective computational pipeline to redesign plant enzymes for better adaptation to the yeast cellular milieu. This proposition is underpinned by compelling evidence that plant and yeast enzymes exhibit distinct sequence features that are generalizable across enzyme families. Consequently, we introduce a data-driven machine learning framework designed to extract 'yeastizing' rules from natural protein sequence variations, which can be broadly applied to all enzymes. Additionally, we discuss the potential to integrate the machine learning model into a full design-build-test-cycle.</description>

      <title>Assembly Theory is an approximation to algorithmic complexity based on LZ compression that does not explain selection or evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06629v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Assembly Theory, pathway complexity, the assembly index, and the assembly number are subsumed and constitute a weak version of algorithmic (Kolmogorov-Solomonoff-Chaitin) complexity reliant on an approximation method based upon statistical compression, their results obtained due to the use of methods strictly equivalent to the LZ family of compression algorithms used in compressing algorithms such as ZIP, GZIP, or JPEG. Such popular algorithms have been shown to empirically reproduce the results of AT that were reported before in successful application to separating organic from non-organic molecules and in the context of the study of selection and evolution. We prove the connections and full equivalence of Assembly Theory to Shannon Entropy and statistical compression, and AT's disconnection as a statistical approach from causality. We demonstrate that formulating a traditional statistically compressed description of molecules, or the theory underlying it, does not imply an explanation or quantification of biases in generative (physical or biological) processes, including those brought about by selection and evolution, when lacking in logical consistency and empirical evidence. We argue that in their basic arguments, the authors of AT conflate how objects may assemble with causal directionality, and conclude that Assembly Theory does not explain selection or evolution beyond known and previously established connections, some of which are reviewed.</description>
