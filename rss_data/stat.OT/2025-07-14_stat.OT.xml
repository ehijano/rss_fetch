      <title>Are Betting Markets Better than Polling in Predicting Political Elections?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Political elections are one of the most significant aspects of what constitutes the fabric of the United States. In recent history, typical polling estimates have largely lacked precision in predicting election outcomes, which has not only caused uncertainty for American voters, but has also impacted campaign strategies, spending, and fundraising efforts. One intriguing aspect of traditional polling is the types of questions that are asked -- the questions largely focus on asking individuals who they intend to vote for. However, they don't always probe who voters think will win -- regardless of who they want to win. In contrast, online betting markets allow individuals to wager money on who they expect to win, which may capture who individuals think will win in an especially salient manner. The current study used both descriptive and predictive analytics to determine whether data from Polymarket, the world's largest online betting market, provided insights that differed from traditional presidential polling. Overall, findings suggest that Polymarket was superior to polling in predicting the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, particularly in swing states. Results are in alignment with research on ''Wisdom of Crowds'' theory, which suggests a large group of people are often accurate in predicting outcomes, even if they are not necessarily experts or closely aligned with the issue at hand. Overall, our results suggest that betting markets, such as Polymarket, could be employed to predict presidential elections and/or other real-world events. However, future investigations are needed to fully unpack and understand the current study's intriguing results, including alignment with Wisdom of Crowds theory and portability to other events.</description>

      <title>Possibilistic inferential models: a review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An inferential model (IM) is a model describing the construction of provably reliable, data-driven uncertainty quantification and inference about relevant unknowns. IMs and Fisher's fiducial argument have similar objectives, but a fundamental distinction between the two is that the former doesn't require that uncertainty quantification be probabilistic, offering greater flexibility and allowing for a proof of its reliability. Important recent developments have been made thanks in part to newfound connections with the imprecise probability literature, in particular, possibility theory. The brand of possibilistic IMs studied here are straightforward to construct, have very strong frequentist-like reliability properties, and offer fully conditional, Bayesian-like (imprecise) probabilistic reasoning. This paper reviews these key recent developments, describing the new theory, methods, and computational tools. A generalization of the basic possibilistic IM is also presented, making new and unexpected connections with ideas in modern statistics and machine learning, e.g., bootstrap and conformal prediction.</description>

      <title>Adapting OpenAI's CLIP Model for Few-Shot Image Inspection in Manufacturing Quality Control: An Expository Case Study with Multiple Application Examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12596v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This expository paper introduces a simplified approach to image-based quality inspection in manufacturing using OpenAI's CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) model adapted for few-shot learning. While CLIP has demonstrated impressive capabilities in general computer vision tasks, its direct application to manufacturing inspection presents challenges due to the domain gap between its training data and industrial applications. We evaluate CLIP's effectiveness through five case studies: metallic pan surface inspection, 3D printing extrusion profile analysis, stochastic textured surface evaluation, automotive assembly inspection, and microstructure image classification. Our results show that CLIP can achieve high classification accuracy with relatively small learning sets (50-100 examples per class) for single-component and texture-based applications. However, the performance degrades with complex multi-component scenes. We provide a practical implementation framework that enables quality engineers to quickly assess CLIP's suitability for their specific applications before pursuing more complex solutions. This work establishes CLIP-based few-shot learning as an effective baseline approach that balances implementation simplicity with robust performance, demonstrated in several manufacturing quality control applications.</description>
