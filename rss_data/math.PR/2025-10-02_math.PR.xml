      <title>Time-dependency in hyperbolic Anderson model: Stratonovich regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the hyperbolic Anderson equation generated by a time-dependent Gaussian noise is under investigation in two fronts: The solvability and large-$t$ asymptotics. The investigation leads to a necessary and sufficient condition for existence and a precise large-$t$ limit form for the expectation of the solution. Three major developments are made for achieving these goals: A universal bound for Stratonovich moment that guarantees the Stratonovich integrability and ${\cal L}^2$-convergence of the Stratonovich chaos expansion under the best possible condition, a representation of the expected Stratonovich moments in terms of a time-randomized Brownian intersection local time, and a large deviation principle for the time-randomized Brownian intersection local time.</description>

      <title>Local linearization for estimating the diffusion parameter of nonlinear stochastic wave equations with spatially correlated noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bi-parameter local linearization of the one-dimensional nonlinear stochastic wave equation driven by a Gaussian noise, which is white in time and has a spatially homogeneous covariance structure of Riesz-kernel type. We establish that the second-order increments of the solution can be approximated by those of the corresponding linearized wave equation, modulated by the diffusion coefficient. These findings extend the previous results of Huang et al. \cite{HOO2024}, which addressed the case of space-time white noise. As applications, we analyze the quadratic variation of the solution and construct a consistent estimator for the diffusion parameter.</description>

      <title>Degenerate systems of three Brownian particles with asymmetric collisions: invariant measure of gaps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a degenerate system of three Brownian particles undergoing asymmetric collisions. We study the gap process of this system and focus on its invariant measure. The gap process is described as an obliquely reflected degenerate Brownian motion in a quadrant. For all possible parameter cases, we compute the Laplace transform of the invariant measure, and fully characterize the conditions under which it belongs to the following classes: rational, algebraic, differentially finite, or differentially algebraic. We also derive explicit formulas for the invariant measure on the boundary of the quadrant, expressed in terms of a Theta-like function, to which we apply a polynomial differential operator. In this study, we introduce a new parameter called $\gamma$ (along with two additional parameters $\gamma_1$ and $\gamma_2$) which governs many properties of the degenerate process. This parameter is reminiscent of the famous parameter $\alpha$ introduced by Varadhan and Williams (and the two parameters $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ recently introduced by Bousquet-M{\'e}lou et al.) to study nondegenerate reflected Brownian motion in a wedge. To establish our main results we start from a kernel functional equation characterizing the Laplace transform of the invariant measure. By an analytic approach, we establish a finite difference equation satisfied by the Laplace transform. Then, using certain so-called decoupling functions, we apply Tutte's invariant approach to solve the equation via conformal gluing functions. Finally, difference Galois theory and exhaustive study allows us to find necessary and sufficient conditions for the Laplace transform to belong to the specified function hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Shadow and percolation I: discrete landscapes with independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let X be a planar random field on Z^2 which we interpret as a random height function describing some landscape of montains. We consider a source of light (a sun) located at infinity in a direction parallel with an axis od Z^2 and emitting rays which are all parallel and make a slope l with the horizontal plane. Given the value of l some montains of the landscape will be lit by the sun and other will be in the shadow of some higher mountain. Under some assumptions on X, including and independence assumption, we prove that this model may present two different phases depending on l. When l&gt;0 is small enough then, almost surely, there exists an unbounded cluster of points in the shadow. However, if l is big enough then, almost surely, there exists an unbounded cluster of points lit by the sun. We reformulate this problem in terms of percolation of a field alpha which has a simple definition (in terms of X) but that does not present many of the nice properties usually found in percolation models such as FKG inequality, invariance by rotation or finite range correlations.</description>

      <title>Representation and Integration by Parts Formulas for Affine Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Affine processes play an important role in mathematical finance and other applied areas due to their tractable structure. In the present article, we derive probabilistic representations and integration by parts (IBP) formulas for expectations involving affine processes. These formulas are expressed in terms of expectations of affine processes with modified parameters and are derived using Fourier analytic techniques and characteristic functions. Notably, our method does not require pathwise differentiability, allowing us to handle models with square-root diffusion coefficients for a large set of parameters. The methodology can be applied to the classic Cox--Ingersoll--Ross (CIR) model, a model for interest rates in mathematical finance, where the initial value derivative corresponds to one of the ``Greeks'' used in option pricing in mathematical finance. Furthermore, we illustrate the theory with an application to a population evolution model arising as a scaling limit of discrete branching processes. Our approach offers a unified and robust framework for sensitivity analysis in models where classical Malliavin calculus techniques are difficult to apply.</description>

      <title>Fisher information and trajectorial interpretation to the It\^o--Langevin relative entropy dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dissipation phenomena of relative entropy from an It\^o--Langevin dynamical system is a classic topic from stochastic analysis. Relying on the time-reversal of diffusions, a novel trajectorial approach investigates the pathwise behavior of relevant entropy processes, reveals more information from the delicate random structure, and eventually retrieves the known classical results. In essence, this approach provides novel insights and rederives the known results of the It\^o--Langevin dynamics, as will be presented in this expository article. Another part is to view the stochastic time-evolution through the lens of the Wasserstein space, under which we observe the geometric feature of steepest descent of the entropy decay as well as its exponential rate of velocity.</description>

      <title>A probabilistic representation for the gradient in a linear parabolic PDE with Neumann boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a probabilistic representation for the gradient of a 2nd order linear parabolic PDE $\partial_{t}u(t,x)=(1/2)a^{ij}\partial_{ij}u(t,x)+b^{i}\partial_{i}u(t,x)$ with Cauchy initial condition $u(0,x)=f(x)$ and Neumann boundary condition in a (closed) convex bounded smooth domain $D$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, $d\geq 1$. The idea is to start from a penalized version of the associated reflecting diffusion $X^{x}$, proceed with a pathwise derivative, show that the resulting family of $\nu$-directional Jacobians is tight in the Jakubowski S-topology with limit $J^{x,\nu}$, solution of a certain linear SDE, and set $\mathbb{E}\left(\nabla f(X^{x}(t))\cdot J^{x,e_{i}}(t)\right)$ for the gradient $\partial_{i}u(t,x)$, where $x\in D$, $t\geq 0$, $e_{i}$ the canonical basis of $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $f$, the initial condition of the semigroup of $X^{x}$, is differentiable. Some more extensions and applications are discussed in the concluding remarks.</description>

      <title>A debiased Bernoulli factory and unbiased estimation of a probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a known function $f : [0, 1] \mapsto (0, 1)$ and a random but almost surely finite number of independent, Ber$(x)$-distributed random variables with unknown $x \in [0, 1]$, we construct an unbiased, $[0, 1]$-valued estimator of the probability $f(x) \in (0, 1)$. Our estimator is based on so-called debiasing, or randomly truncating a telescopic series of consistent estimators. Constructing these consistent estimators from the coefficients of a particular Bernoulli factory for $f$ yields provable upper and lower bounds for our unbiased estimator. Our result can be thought of as a novel Bernoulli factory with the appealing property that the required number of Ber$(x)$-distributed random variates is independent of their outcomes, and also as constructive example of the so-called $f$-factory.</description>

      <title>The log-Sobolev inequality and correlation functions for the renormalization of 1D Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalization group (RG) method is an important tool for studying critical phenomena. In this paper, we employ stochastic analysis techniques to investigate the stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) derived by regularizing and continuousizing the discrete stochastic equation, which is a variant of stochastic quantization equation of the one dimensional (1D) Ising model. Firstly, we give the regularity estimates for the solution to SPDE. Secondly, we prove the Clark-Ocone-Haussmann formula and derive the log-Sobolev inequality up to the terminal time $T$, as well as obtain a priori form of the renormalization relation. Finally, we verify the correctness of the renormalization procedure based on the partition function, and prove that the two point correlation functions of SPDE on lattices converge to the two point correlation functions of the 1D Ising model at the stable fixed point of the RG transformation as $T\rightarrow +\infty$.</description>

      <title>Heavy-tailed critical Galton--Watson processes with immigration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a critical Galton--Watson branching process with immigration, where the offspring distribution belongs to the domain of attraction of a $(1 + \alpha)$-stable law with $\alpha \in (0,1)$, and the immigration distribution either (i) has finite mean, or (ii) belongs to the domain of attraction of a $\beta$-stable law with $\beta \in (\alpha, 1)$. We show that the tail of the stationary distribution is regularly varying. We analyze the stationary process, determine its tail process, and establish a stable central limit theorem for the partial sums. The norming sequence is different from the one corresponding to the tail of the stationary law. In particular, the extremal index of the process is $0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we sample directed random graphs from (asymmetric) step-graphons and investigate the probability that the random graph has at least a Hamiltonian cycle (or a node-wise Hamiltonian decomposition). We show that for almost all step-graphons, the probability converges to either zero or one as the order of the random graph goes to infinity--we term it the zero-one law. We identify the key objects of the step-graphon that matter for the zero-one law, and establish a set of conditions that can decide whether the limiting value of the probability is zero or one.</description>

      <title>Cutoff Phenomenon for Inhomogeneous Nonlinear Recombination in Arbitrary Finite Product Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we prove the cutoff phenomenon for a general class of the discrete-time nonlinear recombination models. This system models the evolution of a probability measure on a finite product space $S^n$ representing the state of spins on $n$ sites. Although its stationary distribution has a product structure, and its evolution is Markovian, the dynamics of the model is nonlinear. Consequently, the estimation of the mixing time becomes a highly non-trivial task. The special case with two spins and homogeneous stationary measure was considered in Caputo, Labb\'e, and Lacoin [The Annals of Applied Probability 35:1164-1197, 2025], where the cutoff phenomenon for the mixing behavior has been verified. In this article, we extend this result to the general case with finite spins and inhomogeneous stationary measure by developing a novel algebraic representation for the density fluctuation of the system with respect to its stationary state.</description>

      <title>Markov chains on Weyl groups from the geometry of the flag variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a basic Markov chain, the Burnside process, on the space of flags $G/B$ with $G = GL_n(\mathbb{F}_q)$ and $B$ its upper triangular matrices. This gives rise to a shuffling: a Markov chain on the symmetric group realized via the Bruhat decomposition. Actually running and describing this Markov chain requires understanding Springer fibers and the Steinberg variety. The main results give a practical algorithm for all n and q and determine the limiting behavior of the chain when q is large. In describing this behavior, we find interesting connections to the combinatorics of the Robinson-Schensted correspondence and to the geometry of orbital varieties. The construction and description is then carried over to finite Chevalley groups of arbitrary type, describing a new class of Markov chains on Weyl groups.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Aware Sequential Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19525v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In settings like vaccination registries, individuals act after observing others, and the resulting public records can expose private information. We study privacy-preserving sequential learning, where agents add endogenous noise to their reported actions to conceal private signals. Efficient social learning relies on information flow, seemingly in conflict with privacy. Surprisingly, with continuous signals and a fixed privacy budget $(\epsilon)$, the optimal randomization strategy balances privacy and accuracy, accelerating learning to $\Theta_{\epsilon}(\log n)$, faster than the nonprivate $\Theta(\sqrt{\log n})$ rate. In the nonprivate baseline, the expected time to the first correct action and the number of incorrect actions diverge; under privacy with sufficiently small $\epsilon$, both are finite. Privacy helps because, under the false state, agents more often receive signals contradicting the majority; randomization then asymmetrically amplifies the log-likelihood ratio, enhancing aggregation. In heterogeneous populations, an order-optimal $\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ rate is achievable when a subset of agents have low privacy budgets. With binary signals, however, privacy reduces informativeness and impairs learning relative to the nonprivate baseline, though the dependence on $\epsilon$ is nonmonotone. Our results show how privacy reshapes information dynamics and inform the design of platforms and policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide series expansions for the tempered stable densities and for the price of European-style contracts in the exponential L\'evy model driven by the tempered stable process. These formulas recover several popular option pricing models, and become particularly simple in some specific cases such as bilateral Gamma process and one-sided TS process. When compared to traditional Fourier pricing, our method has the advantage of being hyperparameter free. We also provide a detailed numerical analysis and show that our technique is competitive with state-of-the-art pricing methods.</description>

      <title>Random Finite Sumsets and Product Sets in Subsets of the Natural Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of additive and multiplicative structures in random subsets of the natural numbers. Specifically, for a Bernoulli random subset of $\mathbb{N}$ where each integer is included independently with probability $p\in (0,1)$, we prove that almost surely such a set contains finite sumsets (FS-sets) and finite product sets (FP-sets) of every finite length. In addition, we establish a novel connection between Hindman's partition theorem and the central limit theorem, providing a probabilistic perspective on the asymptotic Gaussian behavior of monochromatic finite sums and products. These results can be interpreted as probabilistic analogues of finite-dimensional versions of Hindman's theorem. Applications, implications, and open questions related to infinite FS-sets and FP-sets are discussed.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Face Distributions in Random Reduced $\mathfrak s\mathfrak l_3$ Webs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the distribution of interior faces in uniformly random reduced $\mathfrak s \mathfrak l_3$ webs. Using Tymoczko's bijection between $3\times n$ standard Young tableaux and reduced webs, this problem can be reformulated in terms of constrained lattice paths and associated $m$-diagrams. We develop a framework that expresses crossing probabilities in the $m$-diagram as solutions to discrete Dirichlet problems on the triangular lattice, which are evaluated through solutions to lattice Green's functions. From this we obtain explicit limiting formulas for the frequencies of interior faces of each type. As an application, we analyze faces at a distance at least $d$ from the boundary. We prove that almost all interior faces far from the boundary are hexagons, while faces of size $6+2k$ occur with probability $O(d^{-2k})$.</description>

      <title>Correlation estimates for Brownian particles with singular interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study particle systems with singular pairwise interactions and non-vanishing diffusion in the mean-field scaling. A classical approach to describing corrections to mean-field behavior is through the analysis of correlation functions. For bounded interactions, the optimal estimates on correlations are well known: the $m$-particle correlation function is $G_{N,m}=O(N^{1-m})$ for all $m$. Such estimates, however, have remained out of reach for more singular interactions. In this work, we develop a new framework based on linearized correlation functions, which allows us to derive robust bounds for systems with merely square-integrable interaction kernels, providing the first systematic control of correlations in the singular setting. Although at first not optimal, our estimates can be partially refined a posteriori using the BBGKY hierarchy: in the case of bounded interactions, our method recovers the known optimal estimates with a simplified argument. As key applications, we establish the validity of the Bogolyubov correction to mean field and prove a central limit theorem for the empirical measure, extending these results beyond the bounded interaction regime for the first time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any quantum Hamiltonian with an inverse-polynomial gap, the ground state can be prepared in a polynomial circuit depth to inverse-polynomial precision, if the system size is sufficiently large. The resulting circuit is composed of a polynomial number of Pauli rotations without ancilla qubit. Extending this result, we prove that for sufficiently large qubit number, any quantum state can be approximately prepared with a constant (polynomial) number of Pauli rotations to constant (inverse-polynomial) precision. Our theoretical findings reveal exponential quantum advantages in the prominent applications: ground state preparation, combinatorial optimization, and quantum state preparation.</description>

Abstract: Chater and MacKay [CM] derived an entropy function of state for exchange economies satisfying a list of axioms, and showed that a change of state of a system of such economies is possible if and only if their total entropy does not decrease. In this paper, a large class of agent-based models is proved to satisfy the axioms in the thermodynamic limit, and the entropy is shown to be the logarithm of the partition function for their stationary distributions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Gibbs equilibrium of a classical 2D Coulomb gas in the determinantal case = 2. The external potential is the sum of a quadratic term and the potential generated by individual charges pinned in several extended groups. This leads to an equilibrium measure (droplet) with flat density and macroscopic holes. We consider ''correlation energy'' (free energy minus its mean-field approximation) expansions, for large particle number . Under the assumptions that the holes are sufficiently small, separated, and far from the droplet's outer boundary, we prove that (i) the correlation energy up to order 1 is independent of the holes' locations and orientations, and (ii) the difference between the correlation energies of systems differing by their number of holes involves ''topological'' O(log N ) and O (1) terms.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Data Augmentation for Precision Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inverse covariance (also known as precision matrix) estimation in high-dimensional settings. Specifically, we focus on two classes of estimators: linear shrinkage estimators with a target proportional to the identity matrix, and estimators derived from data augmentation (DA). Here, DA refers to the common practice of enriching a dataset with artificial samples--typically generated via a generative model or through random transformations of the original data--prior to model fitting. For both classes of estimators, we derive estimators and provide concentration bounds for their quadratic error. This allows for both method comparison and hyperparameter tuning, such as selecting the optimal proportion of artificial samples. On the technical side, our analysis relies on tools from random matrix theory. We introduce a novel deterministic equivalent for generalized resolvent matrices, accommodating dependent samples with specific structure. We support our theoretical results with numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks, in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to significantly flatter minima.</description>

      <title>An interpolation of discrete rough differential equations and its applications to analysis of error distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03912v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the solution $Y_t$ $(0\le t\le 1)$ and several approximate solutions $\hat{Y}^m_t$ of a rough differential equation driven by a fractional Brownian motion $B_t$ with the Hurst parameter $1/3&lt;H\leq 1/2$ associated with a dyadic partition of $[0,1]$. We are interested in analysis of asymptotic error distribution of $\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t$ as $m\to\infty$. In the preceding results, it was proved that the weak limit of $\{(2^m)^{2H-1/2}(\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t)\}_{0\le t\le 1}$ coincides with the weak limit of $\{(2^m)^{2H-1/2}J_tI^m_t\}_{0\le t\le 1}$, where $J_t$ is the Jacobian process of $Y_t$ and $I^m_t$ is a certain weighted sum process of Wiener chaos of order $2$ defined by $B_t$. However, it is non-trivial to reduce a problem about $\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t$ to one about $J_t$ and $I^m_t$. In this paper, we introduce an interpolation process between $Y_t$ and $\hat{Y}^m_t$, and give several estimates of the interpolation process itself and its associated processes. The analysis provides a framework to deal with the reduction problem and provides a stronger result that the difference $R^m_t=\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t-J_tI^m_t$ is really small compared to the main term $J_tI^m_t$. More precisely, we show that $(2^m)^{2H-1/2+\varepsilon}\sup_{0\leq t\leq 1}|R^m_t|\to 0$ almost surely and in $L^p$ (for all $p&gt;1$) for certain explicit positive number $\varepsilon&gt;0$. As a consequence, we obtain an estimate of the convergence rate of $\sup_{0\leq t\leq 1}|\hat{Y}^m_t-Y_t|\to 0$ in $L^p$ also.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wiener spaces are in many ways the decisive setting for fundamental results on Gaussian measures: large deviations (Schilder), quasi-invariance (Cameron--Martin), differential calculus (Malliavin), support description (Stroock--Varadhan), concentration of measure (Fernique), etc. Analogues of these classical results have been derived in the "enhanced" context of Gaussian rough paths and, more recently, regularity structures equipped with Gaussian models. The aim of this article is to propose a similar notion directly on this enhanced level - an abstract Wiener model space - that encompasses the aforementioned. More specifically, we focus here on enhanced Schilder type results, Cameron--Martin shifts and Fernique estimates, offering a somewhat unified view on results of Friz--Victoir and Hairer--Weber.</description>

      <title>Competing bootstrap processes on the random graph $G(n,p)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00363v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend classical bootstrap percolation by introducing two concurrent, competing processes on an Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,p_n)$. Each node can assume one of three states: red, black, or white. The process begins with $a_R^{(n)}$ randomly selected active red seeds and $a_B^{(n)}$ randomly selected active black seeds, while all other nodes start as white and inactive. White nodes activate according to independent Poisson clocks with rate 1. Upon activation, a white node evaluates its neighborhood: if its red (black) active neighbors exceed its black (red) active neighbors by at least a fixed threshold $r \geq 2$, the node permanently becomes red (black) and active. Model's key parameters are $r$ (fixed), $n$ (tending to $\infty$), $a_R^{(n)}$, $a_B^{(n)}$, and $p_n$. We investigate the final sizes of the active red ($A^{*(n)}_R$) and black ($A^{*(n)}_B$) node sets across different parameter regimes. For each regime, we determine the relevant time scale and provide detailed characterization of asymptotic dynamics of the two concurrent activation processes.</description>

      <title>Anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations and their applications to nonzero-sum stochastic differential games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14263v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [J. Wen, Y. Shi, Stat. Probab. Lett. 156 (2020) 108599] the authors first introduced a kind of anticipated backward stochastic Volterra integral equations (anticipated BSVIEs, for short). By virtue of the duality principle, it is found in this paper that the anticipated BSVIEs can be applied to the study of stochastic differential games. Naturally, in order to develop the relevant theories and applications of BSVIEs, in this paper we deeply investigate a more general class of anticipated BSVIEs whose generator includes both pointwise time-advanced functions and average time-advanced functions. In theory, the well-posedness and the comparison theorem of anticipated BSVIEs are established, and some regularity results of adapted M-solutions are proved by applying Malliavin calculus, which cover the previous results for BSVIEs. Further, using linear anticipated BSVIEs as the adjoint equation, we present the maximum principle for the nonzero-sum differential game system of stochastic delay Volterra integral equations (SDVIEs, for short) for the first time. As one of the applications of the principle, a Nash equilibrium point of the linear-quadratic differential game problem of SDVIEs is obtained.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the rescaled ``true'' self-avoiding walk $(n^{-2/3}X_{\lfloor nt \rfloor})_{t\in\mathbb{R}_+}$ converges weakly as $n$ goes to infinity to the ``true'' self-repelling motion constructed by T\'oth and Werner. The proof features a joint generalized Ray-Knight theorem for the rescaled local times processes and their merge and absorption points as the main tool for showing both the tightness and convergence of the finite dimensional distributions. Thus, our result can be seen as an example of establishing a functional limit theorem for a family of processes by inverting the joint generalized Ray-Knight theorem.</description>

      <title>Beyond Poisson Approximation: Sums of Markovian Bernoulli Variables with Applications to Brownian Motions and Branching Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19404v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{\eta_i\}_{i\ge 1}$ be a sequence of dependent Bernoulli random variables. While the Poisson approximation for the distribution of $\sum_{i=1}^n\eta_i$ has been extensively studied in the literature, this paper establishes new convergence regimes characterized by non-Poisson limits. Specifically, under a Markovian dependence structure, we show that $\sum_{i=1}^n\eta_i,$ under suitable scaling, converges almost surely or in distribution as $n\to\infty$ to a geometric or Gamma random variable. These results provide a new tool for analyzing the limit distributions of sums of Markovian dependent Bernoulli random variables. We demonstrate these results in several applications: determining the limiting distribution of the number of weak cutspheres for a $d(\ge3)$-dimensional standard Brownian motion; deriving the limit law for weak cutpoints of geometric Brownian motion; and analyzing how often the population size reaches a given threshold in certain branching processes, both with and without immigration.</description>

We also explore certain regimes when \(d = 2\). The proof of recurrence relies on an exponential decay estimate of the fractional moment of the Green's function, which, unlike the classical approach used for \(\mathbb{Z}^d\), requires additional entropy estimates via stability of the model distribution under coarse grain operation, which leverages its linear reinforcement.</description>

Abstract: We establish the scaling limit of a class of boundary random walks to the full spectrum of Brownian-type processes on the half-line. By solving the associated martingale problem and employing weak convergence techniques, we prove that under appropriate scaling, the process converges to the general Brownian motion in the $J_1$-Skorokhod topology. The main novelty of our approach lies in a result on the asymptotic behavior of the local time of the boundary random walks, allowing us to derive a CLT result for several Brownian-type limit processes on the half-line.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_p, p\in\cP$ be a sequence of independent random variables s.t. $\bbP(X_p=\pm 1)=1/2$. Let $\te_j=\prod_{p|j}X_p$ if $j$ is square free and $\te_j=0$ otherwise. Denote $S_n=\sum_{\ell=1}^n\te_\ell$. The from this point of view proving limit theorems for $S_n$ is natural problem, since $S_n$ mimics the behavior of $e^{\sqrt{\ln(\beta)}}$. It is a natural guiding conjecture that $S_n/\sqrt n$ obeys the central limit theorem (CLT). However,
  S. Chatterjee conjectured (as expressed in \cite{[25]}) that the CLT should not hold. Chatterjee's conjecture was proved by Harper \cite{[17]}, and by now it is a direct consequence of a more recent breakthrough by Harper \cite{Har20} that $\frac{S_n}{b_n}\to 0$ in $L^1$, where $b_n=(n^{1/2}(\ln(\ln(n)))^{-1/4})u_n, u_n\to\infty$. In particular $S_n/\sqrt n\to 0$. Nevertheless, the question whether there exists a sequence $a_n=o(b_n)$ such that $S_n/a_n$ converges to some limit remains a mystery. Note that the corresponding problem in the Steinhaus Setting was recently resolved by \cite{Gor1}. In this paper make an attempt to shed some light on the convergence of $S_n/a_n$. Additionally, we obtain explicit estimates on hight moments of $S_n$ without restrictions on the size of the moment compared to $n$ like in \cite[Theorem 1.2]{Har19}, which is of independent interest. This is achieved by a martingale argument together with the Burkholder inequality, and it has applications in a natural number theoretic combinatorial problem. Using martingale techniques we will also obtain exponential concentration inequalities for $S_n$ (in the large deviations regime)</description>

      <title>Locally Lipschitz Path Dependent FBSDEs with Unbounded Terminal Conditions in Brownian and L{\'e}vy Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is dedicated to the analysis of forward backward stochastic differential equations driven by a L{\'e}vy process. We assume that the generator and the terminal condition are path-dependent and satisfy a local Lipschitz condition. We study solvability and Malliavin differentiability of such BSDEs. The proof of the existence and uniqueness is done in three steps. First of all, we truncate and localize the terminal condition and the generator. Then we use an iteration argument to get bounds for the solutions of the truncated BSDE (independent from the level of truncation). Finally, we let the level of truncation tend to infinity. A stability result ends the proof. The Malliavin differentiability result is based on a recent characterisation for the Malliavin Sobolev space D 1,2 by S. Geiss and Zhou.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Parameter-optimization of Gaussian pmDAGs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the parameters of a latent variable causal model is central to causal inference and causal identification. In this article, we show that existing graphical structures that are used in causal inference are not stable under marginalization of Gaussian Bayesian networks, and present a graphical structure that faithfully represent margins of Gaussian Bayesian networks. We present the first duality between parameter optimization of a latent variable model and training a feed-forward neural network in the parameter space of the assumed family of distributions. Based on this observation, we develop an algorithm for parameter optimization of these graphical structures based on a given observational distribution. Then, we provide conditions for causal effect identifiability in the Gaussian setting. We propose an meta-algorithm that checks whether a causal effect is identifiable or not. Moreover, we lay a grounding for generalizing the duality between a neural network and a causal model from the Gaussian to other distributions.</description>

      <title>The Brownian loop measure on Riemann surfaces and applications to length spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a simple identity relating the length spectrum of a Riemann surface to that of the same surface with an arbitrary number of additional cusps. Our proof uses the Brownian loop measure introduced by Lawler and Werner. In particular, we express the total mass of Brownian loops in a fixed free homotopy class on any Riemann surface in terms of the length of the geodesic representative for the complete constant curvature metric. This expression also allows us to write the electrical thickness of a compact set in $\mathbb C$ separating $0$ and $\infty$, or the Velling--Kirillov K\"ahler potential, in terms of the Brownian loop measure and the zeta-regularized determinant of Laplacian as a renormalization of the Brownian loop measure with respect to the length spectrum.</description>

      <title>Robust dividend policy: Equivalence of Epstein-Zin and Maenhout preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a continuous-time economy, this paper formulates the Epstein-Zin preference for discounted dividends received by an investor as an Epstein-Zin singular control utility. We introduce a backward stochastic differential equation with an aggregator integrated with respect to a singular control, prove its well-posedness, and show that it coincides with the Epstein-Zin singular control utility. We then establish that this formulation is equivalent to a robust dividend policy chosen by the firm's executive under the Maenhout's ambiguity-averse preference. In particular, the robust dividend policy takes the form of a threshold strategy on the firm's surplus process, where the threshold level is characterized as the free boundary of a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman variational inequality. Therefore, dividend-caring investors can choose firms that match their preferences by examining stock's dividend policies and financial statements, whereas executives can make use of dividend to signal their confidence, in the form of ambiguity aversion, on realizing the earnings implied by their financial statements.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of random-to-random shuffling in the Hecke algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize random-to-random shuffling from a Markov chain on the symmetric group to one on the Type A Iwahori Hecke algebra, and show that its eigenvalues are polynomials in q with non-negative integer coefficients. Setting q=1 recovers results of Dieker and Saliola, whose computation of the spectrum of random-to-random in the symmetric group resolved a nearly 20 year old conjecture by Uyemura-Reyes. Our methods simplify their proofs by drawing novel connections to the Jucys-Murphy elements of the Hecke algebra, Young seminormal forms, and the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory.</description>

      <title>Pandora's Box Problem With Time Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15261v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pandora's Box problem models the search for the best alternative when evaluation is costly. In the simplest variant, a decision maker is presented with $n$ boxes, each associated with a cost of inspection and a hidden random reward. The decision maker inspects a subset of these boxes one after the other, in a possibly adaptive order, and gains the difference between the largest revealed reward and the sum of the inspection costs. Although this classic version is well understood (Weitzman 1979), there is a flourishing recent literature on variants of the problem. Here we introduce a general framework -- the Pandora's Box Over Time problem -- that captures a wide range of variants where time plays a role, e.g., by constraining the schedules of exploration and influencing costs and rewards. In our framework, boxes have time-dependent rewards and costs, whereas inspection may require a box-specific processing time. Moreover, once a box is inspected, its reward may deteriorate over time. Our main result is an efficient constant-factor approximation to the optimal strategy for the Pandora's Box Over Time problem, which is generally NP-hard to compute. We further obtain improved results for the natural special cases where boxes have no processing time, boxes are available only in specific time slots, or when costs and reward distributions are time-independent (but rewards may still deteriorate after inspection).</description>

      <title>Feature Representation Transferring to Lightweight Models via Perception Coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method for transferring feature representation to lightweight student models from larger teacher models. We mathematically define a new notion called \textit{perception coherence}. Based on this notion, we propose a loss function, which takes into account the dissimilarities between data points in feature space through their ranking. At a high level, by minimizing this loss function, the student model learns to mimic how the teacher model \textit{perceives} inputs. More precisely, our method is motivated by the fact that the representational capacity of the student model is weaker than the teacher model. Hence, we aim to develop a new method allowing for a better relaxation. This means that, the student model does not need to preserve the absolute geometry of the teacher one, while preserving global coherence through dissimilarity ranking. Importantly, while rankings are defined only on finite sets, our notion of \textit{perception coherence} extends them into a probabilistic form. This formulation depends on the input distribution and applies to general dissimilarity metrics. Our theoretical insights provide a probabilistic perspective on the process of feature representation transfer. Our experiments results show that our method outperforms or achieves on-par performance compared to strong baseline methods for representation transferring.</description>
