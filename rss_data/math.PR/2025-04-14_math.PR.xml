      <title>Orthogonal series for si- and related processes, Karhunen-Lo\`eve decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reproduces results from Chapter 11 of the forthcoming book \cite{dzh25}. It discusses series expansions of processes with stationary increments (si-processes) and certain associated processes. Making use of de Branges theory of Hilbert spaces of entire functions, it sheds new light on the existing literature and makes available some new results. In particular, it provides some new decompositions of the Karhunen-Lo\`eve type.</description>

      <title>Higher-order derivatives of first-passage percolation with respect to the environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study higher-order derivatives of first-passage percolation with respect to the environment. One of our main results is a generalization of the Benjamini-Kalai-Schramm-Talagrand variance bound, expressed in terms of the $L^2$-norms of these higher-order derivatives. We analyze the structure of these derivatives and compile a collection of related results. Several of these are sufficiently elementary to allow the use of algorithms and computer programs that automatically generate proofs of inequalities that would otherwise be intractable by manual methods.</description>

      <title>Lower Bound for a Fourth-Order Derivative of First-Passage Percolation with Respect to the Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The variance in first-passage percolation can be bounded in terms of the $L^2$-norms of derivatives with respect to the environment. The study of higher-order derivatives in this context is still in its early stages, and only a few results are currently known. In this work, we prove that $-2$ is the optimal lower bound for the fourth-order derivative. To establish this result, we develop an algorithm and implement a computer program that constructs a rigorous mathematical proof of the inequality.</description>

      <title>Brownian motion and stochastic areas on complex full flag manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Brownian motion on the complex full flag manifold can be represented by a matrix-valued diffusion obtained from the unitary Brownian motion. This representation actually leads to an explicit formula for the characteristic function of the joint distribution of the stochastic areas on the full flag manifold. The limit law for those stochastic areas is shown to be a multivariate Cauchy distribution with independent and identically distributed entries. Using a deep connection between area functionals on the flag manifold and winding functionals on complex spheres, we establish new results about simultaneous Brownian windings on the complex sphere and their asymptotics. As a byproduct, our work also unveils a new probabilistic interpretation of the Jacobi operators and polynomials on simplices.</description>

      <title>Bounds on the distance exponent for higher-dimensional Liouville first passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $\xi \geq 0$ and $d \geq 3$, the higher-dimensional Liouville first passage percolation (LFPP) is a random metric on $\epsilon \mathbb{Z}^d$ obtained by reweighting each vertex by $e^{\xi h_\epsilon(x)}$, where $h_\epsilon(x)$ is a continuous mollification of the whole-space log-correlated Gaussian field. This metric generalizes the two-dimensional LFPP, which is related to Liouville quantum gravity. We derive several estimates for the set-to-set distance exponent of this metric, including upper and lower bounds and bounds on its derivative with respect to $\xi$. In the subcritical region for $\xi$, we derive estimates for the fractal dimension and show that it is continuous and strictly increasing with respect to $\xi$. In particular, our result is an important step towards proving a technical assumption made in previous work by the first author and Gwynne. These are also the first bounds on the distance exponent for LFPP in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Weak equilibria of a mean-field market model under asymmetric information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how asymmetric information affects the equilibrium dynamics in a setting where a large number of players interacts. Motivated by the analysis of the mechanism of equilibrium price formation, we consider the mean-field limit of a model with two subpopulations of asymmetrically informed players. One subpopulation observes a stochastic factor that remains inaccessible to the other. We derive an equation for the mean-field equilibrium and prove the existence of solutions in probabilistic weak sense. We rely on a discretization of the trajectories and on weak convergence arguments. We also study the conditions under which a mean-field equilibrium provides an approximation of the equilibrium price for an economy populated by finitely many players. Finally, we illustrate how, in the case of a single informed agent, her strategy can be characterized in terms of the equilibrium.</description>

Abstract: Sleeping Beauty Problem (SBP) is a probability puzzle which has created much confusion in the literature. In this paper we present the analysis of SBP with use of ergodic Markov chains. The presented model formally connects two different answers to the problem and clarifies some errors related to the frequentist analysis of the paradox.</description>

      <title>Creation of chaos for interacting Brownian particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of $N$ Brownian particles, with or without inertia, interacting in the mean-field regime via a weak, smooth, long-range potential, and starting initially from an arbitrary exchangeable $N$-particle distribution. In this model framework, we establish a fine version of the so-called creation-of-chaos phenomenon: in weak norms, the mean-field approximation for a typical particle is shown to hold with an accuracy $O(N^{-1})$ up to an error due solely to initial pair correlations, which is damped exponentially over time. The novelty is that the initial information appears in our estimates only through pair correlations, which currently seems inaccessible to other methods. This is complemented by corresponding results on higher-order creation of chaos in the form of higher-order correlation estimates.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for $\epsilon$-independent products and higher-order tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a central limit theorem (CLT) for families of products of $\epsilon$-independent random variables. We utilize graphon limits to encode the evolution of independence and characterize the limiting distribution. Our framework subsumes a wide class of dependency structures and includes, as a special case, a CLT for higher-order tensor products of free random variables. Our results extend earlier findings and recover as a special case a recent tensor-free CLT, which was obtained through the development of a tensor analogue of free probability. In contrast, our approach is more direct and provides a unified and concise derivation of a more general CLT via graphon convergence.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Optimality of Projected Inventory Level Policies for Lost Sales Inventory Systems with Large Leadtime and Penalty Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the canonical periodic review lost sales inventory system with positive leadtime and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) demand under the average cost criterion. We demonstrate that the relative value function under the constant order policy satisfies the Wiener-Hopf equation. We employ ladder processes associated with a random walk featuring i.i.d. increments, to obtain an explicit solution for the relative value function. This solution can be expressed as a quadratic form and a term that grows sublinearly. Then we perform an approximate policy iteration step on the constant order policy and bound the approximation errors as a function of the cost of losing a sale. This leads to our main result that projected inventory level policies are asymptotically optimal as the leadtime grows when the cost of losing a sale is sufficiently large and demand has a finite second moment. Under these conditions, we also show that the optimal cost rate approaches infinity, proportional to the square root of the cost of losing a sale.</description>

      <title>Minimal surfaces in strongly correlated random environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A minimal surface in a random environment (MSRE) is a $d$-dimensional surface in $(d+n)$-dimensional space which minimizes the sum of its elastic energy and its environment potential energy, subject to prescribed boundary values. Apart from their intrinsic interest, such surfaces are further motivated by connections with disordered spin systems and first-passage percolation models. In this work, we consider the case of strongly correlated environments, realized by the model of harmonic MSRE in a fractional Brownian environment of Hurst parameter $H\in(0,1)$. This includes the case of Brownian environment ($H=1/2$ and $n=1$), which is commonly used to approximate the domain walls of the $(d+1)$-dimensional random-field Ising model.
  We prove that surfaces of dimension $d\in\{1,2,3\}$ delocalize with power-law fluctuations, and determine their precise transversal and minimal energy fluctuation exponents, as well as the stretched exponential exponents governing the tail decay of their distributions. These exponents are found to be the same in all codimensions $n$, depending only on $d$ and $H$. The transversal and minimal energy fluctuation exponents are specified by two scaling relations.
  We further show that surfaces of dimension $d=4$ delocalize with sub-power-law fluctuations, with their height and minimal energy fluctuations tied by a scaling relation. Lastly, we prove that surfaces of dimensions $d\ge 5$ localize.
  These results put several predictions from the physics literature on mathematically rigorous ground.</description>

Abstract: The game of \emph{Showcase Showdown} with unlimited spins is investigated as an $n$-players continuous game, and the Nash Equilibrium strategies for the players are obtained. The sequential game with information on the results of the previous players is studied, as well as three variants: no information, possibility of draw, and different modalities of winner payoff.</description>

      <title>In almost all shallow analytic neural network optimization landscapes, efficient minimizers have strongly convex neighborhoods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether or not a local minimum of a cost function has a strongly convex neighborhood greatly influences the asymptotic convergence rate of optimizers. In this article, we rigorously analyze the prevalence of this property for the mean squared error induced by shallow, 1-hidden layer neural networks with analytic activation functions when applied to regression problems. The parameter space is divided into two domains: the 'efficient domain' (all parameters for which the respective realization function cannot be generated by a network having a smaller number of neurons) and the 'redundant domain' (the remaining parameters). In almost all regression problems on the efficient domain the optimization landscape only features local minima that are strongly convex. Formally, we will show that for certain randomly picked regression problems the optimization landscape is almost surely a Morse function on the efficient domain. The redundant domain has significantly smaller dimension than the efficient domain and on this domain, potential local minima are never isolated.</description>

      <title>Strong convergence of uniformly random permutation representations of surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be the fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus at least two. Consider the composition of a uniformly random element of $\mathrm{Hom}(\Gamma,S_n)$ with the $(n-1)$-dimensional irreducible representation of $S_n$. We prove the strong convergence in probability as $n\to\infty$ of this sequence of random representations to the regular representation of $\Gamma$.
  As a consequence, for any closed hyperbolic surface $X$, with probability tending to one as $n\to\infty$, a uniformly random degree-$n$ covering space of $X$ has near optimal relative spectral gap -- ignoring the eigenvalues that arise from the base surface $X$.
  To do so, we show that the polynomial method of proving strong convergence can be extended beyond rational settings.
  To meet the requirements of this extension we prove two new kinds of results. First, we show there are effective polynomial approximations of expected values of traces of elements of $\Gamma$ under random homomorphisms to $S_n$. Secondly, we estimate the growth rates of probabilities that a finitely supported random walk on $\Gamma$ is a proper power after a given number of steps.</description>

      <title>On the rate of convergence of estimating the Hurst parameter of rough stochastic volatility models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In [8], easily computable scale-invariant estimator $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ was constructed to estimate the Hurst parameter of the drifted fractional Brownian motion $X$ from its antiderivative. This paper extends this convergence result by proving that $\widehat{\mathscr{R}}^s_n$ also consistently estimates the Hurst parameter when applied to the antiderivative of $g \circ X$ for a general nonlinear function $g$. We also establish an almost sure rate of convergence in this general setting. Our result applies, in particular, to the estimation of the Hurst parameter of a wide class of rough stochastic volatility models from discrete observations of the integrated variance, including the fractional stochastic volatility model.</description>

      <title>Local Phase Tracking and Metastability of Planar Waves in Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planar travelling waves on $\mathbb R^d,$ with $ d\geq 2,$ are shown to persist in systems of reaction-diffusion equations with multiplicative noise on significantly long timescales with high probability, provided that the wave is orbitally stable in dimension one ($d=1$). While a global phase tracking mechanism is required to determine the location of the stochastically perturbed wave in one dimension, or on a cylindrical domain, we show that the travelling wave on the full unbounded space can be controlled by keeping track of local deviations only. In particular, the energy infinitesimally added to or withdrawn from the system by noise dissipates almost fully into the transverse direction, leaving behind small localised phase shifts. The noise process considered is white in time and coloured in space, possibly weighted, and either translation invariant or trace class.</description>

      <title>Stong order 1 adaptive approximation of jump-diffusion SDEs with discontinuous drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an adaptive approximation scheme for jump-diffusion SDEs with discontinuous drift and (possibly) degenerate diffusion. This transformation-based doubly-adaptive quasi-Milstein scheme is the first scheme that has strong convergence rate $1$ in $L^p$ for $p\in[1,\infty)$ with respect to the average computational cost for these SDEs. To obtain our result, we prove that under slightly stronger assumptions which are still weaker than those in existing literature, a related doubly-adaptive quasi-Milstein scheme has convergence order $1$. This scheme is doubly-adaptive in the sense that it is jump-adapted, i.e.~all jump times of the Poisson noise are grid points, and it includes an adaptive stepsize strategy to account for the discontinuities of the drift.</description>

      <title>The speed of random walks on semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct, for each real number $0\leq \alpha \leq 1$, a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup whose speed exponent is $\alpha$. We further show that the speed function of a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup can be arbitrarily slow, yet tending to infinity. These phenomena demonstrate a sharp contrast from the group-theoretic setting. On the other hand, we show that the distance of a random walk on a finitely generated semigroup from its starting position is infinitely often larger than a non-constant universal lower bound, excluding a certain degenerate case.</description>

      <title>A SageMath Package for Analytic Combinatorics in Several Variables: Beyond the Smooth Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The field of analytic combinatorics in several variables (ACSV) develops techniques to compute the asymptotic behaviour of multivariate sequences from analytic properties of their generating functions. When the generating function under consideration is rational, its set of singularities forms an algebraic variety -- called the singular variety -- and asymptotic behaviour depends heavily on the geometry of the singular variety. By combining a recent algorithm for the Whitney stratification of algebraic varieties with methods from ACSV, we present the first software that rigorously computes asymptotics of sequences whose generating functions have non-smooth singular varieties (under other assumptions on local geometry). Our work is built on the existing sage_acsv package for the SageMath computer algebra system, which previously gave asymptotics under a smoothness assumption. We also report on other improvements to the package, such as an efficient technique for determining higher order asymptotic expansions using Newton iteration, the ability to use more efficient backends for algebraic computations, and a method to compute so-called critical points for any multivariate rational function through Whitney stratification.</description>

      <title>Parameters estimation of a Threshold Chan-Karolyi-Longstaff-Sanders process from continuous and discrete observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a continuous time process that is self-exciting and ergodic, called threshold Chan-Karolyi-Longstaff-Sanders (CKLS) process. This process is a generalization of various models in econometrics, such as Vasicek model, Cox-Ingersoll-Ross, and Black-Scholes, allowing for the presence of several thresholds which determine changes in the dynamics. We study the asymptotic behavior of maximum-likelihood and quasi-maximum-likelihood estimators of the drift parameters in the case of continuous time and discrete time observations. We show that for high frequency observations and infinite horizon the estimators satisfy the same asymptotic normality property as in the case of continuous time observations. We also discuss diffusion coefficient estimation. Finally, we apply our estimators to simulated and real data to motivate considering (multiple) thresholds.</description>

      <title>The law of large numbers for discrete generalized quantum channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider random linear operators $\Omega \to \mathcal{L}(\mathcal{T}_p, \mathcal{T}_p)$ acting in a $p$-th Schatten class $\mathcal{T}_p$ in a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$ for some $1 \leqslant p &lt; \infty$. Such a superoperator is called a pre-channel since it is an extension of a quantum channel to a wider class of operators without requirements of trace-preserving and positivity. Instead of the sum of i.i.d. variables there may be considered the composition of random semigroups $e^{A_i t/n}$ in the Banach space $\mathcal{T}_p$. The law of large numbers is known in the case $p=2$ in the form of the usual law of large numbers for random operators in a Hilbert space. We obtain the law of large numbers for the case $1\leqslant p \leqslant 2$.</description>

Abstract: We study the generalized Chv\'atal-Sankoff constant $\gamma_{k,d}$, which represents the normalized expected length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of $d$ independent uniformly random strings over an alphabet of size $k$. We derive asymptotically tight bounds for $\gamma_{2,d}$, establishing that $\gamma_{2,d} = \frac{1}{2} + \Theta\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{d}}\right)$. We also derive asymptotically near-optimal bounds on $\gamma_{k,d}$ for $d\ge \Omega(\log k)$.</description>

      <title>Ladder costs for random walks in L\'evy random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.02271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a random walk $Y$ moving on a L\'evy random medium, namely a one-dimensional renewal point process with inter-distances between points that are in the domain of attraction of a stable law. The focus is on the characterization of the law of the first-ladder height $Y_{\mathcal{T}}$ and length $L_{\mathcal{T}}(Y)$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is the first-passage time of $Y$ in $\mathbb{R}^+$. The study relies on the construction of a broader class of processes, denoted Random Walks in Random Scenery on Bonds (RWRSB) that we briefly describe. The scenery is constructed by associating two random variables with each bond of $\mathbb{Z}$, corresponding to the two possible crossing directions of that bond. A random walk $S$ on $\mathbb{Z}$ with i.i.d increments collects the scenery values of the bond it traverses: we denote this composite process the RWRSB. Under suitable assumptions, we characterize the tail distribution of the sum of scenery values collected up to the first exit time $\mathcal{T}$. This setting will be applied to obtain results for the laws of the first-ladder length and height of $Y$. The main tools of investigation are a generalized Spitzer-Baxter identity, that we derive along the proof, and a suitable representation of the RWRSB in terms of local times of the random walk $S$. All these results are easily generalized to the entire sequence of ladder variables.</description>

      <title>The radius of a self-repelling star polymer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.01537v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effective radius of weakly self-avoiding star polymers in one, two, and three dimensions. Our model includes $N$ Brownian motions up to time $T$, started at the origin and subject to exponential penalization based on the amount of time they spend close to each other, or close to themselves. The effective radius measures the typical distance from the origin. Our main result gives estimates for the effective radius where in two and three dimensions we impose the restriction that $T \leq N$. One of the highlights of our results is that in two dimensions, we find that the radius is proportional to $T^{3/4}$, up to logarithmic corrections. Our result may shed light on the well-known conjecture that for a single self-avoiding random walk in two dimensions, the end-to-end distance up to time $T$ is roughly $T^{3/4}$.</description>

      <title>Scaling Limits of Stochastic Transport Equations on Manifolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we generalize some results on scaling limits of stochastic transport equations on the torus, developed recently by Flandoli, Galeati and Luo in Galeati (2020); Flandoli and Luo (2020); Flandoli et al. (2024), to manifolds. We consider the stochastic transport equations driven by colored space-time noise (smooth in space, white in time) on a compact Riemannian manifold without boundary. Then we study the scaling limits of stochastic transport equations, tuning the noise in such a way that the space covariance of the noise on the diagonal goes to the identity matrix but the covariance operator itself goes to zero. This includes the large scale analysis regime with diffusive scaling. We obtain different scaling limits depending on the initial data. With space white noise as initial data, the solutions to the stochastic transport equations converge in distribution to the solution to a stochastic heat equation with additive noise. With square integrable initial data, the solutions to the stochastic transport equations converge to the solution to the deterministic heat equation, and we provide quantitative estimates on the convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits for Consensus-Based Optimization and Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07373v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For algorithms based on interacting particle systems that admit a mean-field description, convergence analysis is often more accessible at the mean-field level. In order to transfer convergence results obtained at the mean-field level to the finite ensemble size setting, it is desirable to show that the particle dynamics converge in an appropriate sense to the corresponding mean-field dynamics. In this paper, we prove quantitative mean-field limit results for two related interacting particle systems: Consensus-Based Optimization and Consensus-Based Sampling. Our approach requires a generalization of Sznitman's classical argument: in order to circumvent issues related to the lack of global Lipschitz continuity of the coefficients, we discard an event of small probability, the contribution of which is controlled using moment estimates for the particle systems. In addition, we present new results on the well-posedness of the particle systems and their mean-field limit, and provide novel stability estimates for the weighted mean and the weighted covariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish an existence result of a solution to a class of probability measure-valued equations, whose solutions can be associated with stationary distributions of many McKean-Vlasov diffusions with gradient-type drifts. Coefficients of the probability measure-valued equation may be discontinuous in the weak topology and the total variation norm. Owing to that the bifurcation point of the probability measure-valued equation is relevant to the phase transition point of the associated McKean-Vlasov diffusion, we establish a local Krasnosel'skii bifurcation theorem. Regularized determinant for the Hilbert-Schmidt operator is used to derive our criteria for the bifurcation point. Concrete examples, including the granular media equation and the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation with quadratic interaction, are given to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>Fixation for $\mathcal{U}$-Ising and $\mathcal{U}$-voter dynamics with frozen vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07807v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The zero-temperature stochastic Ising model is a special case of the famous stochastic Ising model of statistical mechanics, and the voter model is another classical model in this field. In both models, each vertex of the graph $\mathbb{Z}^d$ can have one of two states, and can change state to match the state of its neighbors. In 2017, Morris proposed generalizations of these models, the $\mathcal{U}$-Ising and $\mathcal{U}$-voter dynamics, in which a vertex can change state to match the state of certain subsets of vertices near it. These generalizations were inspired by similar generalizations in the related model of bootstrap percolation, where Balister, Bollob\'as, Duminil-Copin, Morris, Przykucki, Smith and Uzzell were able to establish a very impressive universality classification of the generalized models. However, there have been very few results on the $\mathcal{U}$-Ising and $\mathcal{U}$-voter dynamics. The only one is due to Blanquicett in 2021, who obtained a few encouraging advances on the important question of fixation, which is only partially solved for the zero-temperature stochastic Ising model: will all vertices eventually settle on a given state or will they oscillate forever between the two states? In this work, we tackle a question which was solved for the zero-temperature stochastic Ising model by Damron, Eckner, Kogan, Newman and Sidoravicius in 2015: fixation when a fraction of the vertices of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ are frozen in one of the states. For $d=1$ and $2$, in most cases we prove that if all frozen vertices are in the same state, all vertices eventually settle at this state. Moreover, if vertices can be frozen in both states but the proportion of vertices frozen in the second state is small enough, we were able to establish a universality classification identifying the models in which all vertices settle in a given state.</description>

Abstract: In dimensions 3 or larger, it is a classical fact that the directed polymer model has two phases: Brownian behavior at high temperature, and non-Brownian behavior at low temperature. We consider the response of the polymer to an external field or tilt, and show that at fixed temperature, the polymer has Brownian behavior for some fields and non-Brownian behavior for others. In other words, the external field can induce the phase transition in the directed polymer model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01320v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a theoretical analysis of the original formulation of denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), introduced by Ho, Jain, and Abbeel in Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33 (2020), pp. 6840-6851. An explicit upper bound is derived for the total variation distance between the distribution of the discrete-time DDPM sampling algorithm and a target data distribution, under general noise schedule parameters. The analysis assumes certain technical conditions on the data distribution and a linear growth condition on the noise estimation function. The sampling sequence emerges as an exponential integrator-type approximation of a reverse-time stochastic differential equation (SDE) over a finite time interval. Schr\"odinger's problem provides a tool for estimating the distributional error in reverse time, which connects the reverse-time error with its forward-time counterpart. The score function in DDPMs appears as an adapted solution of a forward-backward SDE, providing a foundation for analyzing the time-discretization error associated with the reverse-time SDE.</description>

Abstract: We consider a random quantum channel obtained by taking a selection of $d$ independent and Haar distributed $N$ dimensional unitaries. We follow the argument of Hastings to bound the spectral gap in terms of eigenvalues and adapt it to give an exact estimate of the spectral gap in terms of singular values \cite{hastings2007random,harrow2007quantum}. This shows that we have constructed a random quantum expander in terms of both singular values and eigenvalues. The lower bound is an analog of the Alon-Boppana bound for $d$-regular graphs. The upper bound is obtained using Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

Abstract: Owing to exhibiting phase transitions, we investigate the local convergence near a stationary distribution for distribution dependent stochastic differential equations. By linearizing the nonlinear Markov semigroup associated with the distribution dependent equation around the stationary distribution, the local exponential convergence of the solution is related to the exponential convergence of a semigroup of linear operators. Our result can be used as a criteria for the locally exponential stability of stationary distributions. Concrete examples, including the granular media equation with double-wells landscapes and quadratic interaction, are given to illustrate our main result.</description>

      <title>Delocalization of a general class of random block Schr\"odinger operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08608v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a natural class of extensions of the Anderson model on $\mathbb Z^d$, called random block Schr\"odinger operators (RBSOs), defined on the $d$-dimensional torus $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$. These operators take the form $H=V+\lambda\Psi$, where $V$ is a diagonal block matrix whose diagonal blocks are i.i.d. $W^d\times W^d$ GUE, representing a random block potential, $\Psi$ describes interactions between neighboring blocks, and $\lambda\ll 1$ is a small coupling parameter (making $H$ a perturbation of $V$). We focus on three specific RBSOs: (1) the block Anderson model, where $\Psi$ is the discrete Laplacian on $(\mathbb Z/L\mathbb Z)^d$; (2) the Anderson orbital model, where $\Psi$ is a block Laplacian operator; (3) the Wegner orbital model, where the nearest-neighbor blocks of $\Psi$ are themselves random matrices. Assuming $d\ge 7$ and $W\ge L^\varepsilon$ for a small constant $\varepsilon&gt;0$, and under a certain lower bound on $\lambda$, we establish delocalization and quantum unique ergodicity for bulk eigenvectors, along with quantum diffusion estimates for the Green's function. Combined with the localization results of arXiv:1608.02922, our results rigorously demonstrate the existence of an Anderson localization-delocalization transition for RBSOs as $\lambda$ varies. Our proof is based on the $T$-expansion method and the concept of self-energy renormalization, originally developed in the study of random band matrices in arXiv:2104.12048. In addition, we introduce a conceptually novel idea, called coupling renormalization, which extends the notion of self-energy renormalization. While this phenomenon is well-known in quantum field theory, it is identified here for the first time in the context of random Schr\"odinger operators. We expect that our methods can be extended to models with real or non-Gaussian block potentials, as well as more general forms of interactions.</description>

      <title>Multitype L\'evy trees as scaling limits of multitype Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish sufficient mild conditions for a sequence of multitype Bienaym\'e-Galton-Watson trees, conditioned in some sense to be large, to converge to a limiting compact metric space which we call a \emph{multitype L\'evy tree}. More precisely, we condition on the size of the maximal subtree of vertices of the same type generated by the root to be large. Although under a different conditioning, our result can be seen as a generalization to the multitype setting of the continuum random trees defined by Aldous, Duquesne and Le Gall in [Ald91a,Ald91b,Ald93,DLG02]. Our main result is an invariance principle for the convergence of such trees, by gluing single-type L\'{e}vy trees together in a method determined by the limiting spectrally positive additive L\'{e}vy field, as constructed by Chaumont and Marolleau [CM21].
  Our approach is a particular case of a more general result about the convergence in the Gromov-Hausdorff-Prohorov topology, of compact marked metric spaces equipped with vector-valued measures, and then glued via an iterative operation. To analyze the gluing operation, we extend the techniques developed by S\'enizergues [Sen19,Sen22] to the multitype setting. While the single-type case exhibits a more homogeneous structure with simpler dependency patterns, the multitype case introduces interactions between different types, leading to a more intricate dependency structure where functionals must account for type-specific behaviors and inter-type relationships.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23342v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the coupled non-linear integro-differential equations for the thermodynamic limit of the empirical correlation and response functions in the Langevin dynamics at temperature $T$, for spherical mixed $p$-spin disordered mean-field models, initialized according to a Gibbs measure for temperature $T_0$, in the replica-symmetric (RS) or $1$-replica-symmetry-breaking (RSB) phase. For any $T_0=T$ above the dynamical phase transition point $T_c^{\rm dyn}$ the resulting stationary relaxation dynamics coincide with the FDT solution for these equations, while for lower $T_0=T$ in the $1$-RSB phase, the relaxation dynamics coincides with the FDT solution, now concentrated on the single spherical band within the Gibbs measure's support on which the initial point lies.</description>

      <title>An Antithetic Multilevel Monte Carlo-Milstein Scheme for Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with non-commutative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14169v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel multilevel Monte Carlo approach for estimating quantities of interest for stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs). Drawing inspiration from [Giles and Szpruch: Antithetic multilevel Monte Carlo estimation for multi-dimensional SDEs without L\'evy area simulation, Annals of Appl. Prob., 2014], we extend the antithetic Milstein scheme for finite-dimensional stochastic differential equations to Hilbert space-valued SPDEs. Our method has the advantages of both Euler and Milstein discretizations, as it is easy to implement and does not involve intractable L\'evy area terms. Moreover, the antithetic correction in our method leads to the same variance decay in a MLMC algorithm as the standard Milstein method, resulting in significantly lower computational complexity than a corresponding MLMC Euler scheme. Our approach is applicable to a broader range of non-linear diffusion coefficients and does not require any commutative properties. The key component of our MLMC algorithm is a truncated Milstein-type time stepping scheme for SPDEs, which accelerates the rate of variance decay in the MLMC method when combined with an antithetic coupling on the fine scales. We combine the truncated Milstein scheme with appropriate spatial discretizations and noise approximations on all scales to obtain a fully discrete scheme and show that the antithetic coupling does not introduce an additional bias.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Fractional Fourier Transform (FRFT) scheme based on closed Newton-Cotes rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16379v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The paper improves the accuracy of the one-dimensional fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) by leveraging closed Newton-Cotes quadrature rules. Using the weights derived from the Composite Newton-Cotes rules of order QN, we demonstrate that the FRFT of a QN-long weighted sequence can be expressed as two composites of FRFTs. The first composite consists of an FRFT of a Q-long weighted sequence and an FRFT of an N-long sequence. Similarly, the second composite comprises an FRFT of an N-long weighted sequence and an FRFT of a Q-long sequence. Empirical results suggest that the composite FRFTs exhibit the commutative property and maintain consistency both algebraically and numerically. The proposed composite FRFT approach is applied to the inversion of Fourier and Laplace transforms, where it outperforms both the standard non-weighted FRFT and the Newton-Cotes integration method, though the improvement over the latter is less pronounced.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Expectation Inference for Efficient Uncertainty Quantification and History Matching of Transient Darcy Flows in Porous Media with Random Parameters Under Distribution Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06923v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The uncertainty quantification of Darcy flows using history matching is important for the evaluation and prediction of subsurface reservoir performance. Conventional methods aim to obtain the maximum a posterior or maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) using gradient-based, heuristic or ensemble-based methods. These methods can be computationally expensive for high-dimensional problems since forward simulation needs to be run iteratively as physical parameters are updated. In the current study, we propose a nonlinear expectation inference (NEI) method for efficient history matching and uncertainty quantification accounting for distribution or Knightian uncertainty. Forward simulation runs are conducted on prior realisations once, and then a range of expectations are computed in the data space based on subsets of prior realisations with no repetitive forward runs required. In NEI, no prior probability distribution for data is assumed. Instead, the probability distribution is assumed to be uncertain with prior and posterior uncertainty quantified by nonlinear expectations. The inferred result of NEI is the posterior subsets on which the expected flow rates cover the varying interval of observation. The accuracy and efficiency of the new method are validated using single- and two-phase Darcy flows in 2D and 3D heterogeneous reservoirs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a family of linear operators, diagonalized by the Hankel transform. The Fredholm determinants of these operators, restricted to $L_2[0, R]$, are expressed in a convenient form for asymptotic analysis as $R\to\infty$. The result is an identity, in which the determinant is equal to the leading asymptotic multiplied by an asymptotically small factor, for which an explicit formula is derived. We apply the result to the determinantal point process with the Bessel kernel, calculating the speed of the convergence of additive functionals with respect to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov metric.</description>

      <title>Sign changes of the partial sums of a random multiplicative function III: Average</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19845v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $V(x)$ be the number of sign changes of the partial sums up to $x$, say $M_f(x)$, of a Rademacher random multiplicative function $f$. We prove that the averaged value of $V(x)$ is at least $\gg (\log x)(\log\log x)^{-1/2-\epsilon}$. Our new method applies for the counting of sign changes of the partial sums of a system of orthogonal random variables having variance $1$ under additional hypothesis on the moments of these partial sums. In particular, we extend to larger classes of dependencies an old result of Erd\H{o}s and Hunt on sign changes of partial sums of i.i.d. random variables. In the arithmetic case, the main input in our method is the ``\textit{linearity}'' phase in $1\leq q\leq 1.9$ of the quantity $\log \mathbb{E} |M_f(x)|^q$, provided by the Harper's \textit{better than squareroot cancellation} phenomenon for small moments of $M_f(x)$.</description>

      <title>Law of Large Numbers and Central Limit Theorem for random sets of solitons of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a random configuration of $N$ soliton solutions $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})$ of the cubic focusing Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (fNLS) equation in one space dimension. The $N$ soliton solutions are parametrized by a $N$-dimension complex vector $\boldsymbol{\lambda}$ whose entries are the eigenvalues of the Zakharov-Shabat linear spectral problem and by $N$ nonzero complex norming constants. The randomness is obtained by choosing the complex eigenvalues i.i.d. random variables sampled from a probability distribution with compact support on the complex plane. The corresponding norming constants are interpolated by a smooth function of the eigenvalues. Then we consider the Zakharov-Shabat linear problem for the expectation of the random measure associated to the spectral data. We denote the corresponding solution of the fNLS equation by $\psi_\infty(x,t)$. This solution can be interpreted as a soliton gas solution. We prove a Law of Large Numbers and a Central Limit Theorem for the differences $\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})-\psi_\infty(x,t)$ and $|\psi_N(x,t;\boldsymbol{\lambda})|^2-|\psi_\infty(x,t)|^2$ when $(x,t)$ are in a compact set of $\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^+$; we additionally compute the correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Functional worst risk minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00412v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to extend worst risk minimization, also called worst average loss minimization, to the functional realm. This means finding a functional regression representation that will be robust to future distribution shifts on the basis of data from two environments. In the classical non-functional realm, structural equations are based on a transfer matrix $B$. In section~\ref{sec:sfr}, we generalize this to consider a linear operator $\mathcal{T}$ on square integrable processes that plays the the part of $B$. By requiring that $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ is bounded -- as opposed to $\mathcal{T}$ -- this will allow for a large class of unbounded operators to be considered. Section~\ref{sec:worstrisk} considers two separate cases that both lead to the same worst-risk decomposition. Remarkably, this decomposition has the same structure as in the non-functional case. We consider any operator $\mathcal{T}$ that makes $(I-\mathcal{T})^{-1}$ bounded and define the future shift set in terms of the covariance functions of the shifts. In section~\ref{sec:minimizer}, we prove a necessary and sufficient condition for existence of a minimizer to this worst risk in the space of square integrable kernels. Previously, such minimizers were expressed in terms of the unknown eigenfunctions of the target and covariate integral operators (see for instance \cite{HeMullerWang} and \cite{YaoAOS}). This means that in order to estimate the minimizer, one must first estimate these unknown eigenfunctions. In contrast, the solution provided here will be expressed in any arbitrary ON-basis. This completely removes any necessity of estimating eigenfunctions. This pays dividends in section~\ref{sec:estimation}, where we provide a family of estimators, that are consistent with a large sample bound. Proofs of all the results are provided in the appendix.</description>

      <title>A particle system approach towards the global well-posedness of master equations for potential mean field games of control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11742v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the $N$-particle systems as well as the HJB/master equations for a class of generalized mean field control (MFC) problems and the corresponding potential mean field games of control (MFGC). A local in time classical solution for the HJB equation is generated via a probabilistic approach based on the mean field maximum principle. Given an extension of the so called displacement convexity condition, we obtain the uniform estimates on the HJB equation for the $N$-particle system. Such estimates imply the displacement convexity/semi-concavity and thus the prior estimates on the solution to the HJB equation for generalized MFC problems. The global well-posedness of HJB/master equation for generalized MFC/potential MFGC is then proved thanks to the local well-posedness and the prior estimates. In view of the nature of the displacement convexity condition, such well-posedness is also true for the degenerated case. Our analysis on the $N$-particle system also induces an Lipschitz approximator to the optimal feedback function in generalized MFC/potential MFGC where an algebraic convergence rate is obtained. Furthermore, an alternative approximate Nash equilibrium is proposed based on the $N$-particle system, where the approximation error is quantified thanks to the aforementioned uniform estimates.</description>

Abstract: This paper serves as a user's guide to sampling strategies for sliced optimal transport. We provide reminders and additional regularity results on the Sliced Wasserstein distance. We detail the construction methods, generation time complexity, theoretical guarantees, and conditions for each strategy. Additionally, we provide insights into their suitability for sliced optimal transport in theory. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data offer a representative comparison of the strategies, culminating in practical recommendations for their best usage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of a (mild) $C$-existence family in complete random normed modules, then we prove that a (mild) $C$-existence family can guarantee the existence of the (mild) solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem in the random setting. Second, we investigate several important properties peculiar to locally almost surely bounded $C$-semigroups in complete random normed modules, which are not involved in the classical theory of $C$-semigroups. Finally, based on the above work, some relations among $C$-existence families, $C$-semigroups and their associated abstract Cauchy problems in complete random normed modules are established, which extend and improve some known results. Besides, an application to a type of stochastic differential equations is also given.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove the $W$-entropy formula and the monotonicity and rigidity theorem of the $W$-entropy for the heat flow on RCD$(K, N)$ and RCD$(K, n, N)$ spaces $(X, d, \mu)$, where $K\in \mathbb{R}$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$ is the geometric dimension of $(X, d, \mu)$ and $N\geq n$. We also prove the $K$-concavity of the Shannon entropy power on RCD$(K, N)$ spaces. As an application, we derive the Shannon entropy isoperimetric inequality and the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces with maximal volume growth condition. Finally, we prove the rigidity theorem for the Stam type logarithmic Sobolev inequality with sharp constant on noncollapsing RCD$(0, N)$ spaces.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Modeling of Option Pricing with an Extended Black-Scholes Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03175v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates enhancing option pricing by extending the Black-Scholes model to include stochastic volatility and interest rate variability within the Partial Differential Equation (PDE). The PDE is solved using the finite difference method. The extended Black-Scholes model and a machine learning-based LSTM model are developed and evaluated for pricing Google stock options. Both models were backtested using historical market data. While the LSTM model exhibited higher predictive accuracy, the finite difference method demonstrated superior computational efficiency. This work provides insights into model performance under varying market conditions and emphasizes the potential of hybrid approaches for robust financial modeling.</description>

      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of Sub-quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>
