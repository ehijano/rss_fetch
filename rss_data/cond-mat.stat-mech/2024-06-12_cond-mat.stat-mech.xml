      <title>Thermodynamic Relations between Free Energy and Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic and dynamical processes lie at the heart of all physical, chemical, and biological systems. However, kinetic and thermodynamic properties which characterize these processes have largely been treated separately as they can be obtained independently for many systems at thermodynamic equilibrium. In this work we demonstrate the existence of a class of relations between kinetic and thermodynamic factors which holds even in the hydrodynamic limit, and which must be satisfied for all systems that satisfy detailed balance and Boltzmann distribution at equilibrium. We achieve this by proving that for systems with inhomogeneous equilibrium states governed by dynamics such as the Cahn-Hilliard (CH) dynamics, the chemical potential and self-diffusivity must mutually constrain each other. We discuss common issues in the literature which result in inconsistent formulations, construct the consistency requirement mathematically, develop a class of self-diffusivities that guarantee consistency, and discuss how the requirement originates from detailed balance and Boltzmann distribution, and is therefore applicable to both conserved and non-conserved dynamics.</description>

      <title>Local Time Statistics and Permeable Barrier Crossing: from Poisson to Birth-Death Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Barrier crossing is a widespread phenomenon across natural and engineering systems. While an abundant cross-disciplinary literature on the topic has emerged over the years, the stochastic underpinnings of the process are yet to be fully understood. We fill this knowledge gap by considering a diffusing particle and presenting a stochastic definition of Brownian motion in the presence of a permeable barrier. This definition relies on reflected Brownian motion and on the crossing events being Poisson processes subordinated by the local time of the underlying motion at the barrier. Within this paradigm we derive the exact expression for the distribution of the number of crossings, and find an experimentally measurable statistical definition of permeability. We employ Feynman-Kac theory to derive and solve a set of governing birth-death diffusion equations and extend them to when barrier permeability is asymmetric. As an application we study a system of infinite, identical and periodically placed asymmetric barriers for which we derive analytically effective transport parameters. This periodic arrangement induces an effective drift at long times whose magnitude depends on the difference in the permeability on either side of the barrier as well as on their absolute values. As the asymmetric permeabilities act akin to localised ``ratchet'' potentials that break spatial symmetry and detailed balance, the proposed arrangement of asymmetric barriers provides an example of a noise-induced drift without the need to time-modulate any external force or create temporal correlations on the motion of a diffusing particle.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of the Landau-Lifshitz one-dimensional magnet, with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning approaches to classical density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this chapter, we discuss recent advances and new opportunities through methods of machine learning for the field of classical density functional theory, dealing with the equilibrium properties of thermal nano- and micro-particle systems having classical interactions. Machine learning methods offer the great potential to construct and/or improve the free energy functional (the central object of density functional theory) from simulation data and thus they complement traditional physics- or intuition-based approaches to the free energy construction. We also give an outlook to machine learning efforts in related fields, such as liquid state theory, electron density functional theory and power functional theory as a functionally formulated approach to classical nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian spacetime and generalized thermofield double formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06961v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the non-Hermitian transition matrix and its gravity dual. States in quantum field theories or gravity theories are typically prepared using Euclidean path integrals. We demonstrate that it is both natural and necessary to introduce non-Hermitian transitions to describe the state when employing different inner products in Euclidean quantum field theories. Transition matrices that are $\eta$-pseudo-Hermitian, with $\eta$ being positive-definite, play the same role as density matrices, where the operator $\eta$ is closely related to the definition of the inner product. Moreover, there exists a one-to-one correspondence between these transition matrices and density matrices. In the context of AdS/CFT correspondence, the Euclidean path integral in the boundary field theory can be translated to the bulk gravitational path integral. We provide an overview of the construction and interpretation of non-Hermitian spacetime. Specifically, we demonstrate the crucial role of the non-Hermitian transition matrix in realizing the thermofield concept in general cases and in understanding the gravity states dual to the eternal black hole. In this context, the pseudoentropy of the transition matrix can also be interpreted as black hole entropy. Finally, we highlight the strong subadditivity property of pseudoentropy, and the connection between non-Hermitian transition matrices and complex metrics.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of active dumbbells near a circular obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we present the collective dynamics of active dumbbells in the presence of a static circular obstacle using Brownian dynamics simulation. The active dumbbells aggregate on the surface of a circular obstacle beyond a critical radius. The aggregation is non-uniform along the circumference, and the aggregate size increases with the activity and the curvature radius. The dense aggregate of active dumbbells displays persistent rotational motion with a certain angular speed, which linearly increases with the activity. Further, we show the strong polar ordering of the active dumbbells within the aggregate. The polar ordering exhibits a long-range correlation, with the correlation length corresponding to the aggregate size. Additionally, we show that the residence time of an active dumbbell on the obstacle surface grows rapidly with area fraction due to many-body interactions that lead to a slowdown of the rotational diffusion. The article further considers the dynamical behavior of a tracer particle in the solution of active dumbbells. Interestingly, the speed of the passive tracer particle displays a crossover from monotonically decreasing to increasing with the tracer particle's size upon increasing the dumbbells' speed. Furthermore, the effective diffusion of the tracer particle displays the non-monotonic behavior with area fraction; the initial increase of the diffusivity is followed by a decrease for larger area fraction.</description>

      <title>A numerical model for time-multiplexed Ising machines based on delay-line oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07197v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ising machines (IM) have recently been proposed as unconventional hardware-based computation accelerators for solving NP-hard problems. In this work, we present a model for a time-multiplexed IM based on the nonlinear oscillations in a delay line-based resonator and numerically study the effects that the circuit parameters, specifically the compression gain $\beta_r$ and frequency nonlinearity $\beta_i$, have on the IM solutions. We find that the likelihood of reaching the global minimum -- the global minimum probability (GMP) -- is the highest for a certain range of $\beta_r$ and $\beta_i$ located near the edge of the synchronization region of the oscillators. The optimal range remains unchanged for all tested coupling topologies and network connections. We also observe a sharp transition line in the ($\beta_i, \beta_r$) space above which the GMP falls to zero. In all cases, small variations in the natural frequency of the oscillators do not modify the results, allowing us to extend this model to realistic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fractons are exotic quasiparticles whose mobility in space is restricted by symmetries. In potential real-world realisations, fractons are likely lodged to a physical material rather than absolute space. Motivated by this, we propose and explore a new symmetry principle that restricts the motion of fractons relative to a physical solid. Unlike models with restricted mobility in absolute space, these fractonic solids admit gauge-invariant momentum density, are compatible with boost symmetry, and can consistently be coupled to gravity. We also propose a holographic model for fractonic solids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial communities are pivotal to maintaining ecological function and preserving the rich tapestry of biological diversity. The rapid development of environmental sequencing technologies, such as metagenomics, has revolutionized our capacity to probe such diversity. However, despite these advances, a theoretical understanding connecting empirical data with ecosystem modelling, in particular in the framework of disordered systems akin to spin glasses, is still in its infancy. Here, we present a comprehensive framework using theories of disordered systems to decode microbiome data, which offers insight into the ecological forces that shape macroecological states. By employing the quenched disordered generalized Lotka-Volterra model, we analyze species abundance data in healthy and diseased human gut microbiomes. Results reveal the emergence of two distinct patterns of species-interaction networks, elucidating the pathways through which dysbiosis may drive microbiome instability. Interaction patterns thus provide a window into the systemic shifts accompanying the transition from health to disease, offering a new perspective on the dynamics of the microbial community. Our findings suggest the potential of disordered systems theory to characterize microbiomes by capturing the essence of ecological interactions and their consequences on stability and functioning, leveraging our understanding of the linkages of dysbiosis and microbial dynamics.</description>

      <title>Physics-guided weak-form discovery of reduced-order models for trapped ultracold hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the relaxation of a highly collisional, ultracold but nondegenerate gas of polar molecules. Confined within a harmonic trap, the gas is subject to fluid-gaseous coupled dynamics that lead to a breakdown of first-order hydrodynamics. An attempt to treat these higher-order hydrodynamic effects was previously made with a Gaussian ansatz and coarse-graining model parameter [R. R. W. Wang &amp; J. L. Bohn, Phys. Rev. A 108, 013322 (2023)], leading to an approximate set of equations for a few collective observables accessible to experiments. Here we present substantially improved reduced-order models for these same observables, admissible beyond previous parameter regimes, discovered directly from particle simulations using the WSINDy algorithm (Weak-form Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics). The interpretable nature of the learning algorithm enables estimation of previously unknown physical quantities and discovery of model terms with candidate physical mechanisms, revealing new physics in mixed collisional regimes. Our approach constitutes a general framework for data-driven model identification leveraging known physics.</description>

      <title>Paradigm for approaching the forbidden phase transition in the one-dimensional Ising model at fixed finite temperature: Single chain in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper [Weiguo Yin, Phys. Rev. Res. 6, 013331 (2024)], the forbidden spontaneous phase transition in the one-dimensional Ising model was found to be approachable arbitrarily closely in decorated ladders by ultranarrow phase crossover (UNPC) at a given finite temperature $T_0$ with the crossover width $2\delta T$ reduced exponentially, which resembles a genuine first-order transition with large latent heat. Here, I reveal that the forbidden phase transition can be approached at fixed $T_0$ as well in decorated single-chain Ising models in the presence of a magnetic field, in which $T_0$ is determined by the interactions involving only the decorated parts and the magnetic field, while $2\delta T$ is independently, exponentially reduced ($\delta T=0$ means a genuine transition) by restoring the ferromagnetic interaction between the ordinary spins on the chain backbone -- which was neglected in the previous studies of pseudotransition -- thus manifesting that this asymptoticity to the forbidden transition is essentially the buildup of coherence in preformed crossover of local states. Furthermore, I show that the UNPC can be realized even in the absence of the conventional geometric frustration because the magnetic field itself can induce previously unnoticed hidden spin frustration. These findings make the doors wide open to the engineering and utilization of UNPC as a new paradigm for exploring exotic phenomena and 1D device applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of Capillary Tension and Interfacial Dynamics of Motility-Induced Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The statistical mechanics of equilibrium interfaces has been well-established for over a half century. In the last decade, a wealth of observations have made increasingly clear that a new perspective is required to describe interfaces arbitrarily far from equilibrium. In this work, beginning from microscopic particle dynamics that break time-reversal symmetry, we systematically derive the interfacial dynamics of coexisting motility-induced phases. Doing so allows us to identify the athermal energy scale that excites interfacial fluctuations and the nonequilibrium surface tension that resists these excitations. Our theory identifies that, in contrast to equilibrium fluids, this active surface tension contains contributions arising from nonconservative forces which act to suppress interfacial fluctuations and, crucially, is distinct from the mechanical surface tension of Kirkwood and Buff. We find that the interfacial stiffness scales linearly with the intrinsic persistence length of the constituent active particle trajectories, in agreement with simulation data. We demonstrate that at wavelengths much larger than the persistence length, the interface obeys surface area minimizing Boltzmann statistics with our derived nonequilibrium interfacial stiffness playing an identical role to that of equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model and Vertex-Reinforced Jump Process on Regular Trees: Infinite-Order Transition and an Intermediate Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the supercritical phase of the vertex-reinforced jump process (VRJP) and the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model on rooted regular trees. The VRJP is a random walk, which is more likely to jump to vertices on which it has previously spent a lot of time. The $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model is a supersymmetric lattice spin model, originally introduced as a toy model for the Anderson transition. On infinite rooted regular trees, the VRJP undergoes a recurrence/transience transition controlled by an inverse temperature parameter $\beta &gt; 0$. Approaching the critical point from the transient regime, $\beta \searrow \beta_{\mathrm{c}}$, we show that the expected total time spent at the starting vertex diverges as $\sim \exp(c/\sqrt{\beta - \beta_{\mathrm{c}}})$. Moreover, on large finite trees we show that the VRJP exhibits an additional intermediate regime for parameter values $\beta_{\mathrm{c}} &lt; \beta &lt; \beta_{\mathrm{c}}^{\mathrm{erg}}$. In this regime, despite being transient in infinite volume, the VRJP on finite trees spends an unusually long time at the starting vertex with high probability. We provide analogous results for correlation functions of the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model. Our proofs rely on the application of branching random walk methods to a horospherical marginal of the $\mathbb{H}^{2|2}$-model.</description>

      <title>Cubic* criticality emerging from a quantum loop model on triangular lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.05715v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal examples of correlated systems with local constraints. Obtaining generic solutions for these models is difficult due to the lack of controlled methods to solve them in the thermodynamic limit. Nevertheless, these solutions are of immediate relevance to both statistical and quantum field theories, as well as the rapidly growing experiments in Rydberg atom arrays and quantum moir\'e materials, where the interplay between correlation and local constraints gives rise to a plethora of novel phenomena. In a recent work [X. Ran, Z. Yan, Y.-C. Wang, et al, arXiv:2205.04472 (2022)], it was found through sweeping cluster quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations and field theory analysis that the triangular lattice quantum loop model (QLM) hosts a rich ground state phase diagram with lattice nematic, vison plaquette (VP) crystals, and the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid (QSL) close to the Rokhsar-Kivelson point. Here, we focus on the continuous quantum critical point separating the VP and QSL phases and demonstrate via both static and dynamic probes in QMC simulations that this transition is of the (2+1)D cubic* universality. In this transition, the fractionalized visons in QSL condense to give rise to the crystalline VP phase, while leaving their trace in the anomalously large anomalous dimension exponent and pronounced continua in the dimer and vison spectra compared with those at the conventional cubic or O(3) quantum critical points.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine Structure of Quantum Entanglement</title>

Abstract: Quantum entanglement, crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity, is commonly assessed through various measures such as von Neumann entropy, mutual information, and entanglement contour, each with its inherent limitations. In this work, we introduce the \textit{hyperfine structure of entanglement}, which dissects entanglement contours known as the fine structure into particle-number cumulants. This measure exhibits a set of universal properties with its significance in quantum information science. We apply it across diverse contexts: in Fermi gases, establishing connections to mutual information and interacting conformal field theory; in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ holographic duality, unveiling finer subregion-subregion duality and extending bulk reconstruction; and in Chern insulators, distinguishing between different quantum phases. Our findings suggest experimental accessibility, offering fresh insights into quantum entanglement across physical systems.</description>

      <title>Saddle avoidance of noise-induced transitions in multiscale systems</title>

Abstract: In multistable dynamical systems driven by weak Gaussian noise, transitions between competing states are often assumed to pass via a saddle on the separating basin boundary. Instead, we show that timescale separation can cause saddle avoidance in non-gradient systems. Using toy models from neuroscience and ecology, we study cases where sample transitions deviate strongly from the instanton predicted by Freidlin-Wentzell theory, even for weak finite noise. We attribute this to a flat quasipotential and present an approach based on the Onsager-Machlup action to aptly predict transition paths.</description>

      <title>The entanglement membrane in exactly solvable lattice models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12509v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement membrane theory is an effective coarse-grained description of entanglement dynamics and operator growth in chaotic quantum many-body systems. The fundamental quantity characterizing the membrane is the entanglement line tension. However, determining the entanglement line tension for microscopic models is in general exponentially difficult. We compute the entanglement line tension in a recently introduced class of exactly solvable yet chaotic unitary circuits, so-called generalized dual-unitary circuits, obtaining a non-trivial form that gives rise to a hierarchy of velocity scales with $v_E&lt;v_B$. For the lowest level of the hierarchy, $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits, the entanglement line tension can be computed entirely, while for the higher levels the solvability is reduced to certain regions in spacetime. This partial solvability enables us to place bounds on the entanglement velocity. We find that $\bar{\mathcal{L}}_{2}$ circuits saturate certain bounds on entanglement growth that are also saturated in holographic models. Furthermore, we relate the entanglement line tension to temporal entanglement and correlation functions. We also develop new methods of constructing generalized dual-unitary gates, including constructions based on complex Hadamard matrices that exhibit additional solvability properties and constructions that display behavior unique to local dimension greater than or equal to three. Our results shed light on entanglement membrane theory in microscopic Floquet lattice models and enable us to perform non-trivial checks on the validity of its predictions by comparison to exact and numerical calculations. Moreover, they demonstrate that generalized dual-unitary circuits display a more generic form of information dynamics than dual-unitary circuits.</description>

      <title>Eco-evolutionary dynamics of cooperative antimicrobial resistance in a population of fluctuating volume and size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14826v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance to drugs (AMR), a global threat to human and animal health, is often regarded as resulting from cooperative behaviour. Moreover, microbes generally evolve in volatile environments that, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and death events), drastically alter population size and strain survival. Motivated by the need to better understand the evolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two competing strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to demographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary carrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental conditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and antimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community (number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared public good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed concentration cooperation threshold, above which the sensitive strain has a growth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using computational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable quenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the influence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably obtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a function of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold. We find that microbial strains tend to coexistence, but demographic fluctuations eventually lead to the extinction of resistant or sensitive cells for small or large values of the concentration cooperation threshold, respectively. This also holds for dynamic environments, whose specific properties determine the extinction timescale.</description>

      <title>Quantum reservoir probing of quantum phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are highly remarkable phenomena manifesting in quantum many-body systems. However, their precise identifications in equilibrium systems pose significant theoretical and experimental challenges. Thus far, dynamical detection protocols employing global quantum quenches have been proposed, wherein transitions are discerned from global nonequilibrium excitations. In this work, we demonstrate that quantum phase transitions can be detected through localized out-of-equilibrium excitations induced by local quantum quenches. While the resulting dynamics after the quench are influenced by both the local quench operation and the intrinsic dynamics of the quantum system, the effects of the former are exclusively extracted through the cutting-edge framework called quantum reservoir probing (QRP). Through the QRP, we find that the impacts of the local quenches vary across different quantum phases and are significantly suppressed by quantum fluctuations amplified near quantum critical points, thereby precisely delineating phase boundaries. We demonstrate that the QRP can detect quantum phase transitions in the paradigmatic integrable and nonintegrable quantum systems, and even topological quantum phase transitions, all within the identical framework employing single-site observables.</description>

      <title>Pseudoentropy sum rule by analytical continuation of the superposition parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a sum rule that connects the pseudoentropy and entanglement entropy of a superposition state. Through analytical continuation of the superposition parameter, we demonstrate that the transition matrix and density matrix of the superposition state can be treated in a unified manner. Within this framework, we naturally derive sum rules for the (reduced) transition matrix, pseudo R\'enyi entropy, and pseudoentropy. Furthermore, we demonstrate the close relationship between the sum rule for pseudoentropy and the singularity structure of the entropy function for the superposition state after analytical continuation. We also explore potential applications of the sum rule, including its relevance to understanding the gravity dual of non-Hermitian transition matrices and establishing upper bounds for the absolute value of pseudoentropy.</description>
