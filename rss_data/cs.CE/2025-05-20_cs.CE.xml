      <title>LLM-Enhanced Feature Engineering for Multi-Factor Electricity Price Predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting electricity price volatility is crucial for effective risk management and decision-making. Traditional forecasting models often fall short in capturing the complex, non-linear dynamics of electricity markets, particularly when external factors like weather conditions and market volatility are involved. These limitations hinder their ability to provide reliable predictions in markets with high volatility, such as the New South Wales (NSW) electricity market. To address these challenges, we introduce FAEP, a Feature-Augmented Electricity Price Prediction framework. FAEP leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with advanced feature engineering to enhance prediction accuracy. By incorporating external features such as weather data and price volatility jumps, and utilizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for effective feature extraction, FAEP overcomes the shortcomings of traditional approaches. A hybrid XGBoost-LSTM model in FAEP further refines these augmented features, resulting in a more robust prediction framework. Experimental results demonstrate that FAEP achieves state-of-art (SOTA) performance compared to other electricity price prediction models in the Australian New South Wale electricity market, showcasing the efficiency of LLM-enhanced feature engineering and hybrid machine learning architectures.</description>

      <title>MLLM-based Discovery of Intrinsic Coordinates and Governing Equations from High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovering governing equations from scientific data is crucial for understanding the evolution of systems, and is typically framed as a search problem within a candidate equation space. However, the high-dimensional nature of dynamical systems leads to an exponentially expanding equation space, making the search process extremely challenging. The visual perception and pre-trained scientific knowledge of multimodal large language models (MLLM) hold promise for providing effective navigation in high-dimensional equation spaces. In this paper, we propose a zero-shot method based on MLLM for automatically discovering physical coordinates and governing equations from high-dimensional data. Specifically, we design a series of enhanced visual prompts for MLLM to enhance its spatial perception. In addition, MLLM's domain knowledge is employed to navigate the search process within the equation space. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two representative types of systems demonstrate that the proposed method effectively discovers the physical coordinates and equations from both simulated and real experimental data, with long-term extrapolation accuracy improved by approximately 26.96% compared to the baseline.</description>

      <title>Predicting Gas Well Performance with Decline Curve Analysis: A Case Study on Semutang Gas Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decline-curve analysis (DCA) is a widely utilized method for production forecasting and estimating remaining reserves in gas reservoir. Based on the assumptions that past production trend can be mathematically characterized and used to predict future performance. It relies on historical production data and assumes that production methods remain unchanged throughout the analysis. This method is particularly valuable due to its accuracy in forecasting and its broad acceptance within the industry. Wells in the same geographical area and producing from similar geological formations often exhibit similar decline curve parameters. This study applies DCA to forecast the future production performance and estimate the ultimate recovery for the Semutang gas field's well 5 in Bangladesh. Using historical production data, decline curves were generated based on exponential, hyperbolic, and harmonic model equations. The cumulative production estimations were 11,139.34 MMSCF for the exponential model, 11,620.26 MMSCF for the hyperbolic model, and 14,021.92 MMSCF for the harmonic model. In terms of the well's productive life, the estimates were 335.13 days, 1,152 days, and 22,611 days, respectively. Among these models, the hyperbolic decline provided the most realistic forecast, closely aligning with observed production trend. The study highlights the importance of selecting an appropriate decline model for accurate production forecasting and reserve estimation, which is essential for effective reservoir management and resource optimization.</description>

      <title>Seismic analysis based on a new interval method with incomplete information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For seismic analysis in engineering structures, it is essential to consider the dynamic responses under seismic excitation, necessitating the description of seismic accelerations. Limit seismics samples lead to incomplete uncertainty information, which is described by the non-probabilistic method reasonable. This study employs the minimum interval radius-based interval process (MRIP) based on the convex model to describe the time-variant uncertain seismic acceleration, subsequently conducting uncertainty analysis for seismic structures. However, the Monte Carlo simulation for uncertainty analysis requires extensive deterministic computations to ensure accuracy, exhibiting poor computational efficiency. To address this issue, this paper first improves the covariance matrix adaptation evolution strategy (CMA-ES) through the dynamic evolution sequence, proposing DES-ES, whose efficiency is validated to be higher than that of CMA-ES. Furthermore, leveraging the dependency of the responses, a computational framework named DES-ES-SS is proposed. Numerical experiments demonstrate that DES-ES-SS improves computational efficiency while maintaining the accuracy of the interval uncertainty analysis of the seismic structures whether the seismic acceleration is stationary or non-stationary.</description>

      <title>Implicit differentiation with second-order derivatives and benchmarks in finite-element-based differentiable physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Differentiable programming is revolutionizing computational science by enabling automatic differentiation (AD) of numerical simulations. While first-order gradients are well-established, second-order derivatives (Hessians) for implicit functions in finite-element-based differentiable physics remain underexplored. This work bridges this gap by deriving and implementing a framework for implicit Hessian computation in PDE-constrained optimization problems. We leverage primitive AD tools (Jacobian-vector product/vector-Jacobian product) to build an algorithm for Hessian-vector products and validate the accuracy against finite difference approximations. Four benchmarks spanning linear/nonlinear, 2D/3D, and single/coupled-variable problems demonstrate the utility of second-order information. Results show that the Newton-CG method with exact Hessians accelerates convergence for nonlinear inverse problems (e.g., traction force identification, shape optimization), while the L-BFGS-B method suffices for linear cases. Our work provides a robust foundation for integrating second-order implicit differentiation into differentiable physics engines, enabling faster and more reliable optimization.</description>

      <title>Grid Topology Estimation using an Information Theoretic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topology of a power grid is estimated using an information theoretic approach. By modeling the grid as a graph and using voltage magnitude data of individual nodes in the grid, the mutual information between pairs of nodes is computed using different approximation methods. Using the well-known Chow-Liu algorithm, a maximum spanning tree based on mutual information is computed to estimate the power grid topology. Experiments and results are presented to optimize this approach with success shown for IEEE networks generated with MATPOWER and data generated using GridLAB-D. The algorithm is then cross-validated on IEEE networks generated by the European Union Joint Research Council.</description>

      <title>CASL-HJX: A Comprehensive Guide to Solving Deterministic and Stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11527v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CASL-HJX is a computational framework designed for solving deterministic and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equations in two spatial dimensions. It provides a flexible and efficient approach to modeling front propagation problems, optimal control problems, and stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi Bellman equations. The framework integrates numerical methods for hyperbolic PDEs with operator splitting techniques and implements implicit methods for second-order derivative terms, ensuring convergence to viscosity solutions while achieving global rather than local optimization. Built with a high-performance C++ core, CASL-HJX efficiently handles mixed-order derivative systems with time-varying dynamics, making it suitable for real-world applications across multiple domains. We demonstrate the solver's versatility through tutorial examples covering various PDEs and through applications in neuroscience, where it enables the design of energy-efficient controllers for regulating neural populations to mitigate pathological synchrony. While our examples focus on these applications, the mathematical foundation of the solver makes it applicable to problems in finance, engineering, and machine learning. The modular architecture allows researchers to define computational domains, configure problems, and execute simulations with high numerical accuracy. CASL-HJX bridges the gap between deterministic control methods and stochastic models, providing a robust tool for managing uncertainty in complex dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>CLT and Edgeworth Expansion for m-out-of-n Bootstrap Estimators of The Studentized Median</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The m-out-of-n bootstrap, originally proposed by Bickel, Gotze, and Zwet (1992), approximates the distribution of a statistic by repeatedly drawing m subsamples (with m much smaller than n) without replacement from an original sample of size n. It is now routinely used for robust inference with heavy-tailed data, bandwidth selection, and other large-sample applications. Despite its broad applicability across econometrics, biostatistics, and machine learning, rigorous parameter-free guarantees for the soundness of the m-out-of-n bootstrap when estimating sample quantiles have remained elusive.
  This paper establishes such guarantees by analyzing the estimator of sample quantiles obtained from m-out-of-n resampling of a dataset of size n. We first prove a central limit theorem for a fully data-driven version of the estimator that holds under a mild moment condition and involves no unknown nuisance parameters. We then show that the moment assumption is essentially tight by constructing a counter-example in which the CLT fails. Strengthening the assumptions slightly, we derive an Edgeworth expansion that provides exact convergence rates and, as a corollary, a Berry Esseen bound on the bootstrap approximation error. Finally, we illustrate the scope of our results by deriving parameter-free asymptotic distributions for practical statistics, including the quantiles for random walk Metropolis-Hastings and the rewards of ergodic Markov decision processes, thereby demonstrating the usefulness of our theory in modern estimation and learning tasks.</description>

      <title>ChromFound: Towards A Universal Foundation Model for Single-Cell Chromatin Accessibility Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12638v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of single-cell Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (scATAC-seq) offers an innovative perspective for deciphering regulatory mechanisms by assembling a vast repository of single-cell chromatin accessibility data. While foundation models have achieved significant success in single-cell transcriptomics, there is currently no foundation model for scATAC-seq that supports zero-shot high-quality cell identification and comprehensive multi-omics analysis simultaneously. Key challenges lie in the high dimensionality and sparsity of scATAC-seq data, as well as the lack of a standardized schema for representing open chromatin regions (OCRs). Here, we present ChromFound, a foundation model tailored for scATAC-seq. ChromFound utilizes a hybrid architecture and genome-aware tokenization to effectively capture genome-wide long contexts and regulatory signals from dynamic chromatin landscapes. Pretrained on 1.97 million cells from 30 tissues and 6 disease conditions, ChromFound demonstrates broad applicability across 6 diverse tasks. Notably, it achieves robust zero-shot performance in generating universal cell representations and exhibits excellent transferability in cell type annotation and cross-omics prediction. By uncovering enhancer-gene links undetected by existing computational methods, ChromFound offers a promising framework for understanding disease risk variants in the noncoding genome.</description>

      <title>Generative Modeling of Random Fields from Limited Data via Constrained Latent Flow Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13007v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep generative models are promising tools for science and engineering, but their reliance on abundant, high-quality data limits applicability. We present a novel framework for generative modeling of random fields (probability distributions over continuous functions) that incorporates domain knowledge to supplement limited, sparse, and indirect data. The foundation of the approach is latent flow matching, where generative modeling occurs on compressed function representations in the latent space of a pre-trained variational autoencoder (VAE). Innovations include the adoption of a function decoder within the VAE and integration of physical/statistical constraints into the VAE training process. In this way, a latent function representation is learned that yields continuous random field samples satisfying domain-specific constraints when decoded, even in data-limited regimes. Efficacy is demonstrated on two challenging applications: wind velocity field reconstruction from sparse sensors and material property inference from a limited number of indirect measurements. Results show that the proposed framework achieves significant improvements in reconstruction accuracy compared to unconstrained methods and enables effective inference with relatively small training datasets that is intractable without constraints.</description>

      <title>System reduction-based approximate reanalysis method for statically indeterminate structures with high-rank modification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.02171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficient structural reanalysis for high-rank modification plays an important role in engineering computations which require repeated evaluations of structural responses, such as structural optimization and probabilistic analysis. To improve the efficiency of engineering computations, a novel approximate static reanalysis method based on system reduction and iterative solution is proposed for statically indeterminate structures with high-rank modification. In this approach, a statically indeterminate structure is divided into the basis system and the additional components. Subsequently, the structural equilibrium equations are rewritten as the equation system with the stiffness matrix of the basis system and the pseudo forces derived from the additional elements. With the introduction of spectral decomposition, a reduced equation system with the element forces of the additional elements as the unknowns is established. Then, the approximate solutions of the modified structure can be obtained by solving the reduced equation system through a pre-conditioned iterative solution algorithm. The computational costs of the proposed method and the other two reanalysis methods are compared and numerical examples including static reanalysis and static nonlinear analysis are presented. The results demonstrate that the proposed method has excellent computational performance for both the structures with homogeneous material and structures composed of functionally graded beams. Meanwhile, the superiority of the proposed method indicates that the combination of system reduction and pre-conditioned iterative solution technology is an effective way to develop high-performance reanalysis methods.</description>

      <title>CSP-free adaptive Kriging surrogate model method for reliability analysis with small failure probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.07010v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the field of reliability engineering, the Active learning reliability method combining Kriging and Monte Carlo Simulation (AK-MCS) has been developed and demonstrated to be effective in reliability analysis. However, the performance of AK-MCS is sensitive to the size of Candidate Sample Pool (CSP), particularly for systems with small failure probabilities. To address the limitations of conventional AK-MCS that relies on CSP, this paper proposes a CSP-free AK-MCS. The proposed methodology consists of two stages: surrogate model construction and Monte Carlo simulation for estimating the failure probability. In the stage of surrogate model construction, the surrogate model is iteratively refined based on the representative samples selected by solving the optimization problem facilitated by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. To achieve an optimal balance between solution accuracy and efficiency, the penalty intensity control and the density control for the experimental design points are introduced to modify the objective function in optimization. The performance of the proposed methodology is evaluated using numerical examples, and results indicate that by leveraging an optimization algorithm to select representative samples, the proposed CSP-free AK-MCS overcomes the limitations of conventional CSP-based AK-MCS and exhibits exceptional performance in addressing small failure probabilities.</description>

      <title>A cable finite element formulation based on exact tension field for static nonlinear analysis of cable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05609v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerically exact cable finite element model for static nonlinear analysis of cable structures. The model derives the exact expression of the tension field using the geometrically exact beam theory coupled with the fundamental mechanical characteristics of cables. The equations for the cable element are formulated by addressing the equilibrium conditions at the element boundaries and ensuring compatibility within the element. Unlike previous studies that typically provide explicit expressions for cable models, this study develops a formulation that emphasizes numerical precision and broad applicability. It achieves this by deriving linearized equations with implicit expressions incorporating integrals. The proposed model accurately computes internal forces and deformation states, and determines the unstrained length of the cable. Additionally, it accounts for the variability in cross-sectional stiffness along the cable's length. The paper discusses solution implementations using the complete tangent matrix and element internal iterations. The effectiveness of the proposed cable element is demonstrated through numerical examples.</description>
