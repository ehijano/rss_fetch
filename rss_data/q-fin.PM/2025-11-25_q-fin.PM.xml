      <title>Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization with a Financial Goal and Defined Time Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research proposes an enhancement to the innovative portfolio optimization approach using the G-Learning algorithm, combined with parametric optimization via the GIRL algorithm (G-learning approach to the setting of Inverse Reinforcement Learning) as presented by. The goal is to maximize portfolio value by a target date while minimizing the investor's periodic contributions. Our model operates in a highly volatile market with a well-diversified portfolio, ensuring a low-risk level for the investor, and leverages reinforcement learning to dynamically adjust portfolio positions over time. Results show that we improved the Sharpe Ratio from 0.42, as suggested by recent studies using the same approach, to a value of 0.483 a notable achievement in highly volatile markets with diversified portfolios. The comparison between G-Learning and GIRL reveals that while GIRL optimizes the reward function parameters (e.g., lambda = 0.0012 compared to 0.002), its impact on portfolio performance remains marginal. This suggests that reinforcement learning methods, like G-Learning, already enable robust optimization. This research contributes to the growing development of reinforcement learning applications in financial decision-making, demonstrating that probabilistic learning algorithms can effectively align portfolio management strategies with investor needs.</description>

      <title>Carbon-Penalised Portfolio Insurance Strategies in a Stochastic Factor Model with Partial Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given the increasing importance of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors, particularly carbon emissions, we investigate optimal proportional portfolio insurance (PPI) strategies accounting for carbon footprint reduction. PPI strategies enable investors to mitigate downside risk while retaining the potential for upside gains. This paper aims to determine the multiplier of the PPI strategy to maximise the expected utility of the terminal cushion, where the terminal cushion is penalised proportionally to the realised volatility of stocks issued by firms operating in carbon-intensive sectors. We model the risky assets' dynamics using geometric Brownian motions whose drift rates are modulated by an unobservable common stochastic factor to capture market-specific or economy-wide state variables that are typically not directly observable. Using classical stochastic filtering theory, we formulate a suitable optimization problem and solve it for CRRA utility function. We characterise optimal carbon penalised PPI strategies and optimal value functions under full and partial information and quantify the loss of utility due incomplete information. Finally, we carry a numerical analysis showing that the proposed strategy reduces carbon emission intensity without compromising financial performance.</description>

      <title>Hybrid LSTM and PPO Networks for Dynamic Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid framework for portfolio optimization that fuses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) forecasting with a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning strategy. The proposed system leverages the predictive power of deep recurrent networks to capture temporal dependencies, while the PPO agent adaptively refines portfolio allocations in continuous action spaces, allowing the system to anticipate trends while adjusting dynamically to market shifts. Using multi-asset datasets covering U.S. and Indonesian equities, U.S. Treasuries, and major cryptocurrencies from January 2018 to December 2024, the model is evaluated against several baselines, including equal-weight, index-style, and single-model variants (LSTM-only and PPO-only). The framework's performance is benchmarked against equal-weighted, index-based, and single-model approaches (LSTM-only and PPO-only) using annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, and maximum drawdown metrics, each adjusted for transaction costs. The results indicate that the hybrid architecture delivers higher returns and stronger resilience under non-stationary market regimes, suggesting its promise as a robust, AI-driven framework for dynamic portfolio optimization.</description>

      <title>Re(Visiting) Time Series Foundation Models in Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial time series forecasting is central to trading, portfolio optimization, and risk management, yet it remains challenging due to noisy, non-stationary, and heterogeneous data. Recent advances in time series foundation models (TSFMs), inspired by large language models, offer a new paradigm for learning generalizable temporal representations from large and diverse datasets. This paper presents the first comprehensive empirical study of TSFMs in global financial markets. Using a large-scale dataset of daily excess returns across diverse markets, we evaluate zero-shot inference, fine-tuning, and pre-training from scratch against strong benchmark models. We find that off-the-shelf pre-trained TSFMs perform poorly in zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, whereas models pre-trained from scratch on financial data achieve substantial forecasting and economic improvements, underscoring the value of domain-specific adaptation. Increasing the dataset size, incorporating synthetic data augmentation, and applying hyperparameter tuning further enhance performance.</description>
