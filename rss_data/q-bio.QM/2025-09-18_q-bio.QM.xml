      <title>Property-Isometric Variational Autoencoders for Sequence Modeling and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological sequence design (DNA, RNA, or peptides) with desired functional properties has applications in discovering novel nanomaterials, biosensors, antimicrobial drugs, and beyond. One common challenge is the ability to optimize complex high-dimensional properties such as target emission spectra of DNA-mediated fluorescent nanoparticles, photo and chemical stability, and antimicrobial activity of peptides across target microbes. Existing models rely on simple binary labels (e.g., binding/non-binding) rather than high-dimensional complex properties. To address this gap, we propose a geometry-preserving variational autoencoder framework, called PrIVAE, which learns latent sequence embeddings that respect the geometry of their property space. Specifically, we model the property space as a high-dimensional manifold that can be locally approximated by a nearest neighbor graph, given an appropriately defined distance measure. We employ the property graph to guide the sequence latent representations using (1) graph neural network encoder layers and (2) an isometric regularizer. PrIVAE learns a property-organized latent space that enables rational design of new sequences with desired properties by employing the trained decoder. We evaluate the utility of our framework for two generative tasks: (1) design of DNA sequences that template fluorescent metal nanoclusters and (2) design of antimicrobial peptides. The trained models retain high reconstruction accuracy while organizing the latent space according to properties. Beyond in silico experiments, we also employ sampled sequences for wet lab design of DNA nanoclusters, resulting in up to 16.1-fold enrichment of rare-property nanoclusters compared to their abundance in training data, demonstrating the practical utility of our framework.</description>

      <title>Modelling species distributions using remote sensing predictors: Comparing Dynamic Habitat Index and LULC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study compares the predictive capacity of the Dynamic Habitat Index (DHI) - a remote sensing (RS)-based measure of habitat productivity and variability - against traditional land-use/land-cover (LULC) metrics in species distribution modelling (SDM) applications. RS and LULC-based SDMs were built using distribution data for eleven bird, amphibian, and mammal species in \^Ile-de-France. Predictor variables were derived from Sentinel-2 RS data and LULC classifications, with the latter incorporating Euclidean distance to habitat types. Ensemble SDMs were built using nine algorithms and evaluated with the Continuous Boyce Index (CBI) and a calibrated AUC. Habitat suitability scores and their binary transformations were assessed using niche overlap indices (Schoener, Warren, and Spearman rank correlation coefficient). Both RS and LULC approaches exhibited similar predictive accuracy overall. After binarisation however, the resulting niche maps diverged significantly. While LULC-based models exhibited spatial constraints (habitat suitability decreased as distance from recorded occurrences increased), RS-based models, which used continuous data, were not affected by geographic bias or distance effects. These results underscore the need to account for spatial biases in LULC-based SDMs. The DHI may offer a more spatially neutral alternative, making it a promising predictor for modelling species niches at regional scales.</description>

      <title>Individualized prescriptive inference in ischaemic stroke</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gold standard in the treatment of ischaemic stroke is set by evidence from randomized controlled trials, based on simple descriptions of presumptively homogeneous populations. Yet the manifest complexity of the brain's functional, connective, and vascular architectures introduces heterogeneities that violate the underlying statistical premisses, potentially leading to substantial errors at both individual and population levels. The counterfactual nature of interventional inference renders quantifying the impact of this defect difficult. Here we conduct a comprehensive series of semi-synthetic, biologically plausible, virtual interventional trials across 100M+ distinct simulations. We generate empirically grounded virtual trial data from large-scale meta-analytic connective, functional, genetic expression, and receptor distribution data, with high-resolution maps of 4K+ acute ischaemic lesions. Within each trial, we estimate treatment effects using models varying in complexity, in the presence of increasingly confounded outcomes and noisy treatment responses. Individualized prescriptions inferred from simple models, fitted to unconfounded data, were less accurate than those from complex models, fitted to confounded data. Our results indicate that complex modelling with richly represented lesion data is critical to individualized prescriptive inference in ischaemic stroke.</description>

      <title>The Role of Graph Topology in the Performance of Biomedical Knowledge Graph Completion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04103v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion has been increasingly adopted as a useful method for helping address several tasks in biomedical research, such as drug repurposing or drug-target identification. To that end, a variety of datasets and Knowledge Graph Embedding models have been proposed over the years. However, little is known about the properties that render a dataset, and associated modelling choices, useful for a given task. Moreover, even though theoretical properties of Knowledge Graph Embedding models are well understood, their practical utility in this field remains controversial. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the topological properties of publicly available biomedical Knowledge Graphs and establish links to the accuracy observed in real-world tasks. By releasing all model predictions and a new suite of analysis tools we invite the community to build upon our work and continue improving the understanding of these crucial applications.</description>
