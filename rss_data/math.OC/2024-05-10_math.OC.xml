      <title>Logic-Based Discrete-Steepest Descent: A Solution Method for Process Synthesis Generalized Disjunctive Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of chemical processes is challenging due to the nonlinearities arising from process physics and discrete design decisions. In particular, optimal synthesis and design of chemical processes can be posed as a Generalized Disjunctive Programming (GDP) superstructure problem. Various solution methods are available to address these problems, such as reformulating them as Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems; nevertheless, algorithms explicitly designed to solve the GDP problem and potentially leverage its structure remain scarce. This paper presents the Logic-based Discrete-Steepest Descent Algorithm (LD-SDA) as a solution method for GDP problems involving ordered Boolean variables. The LD-SDA reformulates these ordered Boolean variables into integer decisions called external variables. The LD-SDA solves the reformulated GDP problem using a two-level decomposition approach where the upper-level subproblem determines external variable configurations. Subsequently, the remaining continuous and discrete variables are solved as a subproblem only involving those constraints relevant to the given external variable arrangement, effectively taking advantage of the structure of the GDP problem. The advantages of LD-SDA are illustrated through a batch processing case study, a reactor superstructure, a distillation column, and a catalytic distillation column, and its open-source implementation is available online. The results show convergence efficiency and solution quality improvements compared to conventional GDP and MINLP solvers.</description>

      <title>Local minima in Newton's aerodynamical problem and inequalities between norms of partial derivatives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem considered first by I. Newton (1687) consists in finding a surface of the minimal frontal resistance in a parallel flow of non-interacting point particles. The standard formulation assumes that the surface is convex with a given convex base $\Omega$ and a bounded altitude. Newton found the solution for surfaces of revolution. Without this assumption the problem is still unsolved, although many important results have been obtained in the last decades. We consider the problem to characterize the domains $\Omega$ for which the flat surface gives a local minimum. We show that this problem can be reduced to an inequality between $L_2$-norms of partial derivatives for bivariate concave functions on a convex domain that vanish on the boundary. Can the ratio between those norms be arbitrarily large? The answer depends on the geometry of the domain. A complete criterion is derived, which also solves the local minimality problem.</description>

      <title>Design of Targeted Community-Based Resource Allocation in the Presence of Vaccine Hesitancy via a Data-Driven Compartmental Stochastic Optimization Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vaccines have proven effective in mitigating the threat of severe infections and deaths during outbreaks of infectious diseases. However, vaccine hesitancy (VH) complicates disease spread prediction and healthcare resource assessment across regions and populations. We propose a modeling framework that integrates an epidemiological compartmental model that captures the spread of an infectious disease within a multi-stage stochastic program (MSP) that determines the allocation of critical resources under uncertainty. The proposed compartmental MSP model adaptively manages the allocation of resources to account for changes in population behavior toward vaccines (i.e., variability in VH), the unique patterns of disease spread, and the availability of healthcare resources over time and space. The compartmental MSP model allowed us to analyze the price of fairness in resource allocation. Using real COVID-19 vaccination and healthcare resource data from Arkansas, U.S. (January-May 2021), our findings include: (i) delaying the initial deployment of additional ventilators by one month could lead to an average increase in the expected number of deaths by 285.41/month, highlighting the importance of prompt action; (ii) each additional ventilator in the initial stockpile and in supply leads to a decrease in the expected number of deaths by 1.09/month and 0.962/month, respectively, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a large stockpile and scalable production response; (iii) the cost of ensuring equitable resource allocation varies over time and location, peaking during the peak of a disease outbreak and in densely populated areas. This study emphasizes the importance of flexible, informed public health decision-making and preparedness, providing a model for effective resource allocation in public health emergencies.</description>

      <title>From Road Congestion to Vehicle-Control Enabled Artificial Traffic Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article provides an overview of the design of nonlinear feedback Cruise Controllers (CCs) for automated vehicles on lane-free roads. The feedback design problem is particularly challenging because of the various state constraints (e.g., collision-free movement, road geometry, speed limits) as well as the nature of the control objective (globally stabilizing distributed controllers that require measurements from neighboring vehicles only). Therefore, the resulting nonlinear control system is defined on an open set (not necessarily diffeomorphic to a linear space) for which the set of desired equilibria is non-compact. The proposed design of the CCs is based on energy-like control Lyapunov functions which combine potential functions with kinetic energy terms and other appropriate penalty terms. The feedback design in the microscopic level is accompanied by the derivation of the corresponding macroscopic traffic flow models. Explicit relations are established between selectable CC features and the obtained macroscopic traffic flow characteristics. This facilitates the active design of efficient traffic flow with desired properties, i.e., the construction of artificial traffic fluids.</description>

      <title>Infinite horizon stochastic recursive control problems with jumps: dynamic programming and stochastic verification theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to studying an infinite horizon stochastic recursive control problem with jumps, where infinite horizon stochastic differential equation and backward stochastic differential equation with jumps describe the state process and cost functional, respectively. For this, the first is to explore the wellposedness and regularity of these two equations in $L^p$-frameworks ($p\geq2$). By establishing the dynamic programming principle of the control problem, we relate the value function of the control problem with a kind of integral-partial differential equation of HJB type in the sense of viscosity solutions. On the other hand, stochastic verification theorems are also studied to provide the sufficient conditions to verify the optimality of given admissible controls. Such a study is carried out in the framework of classical solutions but also in that of viscosity solutions. By these research, we reveal several essential differences from the finite horizon problem.</description>

      <title>Emerging Optimization Problems for Distribution in Same-day Delivery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Same-day deliveries (SDD) have become a new standard to satisfy the "instant gratification" of online customers. Despite the existing powerful technologies deployed in last-mile delivery, SDD services face new decision-making challenges related to the trade-off between delivery cost and time. In addition, new challenges related to environmental issues, customer satisfaction, or fairness arise. Researchers have explored various approaches to face these challenges in the context of SDD, where stochastic and dynamic data uncertainty plays a fundamental role. In this paper, we carefully review the emerging routing problems and solutions proposed in the existing literature for SDD services. We address the questions related to how to deal with dynamic arrival times of orders, how to allocate time slots to deliveries, how to select the right delivery options, how to design pickup and delivery routes, or how to partition the delivery areas and decide the composition of the fleet. We also formulate and compare models for representative problems elaborating on the pros and cons that might guide practitioners in choosing the most appropriate objectives and constraints. Finally, we sketch challenges and identify future research directions.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Accelerated Zeroth-order Algorithm: Improved Robustness and Lower Query Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization problems with access to only zeroth-order information of the objective function on Riemannian manifolds arise in various applications, spanning from statistical learning to robot learning. While various zeroth-order algorithms have been proposed in Euclidean space, they are not inherently designed to handle the challenging constraints imposed by Riemannian manifolds. The proper adaptation of zeroth-order techniques to Riemannian manifolds remained unknown until the pioneering work of \cite{li2023stochastic}. However, zeroth-order algorithms are widely observed to converge slowly and be unstable in practice. To alleviate these issues, we propose a Riemannian accelerated zeroth-order algorithm with improved robustness. Regarding efficiency, our accelerated algorithm has the function query complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-7/4}d)$ for finding an $\epsilon$-approximate first-order stationary point. By introducing a small perturbation, it exhibits a function query complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-7/4}d)$ for seeking a second-order stationary point with a high probability, matching state-of-the-art result in Euclidean space. Moreover, we further establish the almost sure convergence in the asymptotic sense through the Stable Manifold Theorem. Regarding robustness, our algorithm requires larger smoothing parameters in the order of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{7/8}d^{-1/2})$, improving the existing result by a factor of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{3/4})$.</description>

      <title>Minimax problems for ensembles of affine-control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider ensembles of affine-control systems in $\mathbb{R}^n$, and we study simultaneous optimal control problems related to the worst-case minimization. After proving that such problems admit solutions, denoting with $(\Theta^N)_N$ a sequence of compact sets that parametrize the ensembles of systems, we first show that the corresponding minimax optimal control problems are $\Gamma$-convergent whenever $(\Theta^N)_N$ has a limit with respect to the Hausdorff distance. Besides its independent interest, the previous result plays a crucial role for establishing the Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) when the ensemble is parametrized by a set $\Theta$ consisting of infinitely many points. Namely, we first approximate $\Theta$ by finite and increasing-in-size sets $(\Theta^N)_N$ for which the PMP is known, and then we derive the PMP for the $\Gamma$-limiting problem. The same strategy can be pursued in applications where we can reduce infinite ensembles to finite ones to compute the minimizers numerically.</description>

      <title>Parameter identification for an uncertain reaction-diffusion equation via setpoint regulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of estimating the reaction coefficient of a system governed by a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation is tackled. An estimator relying on boundary measurements only is proposed. The estimator is based upon a setpoint regulation strategy and leads to an asymptotically converging estimate of the unknown reaction coefficient. The proposed estimator is combined with a state observer and shown to provide an asymptotic estimate of the actual system state. A numerical example supports and illustrates the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Convergence Rates of Online Critic Value Function Approximation in Native Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the evolution equation that defines the online critic for the approximation of the optimal value function is cast in a general class of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Exploiting some core tools of RKHS theory, this formulation allows deriving explicit bounds on the performance of the critic in terms of the kernel and definition of the RKHS, the number of basis functions, and the location of centers used to define scattered bases. The performance of the critic is precisely measured in terms of the power function of the scattered basis used in approximations, and it can be used either in an a priori evaluation of potential bases or in an a posteriori assessments of value function error for basis enrichment or pruning. The most concise bounds in the paper describe explicitly how the critic performance depends on the placement of centers, as measured by their fill distance in a subset that contains the trajectory of the critic.</description>

      <title>Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition</title>

Abstract: Koopman operators are infinite-dimensional operators that linearize nonlinear dynamical systems, facilitating the study of their spectral properties and enabling the prediction of the time evolution of observable quantities. Recent methods have aimed to approximate Koopman operators while preserving key structures. However, approximating Koopman operators typically requires a dictionary of observables to capture the system's behavior in a finite-dimensional subspace. The selection of these functions is often heuristic, may result in the loss of spectral information, and can severely complicate structure preservation. This paper introduces Multiplicative Dynamic Mode Decomposition (MultDMD), which enforces the multiplicative structure inherent in the Koopman operator within its finite-dimensional approximation. Leveraging this multiplicative property, we guide the selection of observables and define a constrained optimization problem for the matrix approximation, which can be efficiently solved. MultDMD presents a structured approach to finite-dimensional approximations and can more accurately reflect the spectral properties of the Koopman operator. We elaborate on the theoretical framework of MultDMD, detailing its formulation, optimization strategy, and convergence properties. The efficacy of MultDMD is demonstrated through several examples, including the nonlinear pendulum, the Lorenz system, and fluid dynamics data, where we demonstrate its remarkable robustness to noise.</description>

      <title>Topological bifurcations in a mean-field game</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mean-field games (MFG) provide a statistical physics inspired modeling framework for decision making in large-populations of strategic, non-cooperative agents. Mathematically, these systems consist of a forward-backward in time system of two coupled nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), namely the Fokker-Plank and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, governing the agent state and control distribution, respectively. In this work, we study a finite-time MFG with a rich global bifurcation structure using a reduced-order model (ROM). The ROM is a 4D two-point boundary value problem obtained by restricting the controlled dynamics to first two moments of the agent state distribution, i.e., the mean and the variance. Phase space analysis of the ROM reveals that the invariant manifolds of periodic orbits around the so-called `ergodic MFG equilibrium' play a crucial role in determining the bifurcation diagram, and impart a topological signature to various solution branches. We show a qualitative agreement of these results with numerical solutions of the full-order MFG PDE system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a control-constrained optimal control problem subject to time-harmonic Maxwell's equations; the control variable belongs to a finite-dimensional set and enters the state equation as a coefficient. We derive existence of optimal solutions, and analyze first- and second-order optimality conditions. We devise an approximation scheme based on the lowest order N\'ed\'elec finite elements to approximate optimal solutions. We analyze convergence properties of the proposed scheme and prove a priori error estimates. We also design an a posteriori error estimator that can be decomposed as the sum two contributions related to the discretization of the state and adjoint equations, and prove that the devised error estimator is reliable and locally efficient. We perform numerical tests in order to assess the performance of the devised discretization strategy and the a posteriori error estimator.</description>

      <title>An Uncertainty-aware, Mesh-free Numerical Method for Kolmogorov PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study introduces an uncertainty-aware, mesh-free numerical method for solving Kolmogorov PDEs. In the proposed method, we use Gaussian process regression (GPR) to smoothly interpolate pointwise solutions that are obtained by Monte Carlo methods based on the Feynman-Kac formula. The proposed method has two main advantages: 1. uncertainty assessment, which is facilitated by the probabilistic nature of GPR, and 2. mesh-free computation, which allows efficient handling of high-dimensional PDEs. The quality of the solution is improved by adjusting the kernel function and incorporating noise information from the Monte Carlo samples into the GPR noise model. The performance of the method is rigorously analyzed based on a theoretical lower bound on the posterior variance, which serves as a measure of the error between the numerical and true solutions. Extensive tests on three representative PDEs demonstrate the high accuracy and robustness of the method compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Finite Difference Approximation via a Double Sample-Recycling Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating stochastic gradients is pivotal in fields like service systems within operations research. The classical method for this estimation is the finite difference approximation, which entails generating samples at perturbed inputs. Nonetheless, practical challenges persist in determining the perturbation and obtaining an optimal finite difference estimator in the sense of possessing the smallest mean squared error (MSE). To tackle this problem, we propose a double sample-recycling approach in this paper. Firstly, pilot samples are recycled to estimate the optimal perturbation. Secondly, recycling these pilot samples again and generating new samples at the estimated perturbation, lead to an efficient finite difference estimator. We analyze its bias, variance and MSE. Our analyses demonstrate a reduction in asymptotic variance, and in some cases, a decrease in asymptotic bias, compared to the optimal finite difference estimator. Therefore, our proposed estimator consistently coincides with, or even outperforms the optimal finite difference estimator. In numerical experiments, we apply the estimator in several examples, and numerical results demonstrate its robustness, as well as coincidence with the theory presented, especially in the case of small sample sizes.</description>

      <title>Fine-grained Analysis and Faster Algorithms for Iteratively Solving Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While effective in practice, iterative methods for solving large systems of linear equations can be significantly affected by problem-dependent condition number quantities. This makes characterizing their time complexity challenging, particularly when we wish to make comparisons between deterministic and stochastic methods, that may or may not rely on preconditioning and/or fast matrix multiplication. In this work, we consider a fine-grained notion of complexity for iterative linear solvers which we call the spectral tail condition number, $\kappa_\ell$, defined as the ratio between the $\ell$th largest and the smallest singular value of the matrix representing the system.
  Concretely, we prove the following main algorithmic result: Given an $n\times n$ matrix $A$ and a vector $b$, we can find $\tilde{x}$ such that $\|A\tilde{x}-b\|\leq\epsilon\|b\|$ in time $\tilde{O}(\kappa_\ell\cdot n^2\log 1/\epsilon)$ for any $\ell = O(n^{\frac1{\omega-1}})=O(n^{0.729})$, where $\omega \approx 2.372$ is the current fast matrix multiplication exponent. This guarantee is achieved by Sketch-and-Project with Nesterov's acceleration. Some of the implications of our result, and of the use of $\kappa_\ell$, include direct improvement over a fine-grained analysis of the Conjugate Gradient method, suggesting a stronger separation between deterministic and stochastic iterative solvers; and relating the complexity of iterative solvers to the ongoing algorithmic advances in fast matrix multiplication, since the bound on $\ell$ improves with $\omega$.
  Our main technical contributions are new sharp characterizations for the first and second moments of the random projection matrix that commonly arises in sketching algorithms, building on a combination of techniques from combinatorial sampling via determinantal point processes and Gaussian universality results from random matrix theory.</description>

      <title>The Riemann hypothesis and dynamics of Backtracking New Q-Newton's method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new variant of Newton's method - named Backtracking New Q-Newton's method (BNQN) - was recently introduced by the second author. This method has good convergence guarantees, specially concerning finding roots of meromorphic functions. This paper explores using BNQN for the Riemann xi function. We show in particular that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to that all attractors of BNQN lie on the critical line. We also explain how an apparent relation between the basins of attraction of BNQN and Voronoi's diagram can be helpful for verifying the Riemann hypothesis or finding a counterexample to it. Some illustrating experimental results are included, which convey some interesting phenomena. The experiments show that BNQN works very stably with highly transcendental functions like the Riemann xi function and its derivatives. Based on insights from the experiments, we discuss some concrete steps on using BNQN towards the Riemann hypothesis. Ideas and results from this paper can be extended to other zeta functions.</description>

      <title>Faster Linear Systems and Matrix Norm Approximation via Multi-level Sketched Preconditioning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new class of preconditioned iterative methods for solving linear systems of the form $Ax = b$. Our methods are based on constructing a low-rank Nystr\"om approximation to $A$ using sparse random sketching. This approximation is used to construct a preconditioner, which itself is inverted quickly using additional levels of random sketching and preconditioning. We prove that the convergence of our methods depends on a natural average condition number of $A$, which improves as the rank of the Nystr\"om approximation increases. Concretely, this allows us to obtain faster runtimes for a number of fundamental linear algebraic problems:
  1. We show how to solve any $n\times n$ linear system that is well-conditioned except for $k$ outlying large singular values in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.065} + k^\omega)$ time, improving on a recent result of [Derezi\'nski, Yang, STOC 2024] for all $k \gtrsim n^{0.78}$.
  2. We give the first $\tilde{O}(n^2 + {d_\lambda}^{\omega}$) time algorithm for solving a regularized linear system $(A + \lambda I)x = b$, where $A$ is positive semidefinite with effective dimension $d_\lambda$. This problem arises in applications like Gaussian process regression.
  3. We give faster algorithms for approximating Schatten $p$-norms and other matrix norms. For example, for the Schatten 1 (nuclear) norm, we give an algorithm that runs in $\tilde{O}(n^{2.11})$ time, improving on an $\tilde{O}(n^{2.18})$ method of [Musco et al., ITCS 2018].
  Interestingly, previous state-of-the-art algorithms for most of the problems above relied on stochastic iterative methods, like stochastic coordinate and gradient descent. Our work takes a completely different approach, instead leveraging tools from matrix sketching.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal model reduction of linear systems with multiple quadratic outputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we consider the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal model reduction of dynamical systems that are linear in the state equation and up to quadratic nonlinearity in the output equation. As our primary theoretical contributions, we derive gradients of the squared $\mathcal{H}_2$ system error with respect to the reduced model quantities and, from the stationary points of these gradients, introduce Gramian-based first-order necessary conditions for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimal approximation of a linear quadratic output (LQO) system. The resulting $\mathcal{H}_2$ optimality framework neatly generalizes the analogous Gramian-based optimality framework for purely linear systems. Computationally, we show how to enforce the necessary optimality conditions using Petrov-Galerkin projection; the corresponding projection matrices are obtained from a pair of Sylvester equations. Based on this result, we propose an iteratively corrected algorithm for the $\mathcal{H}_2$ model reduction of LQO systems, which we refer to as LQO-TSIA (linear quadratic output two-sided iteration algorithm). Numerical examples are included to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed computational method against other existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Active Disturbance Rejection Control for Uncertain Random Nonlinear Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.04296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, event-triggered active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) is first addressed for a class of uncertain random nonlinear systems driven by bounded noise and colored noise. The event-triggered extended state observer (ESO) and ADRC controller are designed, where two respective event-triggering mechanisms with a fixed positive lower bound for the inter-execution times are proposed. The random total disturbance representing the coupling of nonlinear unmodeled dynamics, external deterministic disturbance, bounded noise, and colored noise is estimated in real time by the event-triggered ESO and compensated in the event-triggered feedback loop. Both the mean square and almost surely practical convergence of the closed-loop systems is shown with rigorous theoretical analysis. Finally, some numerical simulations are implemented to validate the proposed control scheme and theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many power systems, particularly those isolated from larger intercontinental grids, operational dependence on natural gas becomes pivotal, especially during fluctuations or unavailability of renewables coupled with uncertain consumption patterns. Efficient orchestration and inventive strategies are imperative for the smooth functioning of these standalone gas-grid systems. This paper delves into the challenge of synchronized dynamic and stochastic optimization for independent transmission-level gas-grid systems. Our approach's novelty lies in amalgamating the staggered-grid method for the direct assimilation of gas-flow PDEs with an automated sensitivity analysis facilitated by SciML/Julia, further enhanced by an intuitive linkage between gas and power grids via nodal flows. We initiate with a single pipe to establish a versatile and expandable methodology, later showcasing its effectiveness with increasingly intricate examples.</description>

      <title>Computing local minimizers in polynomial optimization under genericity conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on computing local minimizers of a multivariate polynomial optimization problem under certain genericity conditions. By using a technique in computer algebra and the second-order optimality condition, we provide a univariate representation for the set of local minimizers. In particular, for the unconstrained problem, i.e. the constraint set is $\R^n$, the coordinates of all local minimizers can be represented by the values of $n$ univariate polynomials at real roots of a system including a univariate polynomial equation and a univariate polynomial matrix inequality. We also develop the technique for constrained problems having equality/inequality constraints. Based on the above technique, we design symbolic algorithms to enumerate the local minimizers and provide some experimental examples based on hybrid symbolic-numerical computations. For the case that the genericity conditions fail, at the end of the paper, we propose a perturbation technique to compute approximately a global minimizer provided that the constraint set is compact.</description>

      <title>On Solution Uniqueness and Robust Recovery for Sparse Regularization with a Gauge: from Dual Point of View</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the exploration of solution uniqueness, sharpness, and robust recovery in sparse regularization with a gauge $J$. Based on the criteria for the uniqueness of Lagrange multipliers in the dual problem, we give a characterization of the unique solution via the so-called radial cone. We establish characterizations of the isolated calmness (i.e., uniqueness of solutions combined with the calmness properties) of two types of the solution mappings and prove that they are equivalent under the assumption of metric subregularity of the subdifferentials for regularizers. Furthermore, we present sufficient and necessary conditions for a sharp solution, and show that these conditions guarantee robust recovery with a linear rate and imply local upper Lipschitzian properties of the solution mapping. Some applications of the polyhedral regularizer case such as sparse analysis regularization, weighted sorted $\ell_1$-norm sparse regularization, and non-polyhedral regularizer cases such as nuclear norm optimization, conic gauge optimization, and semidefinite conic gauge optimization are given.</description>

Abstract: In this work we take a deep dive into the cone of copositive $3 \times 3$ matrices. In doing so we visualize the cone, make geometric observations about it, and prove them. We then use these observations to parametrize the set. In the process we run into issues with surjectivity, and overcome them by resolving singularities and slightly shifting our original approach. We do all of this to ultimately arrive at a novel parametrization of the $3 \times 3$ copositive matrix cone which is surjective and almost injective, which we call almost bijective.</description>

      <title>Convergence and Complexity Guarantee for Inexact First-order Riemannian Optimization Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze inexact Riemannian gradient descent (RGD) where Riemannian gradients and retractions are inexactly (and cheaply) computed. Our focus is on understanding when inexact RGD converges and what is the complexity in the general nonconvex and constrained setting. We answer these questions in a general framework of tangential Block Majorization-Minimization (tBMM). We establish that tBMM converges to an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. Under a mild assumption, the results still hold when the subproblem is solved inexactly in each iteration provided the total optimality gap is bounded. Our general analysis applies to a wide range of classical algorithms with Riemannian constraints including inexact RGD and proximal gradient method on Stiefel manifolds. We numerically validate that tBMM shows improved performance over existing methods when applied to various problems, including nonnegative tensor decomposition with Riemannian constraints, regularized nonnegative matrix factorization, and low-rank matrix recovery problems.</description>

      <title>Decision-Dependent Uncertainty-Aware Distribution System Planning Under Wildfire Risk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between power systems and wildfires can be dangerous and costly. Damaged structures, load shedding, and high operational costs are potential consequences when the grid is unprepared. In fact, the operation of distribution grids can be liable for the outbreak of wildfires when extreme weather conditions arise. Within this context, investment planning should consider the impact of operational actions on the uncertainty related to wildfires that can directly affect line failure likelihood. Neglecting this can compromise the cost-benefit evaluation in planning system investments for wildfire risk. In this paper, we propose a decision-dependent uncertainty (DDU) aware methodology that provides the optimal portfolio of investments for distribution systems while considering that high power-flow levels through line segments in high-threat areas can ignite wildfires and, therefore, increase the probability of line failures. The methodology identifies the best combination of system upgrades (installation of new lines, hardening existing lines, and placement of switching devices) to provide the necessary leeway to operate the distribution system under wildfire-prone conditions. Our case study demonstrates that by modeling the DDU relationship between power flow prescriptions and line failures, investment decisions are more accurate and better prepare the grid infrastructure to deal with wildfire risk.</description>

Abstract: The co-optimization of behind-the-meter distributed energy resources is considered for prosumers under the net energy metering tariff. The distributed energy resources considered include renewable generations, flexible demands, and battery energy storage systems. An energy management system co-optimizes the consumptions and battery storage based on locally available stochastic renewables by solving a stochastic dynamic program that maximizes the expected operation surplus. To circumvent the exponential complexity of the dynamic program solution, we propose a closed-form and linear computation complexity co-optimization algorithm based on a relaxation-projection approach to a constrained stochastic dynamic program. Sufficient conditions for optimality for the proposed solution are obtained. Numerical studies demonstrate orders of magnitude reduction of computation costs and significantly reduced optimality gap.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bregman-Kaczmarz: An Approach to Solve Linear Inverse Problems with Independent Noise Exactly</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06186v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the block Bregman-Kaczmarz method for finite dimensional linear inverse problems. The block Bregman-Kaczmarz method uses blocks of the linear system and performs iterative steps with these blocks only. We assume a noise model that we call independent noise, i.e. each time the method performs a step for some block, one obtains a noisy sample of the respective part of the right-hand side which is contaminated with new noise that is independent of all previous steps of the method. One can view these noise models as making a fresh noisy measurement of the respective block each time it is used. In this framework, we are able to show that a well-chosen adaptive stepsize of the block Bergman-Kaczmarz method is able to converge to the exact solution of the linear inverse problem. The plain form of this adaptive stepsize relies on unknown quantities (like the Bregman distance to the solution), but we show a way how these quantities can be estimated purely from given data. We illustrate the finding in numerical experiments and confirm that these heuristic estimates lead to effective stepsizes.</description>

Abstract: We propose a Riemannian gradient descent with the Poincar\'e metric to compute the order-$\alpha$ Augustin information, a widely used quantity for characterizing exponential error behaviors in information theory. We prove that the algorithm converges to the optimum at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1 / T)$. As far as we know, this is the first algorithm with a non-asymptotic optimization error guarantee for all positive orders. Numerical experimental results demonstrate the empirical efficiency of the algorithm. Our result is based on a novel hybrid analysis of Riemannian gradient descent for functions that are geodesically convex in a Riemannian metric and geodesically smooth in another.</description>

      <title>Almost Global Asymptotic Trajectory Tracking for Fully-Actuated Mechanical Systems on Homogeneous Riemannian Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the design of tracking controllers that drive a mechanical system's state asymptotically towards a reference trajectory. Motivated by aerospace and robotics applications, we consider fully-actuated systems evolving on the broad class of homogeneous spaces (encompassing all vector spaces, Lie groups, and spheres of any finite dimension). In this setting, the transitive action of a Lie group on the configuration manifold enables an intrinsic description of the tracking error as an element of the state space, even in the absence of a group structure on the configuration manifold itself (e.g., for $\mathbb{S}^2$). Such an error state facilitates the design of a generalized control policy depending smoothly on state and time, which drives the geometric tracking error to a designated origin from almost every initial condition, thereby guaranteeing almost global convergence to the reference trajectory. Moreover, the proposed controller simplifies elegantly when specialized to a Lie group or the n-sphere. In summary, we propose a unified, intrinsic controller guaranteeing almost global asymptotic trajectory tracking for fully-actuated mechanical systems evolving on a broad class of manifolds. We apply the method to an axisymmetric satellite and an omnidirectional aerial robot.</description>
