      <title>Automatic Generation of Safety-compliant Linear Temporal Logic via Large Language Model: A Self-supervised Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring safety in cyber-physical systems (CPS) poses a significant challenge, especially when converting high-level tasks described by natural language into formal specifications like Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). In particular, the compliance of formal languages with respect to safety restrictions imposed on CPS is crucial for system safety. In this paper, we introduce AutoSafeLTL, a self-supervised framework that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of safety-compliant LTL. Our approach integrates a Language Inclusion check with an automated counterexample-guided feedback and modification mechanism, establishing a pipeline that verifies the safety-compliance of the resulting LTL while preserving its logical consistency and semantic accuracy. To enhance the framework's understanding and correction capabilities, we incorporate two additional Agent LLMs. Experimental results demonstrate that AutoSafeLTL effectively guarantees safety-compliance for generated LTL, achieving a 0% violation rate against imposed safety constraints.</description>

      <title>Topological Kleene Field Theories: A new model of computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we establish the foundations of a computational field theory, which we term Topological Kleene Field Theory (TKFT), inspired by Stephen Kleene's seminal work on partial recursive functions. Our central result shows that any computable function can be simulated by the flow on a smooth bordism of a vector field with good local properties. More precisely, we prove that reaching functions on clean dynamical bordisms are exactly equivalent to computable functions, setting an alternative model of computation to Turing machines. The use of non-trivial topologies for the bordisms involved is essential for this equivalence, suggesting interesting connections between the topological structure of these flows and the computational complexity inherent in the functions. We emphasize that TKFT has the potential to surpass the computational complexity of both Turing machines and quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Formalizing Complex Mathematical Statements with LLMs: A Study on Mathematical Definitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12065v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thanks to their linguistic capabilities, LLMs offer an opportunity to bridge the gap between informal mathematics and formal languages through autoformalization. However, it is still unclear how well LLMs generalize to sophisticated and naturally occurring mathematical statements. To address this gap, we investigate the task of autoformalizing real-world mathematical definitions -- a critical component of mathematical discourse. Specifically, we introduce two novel resources for autoformalisation, collecting definitions from Wikipedia (Def_Wiki) and arXiv papers (Def_ArXiv). We then systematically evaluate a range of LLMs, analyzing their ability to formalize definitions into Isabelle/HOL. Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs' performance including refinement through external feedback from Proof Assistants, and formal definition grounding, where we guide LLMs through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical libraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge compared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that LLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant mathematical libraries. At the same time, structured refinement methods and definition grounding strategies yield notable improvements of up to 16% on self-correction capabilities and 43% on the reduction of undefined errors, highlighting promising directions for enhancing LLM-based autoformalization in real-world scenarios.</description>
