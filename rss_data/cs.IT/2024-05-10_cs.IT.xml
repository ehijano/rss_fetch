      <title>Channel Capacity of Near-Field Multiuser Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The channel capacity of near-field (NF) communications is characterized by considering three types of multiuser channels: i) multiple access channel (MAC), ii) broadcast channel (BC), and iii) multicast channel (MC). For NF MAC and BC, closed-form expressions are derived for the sum-rate capacity as well as the capacity region under a two-user scenario. These results are further extended to scenarios with an arbitrary number of users. For NF MC, closed-form expressions are derived for the two-user channel capacity and the capacity upper bound with more users. Further insights are gleaned by exploring special cases, including scenarios with infinitely large array apertures, co-directional users, and linear arrays. Theoretical and numerical results are presented and compared with far-field communications to demonstrate that: i) the NF capacity of these three channels converges to finite values rather than growing unboundedly as the number of array elements increases; ii) the capacity of the MAC and BC with co-directional users can be improved by using the additional range dimensions in NF channels to reduce inter-user interference (IUI); and iii) the MC capacity benefits less from the NF effect compared to the MAC and BC, as multicasting is less sensitive to IUI.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided AirComp: Multi-Timescale Design and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) into over-the-air computation (AirComp) is an effective solution for reducing the computational mean squared error (MSE) via its high passive beamforming gain. Prior works on IRS aided AirComp generally rely on the full instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), which is not applicable to large-scale systems due to its heavy signalling overhead. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-timescale transmission protocol. In particular, the receive beamforming at the access point (AP) is pre-determined based on the static angle information and the IRS phase-shifts are optimized relying on the long-term statistical CSI. With the obtained AP receive beamforming and IRS phase-shifts, the effective low-dimensional I-CSI is exploited to determine devices' transmit power in each coherence block, thus substantially reducing the signalling overhead. Theoretical analysis unveils that the achievable MSE scales on the order of ${\cal O}\left( {K/\left( {{N^2}M} \right)} \right)$, where $M$, $N$, and $K$ are the number of AP antennas, IRS elements, and devices, respectively. We also prove that the channel-inversion power control is asymptotically optimal for large $N$, which reveals that the full power transmission policy is not needed for lowering the power consumption of energy-limited devices.</description>

      <title>On noisy duplication channels with Markov sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channels with noisy duplications have recently been used to model the nanopore sequencer. This paper extends some foundational information-theoretic results to this new scenario. We prove the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) for noisy duplication processes based on ergodic Markov processes. A consequence is that the noisy duplication channel is information stable for ergodic Markov sources, and therefore the channel capacity constrained to Markov sources is the Markov-constrained Shannon capacity. We use the AEP to estimate lower bounds on the capacity of the binary symmetric channel with Bernoulli and geometric duplications using Monte Carlo simulations. In addition, we relate the AEP for noisy duplication processes to the AEP for hidden semi-Markov processes.</description>

      <title>On predicting for non-vanishing continuous time signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper establishes frequency predictability criteria and presents predictors for two-sided non-vanishing bounded continuous time signals, i.e., for signals from $L_{\infty}(\R)$ that do not necessarily vanish at $\pm\infty$. The notions of transfer functions, the spectrum gaps, bandlimitness, and high-pass filters are introduced for these signals. This allowed to obtain some frequency criteria for predictability and predictors for signals with spectrum degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Perfect Subset Privacy in Polynomial Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Delegating large-scale computations to service providers is a common practice which raises privacy concerns. This paper studies information-theoretic privacy-preserving delegation of data to a service provider, who may further delegate the computation to auxiliary worker nodes, in order to compute a polynomial over that data at a later point in time. We study techniques which are compatible with robust management of distributed computation systems, an area known as coded computing. Privacy in coded computing, however, has traditionally addressed the problem of colluding workers, and assumed that the server that administrates the computation is trusted. This viewpoint of privacy does not accurately reflect real-world privacy concerns, since normally, the service provider as a whole (i.e., the administrator and the worker nodes) form one cohesive entity which itself poses a privacy risk. This paper aims to shift the focus of privacy in coded computing to safeguarding the privacy of the user against the service provider as a whole, instead of merely against colluding workers inside the service provider. To this end, we leverage the recently defined notion of perfect subset privacy, which guarantees zero information leakage from all subsets of the data up to a certain size. Using known techniques from Reed-Muller decoding, we provide a scheme which enables polynomial computation with perfect subset privacy in straggler-free systems. Furthermore, by studying information super-sets in Reed-Muller codes, which may be of independent interest, we extend the previous scheme to tolerate straggling worker nodes inside the service provider.</description>

      <title>Characteristic-Mode Based Conformal Design of Ultra-Wideband Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An innovative design method of conformal array antennas is presented by utilizing characteristic mode analysis (CMA) in this work. A single-layer continuous perfect electric conductor under bending conditions is conducted by CMA to evaluate the variations in operating performance. By using this method, the design process of a conformal array is simplified. The results indicate that the operating performance of the antenna with single-layer metal radiation structure remains stable within a certain range of curvature. Subsequently, an infinite array element using single-layer metal radiation structure is designed, operating in ultra-wideband and dual polarization. Following, an 8 * 8 ultra-wideband dual-polarized cylindrical-conformal array (UDCA) is developed by wrapping the planar arrays to a cylindric surface, which has a stable operating performance even at a curvature radius as small as 100 mm. Finally, a physical prototype is cost-effectively fabricated by novel manufacturing solutions that stack three-layer conformal substrate. The experimental result demonstrates that the proposed UDCA with a 1.2{\lambda} curvature radius operates at 3.6~9.6 GHz (90.9%) and achieves 60{\deg} wide-angle scanning in two principal planes, which provides a practical and promising solution for conformal array applications. The insights derived from the CMA offer a direction for further advancement in conformal antenna research.</description>

      <title>On the Capacity of Correlated MIMO Phase-Noise Channels: An Electro-Optic Frequency Comb Example</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The capacity of a discrete-time multiple-input-multiple-output channel with correlated phase noises is investigated. In particular, the electro-optic frequency comb system is considered, where the phase noise of each channel is a combination of two independent Wiener phase-noise sources. Capacity upper and lower bounds are derived for this channel and are compared with lower bounds obtained by numerically evaluating the achievable information rates using quadrature amplitude modulation constellations. Capacity upper and lower bounds are provided for the high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime. The multiplexing gain (pre-log) is shown to be $M-1$, where $M$ represents the number of channels. A constant gap between the asymptotic upper and lower bounds is observed, which depends on the number of channels $M$. For the specific case of $M=2$, capacity is characterized up to a term that vanishes as the SNR grows large.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the information-theoretic conditions to achieve the complete reconstruction of a diploid genome. We also analyze the standard greedy and de-Bruijn graph-based algorithms and compare the coverage depth and read length requirements with the information-theoretic lower bound. Our results show that the gap between the two is considerable because both algorithms require the double repeats in the genome to be bridged.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Generative Semantic Communication Powered by Shared Semantic Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication has drawn substantial attention as a promising paradigm to achieve effective and intelligent communications. However, efficient image semantic communication encounters challenges with a lower testing compression ratio (CR) compared to the training phase. To tackle this issue, we propose an innovative semantic knowledge base (SKB)-enabled generative semantic communication system for image classification and image generation tasks. Specifically, a lightweight SKB, comprising class-level information, is exploited to guide the semantic communication process, which enables us to transmit only the relevant indices. This approach promotes the completion of the image classification task at the source end and significantly reduces the transmission load. Meanwhile, the category-level knowledge in the SKB facilitates the image generation task by allowing controllable generation, making it possible to generate favorable images in resource-constrained scenarios. Additionally, semantic accuracy is introduced as a new metric to validate the performance of semantic transmission powered by the SKB. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed method outperforms the benchmarks and achieves superior performance with minimal transmission overhead, especially in the low SNR regime.</description>

      <title>Refinements and Extensions of Ziv's Model of Perfect Secrecy for Individual Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We refine and extend Ziv's model and results regarding perfectly secure encryption of individual sequences. According to this model, the encrypter and the legitimate decrypter share in common a secret key, not shared with the unauthorized eavesdropper, who is aware of the encryption scheme and has some prior knowledge concerning the individual plaintext source sequence. This prior knowledge, combined with the cryptogram, is harnessed by eavesdropper which implements a finite-state machine as a mechanism for accepting or rejecting attempted guesses of the source plaintext. The encryption is considered perfectly secure if the cryptogram does not provide any new information to the eavesdropper that may enhance its knowledge concerning the plaintext beyond his prior knowledge. Ziv has shown that the key rate needed for perfect secrecy is essentially lower bounded by the finite-state compressibility of the plaintext sequence, a bound which is clearly asymptotically attained by Lempel-Ziv compression followed by one-time pad encryption. In this work, we consider some more general classes of finite-state eavesdroppers and derive the respective lower bounds on the key rates needed for perfect secrecy. These bounds are tighter and more refined than Ziv's bound and they are attained by encryption schemes that are based on different universal lossless compression schemes. We also extend our findings to the case where side information is available to the eavesdropper and the legitimate decrypter, but may or may not be available to the encrypter as well.</description>

      <title>On the Secrecy Capacity of 1-2-1 Atomic Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of secure communication over a noiseless 1-2-1 network, an abstract model introduced to capture the directivity characteristic of mmWave communications. We focus on structured networks, which we refer to as 1-2-1 atomic networks. Broadly speaking, these are characterized by a source, a destination, and three layers of intermediate nodes with sparse connections. The goal is for the source to securely communicate to the destination in the presence of an eavesdropper with unbounded computation capabilities, but limited network presence. We derive novel upper and lower bounds on the secrecy capacity of 1-2-1 atomic networks. These bounds are shown to be tighter than existing bounds in some regimes. Moreover, in such regimes, the bounds match and hence, they characterize the secrecy capacity of 1-2-1 atomic networks.</description>

      <title>Efficient designs for threshold group testing without gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $d$ defective items in a population of $n$ items with $d \ll n$, in threshold group testing without gap, the outcome of a test on a subset of items is positive if the subset has at least $u$ defective items and negative otherwise, where $1 \leq u \leq d$. The basic goal of threshold group testing is to quickly identify the defective items via a small number of tests. In non-adaptive design, all tests are designed independently and can be performed in parallel. The decoding time in the non-adaptive state-of-the-art work is a polynomial of $(d/u)^u (d/(d-u))^{d - u}, d$, and $\log{n}$. In this work, we present a novel design that significantly reduces the number of tests and the decoding time to polynomials of $\min\{u^u, (d - u)^{d - u}\}, d$, and $\log{n}$. In particular, when $u$ is a constant, the number of tests and the decoding time are $O(d^3 (\log^2{n}) \log{(n/d)} )$ and $O\big(d^3 (\log^2{n}) \log{(n/d)} + d^2 (\log{n}) \log^3{(n/d)} \big)$, respectively. For a special case when $u = 2$, with non-adaptive design, the number of tests and the decoding time are $O(d^3 (\log{n}) \log{(n/d)} )$ and $O(d^2 (\log{n} + \log^2{(n/d)}) )$, respectively. Moreover, with 2-stage design, the number of tests and the decoding time are $O(d^2 \log^2{(n/d)} )$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the connection between mixing properties for bipartite graphs and materialization of the mutual information in one-shot settings. We show that mixing properties of a graph imply impossibility to extract the mutual information shared by the ends of an edge randomly sampled in the graph. We apply these impossibility results to some questions motivated by information-theoretic cryptography. In particular, we show that communication complexity of a secret key agreement in one-shot setting is inherently uneven: for some inputs, almost all communication complexity inevitably falls on only one party.</description>

      <title>Non-Binary Covering Codes for Low-Access Computations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a real dataset and a computation family, we wish to encode and store the dataset in a distributed system so that any computation from the family can be performed by accessing a small number of nodes. In this work, we focus on the families of linear computations where the coefficients are restricted to a finite set of real values. For two-valued computations, a recent work presented a scheme that gives good feasible points on the access-redundancy tradeoff. This scheme is based on binary covering codes having a certain closure property. In a follow-up work, this scheme was extended to all finite coefficient sets, using a new additive-combinatorics notion called coefficient complexity. In the present paper, we explore non-binary covering codes and develop schemes that outperform the state-of-the-art for some coefficient sets. We provide a more general coefficient complexity definition and show its applicability to the access-redundancy tradeoff.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation for Holographic MIMO: Wavenumber-Domain Sparsity Inspired Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the sparse channel estimation for holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) systems. Given that the wavenumber-domain representation is based on a series of Fourier harmonics that are in essence a series of orthogonal basis functions, a novel wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis is designed to expose the sparsity inherent in HMIMO channels. Furthermore, by harnessing the beneficial sparsity in the wavenumber domain, the sparse estimation of HMIMO channels is structured as a compressed sensing problem, which can be efficiently solved by our proposed wavenumber-domain orthogonal matching pursuit (WD-OMP) algorithm. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed wavenumber-domain sparsifying basis maintains its detection accuracy regardless of the number of antenna elements and antenna spacing. Additionally, in the case of antenna spacing being much less than half a wavelength, the wavenumber-domain approach remains highly accurate in identifying the significant angular power of HMIMO channels.</description>

      <title>Private Online Community Detection for Censored Block Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the private online change detection problem for dynamic communities, using a censored block model (CBM). Focusing on the notion of edge differential privacy (DP), we seek to understand the fundamental tradeoffs between the privacy budget, detection delay, and exact community recovery of community labels. We establish the theoretical lower bound on the delay in detecting changes privately and propose an algorithm capable of identifying changes in the community structure, while maintaining user privacy. Further, we provide theoretical guarantees for the effectiveness of our proposed method by showing necessary and sufficient conditions on change detection and exact recovery under edge DP. Simulation and real data examples are provided to validate the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Guarantees of Data Augmented Last Layer Retraining Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring fair predictions across many distinct subpopulations in the training data can be prohibitive for large models. Recently, simple linear last layer retraining strategies, in combination with data augmentation methods such as upweighting, downsampling and mixup, have been shown to achieve state-of-the-art performance for worst-group accuracy, which quantifies accuracy for the least prevalent subpopulation. For linear last layer retraining and the abovementioned augmentations, we present the optimal worst-group accuracy when modeling the distribution of the latent representations (input to the last layer) as Gaussian for each subpopulation. We evaluate and verify our results for both synthetic and large publicly available datasets.</description>

      <title>Age Aware Scheduling for Differentially-Private Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores differentially-private federated learning (FL) across time-varying databases, delving into a nuanced three-way tradeoff involving age, accuracy, and differential privacy (DP). Emphasizing the potential advantages of scheduling, we propose an optimization problem aimed at meeting DP requirements while minimizing the loss difference between the aggregated model and the model obtained without DP constraints. To harness the benefits of scheduling, we introduce an age-dependent upper bound on the loss, leading to the development of an age-aware scheduling design. Simulation results underscore the superior performance of our proposed scheme compared to FL with classic DP, which does not consider scheduling as a design factor. This research contributes insights into the interplay of age, accuracy, and DP in federated learning, with practical implications for scheduling strategies.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Holographic MIMO Based Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the high spectral efficiency, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) technology holds promise for enhancing both sensing and communication capabilities. However, accurately characterizing its performance poses a challenge due to the spatial correlation induced by densely spaced antennas. In this paper, a holographic MIMO (HMIMO) based integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed for both downlink and uplink scenarios. The spacial correlation is incorporated in the communication channel modeling, while an accurate spherical wave-based model is utilized to characterize sensing link. By considering both instantaneous channel state information (CSI) and statistical CSI, closed-form expressions are derived for sensing rates (SRs), communication rates (CRs), and outage probabilities under different ISAC designs to investigate the theoretical performance limits of the proposed HISAC framework. Further insights are gained by examining high signal-to-noise ratio slopes and diversity orders. Specifically, i) for the downlink case, a sensing-centric (S-C) design and a communications-centric (C-C) design are investigated based on different beamforming strategies, and a Pareto optimal design is proposed to characterize the attainable SR-CR region; ii) for the uplink case, the S-C design and the C-C design are distinguished by the interference cancellation order of the communication signal and the sensing signal, and the rate region is obtained through a time-sharing strategy. Numerical results reveal that HMIMO based ISAC (HISAC) systems outperform both conventional MIMO based ISAC systems and HMIMO based frequency-division sensing and communications systems, underscoring the superior performance of HISAC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Riemannian gradient descent with the Poincar\'e metric to compute the order-$\alpha$ Augustin information, a widely used quantity for characterizing exponential error behaviors in information theory. We prove that the algorithm converges to the optimum at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1 / T)$. As far as we know, this is the first algorithm with a non-asymptotic optimization error guarantee for all positive orders. Numerical experimental results demonstrate the empirical efficiency of the algorithm. Our result is based on a novel hybrid analysis of Riemannian gradient descent for functions that are geodesically convex in a Riemannian metric and geodesically smooth in another.</description>

Abstract: A coding lattice $\Lambda_c$ and a shaping lattice $\Lambda_s$ forms a nested lattice code $\mathcal{C}$ if $\Lambda_s \subseteq \Lambda_c$. Under some conditions, $\mathcal{C}$ is a finite cyclic group formed by rectangular encoding. This paper presents the conditions for the existence of such $\mathcal{C}$ and provides some designs. These designs correspond to solutions to linear Diophantine equations so that a cyclic lattice code $\mathcal C$ of arbitrary codebook size $M$ can possess group isomorphism, which is an essential property for a nested lattice code to be applied in physical layer network relaying techniques such as compute and forward.</description>

      <title>Joint Transmitter and Receiver Design for Movable Antenna Enhanced Multicast Communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) is an emerging technology that utilizes localized antenna movement to pursue better channel conditions for enhancing communication performance. In this paper, we study the MA-enhanced multicast transmission from a base station equipped with multiple MAs to multiple groups of single-MA users. Our goal is to maximize the minimum weighted signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users by jointly optimizing the position of each transmit/receive MA and the transmit beamforming. To tackle this challenging problem, we first consider the single-group scenario and propose an efficient algorithm based on the techniques of alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Particularly, when optimizing transmit or receive MA positions, we construct a concave lower bound for the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of each user by applying only the second-order Taylor expansion, which is more effective than existing works utilizing two-step approximations. The proposed design is then extended to the general multi-group scenario. Simulation results demonstrate that significant performance gains in terms of achievable max-min SNR/SINR can be obtained by our proposed algorithm over benchmark schemes. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can notably reduce the required amount of transmit power or antennas for achieving a target level of max-min SNR/SINR performance compared to benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>On de Bruijn Covering Sequences and Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An $(m,n,R)$-de Bruijn covering array (dBCA) is a doubly periodic $M \times N$ array over an alphabet of size $q$ such that the set of all its $m \times n$ windows form a covering code with radius $R$. An upper bound of the smallest array area of an $(m,n,R)$-dBCA is provided using a probabilistic technique which is similar to the one that was used for an upper bound on the length of a de Bruijn covering sequence. A folding technique to construct a dBCA from a de Bruijn covering sequence or de Bruijn covering sequences code is presented. Several new constructions that yield shorter de Bruijn covering sequences and $(m,n,R)$-dBCAs with smaller areas are also provided. These constructions are mainly based on sequences derived from cyclic codes, self-dual sequences, primitive polynomials, an interleaving technique, folding, and mutual shifts of sequences with the same covering radius. Finally, constructions of de Bruijn covering sequences codes are also discussed.</description>

      <title>GLDPC-PC Codes for MIMO Systems with Iterative Detection and Decoding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose the integration of GLDPC codes with short polar-like component codes, termed GLDPC codes with polar component codes (GLDPC-PC). This approach leverages the good distance properties of polar-like codes and mitigates their high decoding latency in long block lengths. A recently proposed soft-input soft-output decoder for polar-like codes enables effective iterative belief propagation decoding for GLDPC-PC, ensuring a low error floor under additive white Gaussian noise channels. Simulation results demonstrate that GLDPC-PC codes achieve significant performance improvements in multiple-input multiple-output systems with iterative detection and decoding (IDD). The proposed GLDPC-PC codes and the IDD scheme can be applied to various scenarios.</description>

      <title>Compute-Forward Multiple Access for Gaussian Fast Fading Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compute-forward multiple access (CFMA) is a transmission strategy which allows the receiver in a multiple access channel (MAC) to first decode linear combinations of the transmitted signals and then solve for individual messages. Compared to existing MAC strategies such as joint decoding or successive interference cancellation (SIC), CFMA was shown to achieve the MAC capacity region for fixed channels under certain signal-to-noise (SNR) conditions without time-sharing using only single-user decoders. This paper studies the CFMA scheme for a two-user Gaussian fast fading MAC with channel state information only available at the receiver (CSIR). We develop appropriate lattice decoding schemes for the fading MAC and derive the achievable rate pairs for decoding linear combinations of codewords with any integer coefficients. We give a sufficient and necessary condition under which the proposed scheme can achieve the ergodic sum capacity. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of channel statistics on the capacity achievability of the CFMA scheme. In general, the sum capacity is achievable if the channel variance is small compared to the mean value of the channel strengths. Various numerical results are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Blocking sets, minimal codes and trifferent codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.09457v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove new upper bounds on the smallest size of affine blocking sets, that is, sets of points in a finite affine space that intersect every affine subspace of a fixed codimension. We show an equivalence between affine blocking sets with respect to codimension-$2$ subspaces that are generated by taking a union of lines through the origin, and strong blocking sets in the corresponding projective space, which in turn are equivalent to minimal codes. Using this equivalence, we improve the current best upper bounds on the smallest size of a strong blocking set in finite projective spaces over fields of size at least $3$. Furthermore, using coding theoretic techniques, we improve the current best lower bounds on strong blocking set.
  Our main motivation for these new bounds is their application to trifferent codes, which are sets of ternary codes of length $n$ with the property that for any three distinct codewords there is a coordinate where they all have distinct values. Over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_3$, we prove that minimal codes are equivalent to linear trifferent codes. Using this equivalence, we show that any linear trifferent code of length $n$ has size at most $3^{n/4.55}$, improving the recent upper bound of Pohoata and Zakharov. Moreover, we show the existence of linear trifferent codes of length $n$ and size at least $\frac{1}{3}\left( 9/5 \right)^{n/4}$, thus (asymptotically) matching the best lower bound on trifferent codes.
  We also give explicit constructions of affine blocking sets with respect to codimension-$2$ subspaces that are a constant factor bigger than the best known lower bound. By restricting to~$\mathbb{F}_3$, we obtain linear trifferent codes of size at least $3^{23n/312}$, improving the current best explicit construction that has size $3^{n/112}$.</description>

      <title>Codivergences and information matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.08122v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new concept of codivergence, which quantifies the similarity between two probability measures $P_1, P_2$ relative to a reference probability measure $P_0$. In the neighborhood of the reference measure $P_0$, a codivergence behaves like an inner product between the measures $P_1 - P_0$ and $P_2 - P_0$. Codivergences of covariance-type and correlation-type are introduced and studied with a focus on two specific correlation-type codivergences, the $\chi^2$-codivergence and the Hellinger codivergence. We derive explicit expressions for several common parametric families of probability distributions. For a codivergence, we introduce moreover the divergence matrix as an analogue of the Gram matrix. It is shown that the $\chi^2$-divergence matrix satisfies a data-processing inequality.</description>

      <title>Information Bottleneck Analysis of Deep Neural Networks via Lossy Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08013v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Information Bottleneck (IB) principle offers an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the training process of deep neural networks (DNNs). Its essence lies in tracking the dynamics of two mutual information (MI) values: between the hidden layer output and the DNN input/target. According to the hypothesis put forth by Shwartz-Ziv &amp; Tishby (2017), the training process consists of two distinct phases: fitting and compression. The latter phase is believed to account for the good generalization performance exhibited by DNNs. Due to the challenging nature of estimating MI between high-dimensional random vectors, this hypothesis was only partially verified for NNs of tiny sizes or specific types, such as quantized NNs. In this paper, we introduce a framework for conducting IB analysis of general NNs. Our approach leverages the stochastic NN method proposed by Goldfeld et al. (2019) and incorporates a compression step to overcome the obstacles associated with high dimensionality. In other words, we estimate the MI between the compressed representations of high-dimensional random vectors. The proposed method is supported by both theoretical and practical justifications. Notably, we demonstrate the accuracy of our estimator through synthetic experiments featuring predefined MI values and comparison with MINE (Belghazi et al., 2018). Finally, we perform IB analysis on a close-to-real-scale convolutional DNN, which reveals new features of the MI dynamics.</description>
