      <title>State-space kinetic Ising model reveals task-dependent entropy flow in sparsely active nonequilibrium neuronal dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuronal ensemble activity, including coordinated and oscillatory patterns, exhibits hallmarks of nonequilibrium systems with time-asymmetric trajectories to maintain their organization. However, assessing time asymmetry from neuronal spiking activity remains challenging. The kinetic Ising model provides a framework for studying the causal, nonequilibrium dynamics in spiking recurrent neural networks. Recent theoretical advances in this model have enabled time-asymmetry estimation from large-scale steady-state data. Yet, neuronal activity often exhibits time-varying firing rates and coupling strengths, violating steady-state assumption. To overcome these limitations, we developed a state-space kinetic Ising model that accounts for non-stationary and nonequilibrium properties of neural systems. This approach incorporates a mean-field method for estimating time-varying entropy flow, a key measure for maintaining the system's organization by dissipation. Applying this method to mouse visual cortex data revealed greater variability in causal couplings during task engagement despite the reduced neuronal activity with increased sparsity. Moreover, higher-performing mice exhibited increased entropy flow in higher-firing neurons during task engagement, suggesting that stronger directed activity emerged in a fewer neurons within sparsely active populations. These findings underscore the model's utility in uncovering intricate asymmetric causal dynamics in neuronal ensembles and linking them to behavior through the thermodynamic underpinnings of neural computation.</description>

      <title>Interaction of functional brain networks is formed by k-clique percolation in the human structural connectome</title>

Abstract: The human structural connectome has a complex internal community organization, characterized by a high degree of overlap and related to functional and cognitive phenomena. We explored connectivity properties in connectome networks and showed that $k$-clique percolation of an anomalously high order is characteristic of the human structural connectome. The resulting structural organization maintains a high local density of connectivity distributed throughout the connectome while preserving the overall sparsity of the network. To analyze these findings, we proposed a novel model for the emergence of high-order clique percolation during network formation with a phase transition dynamic under constraints on connection length. Investigating the structural basis of functional brain subnetworks, we identified a direct relationship between their interaction and the formation of clique clusters within their structural connections. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that the percolating clique cluster serves as a distributed boundary between interacting functional subnetworks, showing the complex, complementary nature of their structural connections. We also examined the difference between individual-specific and common structural connections and found that the latter plays a sustaining role in the connectivity of structural communities. At the same time, the superiority of individual connections, in contrast to common ones, creates variability in the interaction of functional brain subnetworks.</description>

      <title>Inferring traits of hyperuniformity from local structures via persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hyperuniformity refers to the suppression of density fluctuations at large scales. Typical for ordered systems, this property also emerges in several disordered physical and biological systems, where it is particularly relevant to understand mechanisms of pattern formation and to exploit peculiar attributes, e.g., interaction with light and transport phenomena. While hyperuniformity is a global property, ideally defined for infinitely extended systems, several disordered correlated systems have finite size. It has been shown in [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 023107 (2024)] that global hyperuniform characteristics systematically correlate with distributions of topological properties representative of local arrangements. In this work, building on this information, we explore and assess the inverse relationship between hyperuniformity and local structures in point patterns as described by persistent homology. Standard machine learning algorithms trained on persistence diagrams are shown to detect hyperuniformity of periodic point patterns with high accuracy. Therefore, we demonstrate that the information on patterns' local structures allows for characterizing whether finite size arrangements are analogous to those realized in hyperuniform patterns. Then, addressing more quantitative aspects, we show that parameters defining hyperuniformity globally can be reconstructed by comparing persistence diagrams of targeted patterns with reference ones. We also explore the generation of patterns entailing given topological properties. The results of this study pave the way for advanced analysis of hyperuniform patterns including local information, and introduce basic concepts for their inverse design.</description>

      <title>Monitored interacting Dirac fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02645v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically study interacting Dirac fermions, described by the Thirring model, under weak local particle number measurements with monitoring rate $\gamma$. This system maps to a bosonic replica field theory, analyzed via the renormalization group. For a nonzero attractive interaction, a phase transition occurs at a critical measurement strength $\gamma_c$. When $\gamma&gt;\gamma_c$, the system enters a localized phase characterized by exponentially decaying density-density correlations beyond a finite correlation length; for $\gamma&lt;\gamma_c$, the correlations decay algebraically. The transition is of BKT-type, reflected by a characteristic scaling of the correlation length. In the non-interacting limit, $\gamma_c\to0$ shifts to zero, reducing the algebraic phase to a single point in parameter space. This identifies weak measurements in the free case as an implicit double fine-tuning to the critical endpoint of the BKT phase transition. Along the non-interacting line, we compute the entanglement entropy from density-density correlation functions and find no entanglement transition at nonzero measurement strength in the thermodynamic limit.</description>
