      <title>Mechanizing Operads with Event-B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rigorous modelling of natural and industrial systems still conveys various challenges related to abstractions, methods to proceed with and easy-to-use tools to build, compose and reason on models. Operads are mathematical structures that provide such abstractions to compose various objects and garanteeing well-formedness.
  Concrete implementations of operads will offer practical means to exploit operads and to use them for various technical applications. Going from the mathematical structures, we develop with Event-B a complete refinement chain that implements algebraic operads and their basic operations.
  The result of this work, can be used from the methodological point of view to handle similar implementations for symbolic computation questions, and also to reason on symbolic computation applications supported by operads structures.</description>

      <title>Projective Variety Recovery from Unknown Linear Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how a smooth irreducible algebraic variety $X$ of dimension $n$ embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$ (with $m \geq n+2$), which degree is $d$, can be recovered using two projections from unknown points onto unknown hyperplanes. The centers and the hyperplanes of projection are unknown: the only input is the defining equations of each projected varieties. We show how both the projection operators and the variety in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$ can be recovered modulo some action of the group of projective transformations of $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^{m}$. This configuration generalizes results obtained in the context of curves embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^3$ and results concerning surfaces embedded in $\mathbb{C} \mathbb{P}^4$.
  We show how in a generic situation, a characteristic matrix of the pair of projections can be recovered. In the process we address dimensional issues and as a result establish a necessary condition, as well as a sufficient condition to compute this characteristic matrix up to a finite-fold ambiguity. These conditions are expressed as minimal values of the degree of the dual variety.
  Then we use this matrix to recover the class of the couple of projections and as a consequence to recover the variety. For a generic situation, two projections define a variety with two irreducible components. One component has degree $d(d-1)$ and the other has degree $d$, being the original variety.</description>

      <title>Scaling Neuro-symbolic Problem Solving: Solver-Free Learning of Constraints and Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets, there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.</description>
