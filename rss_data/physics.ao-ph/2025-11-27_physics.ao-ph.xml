      <title>Sunlight, the Bond Albedo, CO2, and Earth's Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main determinants of Earth's absolute surface Temperature, T, are the solar constant, S, the Bond albedo, A, and the effective emissivity for thermal radiation, e. In this note we assume that the value of the effective emissivity, e = e(C), is determined by the atmospheric concentration C of CO2. We show that the solar constant is most important, the albedo is second, and the CO2 concentration is a distant third.</description>

      <title>The early history of Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB); the legacy of John Latham and Stephen Salter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses the initial development of Marine Cloud Brightening (MCB) as a theoretical idea, from its inception as a cloud microphysics process in circe 1990 to the full-blown concept by 2015. It primarily focuses on the work of founders John Latham and Stephen Salter and their contributions. Recently the concept has been developed further, e.g. in the UK ARIA project, as a prospective method to ameliorate the Earths rapid warming.</description>

      <title>Extratropical Atmospheric Circulation Response to ENSO in Deep Learning Pacific Pacemaker Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupled atmosphere-ocean deep learning (DL) climate emulators are a new frontier but are known to exhibit weak ENSO variability, raising questions about their ability to simulate teleconnections. Here, we present the first Pacific pacemaker (PACE) experiments using a coupled DL emulator (DLESyM) to bypass this weak variability and isolate the atmospheric response to observed ENSO forcing. We find that while the emulator realistically captures internal atmospheric variability, it produces a significantly amplified forced teleconnection response to ENSO. This amplified response leads to biases in simulating extremes, notably an overestimation of atmospheric blocking frequency and duration with the underestimation of peak intensity. Our findings underscore that coupled DL climate models require in-depth and physically-grounded validation, analogous to traditional numerical models, to build confidence in their use for physical climate analysis.</description>

      <title>Crowdsourcing the Frontier: Advancing Hybrid Physics-ML Climate Simulation via $50,000 Kaggle Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subgrid machine-learning (ML) parameterizations have the potential to introduce a new generation of climate models that incorporate the effects of higher-resolution physics without incurring the prohibitive computational cost associated with more explicit physics-based simulations. However, important issues, ranging from online instability to inconsistent online performance, have limited their operational use for long-term climate projections. To more rapidly drive progress in solving these issues, domain scientists and machine learning researchers opened up the offline aspect of this problem to the broader machine learning and data science community with the release of ClimSim, a NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks publication, and an associated Kaggle competition. This paper reports on the downstream results of the Kaggle competition by coupling emulators inspired by the winning teams' architectures to an interactive climate model (including full cloud microphysics, a regime historically prone to online instability) and systematically evaluating their online performance. Our results demonstrate that online stability in the low-resolution, real-geography setting is reproducible across multiple diverse architectures, which we consider a key milestone. All tested architectures exhibit strikingly similar offline and online biases, though their responses to architecture-agnostic design choices (e.g., expanding the list of input variables) can differ significantly. Multiple Kaggle-inspired architectures achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on certain metrics such as zonal mean bias patterns and global RMSE, indicating that crowdsourcing the essence of the offline problem is one path to improving online performance in hybrid physics-AI climate simulation.</description>

      <title>AI4X Roadmap: Artificial Intelligence for the advancement of scientific pursuit and its future directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are reshaping how we approach scientific discovery, not by replacing established methods but by extending what researchers can probe, predict, and design. In this roadmap we provide a forward-looking view of AI-enabled science across biology, chemistry, climate science, mathematics, materials science, physics, self-driving laboratories and unconventional computing. Several shared themes emerge: the need for diverse and trustworthy data, transferable electronic-structure and interatomic models, AI systems integrated into end-to-end scientific workflows that connect simulations to experiments and generative systems grounded in synthesisability rather than purely idealised phases. Across domains, we highlight how large foundation models, active learning and self-driving laboratories can close loops between prediction and validation while maintaining reproducibility and physical interpretability. Taken together, these perspectives outline where AI-enabled science stands today, identify bottlenecks in data, methods and infrastructure, and chart concrete directions for building AI systems that are not only more powerful but also more transparent and capable of accelerating discovery in complex real-world environments.</description>

      <title>EWE: An Agentic Framework for Extreme Weather Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather events pose escalating risks to global society, underscoring the urgent need to unravel their underlying physical mechanisms. Yet the prevailing expert-driven, labor-intensive diagnostic paradigm has created a critical analytical bottleneck, stalling scientific progress. While AI for Earth Science has achieved notable advances in prediction, the equally essential challenge of automated diagnostic reasoning remains largely unexplored. We present the Extreme Weather Expert (EWE), the first intelligent agent framework dedicated to this task. EWE emulates expert workflows through knowledge-guided planning, closed-loop reasoning, and a domain-tailored meteorological toolkit. It autonomously produces and interprets multimodal visualizations from raw meteorological data, enabling comprehensive diagnostic analyses. To catalyze progress, we introduce the first benchmark for this emerging field, comprising a curated dataset of 103 high-impact events and a novel step-wise evaluation metric. EWE marks a step toward automated scientific discovery and offers the potential to democratize expertise and intellectual resources, particularly for developing nations vulnerable to extreme weather.</description>

      <title>Accurate Column Moist Static Energy Budget in Climate Models. Part 1: Conservation Equation Formulation, Methodology, and Primary Results Demonstrated Using GISS ModelE3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Column-integrated moist static energy (MSE) budgets underpin theories of tropical convection and circulation, yet in reanalyses and climate models the budget rarely closes; residuals routinely match the leading terms and mask physical insights. This study derives an MSE conservation law that is strictly consistent with GISS ModelE3 and elucidates why conventional diagnostics fail. Multiple intertwined factors -- the breakdown of the product rule upon discretization, effects of mass-filtering, mismatched flux and advective forms, numerical noise in diagnosed vertical velocity, asynchronous model output timing, and postprocessing including vertical interpolation and temporal averaging -- leave significant residuals in both annual means and daily variability, even when raw 30-min model output is used. Residuals are even larger over land and along coastlines. To tackle this obstacle, this study implements the "process increment method," which accurately computes the column MSE flux divergence by calculating the change in column-integrated internal energy, geopotential energy, and latent heats before and after applying the dynamics scheme. Furthermore, the calculated column flux divergence is decomposed into horizontal and vertical advective components. The most crucial finding is that vertical interpolation into pressure coordinates can introduce errors substantial enough to reverse the sign of vertical MSE advection in the warm-pool regions. In ModelE3, native-grid values show MSE import via vertical circulations, while values after interpolation into pressure coordinates indicate export. This discrepancy may prompt a reevaluation of vertical advection as an exporting mechanism and underscores the importance of precise MSE budget calculations.</description>

      <title>Constructing Extreme Heatwave Storylines with Differentiable Climate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding the plausible upper bounds of extreme weather events is essential for risk assessment in a warming climate. Existing methods, based on large ensembles of physics-based models, are often computationally expensive or lack the fidelity needed to simulate rare, high-impact extremes. Here, we present a novel framework that leverages a differentiable hybrid climate model, NeuralGCM, to optimize initial conditions and generate physically consistent worst-case heatwave trajectories. Applied to the 2021 Pacific Northwest heatwave, our method produces heatwave intensity up to 3.7 $^\circ$C above the most extreme member of a 75-member ensemble. These trajectories feature intensified atmospheric blocking and amplified Rossby wave patterns-hallmarks of severe heat events. Our results demonstrate that differentiable climate models can efficiently explore the upper tails of event likelihoods, providing a powerful new approach for constructing targeted storylines of extreme weather under climate change.</description>

      <title>Nowcasting of Aviation Radiation Using Geospace Environment Properties: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiation exposure at aviation altitudes presents significant health risks to aircrews due to the cumulative effects of ionizing radiation. Physics-based models estimate radiation levels based on geophysical and atmospheric parameters, but often struggle to capture the highly dynamic and complex nature of the radiation environment, limiting their real-time predictive capabilities. To address this challenge, we investigate machine learning (ML) methods to enhance real-time radiation nowcasting. Leveraging newly compiled ML-ready datasets, publicly available at https://dmlab.cs.gsu.edu/rdp/, we train supervised models capable of capturing both linear and non-linear relationships between Geospace conditions and atmospheric radiation levels. Our experiments demonstrate that the XGBoost model achieves approximately 10 percent improvement in prediction accuracy over the considered physics-based model. Furthermore, feature importance analysis reveals that certain Geospace properties, specifically solar polar fields, solar wind properties, and neutron monitor data, are impacting the nowcast of the radiation levels at flight altitudes. These findings suggest meaningful physical relationships between the near-Earth space environment and atmospheric radiation, and highlight the potential of ML-based approaches for operational space weather applications.</description>
