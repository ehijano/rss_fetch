      <title>Whistler Chorus Amplification in the Magnetosphere: A Nonlinear Free-Electron Laser Model Based on the Ginzburg-Landau Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel nonlinear model for whistler-mode chorus amplification based on the free-electron laser (FEL) mechanism. First, we derive the nonlinear collective variable equations for the whistler-electron interaction. Consistent with in situ satellite observations, these equations predict that a small seed wave can undergo exponential growth, reaching a peak of a few hundred picoteslas after a few milliseconds, followed by millisecond timescale amplitude modulations. Next, we show that when one accounts for multiple wave frequencies and wave spatial variations, the amplitude and phase of the whistler wave can be described by the Ginzburg-Landau equation (GLE), providing a framework for the investigation of solitary wave behavior of chorus modes. These findings enhance our understanding of wave-particle interactions and space weather in the Van Allen radiation belts, deepen the connection between whistler-electron dynamics and FELs, and reveal a novel connection between whistler-mode chorus and the GLE.</description>

      <title>Comparing observations of the closely located JUICE and STEREO-A spacecraft during the widespread solar energetic particle event of 2024 May 13</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JUICE was launched in April 2023, and it is now in its cruise phase to Jupiter, where it is scheduled to arrive in July 2031. JUICE carries a radiation monitor, namely the RADiation hard Electron Monitor (RADEM) to measure protons, electrons, and ions, detecting particles coming mainly from the anti-Sun direction. On 2024 May 13, a large solar energetic particle (SEP) event took place in association with an eruption close to the western limb of the Sun as seen from Earth. Providentially, at that time JUICE was located very close to STEREO-A, being separated by 0.13 au in radial distance, 0.3 deg in latitude, and 1.6 deg in longitude. Methods. We analysed the IP context using in-situ measurements and studied the proton anisotropies measured by near-Earth spacecraft and STEREO-A. We focused on an isotropic period during the decay phase of the SEP event to compute the proton energy spectrum. We fit the STEREO-A spectrum and compared it to that measured by SOHO and JUICE. Conclusions. The RADEM instrument aboard JUICE is a valuable tool for measuring SEP events in the heliosphere, providing an excellent opportunity to study and characterise the energetic particle environment in the solar wind between 0.65 and 5.2 au. The intercalibration factors between the fluxes measured by STEREO-A and JUICE at the effective energies of 6.9 MeV, 13.3 MeV, 21.6 MeV, and 31.2 MeV are 1.02, 1.23, 1.12, and 0.95 respectively. These intercalibration factors are valid only until 2024 July 10, when the configuration of the RADEM instrument was changed.</description>
