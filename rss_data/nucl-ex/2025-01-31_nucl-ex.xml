      <title>Recent open heavy flavor studies for the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will operate a series of high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($\textit{e + A}$) collisions to study several fundamental questions in the high energy and nuclear physics field. Heavy flavor hadron and jet production at the EIC plays an important role in exploring both potential modification on the initial-state nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs) and final-state parton propagation and hadronization processes under different nuclear medium conditions. The current design of the EIC ePIC detector has good performance of vertex and track reconstruction, particle identification and energy determination in the pseudorapidity region of $-3.5&lt;\eta&lt;3.5$, which will enable a series of high precision heavy flavor hadron and jet measurements. Latest simulation studies of the projected nuclear modification factor $R_{eA}$ of heavy flavor jets and heavy flavor hadron inside jets in $e+p$ and $\textit{e + Au}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 28.6 GeV and 63.2 GeV as well as the projected statistical accuracy of inclusive and differential charm baryon over meson ratio measurements in $e+p$ collisions will be presented. The impacts of these proposed EIC measurements on constraining the heavy quark propagation properties in cold nuclear medium and exploring the heavy quark hadronization process will be discussed.</description>

      <title>$\beta$-delayed neutron spectroscopy of $^{85, 86}$As with MONSTER at IGISOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $\beta$-delayed neutron emission in the $^{85, 86}$As $\beta$-decays has been measured at the Ion Guide Isotope Separator On Line facility of the Accelerator Laboratory of the University of Jyv\"askyl\"a. The complete $\beta$-decays have been studied with a complex setup that consists of a plastic scintillator for $\beta$-particles, MONSTER -- the MOdular Neutron time-of-flight SpectromeTER -- for neutrons, and a high-purity germanium and four LaBr$_3$ crystals for $\gamma$-rays. The $\beta$-delayed neutron energy distributions have been determined by unfolding the time-of-flight spectra with an innovative methodology based on the iterative Bayesian unfolding method and accurate Monte Carlo simulations. The results obtained for $^{85}$As are in excellent agreement with the existing evaluated data, validating the proposed methodology. In the case of $^{86}$As, a stronger neutron intensity at higher energies than previously predicted is discovered.</description>

      <title>Updated analysis of neutron magnetic form factor and the nucleon transverse densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an updated global extraction of the neutron magnetic form factor, including new extractions from $^3$H-$^3$He comparisons at Jefferson Lab. Our new global fit addresses discrepancies between previous data sets at modest momentum transfer by separating the uncertainties from world data into normalization and uncorrelated uncertainties. We use this updated global fit, along with previous fits for the other form factors, to extract the neutron and proton transverse charge and magnetization densities and their uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Object Detection with Deep Learning for Rare Event Search in the GADGET II TPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17892v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the pursuit of identifying rare two-particle events within the GADGET II Time Projection Chamber (TPC), this paper presents a comprehensive approach for leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and various data processing methods. To address the inherent complexities of 3D TPC track reconstructions, the data is expressed in 2D projections and 1D quantities. This approach capitalizes on the diverse data modalities of the TPC, allowing for the efficient representation of the distinct features of the 3D events, with no loss in topology uniqueness. Additionally, it leverages the computational efficiency of 2D CNNs and benefits from the extensive availability of pre-trained models. Given the scarcity of real training data for the rare events of interest, simulated events are used to train the models to detect real events. To account for potential distribution shifts when predominantly depending on simulations, significant perturbations are embedded within the simulations. This produces a broad parameter space that works to account for potential physics parameter and detector response variations and uncertainties. These parameter-varied simulations are used to train sensitive 2D CNN object detectors. When combined with 1D histogram peak detection algorithms, this multi-modal detection framework is highly adept at identifying rare, two-particle events in data taken during experiment 21072 at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), demonstrating a 100% recall for events of interest. We present the methods and outcomes of our investigation and discuss the potential future applications of these techniques.</description>

      <title>The Fermi function and the neutron's lifetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The traditional Fermi function ansatz for nuclear beta decay describes enhanced perturbative effects in the limit of large nuclear charge $Z$ and/or small electron velocity $\beta$. We define and compute the quantum field theory object that replaces this ansatz for neutron beta decay, where neither of these limits hold. We present a new factorization formula that applies in the limit of small electron mass, analyze the components of this formula through two loop order, and resum perturbative corrections that are enhanced by large logarithms. We apply our results to the neutron lifetime, supplying the first two-loop input to the long-distance corrections. Our result can be summarized as \begin{equation*}
  \tau_n \times |V_{ud}|^2\big[1+3\lambda^2\big]\big[1+\Delta_R\big]
  =
  \frac{5263.284(17)\,{\rm s}}
  {1 + 27.04(7)\times 10^{-3} }~, \end{equation*} with $|V_{ud}|$ the up-down quark mixing parameter, $\tau_n$ the neutron's lifetime, $\lambda$ the ratio of axial to vector charge, and $\Delta_R$ the short-distance matching correction. We find a shift in the long-distance radiative corrections compared to previous work, and discuss implications for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$ and tests of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Branching ratio and information entropy for the p+$^{12}$C reaction in the extended-quantum-molecular-dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reactions of p+$^{12}$C with triangular 3$\alpha$ structure and spherical structure with incident energies ranging from 5 to 200 MeV/nucleon are simulated by the in the extended-quantum-molecular-dynamics (EQMD) model together with the GEMINI decay process. This paper presents the incident energy dependence of the branching ratios of fragment production and multiplicity, as well as the associated event information entropy. The results indicate that the triangular 3$\alpha$ $^{12}$C has an extra branching ratio for the quasi-elastic reaction compared to the spherical $^{12}$C. This peculiarity of the branching ratios of the triangular 3$\alpha$ $^{12}$C appears as a small dent in the curves of the event information entropy (both the fragment information entropy and the multiplicity information entropy). Therefore, we propose that the event information entropy could be a probe for detecting the $\alpha$-cluster structure.</description>

      <title>Description of di-hadron saturation signals within a universal nuclear PDF picture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Di-hadron and di-jet correlation measurements in proton-nucleus ($p$+A) and electron--nucleus collisions are widely motivated as sensitive probes of novel, non-linear QCD saturation dynamics in hadrons, which are particularly accessible in the dense nuclear environment at low values of Bjorken-$x$ ($x_\mathrm{A})$. Current measurements at RHIC and the LHC observe a significant suppression in the per-trigger yield at forward rapidities compared to that in proton-proton collisions, nominally consistent with the "mono-jet" production expected in a saturation scenario. However, the width of the azimuthal correlation remains unmodified, in contradiction to the qualitative expectations from this physics picture. I investigate whether the construction of these observables leaves them sensitive to effects from simple nuclear shadowing as captured by, for example, universal nuclear parton distribution function (nPDF) analyses. I find that modern nPDF sets, informed by recent precision measurements sensitive to the shadowing of low-$x_\mathrm{A}$ gluon densities in LHC and other data, can describe all or the majority of the di-hadron/jet suppression effects in $p$+A data at both RHIC and the LHC, while giving a natural explanation for why the azimuthal correlation width is unmodified. Notably, this is achieved via a $(x_\mathrm{A},Q^2)$-differential suppression of overall cross-sections only, without requiring additional physics dynamics which alter the inter-event correlations.</description>

      <title>Measurement of in-medium jet modification using direct photon+jet and $\pi^{0}$+jet correlations in $p+p$ and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 200$ GeV</title>

Abstract: The STAR Collaboration presents measurements of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from energetic direct-photon ($\gamma_{\rm dir}$) and neutral-pion ($\pi^{0}$) triggers in p+p and central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ GeV over a broad kinematic range, for jet resolution parameters $R$=0.2 and 0.5. Medium-induced jet yield suppression is observed to be larger for $R$=0.2 than for 0.5, reflecting the angular range of jet energy redistribution due to quenching. The predictions of model calculations incorporating jet quenching are not fully consistent with the observations. These results provide new insight into the physical origins of jet quenching.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Quadrupole Deformation using E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ Transitions in Heavy Isotopes in the Mass Range of $150&lt;A&lt;250$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09272v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The measurement of a permanent electric dipole moment (EDM) in atoms is crucial for understanding the origins of CP-violation. However, accurate interpretation of the EDM in systems involving deformed isotopes requires the characterization of their deformation. While nuclear deformation is indicated in various structure models, there is substantial mutual disagreement between the theoretical models or between theoretical models and experimental values.
  Nuclear E$2$ transitions allow access to quantify quadrupole deformation, but these transitions are often mixed with M$1$ transitions. Both E$2$ and M$1$ transitions are well characterized by Weisskopf estimates, which rely on a single-particle approximation, but deviate due to collective nuclear deformations. Previously, Weisskopf estimates were only available for the mass range $A&lt;150$, and in this work we have extended the Weisskopf estimates of both E$2$ and M$1$ transition lifetimes to the mass range of $150\le A\le 250$.
  We comprehensively studied the deviation of E$2$ and M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes from the newly established Weisskopf estimates in $91$ candidate isotopes, by comparing the transition lifetimes of the candidate isotopes to their nearest even-even counterparts, whose E$2$ transition strengths are very well understood. Estimates of collective nuclear quadrupole deformation in $67$ of these isotopes were thus obtained, either from E$2$ or M$1+$E$2$ transition lifetimes. In $32$ cases they were obtained from both types of transitions independently, and are mutually consistent, as well as following the trends established in theory. We thereby identify the isotopes $^{223,225}$Fr, $^{221,223}$Ra, $^{223,225,227}$Ac and $^{229}$Pa, where EDM measurements are foreseen and information on nuclear deformation is needed, for which no measurement of nuclear quadrupole deformation has been made.</description>

      <title>Information entropy for central $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions with the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the multiplicity information entropy of hadrons, anti-hadrons, baryons, and net-protons in central \(^{197}\)Au+\(^{197}\)Au collisions with impact parameters of 0$-$3 fm, using the ultrarelativistic quantum molecular dynamics model (UrQMD) across various center-of-mass energies (\(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}\)) from 5.0 to 54.4 GeV. Our simulations employ hydrodynamic modes with different equations of state (EoS) and a default mode without hydrodynamics. The results reveal that the information entropies of baryons and net-protons are sensitive to the selected EoS. In particular, enhancements of the information entropies around \(\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} \sim 30\) GeV, especially with chiral hadron gas and Bag model EoS, indicate a phase transition or critical endpoint behavior. These findings highlight the importance of the EoS in understanding the thermodynamic properties of matter produced in high-energy collisions.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of denoising diffusion probabilistic models for fast and high-fidelity whole-event simulation in high-energy heavy-ion experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01602</link>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs), variational auto-encoders, and normalizing flows, have been widely used and studied as efficient alternatives for traditional scientific simulations. However, they have several drawbacks, including training instability and inability to cover the entire data distribution, especially for regions where data are rare. This is particularly challenging for whole-event, full-detector simulations in high-energy heavy-ion experiments, such as sPHENIX at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider and Large Hadron Collider experiments, where thousands of particles are produced per event and interact with the detector. This work investigates the effectiveness of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) as an AI-based generative surrogate model for the sPHENIX experiment that includes the heavy-ion event generation and response of the entire calorimeter stack. DDPM performance in sPHENIX simulation data is compared with a popular rival, GANs. Results show that both DDPMs and GANs can reproduce the data distribution where the examples are abundant (low-to-medium calorimeter energies). Nonetheless, DDPMs significantly outperform GANs, especially in high-energy regions where data are rare. Additionally, DDPMs exhibit superior stability compared to GANs. The results are consistent between both central and peripheral centrality heavy-ion collision events. Moreover, DDPMs offer a substantial speedup of approximately a factor of 100 compared to the traditional Geant4 simulation method.</description>

Abstract: The proposed Electron-Ion Collider (EIC) will utilize high-luminosity high-energy electron+proton ($e+p$) and electron+nucleus ($e+A$) collisions to solve several fundamental questions including searching for gluon saturation and studying the proton/nuclear structure. Complementary to the ongoing EIC project detector technical prototype carried out by the ePIC collaboration, a Depleted Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (i.e., MALTA2) based fast timing silicon tracking detector (FMT) has been proposed to provide additional hits for track reconstruction in the forward and backward region at the EIC to improve the overall track reconstruction quality. The fast timing resolution of the MALTA2 technology will help reject background events at the EIC as well. Progress of latest MALTA2 R$\&amp;$D, the development of a new MALTA2 quad-sensor prototype module and impacts of the proposed FMT in EIC physics studies will be discussed.</description>
