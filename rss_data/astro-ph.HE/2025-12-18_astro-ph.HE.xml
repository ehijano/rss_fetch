      <title>Super-Eddington Chimneys: On the Cooling Evolution of Tidal Disruption Event Envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of a compact accretion disk following a tidal disruption event (TDE) requires that the shocked stellar debris cool efficiently as it settles toward the black hole. While recent simulations suggest that stream dissipation occurs rapidly, how the weakly bound debris subsequently loses its thermal energy to assemble a compact disk near the circularization radius remains uncertain. We investigate this cooling process using axisymmetric radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of quasi-hydrostatic 'TDE envelopes', initialized with the total mass, angular momentum, and binding energy expected from a complete stellar disruption. The envelopes, supported by radiation pressure on large scales and rotation near the circularization radius, evolve through a combination of radiative diffusion, turbulent mixing, and polar outflows. In our fiducial model, a quasi-steady state is achieved in which a polar outflow radiates and expels matter at several times the Eddington luminosity. This enables the envelope to cool and contract, forming a dense, rotationally supported ring near the circularization radius, but on a timescale roughly ten times shorter than the naive photon-diffusion timescale. Comparative models without radiation transport confirm that cooling, not purely adiabatic evolution, is essential to driving this rapid inflow. Nevertheless, across a range of envelope masses, the effective envelope cooling time scales only weakly with its optical depth, implying that advective and wind-driven energy transport dominate over diffusion. Our results demonstrate the cooling-induced contraction, even absent viscosity and associated black hole accretion, can produce luminosities and large photosphere radii consistent with early UV/optical TDE emission. However, more quantitative light-curve predictions must incorporate self-consistent formation and feeding of the envelope by fall-back accretion.</description>

      <title>Supermassive black-hole imaging with a self-consistent electron-temperature prescription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent 230 GHz observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have resolved the innermost structure of the M87 galaxy, revealing a ring-like feature consistent with thermal synchrotron emission from a magnetized torus surrounding a rotating supermassive black hole. Moreover, Global Millimeter VLBI Array observations at 86 GHz have revealed a larger-scale, edge-brightened jet with clear signatures of non-thermal emission. The theoretical modelling of these observations involves advanced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of magnetized accretion disks around rotating black holes, together with the associated synchrotron emission, which is normally treated with simplified expressions for the electron temperature and assuming a purely thermal distribution. However, an important non-thermal component is expected to be present, making the thermal-emission model not only an approximation, but also a source of degeneracy in the modelling. In view of this, we here present the first application of an ab-initio approach to the electron temperature derived from microscopic simulations of turbulent collisionless plasmas. The novel method, which has no tuneable coefficients and is fully specified by the thermodynamical and magnetic properties of the plasma, provides a better description of the jet morphology and width at 86 GHz, as well as of the broadband spectral emission. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating microscopic plasma physics in black-hole imaging and emphasise the crucial role of magnetic reconnection in electron heating and acceleration processes.</description>

      <title>A milli-Tidal Disruption Event Model for GRB$\;$250702B: Main Sequence Star Disrupted by an IMBH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRB$\;$250702B is the longest GRB recorded so far, with multiple gamma-ray emission episodes spread over a duration exceeding $25\;$ks and a weaker soft X-ray pre-peak $\sim1\;$day gradually rising emission. It is offset from its host galaxy center by $\sim5.7\;$kpc, and displays a long-lived afterglow emission in radio to X-ray. Its true nature is unclear, with the two leading candidate classes of objects being a peculiar type of ultra-long GRB and a tidal disruption event (TDE) by an intermediate mass black hole (IMBH). Here, we consider the latter, mTDE origin. We model the afterglow data, finding a stratified external density profile $\propto r^{-k}$ with $k=1.60\pm0.17$, consistent with Bondi accretion of the interstellar medium (of initial number density $n_{\rm ISM}=n_0\;{\rm cm^{-3}}$ and sound speed $c_s=c_{s,6}10^6\;{\rm cm\,s^{-1}}$) for which $n(r)\approx n_{\rm ISM}(r/R_{\rm B})^{-3/2}$ within the Bondi radius $R_{\rm B}$. Moreover, we use the implied density normalization to infer the IMBH mass within this model, finding $M_\bullet\approx\left(6.55^{+3.51}_{-2.29}\right)\times10^3\,n_0^{-2/3}\,c_{s,6}^{2}(1+\mathcal{M}^2)\;M_\odot$ where $\mathcal{M}\equiv v_{\rm BH}/c_s$ is the IMBH's Mach number relative to the ISM. Together with an upper limit on $M_\bullet&lt;\frac{c^3}{G}\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z} \lesssim5\times10^4\,M_\odot$ from the source-frame minimum variability time $t_{\rm MV,src}\!=\!\frac{t_{\rm MV}}{1+z}\!\approx\!0.5\;$s this implies $v_{\rm BH}\lesssim 28\,n_0^{1/3}\;{\rm km\;s^{-1}}$. We show that a mTDE of a main-sequence star (but not of a white dwarf) can explain the duration and energetics of GRB$\;$250702B. The gradual rise to the peak may be caused by gradual circularization and accretion disk buildup, leading to an increase in the jet's power and Lorentz factor.</description>

      <title>A Very Rich Bimodal Galaxy Cluster Merger: RXC J0032.1+1808</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The galaxy cluster RXC J0032.1+1808 has been well-studied with optical imaging and gravitational lensing mass maps, both of which reveal an elongated morphology in the north-south direction. We find that its X-ray morphology is bimodal, suggesting that it is in the process of merging; combined with a previously reported detection of a radio relic, we suggest that the system is seen after first pericenter. We extract the global X-ray temperature and unabsorbed luminosity from archival XMM-Newton data, finding $T_X=8.5^{+1.1}_{-0.9}$ keV and $L_X=1.04 \pm 0.03 \times 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 90\% confidence in the $0.5$--$10.0$ keV energy range. We conduct a redshift survey of member galaxies and find that the line-of-sight relative velocity between the two subclusters is $76\pm364$ km/s. We use publicly available hydrodynamic simulations to show that it cannot be a head-on merger, that it is observed ${\approx}395$--560 Myr after pericenter, and that the viewing angle must be one that foreshortens the apparent subcluster separation by a factor ${\approx}2$.</description>

      <title>Future Space-based Gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments using millisecond pulsars (MSPs) are beginning to detect nHz gravitational waves (GWs). MSPs are bright GeV gamma-ray emitters, and all-sky monitoring of about 100 MSPs with the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has enabled a gamma-ray Pulsar Timing Array. The GPTA provides a complementary view of nHz GWs because its MSP sample is different, and because the gamma-ray data are immune to plasma propagation effects, have minimal data gaps, and rely on homogeneous instrumentation. To assess GPTA performance for future gamma-ray observatories, we simulated the population of Galactic MSPs and developed a high-fidelity method to predict their gamma-ray spectra. This combination reproduces the properties of the LAT MSP sample, validating it for future population studies. We determined the expected signal from the simulated gamma-ray MSPs for instrument concepts with a wide range of capabilities. We found that the optimal GPTA energy range runs about 0.1 to 5 GeV, but we also examined Compton/MeV instruments. With the caveat that the MSP spectra models are extrapolated beyond observational constraints, we found low signal-to-background ratios, yielding few MSP detections. GeV-band concepts would detect 10$^3$ to 10$^4$ MSPs and achieve GW sensitivity on par with and surpassing the current generation of radio PTAs, reaching the GW self-noise regime. When considering two possible scenarios for the formation of MSPs in the Galactic bulge, the collective signal from which is a potential source of an excess GeV signal observed towards the Galactic center, we find that most of the concepts can both detect this bulge population and distinguish the production channel. In summary, the high discovery potential, strong GW performance, and tremendous synergy with radio PTAs all argue for the pursuit of next-generation gamma-ray pulsar timing.</description>

      <title>GRBs and Relativistic Transients in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relativistic transients such as gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), jetted tidal disruption events, luminous fast blue optical transients, and fast X-ray transients, represent the brightest explosions in the Universe and serve dual roles as laboratories for extreme physics and as cosmic lighthouses probing the earliest epochs of the Universe. The 2040s will bring transformative capabilities: wide-field optical surveys discovering tens of thousands of optical transients nightly, proposed high-energy missions like THESEUS providing 10-100x improved high-energy monitoring, and third-generation gravitational wave detectors identifying $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ compact object mergers annually, many accompanied by relativistic jets. This industrial-scale discovery rate will enable population studies addressing fundamental questions such as jet launching mechanisms, nucleosynthesis, the first stars, and how progenitor environments shape these transients across cosmic time. However, realizing this science requires overcoming a critical bottleneck: these transients evolve on timescales of seconds to days, with their physics encoded in rapidly-changing multi-wavelength signatures demanding immediate spectroscopic characterization down to m ~ 25. Current facilities, optimized for classical/queue scheduling, do not provide the rapid, flexible, multi-target response necessary for industrial-scale follow-up. This white paper demonstrates that without a dedicated large-aperture (10-30 m effective collecting area) time-domain facility with robotic scheduling and optical-NIR spectroscopic capabilities, the transformative potential of relativistic transient science in the 2040s will be considerably limited.</description>

      <title>Irradiation-Driven Formation of Supersoft X-ray Sources Following Classical Novae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supersoft X-ray sources (SSSs) are characterized by persistent thermonuclear burning on the surfaces of white dwarfs (WDs).The standard model requires high mass transfer rates of $\sim 10^{-7}\, {\rm M_{\odot}}\,yr^{-1}$ from massive companions, presenting a theoretical impediment to the observed short-period SSSs, whose orbital periods imply low-mass donors theoretically incapable of sustaining such accretion.To resolve this paradox,we propose and demonstrate through detailed simulations that irradiative feedback following a classical nova (CN) eruption provides a natural formation channel.Through detailed binary evolution simulations with MESA, we reveal that sustained WD irradiation initially from the outburst and subsequently from accretion luminosity triggers significant and stable expansion of the low mass companion.This,in turn,drives mass-transfer rates into the stable hydrogen-burning regime and sustains it beyond $10^4$ years after the initiation of hydrogen burning.This mechanism robustly explains the observed population of short-period SSSs. Moreover,when irradiation-driven mass transfer rate drops below the stable accretion rate,it may lead to the rapid accumulation of sufficient material on shorter time scales to trigger a recurrent nova outburst instead of SSS, thereby also offering an explanation for the origin of short-period recurrent novae.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Interpretation of Fermi-LAT Pulsars: Fundamental-Plane Death Border, Visibility Thresholds, and GeV-TeV Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework that links equatorial-current-sheet (ECS) physics to catalog-lelvel phase-averaged gamma-ray pulsar properties. Guided by analytic scalings and 3D particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations, we show that the pulsar "Fundamental Plane" (relating gamma-ray luminosity, spectral cutoff energy, spin-down power $\dot{\cal{E}}$, and surface magnetic field) is bounded by two regimes: a radiation-reaction-limited branch and a potential-drop-limited branch. Their intersection defines a transition in $\dot{\cal{E}}$ that maps to a gamma-ray visibility threshold on the $P-\dot{P}$ diagram, above which detectability is set by distance and beaming, and below which both cutoff energy and efficiency decline rapidly. Placing ATNF pulsars and McGill magnetars onto these planes reproduces the observed Fermi occupancy, with millisecond pulsars (MSPs) on the observable side, young pulsars (YPs) straddling the threshold, and magnetars clustering at or just below it. At higher $\dot{\cal{E}}$, both MSPs and YPs depart from the maximal radiation-reaction-limited envelope at similar cutoff energies, suggesting that enhanced pair creation screens the accelerating electric field in the ECS. We interpret this behavior with a compactness-based criterion for optically thin $\gamma\gamma$ pair feedback in or near the ECS and briefly note an extension to $\gamma\gamma\rightarrow\mu^\pm$ that could yield pulsed multi-TeV neutrinos in the most energetic systems. The framework predicts an MeV-bright, GeV-faint corridor below current Fermi sensitivity, a target for next-generation MeV missions. Finally, motivated by the recent HESSII detection of pulsed multi-TeV emission from Vela, we use PIC particle distributions with a simple seed-photon model to reproduce a multi-TeV inverse-Compton component alongside the GeV curvature emission, supporting a unified ECS-based GeV-TeV origin.</description>

      <title>Time Evolution of Optical Darkness in GRB Afterglow: The Case of GRB 240825A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to occur in star-forming regions. The multiwavelength follow-up observations of the early afterglow of GRB 240825A provided insights into the evolution of the optical-to-X-ray spectral feature of the afterglow. We comprehensively investigate the evolution of X-ray spectral properties through time-resolved spectral analysis and calculate optical darkness ($\beta_\mathrm{OX}$) to reveal the physical properties of the afterglow. The X-ray-to-optical SEDs of afterglow in different time intervals are fitted to derive the extinction curves. The $\beta_\mathrm{OX}$ exhibits a trend of decreasing and then increasing, reaching its minimum value at $\sim1000\mathrm{\,s}$ post-trigger. However, at 11 hours post-trigger, $\beta_\mathrm{OX}$ does not meet the criteria for an optically dark burst. The extinction curves in different time intervals indicate that GRB 240825A occurred in a dust-obscured environment.</description>

      <title>Magnetised turbulent plasmas as high-energy particle accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This proceedings paper reports on the theoretical modelling of particle acceleration in magnetised turbulent plasmas. It briefly reviews some recent findings obtained from fully kinetic numerical simulations of large-amplitude, semi to fully relativistic turbulence. The paper then argues that these findings can be understood within the framework of a ``generalised Fermi'' picture of stochastic acceleration, which it summarises. The dominant contributions to acceleration appear to arise from particle interactions with sharp, dynamic bends of the magnetic field lines and regions of velocity compression. Interestingly, the acceleration rate is spatially inhomogeneous and its probability distribution follows a broken power law extending up to large values. This makes relativistic, large-amplitude turbulence an extreme particle accelerator. Some implications for particle transport and the shape of the particle energy spectrum in the presence of radiative losses and over long timescales are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Prospects on detection of the Fermi Bubbles with CTAO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2010, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope observed two gamma-ray emitting structures, the Fermi Bubbles (FBs), that extend up to 55{\deg} above and below the Galactic plane and that seem to emanate from the Galactic center region. Although the spectrum at latitudes |b| &gt; 10{\deg} has a softening or a cutoff around 100 GeV, the one at the base of the FBs, |b| &lt;10{\deg}, extends up to about 1 TeV without a significant cutoff in the Fermi LAT data. The mechanism behind the FBs production is currently under debate. More observations of the FBs at different energies are required to improve our understanding of their origin.
  Recently, H.E.S.S. and HAWC observatory have set upper limits on the FBs. In this work, we assess the sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) using the "alpha configuration" in the South site to detect the FBs and investigate the optimal strategies for their detection at low latitudes. We simulate the observations using the official CTAO science tool gammapy, considering several benchmark models for the FBs and the interstellar emission and test different observational strategies taking advantage of the proposed CTAO consortium surveys. We use these simulations to estimate the CTAO sensitivity to the FBs.</description>

      <title>Hadronic Clues in Quasars Caught by Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores whether hadronic processes could be responsible for the high-energy emission seen in quasars identified by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) instrument aboard the Fermi satellite. In contrast to purely leptonic models, this work investigates whether hadronic mechanisms can explain the observed gamma-ray spectra by analyzing the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of a chosen sample of FSRQs (Flat-Spectrum Radio Quasars). By incorporating both hadronic and leptonic components into their multi-wavelength modeling, we evaluate the model's feasibility to simultaneously describe the data collected by Fermi-LAT and neutrinos detected by IceCube. According to the results, a hadronic contribution would be required to explain the SED of quasars detected by Fermi-LAT. However, their contribution to the neutrino flux detected by IceCube remains understated.</description>

      <title>Serendipitous and targeted mm/sub-mm transient searches with wide-FOV telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The millimeter/sub-millimeter (mm/sub-mm) sky remains a rich but under-explored frontier for transient and variable phenomena. A wide-field, high-sensitivity instrument with a large aperture and degree-scale field of view would open this regime, enabling both systematic survey monitoring and rapid-response follow-up. Key science opportunities include Galactic Plane monitoring and surveys to discover and characterize time-variable emission from young stellar objects, magnetically active and flaring stars, compact binaries, and explosive events, as well as prompt responses to multi-messenger alerts with large localization regions (e.g., gravitational-wave triggers). Multi-band capability, rapid slewing, and high sensitivity are essential to probe energetic processes such as jet launching, relativistic shocks and accretion flows in unprecedented detail. While long-term monitoring is well established at radio and optical/infrared wavelengths, mm/sub-mm observations uniquely bridge the spectral gap between these regimes, directly probing obscured environments that are inaccessible elsewhere. Large-scale monitoring programs will yield legacy datasets crucial for population studies through the 2040s and beyond.</description>

      <title>Achromatic, spin-odd Kerr EVPA as a null Frenet--Serret torsion integral on the photon ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the achromatic gravitational imprint that Kerr spacetime leaves on linear polarization at the photon ring. Recasting parallel transport in a null Frenet--Serret frame yields a single scalar evolution law for the electric-vector position angle. On the observer's screen, the Kerr-minus-Schwarzschild pattern on the direct critical curve is nonzero, strictly odd under spin reversal after a half-turn azimuth relabelling, and tightly confined to a thin annulus. Using backward-shot, Carter-separated geodesics with midpoint RK2 transport, we achieve second-order convergence and degree-scale amplitudes that grow monotonically with spin and inclination (RMS $\simeq 0.5$--$2^\circ$ for $a/M\gtrsim 0.8$, $i\gtrsim 60^\circ$). Three independent constructions -- Frenet--Serret line integral, explicit Levi--Civita transport of the polarization vector, and the phase of the Walker--Penrose constant -- agree ray by ray. We then define a parity-odd ring estimator that is intrinsically achromatic after standard wavelength-squared regression, symmetry-protected against common even-parity systematics, and compressed into low azimuthal modes. This yields a minimal two-parameter template (spin and inclination) for mm/sub-mm polarimetry of horizon-scale rings in sources such as M87$^\ast$ and Sgr~A$^\ast$. The pipeline enables either a detection of the strong-field parallel-transport phase induced by frame dragging or informative upper limits.</description>

      <title>White Dwarf Binaries: Probes of Future Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: White dwarf binaries are fundamental astrophysical probes. They represent ideal laboratories to test the models of binary evolution, which also apply to the sources of gravitational waves, whose detection led to the award of the 2017 Nobel Prize in Physics. Moreover, their final fate is intimately linked to Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia), i.e. the thermonuclear explosion of a white dwarf following the interaction with a companion star, which have become the fundamental yardsticks on cosmological distance scales and led to the discovery of dark energy and the award of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics. Finally, white dwarf binaries play a crucial role in influencing star formation and chemical evolution of the Galaxy by injecting energy into, and enriching, the interstellar medium with material ejected during nova eruptions and SN Ia explosions. In the next decade, the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) at the Vera Rubin Observatory will lead to the discovery of hundreds of thousands of white dwarf binaries. Nonetheless, the intrinsic faintness of the majority of these systems will prevent their spectroscopic characterisation with the instruments available in the 2030s. Hence ESO's Expanding Horizons call is timely for planning a future transformative facility, capable of delivering phase-resolved spectroscopic observations of faint white dwarf binaries, which are key to advancing our understanding of stellar and Galactic evolution and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Dynamical binary interactions in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical binary interactions such as common envelope (CE) evolution or stellar mergers are a critical phase in the formation of a wide variety of binary phenomena, ranging from blue stragglers to type I supernovae (of all flavours, a, b and c), $\gamma$-ray bursts to bipolar planetary nebulae, Thorne-Zytkow objects to X-ray binaries. In 2040s, the urgency of resolving long-standing questions regarding the physics behind the dynamical interaction stages and the absolute and relative frequencies of binary evolutionary pathways will only increase owing to rapidly expanding population statistics of gravitational wave events. Here, we argue that multi-wavelength observations (spectroscopy and photometry), linear spectropolarimetry, and interferometry of a large number of Luminous Red Novae, a particular class of transients associated with dynamical binary interactions, will provide unprecedented details about the underlying interaction physics. A breakthrough will be achieved by a tenfold or larger increase in identifications of transient-type events from interacting binaries and their follow-up with instrumentation that provides at least 10 times better angular resolution, 100 times better spectral resolution, and $\sim$100 times higher sensitivity than 2030s facilities.</description>

      <title>FrankenStat I: a New Approach to Pulsar Timing Array Data Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2023, after more than two decades of searching, pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations around the world announced evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background. It was quickly followed by work from the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA), demonstrating that the results of regional collaborations were consistent with each other. The combination of these datasets is still ongoing and represents a significant investment of time and expertise.
  In that IPTA comparison, authors of this letter combined the separate datasets in the standard PTA optimal detection statistic for cross-correlations incoherently, that is, the data was combined without fitting a merged timing model across all PTA datasets, treating datasets of the same pulsar as independent, and neglecting the "same pulsar, different datasets" cross-correlations. This work refines that method by extending its core ideas beyond detection statistics and into a full, general data-combination method. We have demonstrated its efficacy and extreme efficiency on simulated data. This new method, \textit{FrankenStat}, is very similar in sensitivity and parameter-constraining power to traditional data combination methods while completing the full data combination in just a few minutes.</description>

      <title>Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients in the 2040s</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminous Fast Blue Optical Transients (LFBOTs) are a class of extragalactic transient of uncertain origin. Several hypotheses have been put forward which could feasibly be consistent with the sample number of events discovered thus far, including tidal disruption events around intermediate mass black holes, failed supernovae and mergers of stars with black holes. Whatever their origin, it is clear that better understanding LFBOTs will provide unique insight into the black hole formation/growth, central engine physics and transient-host galaxy interactions - themes which are expected to drive research in transient astronomy over the coming decades. The vast majority of LFBOTs are missed by current photometric surveys, or not efficiently selected for detailed follow-up. This white paper outlines the observing capabilities required on a 2040 timescale to maximise the discovery potential from these enigmatic events.</description>

      <title>Compact Stars as Portals to Extra-Dimensional Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate hydrostatic configurations of asymmetric dark matter (DM) spheres in scenarios where fermionic DM can propagate into extra spatial dimensions, while Standard Model fields remain confined to ordinary three dimensions. As the number of extra dimensions increases, the effective equation of state for non-relativistic matter softens, making even modest DM accumulation inside neutron stars susceptible to gravitational collapse into extra-dimensional black holes. These black holes are longer lived than their $3$ dimensional counterparts and can accrete enough material to consume an entire neutron star, ultimately producing solar-mass black holes. For geometric cross sections, DM with masses above $\mathcal{O}(10\,{\rm TeV})$ may already be excluded for more than two extra dimensions of size ${\mathcal{O}(\rm fm})$ -- sharply contrasting with the standard $3$ dimensional case, where comparable limits only appear for masses $\gtrsim 10^{5}$ TeV at typical halo densities of $0.3\, \rm{GeV/cm^3}$.</description>

      <title>Non-Thermal Production of Sexaquark Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard thermal freeze-out scenarios with QCD-scale interaction rates predict a $uuddss$ sexaquark relic abundance many orders of magnitude below the observed dark matter density, representing a key challenge for sexaquark dark matter models. Additionally, if the maximum post-inflationary temperature never exceeds the QCD confinement scale, the usual thermal/chemical-equilibrium production of the sexaquark near ${T \sim T_{\rm QCD} \simeq 150 \text{-} 170~\mathrm{MeV}}$ never occurs. In this work we show that non-thermal mechanisms can naturally overcome this obstacle. Using late-decaying reheatons as a representative case (while noting the broader applicability), we demonstrate that the final abundance is determined by two quantities: the branching fraction into strange-quark-rich matter and the coalescence probability into sexaquarks during the matter-dominated or early radiation-dominated epoch. We provide compact expressions and benchmark calculations for reheating temperatures $T_R \in [10, 100]~\mathrm{MeV}$ and reheaton masses above the QCD confinement scale. Unlike the predictive but unsuccessful thermal scenario, non-thermal production is sensitive to injection microphysics, coalescence efficiency, and residual entropy dilution. We delineate the viable parameter space, evaluate collider and precision constraints on representative reheaton models, and derive indirect detection bounds on residual antisexaquark populations. Our results establish non-thermal production as a viable pathway to sexaquark dark matter and highlight broader implications for non-equilibrium mechanisms in the early universe.</description>

      <title>The diffusion coefficient in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is the largest satellite galaxy of the Milky Way and provides a unique laboratory for high-energy astrophysics and dark matter studies. In this work, we develop an end-to-end numerical description of cosmic-ray transport and the associated non-thermal emission in the LMC, extending the public DRAGON and HERMES codes. Within this framework, we compute the diffuse synchrotron radiation produced by cosmic-ray electrons in the LMC and compare our predictions with observed low-frequency radio maps. Because electron diffusion imprints a characteristic morphology on the radio emission, this comparison allows us to infer the effective average diffusion coefficient in the LMC. We find a diffusion coefficient D0 = (3-6) $\times 10^{28} \; \rm{cm}^2 \; \rm{s}^{-1}$ at 1 GeV, comparable to but slightly larger than values typically inferred for the Milky Way. More generally, this work provides a scalable tool for interpreting non-thermal signals in nearby galaxies and constraining their cosmic-ray transport properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gamma-Ray and AntiMatter Survey (GRAMS) is a next-generation experiment using a Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) detector to measure MeV gamma rays and antiparticles. MeV gamma-ray observations are important for understanding multi-messenger and time-domain astronomy, enabling exploration of the universe's most potent events, such as supernovae and neutron star mergers. Despite the significance of MeV gamma-rays, GRAMS could also explore the so-called 'MeV gap' region to improve MeV gamma-ray measurement sensitivity that was restricted by the challenge of accurately reconstructing Compton events. Aside from gamma-ray detection, the GRAMS proposed method also serves as an antiparticle spectrometer, targeting the low-energy range of cosmic antinuclei measurements. This work will provide updates on the current status and progress towards the prototype balloon flight with a small-scale LArTPC (pGRAMS) scheduled for early 2026, as well as the recent progress on antihelium-3 sensitivity calculation.</description>

      <title>XRISM view of a stellar flare: High-resolution Fe K spectra of HR 1099, an RS CVn-type star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic observation was made of the RS CVn-type binary star HR 1099 using the Resolve instrument onboard XRISM for its calibration purposes. During the $\sim$400 ks telescope time covering 1.5 binary orbit, a flare lasting for $\sim$100 ks was observed with a released X-ray radiation energy of $\sim 10^{34}$ erg, making it the first stellar flare ever observed with an X-ray microcalorimeter spectrometer. The flare peak count rate is 6.4 times higher than that in quiescence and is distinguished clearly in time thanks to the long telescope time. Many emission lines were detected in the 1.7--10 keV range both in the flare and quiescent phases. Using the high spectral resolution of Resolve in the Fe K band (6.5--7.0 keV), we resolved the inner-shell lines of Fe XIX--XXIV as well as the outer-shell lines of Fe XXV--XXVI. These lines have peaks in the contribution functions at different temperatures over a wide range, allowing us to construct the differential emission measure (DEM) distribution over the electron temperature of 1--10 keV (roughly 10--100 MK) based only on Fe lines, thus without an assumption of the elemental abundance. The reconstructed DEM has a bimodal distribution, and only the hotter component increased during the flare. The elemental abundance was derived based on the DEM distribution thus constructed. A significant abundance increase was observed during the flare for Ca and Fe, which are some of the elements with the lowest first ionization potential among those analyzed, but not for Si, S, and Ar. This behavior is seen in some giant solar flares and the present result is a clear example in stellar flares.</description>

Abstract: We investigate quartically self-interacting massive boson stars by constructing equilibrium sequences and performing dynamical evolutions. The mass curve $M(|\phi_c|)$ along these sequences develops multiple extrema, yet stability changes only at the first maximum; configurations beyond it become highly compact and collapse under numerically induced perturbations, with near-critical models displaying a short-lived double-dive behaviour. Head-on collisions of equal-mass stars yield three distinct outcomes - boson star remnants, black hole formation at contact, and collapse of each star to a black hole prior to contact. The associated gravitational-wave energies reflect the competition between increasing compactness and decreasing tidal deformability, and at large self-interaction strengths the collapse-before-contact branch exhibits a pronounced non-monotonic structure. The simulations reported here constitute a substantial catalogue of initial conditions and waveforms, providing a natural basis for neural-network techniques aimed at improving boson star initial data and constructing surrogate models capable of rapidly predicting gravitational-wave signals across an extended parameter space.</description>

      <title>BBNet: accurate neural network emulator for primordial light element abundances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Big-Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) predictions of primordial light-element abundances offer a powerful probe of early-Universe physics. However, high-accuracy numerical BBN calculations have become a major computational bottleneck for large-scale cosmological inferences due to the complex nuclear network. Here we present BBNet, a fast and accurate deep learning emulator for primordial abundances. The training data are generated by full numerical calculations using two public BBN codes, PArthENoPE and AlterBBN, modified to accommodate extended cosmologies that include dark radiation and a stiff equation of state. The network employs a residual multi-head architecture to capture convoluted physical relationships. BBNet produces primordial helium-4 and deuterium abundances with negligible errors in milliseconds per sample, achieving a speed-up of up to $10^4$ times relative to first-principles solvers while remaining unbiased over wide parameter ranges. Therefore, our emulator can supersede traditional simplified numerical prescriptions that compromise accuracy for speed. Based on extensive assessments of its performance, we conclude that BBNet is an optimal solution to the theoretical prediction of primordial element abundances. It will serve as a reliable tool for precision cosmology and new-physics searches.</description>

      <title>Searching for Pseudo-Dirac neutrinos from Astrophysical sources in IceCube data</title>

Abstract: We analyze IceCube public data from its IC86 configuration, namely PSTracks event selection, to search for pseudo-Dirac signatures in high-energy neutrinos from astrophysical sources. Neutrino flux from astrophysical sources is reduced in the pseudo-Dirac scenario due to the conversion of active-to-sterile neutrinos as compared to the neutrino oscillation scenario of only three active neutrinos over astrophysical distances. We fit IceCube data using astrophysical flux models for four point-like sources in both scenarios and constrain the active-sterile mass-square-difference in the absence of any evidence for the pseudo-Dirac scenario. We present the exclusion regions for the common mass-squared difference $\delta m^2$, inducing active-sterile oscillations, for all three neutrino flavors. This includes results from individual sources as well as from a stacking analysis that combines data from the four sources. Our findings indicate that the exclusion region is $\delta m^2 \in [2.1\times 10^{-21} - 2.0\times 10^{-16}]$ eV$^2$ with $\ge 90\%$ confidence level (CL) significance for neutrino energies ranging from 0.5 TeV to 1 PeV. When we extend the energy range down to 0.1 TeV, the exclusion region broadens to $\delta m^2 \in [1.1 \times 10^{-21} - 3.0\times 10^{-16}]$ eV$^2$ at $\ge 90\%$ CL.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Local Void: A data-driven search for the origins of the Amaterasu particle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16483v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a simulation-based inference framework to constrain the origins of individual ultra-high-energy cosmic rays by combining realistic three-dimensional propagation modeling with Bayesian parameter estimation. Our method integrates CRPropa 3 simulations, including all relevant interactions and magnetic deflections in both Galactic and extra-Galactic fields, with Approximate Bayesian Computation to infer posterior distributions over key parameters such as source position, distance, energy, and magnetic field properties. This approach allows joint constraints from the observed energy and arrival direction to be applied simultaneously, naturally incorporating their correlations in addition to relevant modelling uncertainties. We demonstrate our method by applying it to the Amaterasu particle detected by the Telescope Array observatory, the second-highest-energy cosmic ray ever detected. The resulting posterior distributions quantify the regions of space consistent with its reconstructed properties under different energy and composition assumptions, revealing a broader set of nearby source candidates than found in previous analyses. This application highlights the framework's ability to translate individual UHECR observations into directly interpretable source constraints and provides a foundation for future simulation-based analyses of cosmic rays at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Seeking Spinning Subpopulations of Black Hole Binaries via Iterative Density Estimation</title>

Abstract: Attempts to understand the formation of binary black hole (BBH) systems detected via gravitational wave (GW) emission are affected by many unknowns and uncertainties, from both the observational and theoretical (astrophysical modelling) sides. Binary component spins have been proposed as a means to investigate formation channels, however obtaining clear inferences is challenging, given the apparently low magnitude of almost all merging BH spins and their high measurement uncertainties. Even for the effective aligned spin $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ which is more precisely measured than component spins, specific model assumptions have been required to identify any clear trends. Here, we reconstruct the joint component mass and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ distribution of BBH mergers with minimal assumptions using the GWTC-3 catalog, using an iterative kernel density estimation (KDE)-based method. We reproduce some features seen in previous analyses, for instance a small but preferentially positive $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ for low-mass mergers; we also identify a possible subpopulation of higher-spin BBH with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}|$ up to $\sim\! 0.75$ for primary masses $m_1 \gtrsim 40\,M_\odot$, in addition to the bulk of the distribution with $|\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}| \lesssim 0.2$. This finding is consistent with previous studies indicating a broader spin distribution at high mass, suggesting a distinct origin for the high-spin systems. We also identify a new potential trend of low-mass BBHs: the \emph{derivative} of $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$ with respect to $m_1$ ($m_2$) is positive (negative) over the $10$--$15\,M_\odot$ range. This apparent structure may be related to} a previously reported anticorrelation between mass ratio and $\chi_{\mathrm{eff}}$.</description>

      <title>Multi-GeV Fermi-LAT Detection of PSR B1259-63</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10037v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSR B1259-63/LS 2883 is a classical gamma-ray binary detected from radio to TeV energies near periastron. Using over 17 years of Fermi-LAT observations, we report the first significant detection ($8\sigma$ in likelihood analysis) of the system in the 10-100 GeV energy range, over orbital phases from -400 to +100 days relative to periastron. The observed spectrum is well described by a power law with photon index $\Gamma = 1.9 \pm 0.1$ and shows a flux level consistent with that measured at TeV energies by H.E.S.S. The smooth connection between the Fermi-LAT and TeV spectra suggests that the detected multi-GeV emission traces the rising tail of the inverse-Compton component extending into the TeV regime. The presence of detectable emission hundreds of days before periastron indicates high-energy activity over a larger orbital phase range than previously established, enabling new constraints on particle-acceleration and radiative processes in the system.</description>

      <title>Origin of Pulsed Radio Emission from Magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extended periods of radio pulsations have been observed for six magnetars, displaying characteristics different from those of ordinary pulsars. In this Letter, we argue that radio emission is generated in a closed, twisted magnetic flux bundle originating near the magnetic pole and extending beyond 100 km from the magnetar. The electron-positron flow in the twisted bundle has to carry electric current and, at the same time, experiences a strong drag by the radiation field of the magnetar. This combination forces the plasma into a ``radiatively locked'' state with a sustained two-stream instability, generating radio emission. We demonstrate this mechanism using novel first-principles simulations that follow the plasma behavior by solving the relativistic Vlasov equation with the discontinuous Galerkin method. First, using one-dimensional simulations, we demonstrate how radiative drag induces the two-stream instability, sustaining turbulent electric fields. When extended to two dimensions, the system produces electromagnetic waves, including superluminal modes capable of escaping the magnetosphere. We measure their frequency and emitted power, and incorporate the local simulation results into a global magnetospheric model. The model explains key features of observed radio emission from magnetars: its appearance after an X-ray outburst, wide pulse profiles, luminosities $\sim 10^{30}{\rm{erg/s}}$, and a broad range of frequencies extending up to $\sim 100\, \mathrm{GHz}$.</description>

      <title>Radio emission from beyond the light cylinder in millisecond pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A striking aspect of the radio profiles of many millisecond pulsars (MSPs) is that they consist of components separated from each other by regions lacking in emission. We devise a technique for determining "disjoint" from "contiguous" components and show that 35% of MSPs have disjoint components as opposed to only 3% of the slow pulsar population. We surmise that the pulsars with these disjoint components show evidence for both emission above the polar cap and from the current sheet beyond the light cylinder (LC), co-located with gamma-ray emission. For some of the radio MSPs only the LC emission is being observed. It is our contention that almost all of the current population of gamma-ray MSPs show evidence for co-located radio emission. A simple geometric explanation allows the presence (or not) of LC emission and the relationship (or not) between the gamma-ray and radio profiles to be determined. The LC components have frequently very high polarization and typically flat position-angle traverses thus helping to explain the difficulties in determining the geometry of MSPs. In cases where the geometry can be determined the values broadly align with expectations. In this picture, the number of potentially detectable radio MSPs is higher than previously thought, although the actual detectability of LC components depends on their luminosity function. A mechanism is required to produce coherent radio emission far from the stellar surface. These ideas have implications for our understanding of the populations of radio-loud and radio-quiet rotation-powered millisecond pulsars, and may have implications for the long-term timing stability of some of these sources.</description>

      <title>AT2025ulz and S250818k: zooming in with the Hubble Space Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AT2025ulz is an optical/near-infrared transient discovered during follow-up of the candidate gravitational wave (GW) event S250818k. Its young age ($\lesssim$1 d), rapid decline and strong color evolution over the first 48 hr classify it as a potential kilonova candidate. In this work, we present the results of our observing campaign, carried out with the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) and the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Although the early time evolution of AT2025ulz resembles some aspects of a kilonova, its rapid onset ($\sim$3 hr after the GW trigger) and luminosity (a factor of $\sim5$ brighter than AT2017gfo in $g$-band) are difficult to reproduce. Only a small subset of our kilonova models matches its multi-color light curve, and the inferred ejecta mass is uncomfortably large given the low chirp mass ($\lesssim\!0.87\!$ M$_{\odot}$) of the GW candidate. HST observations place the transient within a nearby ($z=0.08489$) spiral galaxy with on-going star-formation and measure a color ($F336W-F160W\!\approx\!1.4$ mag) that is too blue to match with a kilonova. Our data support the classification of AT2025ulz as a supernova, initially undergoing a shock-cooling phase and later entering its photospheric phase, and spectroscopically identified via its broad absorption features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how the large-scale heliosphere alters the arrival directions of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons and ask if and when this "heliospheric lens" can be ignored for anisotropy and source-association studies - an especially timely topic given, for instance, the persistent cosmic-ray positron fraction and its unknown origin. Using a modular back-tracing framework, we explore a set of widely used magnetic-field descriptions-from a Parker spiral baseline to more structured configurations that include latitudinal wind contrasts, Smith-Bieber-type azimuthal strengthening, and tilted or wavy heliospheric current sheets. We model the deterministic deflections of high-energy cosmic-ray electrons and positrons (CREs) induced by large-scale heliospheric magnetic-field structures using a back-tracing approach. Our results apply to CREs above tens of GeV, where diffusion, convection, and adiabatic energy losses play a subdominant role; these processes are neglected in the present study and will be addressed in future work. Across these models the picture is consistent: most bending is accumulated within the inner tens of astronomical units and decreases rapidly with energy. Field choices and solar-cycle geometry set the overall normalization, with stronger spiral winding or a more highly tilted current sheet producing larger deflections at the same energy. Differences between electrons and positrons are most apparent at lower energies, where drift histories and current-sheet encounters diverge, and become increasingly small at multi-TeV energies.

      <description>arXiv:2511.23426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), among the most compelling astrophysical phenomena, are potential candidates for exploring the evolution of energy distribution among magnetic fields and particles through multiwavelength observations. The fraction of energy transferred between particles and the magnetic field is governed by microphysical parameters, typically assumed to be constant during relativistic shocks but may in fact vary with time. In this work, we derive the light curves and closure relations (CRs) of the synchrotron-self Compton (SSC) process from the external reverse shock (RS) with variations of microphysical parameters in a homogeneous and stellar-wind medium. We consider the evolution of the RS in the thick- and thin-shell regimes. We demonstrate that, depending on the microphysical parameters, this process can mimic plateau phases and produce temporal decay indices steeper than those predicted by high-latitude emission alone. The current model is employed to examine the evolution of the spectral and temporal indices of GRBs reported in the Second Fermi-LAT Gamma-ray Burst Catalog (2FLGC) and bursts detected at very high energies, using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations.</description>

      <title>Redshift Classification of Optical Gamma-Ray Bursts using Supervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13038v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are among the most luminous explosions in the Universe and serve as powerful probes of the early cosmos. However, the rapid fading of their afterglows and the scarcity of spectroscopic measurements make photometric classification crucial for timely high-redshift identification. We present an ensemble machine learning framework for redshift classification of GRBs based solely on their optical plateau and prompt emission properties. Our dataset comprises 171 long GRBs observed by the Swift UVOT and more than 450 ground-based telescopes. The analysis pipeline integrates robust statistical techniques, including M-estimator outlier rejection, multivariate imputation using Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations, and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator feature selection, followed by a SuperLearner ensemble combining parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric algorithms. The optimal model, trained on raw optical data with outlier removal at a redshift threshold of z equals 2.0, achieves a true positive rate of 74 percent and an area under the curve of 0.84, maintaining balanced generalization between training and test sets. At higher thresholds, such as z equals 3.0, the classifier sustains strong discriminative power with an area under the curve of 0.88. Validation on an independent GRB sample yields 97 percent overall accuracy, perfect specificity, and an ensemble area under the curve of 0.93. Compared to previous prompt- and X-ray-based classifiers, our optical framework offers enhanced sensitivity to high-redshift events, improved robustness against data incompleteness, and greater applicability to ground-based follow-up. We also publicly release a web application that enables real-time redshift classification, facilitating rapid identification of candidate high-redshift GRBs for cosmological studies.</description>

      <title>Measuring the Lense-Thirring Orbital Precession and the Neutron Star Moment of Inertia with Pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NSs) are compact objects that host the densest forms of matter in the observable universe, providing unique opportunities to study the behaviour of matter at extreme densities. While precision measurements of NS masses through pulsar timing have imposed effective constraints on the equation of state (EoS) of dense matter, accurately determining the radius or moment of inertia (MoI) of a NS remains a major challenge. This article presents a detailed review on measuring the Lense-Thirring (LT) precession effect in the orbit of binary pulsars, which would give access to the MoI of NSs and offer further constraints on the EoS. We discuss the suitability of certain classes of binary pulsars for measuring the LT precession from the perspective of binary star evolution, and highlight five pulsars that exhibit properties promising to realise these goals in the near future. Finally, discoveries of compact binaries with shorter orbital periods hold the potential to greatly enhance measurements of the MoI of NSs. The MoI measurements of binary pulsars are pivotal to advancing our understanding of matter at supranuclear densities as well as improving the precision of gravity tests, such as the orbital decay due to gravitational wave emission and of tests of alternative gravity theories.</description>

      <title>Stronger Constraints on Primordial Black Holes as Dark Matter Derived from the Thermal Evolution of the Intergalactic Medium over the Last Twelve Billion Years</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) have been explored as potential dark matter candidates, with various astrophysical observations placing upper limits on the fraction $f_\mathrm{PBH}$ of dark matter in the form of PBHs. However, a largely underutilized probe of PBH abundance is the temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM), inferred from the thermal broadening of absorption lines in the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest of quasar spectra. PBHs inject energy into the IGM via Hawking radiation, altering its thermal evolution. In this work, we constrain this energy injection by self-consistently modeling its interplay with the cosmological ultraviolet background from galaxies and supermassive black holes. Leveraging IGM temperature measurements spanning the past twelve billion years ($z \sim 0$ to $6$), we derive one of the most stringent constraints on PBH-induced heating from light PBHs within the mass range $10^{15}$-$10^{17}$ g. Specifically, for $M_\mathrm{PBH} = 10^{16}$ g, we find $f_\mathrm{PBH} &lt; 5 \times 10^{-5}$ at 95\% confidence, with the bound scaling approximately as $M_\mathrm{PBH}^{4}$ at other masses. Our inclusion of helium reionization and low-redshift temperature measurements strengthens previous IGM-based PBH constraints by an order of magnitude or more. Compared to other existing limits, our result is among the strongest, second only to the constraints from the 511 keV line from the Galactic Center, but with distinct systematics. More broadly, this study highlights the IGM thermal history as a powerful and independent probe of beyond-standard model physics.</description>

      <title>Probing the Firn Refractive Index Profile Using Antenna Response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Radio Neutrino Observatory-Greenland (RNO-G, at Summit Station) experiment comprises an extensive fat-dipole antenna array deployed into ice boreholes over an eventual area of approximately 35 ${\rm km}^2$. Since the RNO-G experimental sensitivity depends on the radio-frequency properties of the firn, which are known to vary laterally on sub-km distance scales and vertically on sub-meter distance scales, a technique for quickly extracting information on firn ice properties with depth ($n(z)$) during drilling and deployment is desirable. Given that a dipole's resonant wavelength is fixed by geometry, the resonant frequency $f_{res}$ (measured as an S-parameter reflection coefficient [`$S_{11}$'] minimum) scales inversely with the local refractive index, allowing a translation of a depth-dependent $S_{11}$(z) profile into $n(z)$. $S_{11}$(z) data were initially taken in August, 2024 using a dipole lowered into a newly-drilled $98\pm 1$-mm diameter, 350-m deep borehole at Summit Station, Greenland, approximately 1 km from the site of the original GISP-2 core; improved measurements were subsequently made in May, 2025. We conclude that $S_{11}$(z) data can be used to estimate \RIP, on 50 cm vertical scales, at the per-cent level of accuracy required by experiments such as RN0-G.</description>

      <title>Rapid formation of a very massive star &gt;50000 $M_\odot$ and subsequently an IMBH from runaway collisions. Direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$.
  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.
  Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement.
  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH.
  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Learning to detect continuous gravitational waves: an open data-analysis competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06445v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report results of a public data-analysis challenge, hosted on the open data-science platform Kaggle, to detect simulated continuous gravitational-wave signals (CWs). These are weak signals from rapidly spinning neutron stars that remain undetected despite extensive searches. The competition dataset consisted of a population of CW signals using both simulated and real LIGO detector data matching the conditions of actual CW searches. The competition attracted more than 1,000 participants to develop realistic CW search algorithms. We describe the top 10 approaches and discuss their applicability as a pre-processing step compared to standard CW-search approaches. For the competition's dataset, we find that top approaches can reduce the computing cost by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude at a false-dismissal probability comparable to standard CW searches. Additionally, the competition drove the development of new GPU-accelerated detection pipelines, which facilitated their adoption in other areas of gravitational-wave data analysis. We release the associated dataset, which constitutes the first open standardized benchmark for CW detection, to enable reproducible method comparisons and to encourage further developments toward the first detection of these elusive signals.</description>

      <title>SN 2024aecx: Double-Peaked Light Curves and Rapid Evolution in a Nearby Type IIb Supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 2024aecx is a nearby ($\sim$11 Mpc) Type IIb SN discovered within $\sim$1 d after explosion. In this paper we report high-cadence photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations, conducted from as early as 0.27 d post discovery out to the nebular phase at 158.4 d. We analyze the environment of SN 2024aecx and derive a new distance, metallicity and host extinction. The light curve exhibits a hot and luminous shock-cooling peak at the first few days, followed by a main peak with very rapid post-maximum decline. The earliest spectra are blue and featureless, while from 2.3 d after discovery prominent P-Cygni profiles emerge. At nebular phase, the emission lines exhibit asymmetric and double-peaked profiles, indicating asphericity and/or early dust formation in the ejecta. We simulated the progenitor and explosion using a two-component model of shock cooling and radioactive $^{56}$Ni heating; our model favors an extended, low-mass H-rich envelope with$ M_{\mathrm{e}} = 0.08^{+0.02}_{-0.03}\, M_{\odot} $ and a low ejecta mass of $ M_{\mathrm{ej}} = 2.65^{+1.21}_{-0.73} \, M_{\odot}. $The comprehensive monitoring of SN 2024aecx, coupled with the detailed characterization of its local environment, establishes it as a benchmark event for probing the progenitors and explosion mechanisms of Type IIb SNe.</description>
