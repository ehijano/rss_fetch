      <title>Isomorphisms of Tits--Kantor--Koecher Lie algebras of JB*-triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterise the isomorphisms of Tits--Kantor--Koecher Lie algebras of JB*-triples as a class of surjective linear isometries and show how these algebras form a category equivalent to that of JB*-triples. We introduce the concepts of tripotent, and orthogonality and order amongst tripotents for Tits--Kantor--Koecher Lie algebras. This leads to showing that a graded or negatively graded order isomorphism between certain subsets of tripotents of two Tits--Kantor--Koecher Lie algebras of atomic JB*-triples, which commutes with involutions, preserves orthogonality and is continuous at a non-zero tripotent of a specific type, can be extended as a real-linear isomorphism between the algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On normed vector spaces there is a well-known connection between the Tikhonov well-posedness of a minimisation problem and the differentiability of an associated convex conjugate function. We show how this duality naturally generalises to the setting of asymmetrically normed spaces.</description>

      <title>Ces\`{a}ro Operators on Rooted Directed Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the notion of the Ces\'aro operator $C_{\mathscr T}$ on a rooted directed tree $\mathscr T.$ If $\mathscr T$ is the rooted tree with no branching vertex, then $C_{\mathscr T}$ is unitarily equivalent to the classical Ces\'aro operator $C_{0}$ on the sequence space $\ell^2(\mathbb N).$ Besides some basic properties related to boundedness and spectral behavior, we show that $C_{\mathscr T}$ is subnormal if and only if $\mathscr T$ is isomorphic to the rooted directed tree $\mathbb N$ provided $\mathscr T$ is of finite branching index. In particular, the verbatim analogue of Kriete-Trutt theorem fails for Ces\'aro operators on rooted directed trees. However, if, in addition, $\mathscr T$ is locally finite, then $C_{\mathscr T}$ is a compact perturbation of a subnormal operator.</description>

      <title>Symmetric form geometric constant related to isosceles orthogonality in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce a novel geometric constant $L_X(t)$, which provides an equivalent definition of the von Neumann-Jordan constant from an orthogonal perspective. First, we present some fundamental properties of the constant $L_X(t)$ in Banach spaces, including its upper and lower bounds, as well as its convexity, non-increasing continuity. Next, we establish the identities of $L_X(t)$ and the function $\gamma_X(t)$, the von Neumann-Jordan constant, respectively. We also delve into the relationship between this novel constant and several renowned geometric constants (such as the James constant and the modulus of convexity). Furthermore, by utilizing the lower bound of this new constant, we characterize Hilbert spaces. Finally, based on these findings, we further investigate the connection between this novel constant and the geometric properties of Banach spaces, including uniformly non-square, uniformly normal structure, uniformly smooth, etc.</description>

      <title>The skew James type constant in Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, Takahashi has introduced the James type constants $\mathcal{J}_{\mathcal{X} ,t}(\tau)$. Building upon this foundation, we introduce an innovative skew James type constant, denoted as $\mathcal{J}_t[\tau,\mathcal{X}]$, which is perceived as a skewed counterpart to the traditional James type constants. We delineate a novel constant, and proceed to ascertain its equivalent representations along with certain attributes within the context of Banach spaces, and then an investigation into the interrelation between the skewness parameter and the modulus of convexity is conducted, after that we define another new constant $\mathcal{G}_t(\mathcal{X})$, and some conclusions were drawn.</description>

      <title>Topological Properties of the Effective Reproduction Number in an Heterogeneous SIS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This present results lay the foundations for the study of the optimal allocation of vaccine in the simple epidemiological SIS model where one consider a very general heterogeneous population. In the present setting each individual has a type x belonging to a general space, and a vaccination strategy is a function $\eta$ where $\eta$(x) $\in$ [0, 1] represents the proportion of non-vaccinated among individuals of type x. We shall consider two loss functions associated to a vaccination strategy $\eta$: either the effective reproduction number, a classical quantity appearing in many models in epidemiology, and which is given here by the spectral radius of a compact operator that depends on $\eta$; or the overall proportion of infected individuals after vaccination in the maximal endemic state.By considering the weak-* topology on the set $\Delta$ of vaccination strategies, so that it is a compact set, we can prove that those two loss functions are continuous using the notion of collective compactness for a family of operators. We also prove their stability with respect to the parameters of the SIS model. Eventually, we consider their monotonicity and related properties in particular when the model is ``almost'' irreducible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the weak Brehmer's condition and prove that the Cauchy transform for a representation of a right-angled Artin monoid is bounded under such conditions. As a result, we obtain the Poisson transform and $*$-regular dilation for a family of operators that satisfies the weak Brehmer's condition and the property (P). This generalizes Popescu's notion of Cauchy and Poisson transforms for commuting families of row contractions.</description>

      <title>New characterizations for Fock spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00545v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the maximal Fock space $F^\infty_\alpha$ on $C^n$ is a Lipschitz space, that is, there exists a distance $d_\alpha$ on $C^n$ such that an entire function $f$ on $C^n$ belongs to $F^\infty_\alpha$ if and only if $$|f(z)-f(w)|\le Cd_\alpha(z,w)$$ for some constant $C$ and all $z,w\in C^n$. This can be considered the Fock space version of the following classical result in complex analysis: a holomorphic function $f$ on the unit ball $B_n$ in $C^n$ belongs to the Bloch space if and only if there exists a positive constant $C$ such that $|f(z)-f(w)|\le C\beta(z,w)$ for all $z,w\in B_n$, where $\beta(z,w)$ is the distance on $B_n$ in the Bergman metric. We also present a new approach to Hardy-Littlewood type characterizations for $F^p_\alpha$.</description>

      <title>Parametric shape optimization for the convected Helmholtz equation with a generalized Myers boundary condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the convected Helmholtz equation with a generalized Myers boundary condition (a boundary condition of the second-order) and characterize the set of physical parameters for which the problem is weakly well-posed. The model comes from industrial applications to absorb acoustic noise in jet engines filled with absorbing liners (porous material). The problem is set on a 3D cylinder filled with a d-upper regular boundary measure, with a real 1 &lt; d $\le$ 2. This setup leads to a parametric shape optimization problem, for which we prove the existence of at least one optimal distribution for any fixed volume fraction of the absorbing liner on the boundary that minimizes the total acoustic energy on any bounded wavenumber range.</description>

      <title>A model and characterization of a class of symmetric semibounded operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal G$ be a Hilbert space and $\mathfrak B(\mathcal G)$ the algebra of bounded operators, $\mathcal H=L_2([0,\infty);\mathcal G)$. An operator-valued function $Q\in L_{\infty,\rm loc}\left([0,\infty);\mathfrak B(\mathcal G)\right)$ determines a multiplication operator in $\mathcal H$ by $(Qy)(x)=Q(x)y(x)$, $x\geqslant0$. We say that an operator $L_0$ in a Hilbert space is a Schr\"odinger type operator, if it is unitarily equivalent to $-d^2/dx^2+Q(x)$ on a relevant domain. The paper provides a characterization of a class of such operators. The characterization is given in terms of properties of an evolutionary dynamical system associated with $L_0$. It provides a way to construct a functional Schr\"odinger model of $L_0$.</description>

      <title>Manifolds of absolutely continuous functions with values in an infinite-dimensional manifold and regularity properties of half-Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06512v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $p\in [1,\infty]$, we define a smooth manifold structure on the set $AC_{L^p}([a,b],N)$ of absolutely continuous functions $\gamma\colon [a,b]\to N$ with $L^p$-derivatives for all real numbers $a&lt;b$ and each smooth manifold $N$ modeled on a sequentially complete locally convex topological vector space, such that $N$ admits a local addition. Smoothness of natural mappings between spaces of absolutely continuous functions is discussed, like superposition operators $AC_{L^p}([a,b],N_1)\to AC_{L^p}([a,b],N_2)$, $\eta\mapsto f\circ \eta$, for a smooth map $f\colon N_1\to N_2$. For $1\leq p &lt;\infty$ and $r\in \mathbb{N}$ we show that the right half-Lie groups $\text{Diff}_K^r(\mathbb{R})$ and $\text{Diff}^r(M)$ are $L^p$-semiregular. Here $K$ is a compact subset of $\mathbb{R}$ and $M$ is a compact smooth manifold. An $L^p$-semiregular half-Lie group $G$ admits an evolution map $\text{Evol}:L^p([0,1],T_e G)\to AC_{L^p}([0,1],G)$, where $e$ is the neutral element of $G$. For the preceding examples, the evolution map $\text{Evol}$ is continuous.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03667v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper establishes an analog Whittaker-Shannon-Kotelnikov sampling theorem for unbounded non-decaying band-limited signals. An explicit interpolation formula is obtained for signals sublinear growth with rate of growth less than 1/2. At any time, the rate of decay for the $k$th coefficients of this formula is $\sim 1/k^2$. In addition, the paper obtains a method for calculating the coefficients of the interpolation formula applicable to signals with arbitrarily high rate of polynomial growth.</description>

      <title>Matrix Chaos Inequalities and Chaos of Combinatorial Type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18468v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Matrix concentration inequalities and their recently discovered sharp counterparts provide powerful tools to bound the spectrum of random matrices whose entries are linear functions of independent random variables. However, in many applications in theoretical computer science and in other areas one encounters more general random matrix models, called matrix chaoses, whose entries are polynomials of independent random variables. Such models have often been studied on a case-by-case basis using ad-hoc methods that can yield suboptimal dimensional factors.
  In this paper we provide general matrix concentration inequalities for matrix chaoses, which enable the treatment of such models in a systematic manner. These inequalities are expressed in terms of flattenings of the coefficients of the matrix chaos. We further identify a special family of matrix chaoses of combinatorial type for which the flattening parameters can be computed mechanically by a simple rule. This allows us to provide a unified treatment of and improved bounds for matrix chaoses that arise in a variety of applications, including graph matrices, Khatri-Rao matrices, and matrices that arise in average case analysis of the sum-of-squares hierarchy.</description>
