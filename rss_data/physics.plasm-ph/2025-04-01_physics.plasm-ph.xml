      <title>Applying Machine Learning Methods to Laser Acceleration of Protons: Synthetic Data for Exploring the High Repetition Rate Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advances in ultra-intense laser technology have increased repetition rates and average power for chirped-pulse laser systems, which offers a promising solution for many applications including energetic proton sources. An important challenge is the need to optimize and control the proton source by varying some of the many degrees of freedom inherent to the laser-plasma interactions. Machine learning can play an important role in this task, as our work examines. Building on our earlier work in Desai et al. 2024, we generate a large $\sim$1.5 million data point synthetic data set for proton acceleration using a physics-informed analytic model that we improved to include pre-pulse physics. Then, we train different machine learning methods on this data set to determine which methods perform efficiently and accurately. Generally, we find that quasi-real-time training of neural network models using single shot data from a kHz repetition rate ultra-intense laser system should typically be feasible on a single GPU. We also find that a less sophisticated model like a polynomial regression can be trained even faster and that the accuracy of these models is still good enough to be useful. We provide our source code and example synthetic data for others to test new machine learning methods and approaches to automated learning in this regime.</description>

      <title>Simulations of edge and SOL turbulence in diverted negative and positive triangularity plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing the performance of magnetic confinement fusion devices is critical to achieving an attractive fusion reactor design. Negative triangularity (NT) scenarios have been shown to achieve excellent levels of energy confinement, while avoiding edge localized modes (ELMs). Modeling turbulent transport in the edge and SOL is key in understanding the impact of NT on turbulence and extrapolating the results to future devices and regimes. Previous gyrokinetic turbulence studies have reported beneficial effects of NT across a broad range of parameters. However, most simulations have focused on the inner plasma region, neglecting the impact of NT on the outermost edge. In this work, we investigate the effect of NT in edge and scrape-off layer (SOL) simulations, including the magnetic X-point and separatrix. For the first time, we employ a multi-fidelity approach, combining global, non-linear gyrokinetic simulations with drift-reduced fluid simulations, to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying physics at play. First-principles simulations using the GENE-X code demonstrate that in comparable NT and PT geometries, similar profiles are achieved, while the turbulent heat flux is reduced by more than 50% in NT. Comparisons with results from the drift-reduced fluid turbulence code GRILLIX suggest that the turbulence is driven by trapped electron modes (TEMs). The parallel heat flux width on the divertor targets is reduced in NT, primarily due to a lower spreading factor $S$.</description>

      <title>Twisted magnetar magnetospheres: a class of semi-analytical force-free non-rotating solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetospheric twists, that is magnetospheres with a toroidal component, are under scrutiny due to the key role the twist is believed to play in the behaviour of neutron stars. Notably, its dissipation is believed to power magnetar activity, and is an important element of the evolution of these stars. We exhibit a new class of twisted axi-symmetric force-free magnetospheric solutions. We solve the Grad-Shafranov equation by introducing an ansatz akin to a multipolar expansion. We obtain a hierarchical system of ordinary differential equations where lower-order multipoles source the higher-order ones. We show that analytical approximations can be obtained, and that in general solutions can be numerically computed using standard solvers. We obtain a class of solutions with a great flexibility in initial conditions, and show that a subset of these asymptotically tend to vacuum. The twist is not confined to a subset of field lines. The solutions are symmetric about the equator, with a toroidal component that can be reversed. This symmetry is supported by an equatorial current sheet. We provide a first-order approximation of a particular solution that consists in the superposition of a vacuum dipole and a toroidal magnetic field sourced by the dipole, where the toroidal component decays as $1/r^4$. As an example of strongly multipolar solution, we also exhibit cases with an additional octupole component.</description>

      <title>Application of a spherically averaged pair potential in \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo simulations of the warm dense electron gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spherically averaged periodic pair potentials offer the enticing promise to provide accurate results at a drastically reduced computational cost compared to the traditional Ewald sum. In this work, we employ the pair potential by Yakub and Ronchi [\textit{J.~Chem.~Phys.}~\textbf{119}, 11556 (2003)] in \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations of the warm dense uniform electron gas. Overall, we find very accurate results with respect to Ewald reference data for integrated properties such as the kinetic and potential energy, whereas wavenumber resolved properties such as the static structure factor $S(\mathbf{q})$, the static linear density response $\chi(\mathbf{q})$ and the static quadratic density response $\chi^{(2)}(\mathbf{q},0)$ fluctuate for small $q$. In addition, we perform an analytic continuation to compute the dynamic structure factor $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ from PIMC results of the imaginary-time density--density correlation function $F(\mathbf{q},\tau)$ for both pair potentials. Our results have important implications for future PIMC calculations, which can be sped up significantly using the YR potential for the estimation of equation-of-state properties or $q$-resolved observables in the non-collective regime, whereas a full Ewald treatment is mandatory to accurately resolve physical effects manifesting for smaller $q$, including the evaluation of compressibility sum rules, the interpretation of x-ray scattering experiments at small scattering angles, and the estimation of optical and transport properties.</description>

      <title>Determining the 3D Dynamics of Solar Flare Magnetic Reconnection</title>

Abstract: Solar flares are major space weather events that result from the explosive conversion of stored magnetic energy into bulk motion, plasma heating, and particle acceleration. While the standard flare model has proven highly successful in explaining key morphological features of flare observations, many aspects of the energy release are not yet understood. In particular, the turbulent three-dimensional structure of the flare current sheet is thought to play an important role in fast reconnection, particle acceleration, and bursty dynamics. Although direct diagnosis of the magnetic field dynamics in the corona remains highly challenging, rich information may be gleaned from flare ribbons, which represent the chromospheric imprints of reconnection in the corona. Intriguingly, recent solar imaging observations have revealed a diversity of fine structure in flare ribbons that hints at corresponding complexity in the reconnection region. We present high-resolution three-dimensional MHD simulations of an eruptive flare and describe our efforts to interpret fine-scale ribbon features in terms of the current sheet dynamics. In our model, the current sheet is characterized by many coherent magnetic structures known as plasmoids. We derive a model analogue for ribbons by generating a time series of field-line length maps (L-maps) and identifying abrupt shortenings as flare reconnection events. We thereby demonstrate that plasmoids imprint transient 'spirals' along the analogue of the ribbon front, with a morphology consistent with observed fine structure. We discuss the implications of these results for interpreting SolO, IRIS, and DKIST observations of explosive flare energy release.</description>

      <title>Chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.02017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulence plays a very important role in determining the transport of energy and particles in fusion plasmas. This work is devoted to studying the chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence in the context of the nonlinear wave-particle interaction. Turbulent waves with characteristic wavelengths at different scales can interact with the same group of charged particles when the waves' phase velocities are close to the velocities of the charged particles. A multi-wavenumber standard mapping is developed to model the chaotic diffusion in multi-scale turbulence. The diffusion coefficient is obtained by calculating the correlation functions analytically. For our purposes, the wave intensities of all the turbulent waves are of the same order. It is found that the contribution of the largest scale components dominates the deviation from the quasi-linear (QL) diffusion coefficient. Just decreasing the interwave spacing of the wave phase velocity of the smaller scale components (the turbulent waves with characteristic wavelengths at smaller scale) to realize strongly resonant overlap cannot make the diffusion coefficient approach the QL diffusion limit for a given finite wave amplitude. The diffusion coefficient may deviate from the QL one when larger-scale components are added to a very chaotic system driven by smaller-scale components. In particular, for the two-scale case, the diffusion coefficient is mostly over the QL diffusion coefficient as the wave intensity increases in the limit of zero interwave spacing for the smaller scale components. As more scales of wavelengths are included, the diffusion coefficient approaches the QL diffusion coefficient. The results can give new insight into other resonance-induced multi-scale turbulence in Hamiltonian systems with 1.5 or 2 degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Observation of Alfven solitons in the solar corona using Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08520v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solitons are predominantly observed in near-earth plasmas as well as planetary magnetospheres; however, their existence in the solar corona remains largely unexplored, despite theoretical investigations. This study aims to address this gap by examining the presence and dynamics of solitons in the solar corona, particularly in the context of coronal heating. Utilizing observational data from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) during the onset of a strong Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) event, the analyses reveal a train of aperiodic solitons with increasing amplitude preceding the eruption. A key finding of this study is that the observed aperiodic soliton train serves as a potential candidate in facilitating energy transfer through dissipation within the coronal plasma, hereby, influencing the initiation of solar eruptive events such as a CME. A defining characteristic of this solitary train is its hypersonic and super-Alfvenic nature, evident from the presence of high Mach numbers that reinforces its role in plasma energy equilibration in the solar corona, thereby contributing to plasma heating.</description>
