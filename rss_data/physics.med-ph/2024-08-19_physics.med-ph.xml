      <title>Contactless seismocardiography via Gunnar-Farneback optical flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismocardiography (SCG) has gained significant attention due to its potential applications in monitoring cardiac health and diagnosing cardiovascular conditions. Conventional SCG methods rely on accelerometers attached to the chest, which can be uncomfortable or inconvenient. In recent years, researchers have explored non-contact methods to capture SCG signals, and one promising approach involves analyzing video recordings of the chest. In this study, we investigate a vision-based method based on the Gunnar-Farneback optical flow to extract SCG signals from the chest skin movements recorded by a smartphone camera. We compared the SCG signals extracted from the chest videos of four healthy subjects with those obtained from accelerometers and our previous method based on sticker tracking. Our results demonstrated that the vision-based SCG signals extracted by the proposed method closely resembled those from accelerometers and stickers, although these signals were captured from slightly different locations. The mean squared error between the vision-based SCG signals and accelerometer-based signals was found to be within a reasonable range, especially between signals on head-to-foot direction (0.2$&lt;$MSE$&lt;$1.5). Additionally, heart rates derived from the vision-based SCG exhibited good agreement with the gold-standard ECG measurements, with a mean difference of 0.8 bpm. These results indicate the potential of this non-invasive method in health monitoring and diagnostics.</description>

      <title>ECG-Free Assessment of Cardiac Valve Events Using Seismocardiography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seismocardiogram (SCG) signals can play a crucial role in remote cardiac monitoring, capturing important events such as aortic valve opening (AO) and mitral valve closure (MC). However, existing SCG methods for detecting AO and MC typically rely on electrocardiogram (ECG) data. In this study, we propose an innovative approach to identify AO and MC events in SCG signals without the need for ECG information. Our method utilized a template bank, which consists of signal templates extracted from SCG waveforms of 5 healthy subjects. These templates represent characteristic features of a heart cycle. When analyzing new, unseen SCG signals from another group of 6 healthy subjects, we employ these templates to accurately detect cardiac cycles and subsequently pinpoint AO and MC events. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed template bank approach in achieving ECG-independent AO and MC detection, laying the groundwork for more convenient remote cardiovascular assessment.</description>

      <title>Orientation independent quantification of macromolecular proton fraction in tissues with suppression of residual dipolar coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative magnetization transfer (MT) imaging enables non-invasive characterization of the macromolecular environment of tissues. However, recent work has highlighted that the quantification of MT parameters exhibits orientation dependence in ordered tissue structures, potentially confounding its clinical applications. Notably, in tissues with ordered structures, such as articular cartilage and myelin, the residual dipolar coupling (RDC) effect can arise owing to incomplete averaging of dipolar-dipolar interactions of water protons. In this study, we demonstrated the confounding effect of RDC on quantitative MT imaging in ordered tissues can be suppressed by using an emerging technique known as macromolecular proton fraction mapping based on spin-lock (MPF-SL). The off-resonance spin-lock pulse in MPF-SL could be designed to generate a strong effective spin-lock field to suppress RDC without violating the specific absorption rate and hardware limitations in clinical scans. Furthermore, removing the water signal in MPF-SL enabled the application of a strong effective spin-lock field without any confounding signal from direct water saturation. Our findings were experimentally validated using human knee specimens and healthy human cartilage. The results demonstrated that MPF-SL exhibits lower sensitivity to tissue orientation compared with R2, R1rho, and saturation-pulse-based MT imaging. Thus, MPF-SL could serve as a valuable orientation-independent technique for quantifying MPF.</description>

      <title>Metabolic light absorption, scattering and emission (MetaLASE) microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical imaging of metabolism can provide key information about health and disease progression in cells and tissues, however, current methods have lacked gold-standard information about histological structure. Conversely, histology and virtual histology methods have lacked metabolic contrast. Here we present a novel microscopy technology, Metabolic Light Absorption, Scattering and Emission (MetaLASE) microscopy, which rapidly provides a virtual histology and optical metabolic readout simultaneously. Photoacoustic remote sensing microscopy achieves nuclei contrast and hematoxylin contrast using ultraviolet absorption and an eosin contrast using the scattered ultraviolet light. The same ultraviolet source excites endogenous NADH, FAD and collagen autofluorescence allowing a measurable Optical Redox Ratios to see enhanced metabolism in areas of invasive carcinoma in breast and prostate tissues compared to benign regions. Benign chronic inflammation and glands also are seen to exhibit hypermetabolism. MetaLASE microscopy offers promise for future applications in intraoperative margin analysis, and in research applications where greater insights into metabolic activity should be correlated with cell and tissue types.</description>

      <title>Decoding the human brain tissue response to radiofrequency excitation using a biophysical-model-free deep MRI on a chip framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) relies on radiofrequency (RF) excitation of proton spin. Clinical diagnosis requires a comprehensive collation of biophysical data via multiple MRI contrasts, acquired using a series of RF sequences that lead to lengthy examinations. Here, we developed a vision transformer-based framework that captures the spatiotemporal magnetic signal evolution and decodes the brain tissue response to RF excitation, constituting an MRI on a chip. Following a per-subject rapid calibration scan (28.2 s), a wide variety of image contrasts including fully quantitative molecular, water relaxation, and magnetic field maps can be generated automatically. The method was validated across healthy subjects and a cancer patient in two different imaging sites, and proved to be 94% faster than alternative protocols. The deep MRI on a chip (DeepMonC) framework may reveal the molecular composition of the human brain tissue in a wide range of pathologies, while offering clinically attractive scan times.</description>
