      <title>Lifting Cocycles: From Heuristic to Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The circular coordinates algorithm, a key tool in topological data analysis, relies on a theoretically unvalidated lifting step to convert cocycles from a prime field to integer coefficients. We provide a rigorous analysis of this procedure, establishing a criterion for its success. We also introduce a novel algebraic method to reduce any lifted cocycle to a cocycle with winding number 1, ensuring feature correctness. These principles are extended to homology cycles, solidifying the theoretical foundation of this widely used feature extraction technique.</description>

      <title>Modular forms for chromatic homotopy: Supersingular congruences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we confirm a conjecture of Larson that arises in the Adams--Novikov spectral sequence (ANSS) for the stable homotopy groups of spheres and, specifically, in Behrens' program on explicit modular forms detecting $v_2$--periodic classes in the divided $\beta$-family. The conjecture predicts the supersingular order of the weight $12t$ form $L_2(\Delta^t)$, when $(p-1)\mid 12t,$ attached to the $\Gamma_0(2)$ Hecke correspondence. We prove the prediction for all primes $p\ge5$, thereby providing the precise modular input that calibrates the relevant ANSS differentials in the Behrens program and removes the last obstruction to using pure $\Delta$-power across the range of indices where Hodge-scaling cancels.</description>

      <title>Approximate Fiber Products of Schemes and Their \'Etale Homotopical Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical fiber product in algebraic geometry provides a powerful tool for studying loci where two morphisms to a base scheme, $\phi: X \to S$ and $\psi: Y \to S$, coincide exactly. This condition of strict equality, however, is insufficient for describing the geometric structure of semantic spaces in modern large language models, whose foundational architecture is the Transformer. The token spaces of these models are fundamentally arithmetic, and recent work has revealed complex geometric singularities, challenging the classical manifold hypothesis.
  This paper develops a new framework to study and quantify the nature of approximate alignment between morphisms in the context of arithmetic geometry, using the tools of \'etale homotopy theory. We introduce the central object of our work, the \'etale mismatch torsor, a sheaf of torsors over the product scheme $X \times_S Y$. The structure of this sheaf serves as a rich, intrinsic, and purely algebraic measure of the global relationship between the two morphisms.
  Our main theorem provides a complete classification of these structures, establishing a bijection between their isomorphism classes and the first \'etale cohomology group $H^1_{\text{\'et}}(X \times_S Y, \underline{\pi_1^{\text{\'et}}(S)})$. This result yields a discrete, algebraic invariant that replaces the non-intrinsic, metric-based notions of approximation first explored in applied contexts. We apply this framework to the concrete case of generalized Howe curves over finite fields to illustrate its connection to classical problems. This work introduces new homotopical invariants to arithmetic geometry, opening new avenues for the structural analysis of complex discrete systems.</description>

      <title>Fuzzy simplicial sets and their application to geometric data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we expand upon the concepts introduced by David Spivak about the relationship between the category $\mathbf{UM}$ of uber metric spaces and the category $\mathbf{sFuz}$ of fuzzy simplicial sets. We show that fuzzy simplicial sets can be regarded as natural combinatorial generalizations of metric relations. Furthermore, we take inspiration from UMAP to apply the theory to manifold learning, dimension reduction and data visualization, while refining some of their constructions. We generalize the adjunction between $\mathbf{UM}$ and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, derive an explicit description of colimits in $\mathbf{UM}$, and show that $\mathbf{UM}$ can be embedded into $\mathbf{sFuz}$. Furthermore, we prove analogous results for the category of extended-pseudo metric spaces $\mathbf{EPMet}$. We also provide rigorous definitions of functors that make it possible to recursively merge sets of fuzzy simplicial sets and provide a description of the adjunctions between the category of truncated fuzzy simplicial sets and $\mathbf{sFuz}$, which we relate to persistent homology. Combining those constructions, we can show a surprising connection between the well-known dimension reduction methods UMAP and Isomap and derive an alternative algorithm, which we call IsUMap, that combines some of the strengths of both methods. Additionally, we developed a new embedding method that allows to preserve clusters detected in the original metric space that we construct from the data. The visualization of the optimization process gives the user information, both about the inner-cluster distributions in the original metric space and their inter-cluster relations. We compare our new method with UMAP, Isomap and t-SNE on a series of low- and high-dimensional datasets and provide explanations for observed differences and improvements.</description>

      <title>Formal Manifold Structures on Positive Characteristic Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his 1970 ICM report, Sullivan proposes the program of l-adic formalization of the concept of manifolds. In this program, he claims that smooth positive characteristic varieties should carry l-adic formal manifold structures. He also claims the existence of an abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures. This paper carries out this program, establishes the claims for certain varieties, and relates the abelianized Galois symmetry on l-adic formal manifold structures to the Galois symmetry of varieties. Meanwhile, we prove that a simply-connected variety is l-adic homotopic equivalent to a simply-connected finite CW complex if and only if the l-profinite completion of its etale homotopy type admits an l-local lifting.</description>

      <title>Torsion in Persistent Homology and Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of torsion in hybrid deep learning models that incorporate topological data analysis, focusing on autoencoders. While most TDA tools use field coefficients, this conceals torsional features present in integer homology. We show that torsion can be lost during encoding, altered in the latent space, and in many cases, not reconstructed by standard decoders. Using both synthetic and high-dimensional data, we evaluate torsion sensitivity to perturbations and assess its recoverability across several autoencoder architectures. Our findings reveal key limitations of field-based approaches and underline the need for architectures or loss terms that preserve torsional information for robust data representation.</description>

      <title>On Singer's conjecture for the fourth algebraic transfer in certain generic degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10232v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be the Steenrod algebra over the finite field $k := \mathbb Z_2$ and $G(q)$ be the general linear group of rank $q$ over $k.$ A well-known open problem in algebraic topology is the explicit determination of the cohomology groups of the Steenrod algebra, ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k),$ for all homological degrees $q \geq 0.$ The Singer algebraic transfer of rank $q,$ formulated by William Singer in 1989, serves as a valuable method for the description of such Ext groups. This transfer maps from the coinvariants of a certain representation of $G(q)$ to ${\rm Ext}^{q, *}_A(k, k).$ Singer predicted that the algebraic transfer is always injective, but this has gone unanswered for all $q\geq 4.$ This paper establishes Singer's conjecture for rank four in the generic degrees $n = 2^{s+t+1} +2^{s+1} - 3$ whenever $t\neq 3$ and $s\geq 1,$ and $n = 2^{s+t} + 2^{s} - 2$ whenever $t\neq 2,\, 3,\, 4$ and $s\geq 1.$ In conjunction with our previous results, this completes the proof of the Singer conjecture for rank four. All the obtained results can be verified directly by using the program suite of our novel algorithms presented in [17, 18, 19, 20]. We note that although Singer's conjecture still holds for the case of rank 4, it no longer holds for rank 6, as announced in our most recent work [20].</description>

      <title>Towards the dual motivic Steenrod algebra in positive characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.05230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dual motivic Steenrod algebra with mod $\ell$ coefficients was computed by Voevodsky over a base field of characteristic zero, and by Hoyois, Kelly, and {\O}stv{\ae}r over a base field of characteristic $p \neq \ell$. In the case $p = \ell$, we show that the conjectured answer is a retract of the actual answer. We also describe the slices of the algebraic cobordism spectrum $MGL$: we show that the conjectured form of $s_n MGL$ is a retract of the actual answer.</description>

      <title>Cosmology with Persistent Homology: Parameter Inference via Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15405v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon [2308.02636], we investigate the constraining power of persistent homology on cosmological parameters and primordial non-Gaussianity in a likelihood-free inference pipeline utilizing machine learning. We evaluate the ability of Persistence Images (PIs) to infer parameters, comparing them to the combined Power Spectrum and Bispectrum (PS/BS). We also compare two classes of models: neural-based and tree-based. PIs consistently lead to better predictions compared to the combined PS/BS for parameters that can be constrained, i.e., for $\{\Omega_{\rm m}, \sigma_8, n_{\rm s}, f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}\}$. PIs perform particularly well for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$, highlighting the potential of persistent homology for constraining primordial non-Gaussianity. Our results indicate that combining PIs with PS/BS provides only marginal gains, indicating that the PS/BS contains little additional or complementary information to the PIs. Finally, we provide a visualization of the most important topological features for $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ and for $\Omega_{\rm m}$. This reveals that clusters and voids (0-cycles and 2-cycles) are most informative for $\Omega_{\rm m}$, while $f_{\rm NL}^{\rm loc}$ is additionally informed by filaments (1-cycles).</description>

      <title>A model for the assembly map of bordism-invariant functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05238v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study oplax colimits of stable categories, of hermitian categories and of Poincar\'e categories in nice cases. This allows us to produce a categorical model of the assembly map of a bordism-invariant functor of Poincar\'e categories which is also a Verdier projection, whose kernel we explicitly describe. As a direct application, we generalize the Shaneson splitting for bordism-invariant functors of Poincar\'e categories proved by Calm\`es-Dotto-Harpaz-Hebestreit-Land-Moi-Nardin-Nikolaus-Steimle to allow for twists. We also show our methods can tackle their general twisted Shaneson splitting of Poincar\'e-Verdier localizing invariants which specifies to a twisted Bass-Heller-Swan decomposition for the underlying stable categories, generalizing part of recent work of Kirstein-Kremer.</description>
