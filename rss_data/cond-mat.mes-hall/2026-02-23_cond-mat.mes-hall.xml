      <title>Method for real-time monitoring of paramagnetic reactions using spin relaxometry with fluorescent nanodiamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin relaxometry using fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) has been applied successfully to sense numerous paramagnetic target molecules such as free radicals and metalloproteins. However, despite their high sensitivity, T1 spin relaxation measurements are often hampered by their slow acquisition speed. Here, we demonstrate a method that allows for real-time monitoring of paramagnetic chemical reactions. We demonstrate T1 spin relaxometry from thousands of FNDs using an optimised cuvette-based system integrating an avalanche photodiode operated in linear mode, and a fast, fieldprogrammable gate array (FPGA) for data collation. We demonstrate chemical monitoring of the reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I) ions in-solution with a 15 second integration using an optimised T1 sensing protocol. Our method achieves more than two orders of magnitude speed up with an order of magnitude reduction in cost when compared with traditional techniques. With further technical improvements, we believe this in-solution method could be extended to sense the sub-second chemical kinetics of paramagnetic molecules in solution.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Band-Gap Renormalization in Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate, by femtosecond time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, that photoinduced interlayer charge transfer in a heterostructure consisting of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene and a single atomic layer of silver on 6H-SiC(0001) transiently modulates the intrinsic potential landscape across the silver-graphene interface. This acts as an ultrafast optoelectronic gate that drives momentum-dependent band renormalizations, resulting in a transient band-gap opening on femtosecond timescales. Simultaneously, the photogenerated hot-carrier population enhances electronic screening, leading to subsequent closing of the band-gap beyond the thermal equilibrium value. These findings reveal two different mechanisms for photoinduced, reversible control of the electronic band structure in bilayer graphene -- interlayer charge transfer and hot-carrier-enhanced screening -- providing a general framework for the ultrafast control of electronic properties in graphene-based heterostructures. This opens up novel pathways for the realization of ultrafast optoelectronic devices and the exploration of correlated quantum phases in bilayer graphene under non-equilibrium conditions.</description>

      <title>Bright-dark exciton splitting in lead halide perovskite crystals accessed via quantum beats in photon echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the fine structure of excitons is crucial for optoelectronic and quantum photonic applications of lead halide perovskites. It is demonstrated that polarization-sensitive photon echo spectroscopy in magnetic field provides a powerful method to access coherent exciton dynamics and reveal their energy level structure, which is hidden by inhomogeneous broadening. Exciton quantum beats observed in both Faraday and Voigt geometries offer a precise probe of the energy splittings among the four 1$s$ exciton states, enabling determination of the fine structure and bright-dark splittings. Application of this technique to bulk mixed halide perovskite crystals FA$_{0.9}$Cs$_{0.1}$PbI$_{2.8}$Br$_{0.2}$ reveals a bright-dark exciton splitting of $\Delta_\mathrm{X}=0.46~$meV, along with electron and hole Land\'{e} $g$ factors $g_\mathrm{e}=3.38$ and $g_\mathrm{h}=-1.14$, respectively. The quantum beats persist on timescales of 20--50$~$ps, demonstrating remarkably robust spin and optical coherences at cryogenic temperature of 2$~$K. The decay of the quantum beats of the outer doublet is governed by dephasing due to dispersion of the bright-dark splitting of $\sim0.06~$meV caused by localization potential fluctuations, while dephasing in the bright exciton inner doublet originates from a small zero field splitting of $\sim0.035~$meV due to anisotropic potentials.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of swift-electron momentum transfer to a large spherical nanoparticle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swift electrons from highly focused beams produced in aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopes offer a powerful route for probing and manipulating matter at the nanoscale. Although linear momentum transfer from swift electrons to nanoparticles has been investigated theoretically and experimentally, subsequent analyzes revealed that several earlier predictions relied on non-causal dielectric functions or insufficient numerical convergence, leading to spurious sign reversals in the transferred momentum. Here, we derive analytical expressions and develop a numerically efficient electrodynamic framework to compute the linear momentum transferred from a swift electron to an isolated spherical nanoparticle described by a fully causal, local dielectric response. We apply our framework to large nanoparticles with 50 nm radius and explicitly resolve the spectral density of linear momentum transfer across the full frequency domain. Using causal dielectric functions for aluminum and bismuth, we analyze the role of electron velocity, impact parameter, and material-specific resonances. We find that, when causality and full multipolar convergence are enforced, the net transverse linear momentum transferred to spherical nanoparticles remains attractive toward the electron trajectory for all nanoparticles considered, despite the presence of material-dependent sign changes in individual electric and magnetic contributions. These results contrast with earlier theoretical predictions of net repulsive behavior and indicate that additional physical mechanisms beyond the present isolated, local description are required to account for experimentally observed repulsion. Our work establishes a robust reference framework for momentum transfer calculations and provides quantitative benchmarks relevant for electron-beam-based nanoscale manipulation.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Force Imaging of 2D Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators are central to our understanding of the connection between topological symmetries in a material and its band electronics. Within this class of materials, a breadth of complex quantum behaviors, such as persistent spin-polarized current states in the presence of a broken time reversal symmetry, and temperature-independent topological protection of quantum states, are thought to exist. However, current studies using photoemission and spectroscopic analyses or transport experiments fail to provide insight into the interplay between the physical 2D manifold and the band topology itself, since they do not provide spatial resolution of the phenomena to be understood. In this work, we develop a methodology for applying magnetic force microscopy to such systems to address this issue. Using well-characterized 2D crystallites of bismuth telluride ($Bi_2$$Te_3$), we image the magnetic signal directly associated with topological edge states. The observed phase contrast is remarkably robust at a temperature of 25{\deg}C and occurs across crystallite sizes and shapes. A detailed analysis of the magnetic imaging suggests that the current observed is composed of two parts: the first is a persistent current ($I_{Persistent}$) as predicted by theory, and the second is due to Faraday induction, $I_{Faraday}$. Damping dynamics of the cantilever during imaging further suggest that this Faraday EMF is established by spin accumulation along the 1D edge channel of the crystal, which then converts to a charge current in the presence of time reversal symmetry breaking, creating a novel form of rectification in the channel. This unexpected result can prompt new ideas for topology-based circuit elements with extremely low losses and power consumption.</description>

      <title>Toroidal Fermi-surface geometry and phonon-limited transport in nodal-line semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nodal-line semimetals (NLSs) can display unconventional quasiparticle dynamics and charge transport properties due to their extended band degeneracy and the peculiar geometry of their Fermi surface. We consider electron-acoustic phonon scattering as the dominant relaxation mechanism and compute the quasiparticle decay rate and dc conductivity by solving the linearized semiclassical Boltzmann equation in a minimal model of a doped circular NLS. We find that the toroidal geometry of the Fermi surface gives rise to two parametrically distinct Bloch-Gr\"uneisen temperatures, associated with momentum transfers along the poloidal and toroidal directions, respectively. As a result, an intermediate temperature window opens between these two scales, in which the decay rate follows $\Gamma\propto T^2$, while the conductivity follows $\sigma\propto T^{-2}$. We also obtain the low- and high-temperature asymptotic behaviors, and discuss implications for ARPES and transport measurements in candidate NLS materials.</description>

      <title>Modeling of a magnetic field sensor based on spin Hall magnetoresistance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation spintronic sensors aim to overcome the limitations of traditional tunneling-magnetoresistance (TMR) devices, such as complex manufacturing, high $1/f$ noise, and significant offsets. This work presents a comprehensive modeling and experimental validation of a magnetic field sensor based on Spin Hall Magnetoresistance (SMR) in a Wheatstone bridge configuration. Utilizing a multiphysics approach, we simulate the interplay between SMR, Anisotropic Magnetoresistance (AMR), and Spin-Orbit Torque (SOT) using a Stoner-Wohlfarth model complemented by a Fuchs-Sondheimer analysis of current distribution. To account for the presence of magnetic domains, we incorporate a modified Stoner-Wohlfarth framework that considers non-uniform magnetization and domain wall motion through a "truncated astroid" approach, allowing for a statistical distribution of single-domain particles. The model is validated against experimental measurements of Pt/$\text{Fe}_{60}\text{Co}_{20}\text{B}_{20}$ and Ta/$\text{Fe}_{60}\text{Co}_{20}\text{B}_{20}$ bilayers patterned into Hall bars and Wheatstone bridges. The model provides critical design guidelines for optimizing material properties, layer thickness, and device layout to minimize power consumption and maximize sensitivity in SMR-based sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Higher-Dimensional Information Lattice: Quantum State Characterization through Inclusion-Exclusion Local Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the information lattice, originally defined for one-dimensional open-boundary chains, to characterize quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries. In one dimension, the information lattice provides a position- and scale-resolved decomposition of von Neumann information. Its generalization is nontrivial because overlapping subsystems can form loops, allowing multiple regions to encode the same information. This prevents information from being assigned uniquely to any one of them. We address this by introducing a higher-dimensional information lattice in which local information is defined through an inclusion-exclusion principle. The inclusion-exclusion local information is assigned to the lattice vertices, each labeled by subsystem position and scale. We implement this construction explicitly in two dimensions and apply it to a range of many-body ground states with distinct entanglement structures. Within this position- and scale-resolved framework, we extract information-based localization lengths, direction-dependent critical exponents, characteristic edge mode information, long-range information patterns due to topological order, and signatures of non-Abelian fusion channels. Our work establishes a general information-theoretic framework for isolating the universal scale-resolved features of quantum many-body states in higher-dimensional geometries.</description>

      <title>Topological Boundary Time Crystal Oscillations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary time crystals (BTCs) break time-translation symmetry and exhibit long-lived, robust oscillations insensitive to initial conditions. We show that collective spin BTCs can admit emergent topological winding numbers in operator space. Expanding the density operator in a spherical tensor basis, we map the Lindblad dynamics onto an effective local hopping problem, where collective degrees of freedom label sites of an emergent two-dimensional operator space lattice and identify topological obstructions that enforce the delocalization of operator modes on the lattice. The resulting spectral delocalization provides a natural explanation for the robust oscillatory dynamics observed in BTCs. When combined with non-reciprocal transport of operator weight across operator space, this mechanism moreover also leads to the universality of long-time dynamics across a broad class of initial states. Our results frame BTC dynamics as a form of topologically constrained operator space transport and suggest a close connection to non-Hermitian skin-effects.</description>

      <title>Direct imaging of a topological nematic phase in a spin-compensated magnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density waves conventionally describe the periodic modulation of charge or spin, yet the spatial modulation of electronic topology has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a Berry-curvature density wave in the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3NiN with compensated spins. Using high-precision Sagnac Kerr microscopy, we directly image micrometer-scale modulations of the Berry curvature. These topological ripples exhibit orientations unpinned to the crystal lattice, forming a nematic phase that spontaneously breaks rotational symmetry. We attribute this instability to field-induced spatial variations of the spin texture driven by competing magnetic interactions. This discovery unveils a new class of collective order in spin-compensated magnets arising from the geometric phase of the wavefunction itself and offering a tunable degree of freedom for topological spintronics based on antiferromagnets and altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Measuring and correcting nanosecond pulse distortions in quantum-dot spin qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.17899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gate-defined semiconductor quantum dots utilize fast electrical control to manipulate spin and charge states of individual electrons. Electrical pulse distortions can limit control fidelities but are difficult to measure at the device level. Here, we use detuning-axis pulsed spectroscopy to characterize baseband pulse distortions in a silicon double quantum-dot. We extract the gate-voltage impulse response and apply a digital pre-distortion filter to eliminate pulse distortions on timescales longer than 1~ns. With the pre-distortion, we reduce the frequency chirp of coherent exchange oscillations in a singlet-triplet qubit. Our results suggest a scalable and tuning-efficient method for characterizing pulse distortions in quantum-dot spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Microwave Imaging of Edge Conductivity in Graphene at Charge Neutrality and Quantum Hall States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report local conductivity imaging of edge states in monolayer graphene by millikelvin microwave impedance microscopy (MIM). At the charge-neutrality point, as the magnetic field increases, the local conductivity at the edge drops to zero more slowly than in the bulk. This behavior is consistent with the calculated spatial profile of the charge gap in the canted antiferromagnetic phase. For comparison, we also perform microwave imaging of integer quantum Hall states away from neutrality, which host dissipationless chiral edge channels. The evolution of the edge signal as a function of the bulk gap is fundamentally different between the Landau level filling factor $\nu = 0$ and $|\nu| \ge 1$ integer quantum Hall states, which can be qualitatively explained by numerical simulations and theoretical analysis. Our results provide a comprehensive microscopic picture of the edge and bulk states as the Fermi level moves across the unique Landau-level spectrum of graphene.</description>

      <title>Lattice and Orbital-Resolved Fermiology of Metallenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin metallenes have emerged as a new member of the two-dimensional (2D) materials family. Recent experimental realization of metallenes in the {\AA}ngstr\"om limit has further intensified interest in this class of 2D materials. However, achieving sub-atomic insight into them demands the most detailed and systematic characterization of their electronic structure. Such understanding is essential for the rational design and exploitation of their properties in plasmonics, catalysis, and quantum optics. Existing electronic-structure studies are either scattered or focus on a few selected systems, and a comprehensive view of their band structures and Fermi surfaces remains missing. Here, we address this gap by studying 45 elemental metallenes in six monolayer lattices (honeycomb, square, hexagonal, and their buckled forms) using density-functional theory. We found that lattice type primarily fixes the shape and radial placement of the Fermi-lines, while out-of-plane buckling introduces controlled modifications: it shortens long straight Fermi-line segments, and occasionally creates, removes, or merges small Fermi-line pockets. The electronic configuration determines which orbital type dominates the Fermi level. We summarized Fermiology using a single score for each element, termed pocketness, derived from four descriptors that combine element properties (symmetry, coordination) with electronic characteristics (dispersion, Fermi-surface topology). This score enables targeted angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) tests, controlled Lifshitz transitions, and provides a predictive basis for transport and device applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability to establish coherent communication channels is key for scaling up quantum devices. Here, we engineer interactions between distant polaritons, hybrid spin-photon excitations formed at different lumped-element superconducting resonators within a chip. The chip consists of several resonator pairs, slightly detuned in frequency to make them addressable, capacitively coupled within each pair and inductively coupled to a common readout line. They interact locally with samples of PTMr and Tripak$^{-}$ organic free radicals, deposited onto their inductors, which provide model $S = 1/2$, $g \simeq 2$ spin ensembles. Frequency-dependent microwave transmission experiments, performed at very low temperatures, measure polariton frequencies as a function of magnetic field in different scenarios. When only one resonator within a pair hosts a molecular sample, the results evidence that spins couple remotely to the empty LER as well as to the local cavity mode. If both resonators interact with a spin ensemble, the magnetic field tunes the polariton frequencies relative to each other, on account of the different spin-photon interactions at each LER. When polaritons are brought into mutual resonance, an avoided level crossing emerges that gives direct spectroscopic evidence for a coherent polariton-polariton interaction mediated by the circuit. Pump-probe experiments reveal that the excitation of a polariton within a connected pair is felt, thus it can be read out, by the other one. These observations, backed by model calculations, illustrate the control and detection of distant photon-photon and spin-spin correlations and entanglement in a scalable modular chip.</description>

      <title>Physical Pictures for Quasisymmetry in Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasisymmetry (QS) provides a novel route to understand and control near-degeneracies, Berry curvature, optical selection rules, and symmetry-protected phenomena in quantum materials. Here we give physical interpretations of the emergence of QS operators across multiple material families. Using density functional theory and the $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ formalism, we identify QS subspaces and calculate their representation matrices, quantifying the quasisymmetry via a metric $\epsilon$ that measures subspace invariance. For Sn/SiC and transition-metal dichalcogenide monolayers, QS corresponds to an emergent mirror symmetry, whereas in wurtzite crystals it manifests as an emergent spatial inversion. By contrast, for AgLa the QS appearing in avoided crossings is inherited from a nearby high-symmetry point rather than being an emergent lattice symmetry. Combining group-theoretical analysis and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ modeling, our results establish concrete physical pictures for QS and provide practical criteria to diagnose it in first-principles calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general electromagnetic description for dipoles confined to surfaces with oblique dipole moment orientations, extending the conventional in-plane (IP) and out-of-plane (OOP) treatments. This description is useful for describing localized polarization in, \textit{e.g.}, van der Waals heterostructures, thin films of molecular aggregates, and metal-dielectric interfaces. The theory is suitable for any material with vanishingly thin thickness relative to the light wavelength, independent of the geometry of the material and the media interfacing it. We apply the formalism to a uniaxial excitonic sheet, covering a large number of two-dimensional (2D) materials and organic thin films. Our theory reveals pairs of polaritonic resonances originating from the IP and OOP components of the excitonic dipole moment. The formalism suggests experimentally accessible signatures of dipole moment orientation, enhanced by near-field probes. This work proposes a unified language for the description of 2D materials, thin films and interfaces with anisotropic dipolar responses.</description>

      <title>High-quality single photons from cavity-enhanced biexciton-to-exciton transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.18153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Resonant laser excitation of a two-level system with subsequent single-photon emission can be used to generate single photons with high indistinguishability or Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) visibility. However, spectral overlap between excitation laser and emitted photons generally poses significant challenges. Furthermore, emitter re-excitation intrinsically limits achievable single-photon purity. Established solutions mitigate these issues at significant cost to source efficiency and with increased source complexity. This motivates the use of few-level systems with spectral separation of excitation and emission pathways. One option is a three-level cascade. However, without targeted lifetime engineering of emitting states, the cascade naturally limits achievable photon indistinguishability. Here we study a semiconductor quantum dot with resonant and selective cavity-enhancement of biexciton-to-exciton transition. Following resonant two-photon excitation of the biexciton state, we collect the emitted single photon with the cavity. This approach circumvents emitter re-excitation and naturally introduces spectral separation of excitation laser and emitted single photon. Supported by first experimental results, we demonstrate theoretically that with selective Purcell enhancement, the observed quality quantifiers of single-photon emission (purity, equivalently $g^{(2)}(0)$, and HOM visibility $\mathcal{V}$, equivalently indistinguishability) are competitive with respect to high-quality deterministic quantum-dot single-photon sources. This is already achieved without systematic optimization or targeted system engineering, which firmly places the reported approach as a viable route to the next generation of highest-quality quantum-dot based deterministic single-photon sources.</description>

      <title>Correlated phases of moat-band excitons in two-dimensional systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional systems of interacting excitons with a moat dispersion, for which the ground-state energy manifold presents a ring of discrete or continuously degenerate minima around a single point in momentum space. At low densities and for an idealized, perfectly degenerate moat, we show that the excitons undergo statistical transmutation and stabilize a chiral spin liquid. At higher densities, the moat dispersion favors Bose-Einstein condensation into states occupying multiple momenta, leading to inhomogeneous condensate phases and potentially supersolidity. We discuss the impact of band-structure warping present in realistic systems and argue that it generically stabilizes Bose-condensed phases over the chiral spin liquid, and analyze the superfluid response of the former which is unconventional due to the moat band. We also demonstrate that a proper renormalization of the exciton-exciton interaction is essential for describing these phases, and show that even purely repulsive interactions can favor inhomogeneous condensates. To further explore inhomogeneous condensate phases, we employ a Gross-Pitaevskii framework with a pseudopotential approximation and map out the resulting phase diagram. We show that the presence of degenerate dispersion minima can drive supersolidity already at weak coupling, in contrast to systems with a standard parabolic dispersion. Finally, we discuss our results in the context of real excitonic systems and argue that moat-band-induced supersolidity can be within experimental reach for realistic values of the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of Refrigeration and Engine Operation in Minimal Qubit Repeated-Interaction Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the operation of a qubit as a quantum thermal device within the repeated interaction framework, allowing for strong system-bath coupling and finite interaction times. We analyze two minimal models: an alternating-coupling setup, in which the qubit sequentially interacts with hot and cold baths, and a simultaneous-coupling setup, where both baths interact with the qubit during each collision. For the alternating model, we obtain an exact analytical solution for the limit-cycle state, valid for arbitrary coupling strengths and collision durations. Using this solution, we rigorously prove a no-go theorem for quantum refrigeration. We further demonstrate that, although work can be generated locally at individual system-bath contacts, the total work over a cycle is always nonpositive, precluding engine operation. In the absence of work, the model describes pure heat conduction, for which we derive a closed-form expression for the heat current and show that it exhibits a nonmonotonic turnover behavior. The simultaneous-coupling model is analyzed perturbatively. In the short-collision-time limit, it reproduces the same steady-state behavior as the alternating model, reinforcing the generality of the constraints identified. Our results establish fundamental limitations on qubit-based quantum thermal machines operating under Markovian repeated interactions and highlight the need for enriched models to realize functional quantum thermal devices.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of a controlled conical geometry on the electric charge transport through a two-dimensional quantum ring weakly coupled to both the emitter and the collector. These mesoscopic systems are known for being able to confine highly mobile electrons in a defined region of matter. In particular, we consider a GaAs device having an average radius of $800\hspace{0.05cm}\text{nm}$ in different regimes of subband occupation at non-zero temperature and under the influence of a weak and uniform background magnetic field. Using the adapted Landauer formula for the resonant tunneling and the energy eigenvalues, we explore how the modified surface affects the Van-Hove conductance singularities, the magnetoresistance interference patterns resulting from the Aharonov-Bohm oscillations of different frequencies and the charge transport when an electric potential is applied in the terminals of the device. Magnetoresistance and charge current oscillations depending only on the curvature intensity are reported, providing a new feature that represents an alternative way to optimize the transport through the device by tuning its geometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Latching techniques are widely used to enhance readout of qubits. These methods require precise tuning of multiple tunnel rates, which can be challenging to achieve under realistic experimental conditions, such as when a qubit is coupled to a single reservoir. Here, we present a method for single-shot measurement of a quantum dot qubit with a single reservoir using a latched-readout scheme. Our approach involves pulsing a barrier gate to dynamically control qubit-to-reservoir tunnel rates, a method that is readily applicable to the latched readout of various spin-based qubits. We use this method to enable qubit state latching and to reduce the qubit reset time in measurements of coherent Larmor oscillations of a Si/SiGe quantum dot hybrid qubit.</description>

Abstract: We study surface plasmons in minimally-twisted gapped bilayer graphene that contains a triangular network of partial dislocations (or AB-BA domain walls) hosting topologically protected one-dimensional electronic states. We show that this system behaves as a plasmonic crystal and we calculate its band structure by solving classical equations of motion for charge dynamics on the network links with impedance boundary conditions at the network nodes. The plasmon dispersion exhibits several notable features such as multiple gapless branches, flat bands, and dissipationless modes at high-symmetry points. We compare our network-based formalism with the conventional random phase approximation and discuss when each approach is valid. Calculations of plasmon waves launched by local scatterers are presented to simulate terahertz nano-imaging experiments.</description>

Abstract: We compute the electronic and emission properties of Coulomb-correlated multi-particle states (X$^0$, X$^\pm$, XX) in weakly confining GaAs/AlGaAs quantum dots using an 8-band $\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{p}$ model coupled to continuum elasticity and configuration interaction (CI). We evaluate polarization-resolved oscillator strengths and radiative rates both in the dipole approximation (DA) and in a quasi-electrostatic beyond-dipole (BDA) longitudinal formulation implemented via a Poisson reformulation exactly equivalent to the dyadic Green-tensor kernel. For the dots studied, BDA yields lifetimes in quantitative agreement with experiment, e.g., $\tau^X=0.279\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.267\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.) and $\tau^{XX}=0.101\,\mathrm{ns}$ vs $0.115\,\mathrm{ns}$ (exp.). The framework also reproduces electric-field tuning of the multi-particle electronic structure and emission-including the indistinguishability inferred from $P=\tau^X/(\tau^X+\tau^{XX})$-and we assess sensitivity to CI-basis size and to electron-electron and hole-hole exchange.</description>

      <title>Laser-Induced Current Transients in Ultrafast All-Optical Switching of Metallic Spin Valves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All-optical switching in a ferromagnetic spin valve is studied here using atomistic spin drift-diffusion dynamics, which includes contributions from spin pumping and superdiffusive transport. We find the switching is governed principally by spin-polarized currents due to non-equilibrium hot electrons excited by the laser pulse and re-equilibration currents. In particular, an initial superdiffusive forward flow of electrons, polarized by the free layer, is generated. This drives parallel to antiparallel switching of the free layer through accumulation of minority spins at the reference layer. A diffusive backward flow of electrons, repolarized by the reference layer, follows the initial superdiffusive flow as the charge distribution re-equilibrates. Due to the pulse width-dependent asymmetric amplitudes of the forward and backward transients, the latter can drive antiparallel to parallel switching, and create multi-domain structures at higher laser fluences and longer pulses. The results obtained here are in agreement with experimental observations, providing a framework for self-consistent modelling of all-optical switching in metallic heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01684v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density function theory is the workhorse of modern electronic structure theory. However, its accuracy in practical calculations is limited by the choice of the exchange-correlation potential. In this respect, two-dimensional materials pose a special challenge, as all these materials and their heterostructures have a crucial similarity. The underlying atomic structures are strongly spatially inhomogeneous, implying that current exchange-correlation functionals, that in almost all cases are isotropic, are ill-prepared for an accurate description. We present an anisotropic screened-exchange potential, that remedies this problem and reproduces the band-gap of 2D materials as well as the piecewise linearity of the total energy with fractional occupation number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In contrast to the usual bulk-boundary correspondence, topological states localized within the bulk of the system have been numerically identified in quasicrystalline structures, termed bulk localized transport (BLT) states. These states exhibit properties different from edge states, one example being that the number of BLT states scales with system size, while the number of edge states scales with system perimeter. Here, we define a procedure to identify BLT states, which is based on the physically motivated crosshair marker and robustness analyses. Applying the procedure to the Hofstadter model on the Ammann-Beenker tiling, we find that the BLT states appear mainly for magnetic fluxes within a specific interval. While edge states appear at low densities of states, we find that BLT states can appear at many different densities of states. Many of the BLT states are found to have real-space localization that follows geometric patterns characteristic of the given quasicrystal. Furthermore, BLT states can appear both isolated and in groups within the energy spectrum which could imply greater robustness for the states within such groups. The spatial localization of the states within a certain group can change depending on the Fermi energy.</description>

      <title>Enabling full localization of qubits and gates with a multi-mode coupler</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tunable couplers are a key building block of superconducting quantum processors, enabling high on-off ratios for two-qubit entangling interactions. While qubit-qubit interaction can be turned off, residual wavefunctions delocalize single-qubit excitations over the device, yielding weak effective couplings that manifest as unintended crosstalk. Moreover, conventional single-mode couplers lack independent control over interactions in the one- and two-excitation manifolds, leading to unitary errors such as leakage during gate operations. Here, we propose a multi-mode tunable coupler that enforces complete localization, yielding near-perfect qubit isolation at the decoupled point. We further show that the additional degrees of freedom in the coupler enable independent and nonlinear control of effective interactions across distinct excitation manifolds, with large on-off ratios. This architecture provides a new route toward the next generation of couplers for scalable and high-fidelity gate operations in superconducting quantum processors.</description>

Abstract: Predicting how organic molecules adsorb, assemble, and interact on metal surfaces is central to surface chemistry and molecular electronics, particularly in the context of interpreting high-resolution scanning probe microscopy. Yet, the application of first-principles simulations to interfaces is hampered by the computational cost for evaluating the electronic structure for the large number of atoms typically involved. We hereby present MAD-SURF, a machine learning interatomic potential specifically tailored for molecular adsorption on coinage metal surfaces. Trained on a broad dataset spanning diverse molecules, adsorption motifs, surfaces, molecular dynamics trajectories and non-covalent aggregates, MAD-SURF achieves accuracy comparable to the underlying DFT reference while enabling simulations orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory. The model reliably reproduces energies, forces and adsorption geometries across the three coinage metal substrates. We demonstrate its capabilities on experimentally characterized systems, including organic monolayers, polycyclic aggregates, flexible biomolecules and the long-range herringbone reconstruction of gold. By merging accuracy, speed, and generalizability, MAD-SURF offers a practical framework for accelerating atomistic simulations and advancing data-driven workflows in surface science.</description>

      <title>Stress-Induced Ferroelectricity in Hafnium Oxide Core-Shell Nanoparticles</title>

Abstract: In contrast to hafnium oxide (HfO2) thin films, where the appearance of switchable ferroelectric polarization can be induced by strain engineering, reliable methods for controlling ferroelectricity are absent in HfO2 nanoparticles. Direct experimental observations of ferroelectric hysteresis and/or ferroelectric domains in the nanoparticles are absent too. To the best of our knowledge, the possibility of stress-induced ferroelectric states in the HfO2 nanoparticles was not explored. In this work, we study the influence of chemical stress on phase diagrams, dielectric and polar properties of spherical HfO2 core-shell nanoparticles using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional that includes higher-order contributions together with trilinear and biquadratic couplings involving polar, antipolar, and nonpolar order parameters. The ferroelectric phase exhibits reentrant behavior as a function of nanoparticle size, such that the spontaneous polarization exists only within a limited range of core radii R_c, namely R_cr^min&lt;R_c&lt;R_cr^max. The minimal critical radius R_cr^min is primarily determined by the size dependence of the depolarization field and correlation effects; the maximal critical radius R_cr^max is primarily determined by the size dependence of chemical stresses induced by the elastic defects in the shell. Thus, this work identifies a stress-driven mechanism for reentrant ferroelectricity stabilization in nanoscale hafnia-zirconia, arising from the competition between depolarization field-induced suppression of ferroelectricity and its support by shell-induced chemical stress.</description>
