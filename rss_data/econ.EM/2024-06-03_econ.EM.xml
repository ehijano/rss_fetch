      <title>Transforming Japan Real Estate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Japanese real estate market, valued over 35 trillion USD, offers significant investment opportunities. Accurate rent and price forecasting could provide a substantial competitive edge. This paper explores using alternative data variables to predict real estate performance in 1100 Japanese municipalities. A comprehensive house price index was created, covering all municipalities from 2005 to the present, using a dataset of over 5 million transactions. This core dataset was enriched with economic factors spanning decades, allowing for price trajectory predictions.
  The findings show that alternative data variables can indeed forecast real estate performance effectively. Investment signals based on these variables yielded notable returns with low volatility. For example, the net migration ratio delivered an annualized return of 4.6% with a Sharpe ratio of 1.5. Taxable income growth and new dwellings ratio also performed well, with annualized returns of 4.1% (Sharpe ratio of 1.3) and 3.3% (Sharpe ratio of 0.9), respectively. When combined with transformer models to predict risk-adjusted returns 4 years in advance, the model achieved an R-squared score of 0.28, explaining nearly 30% of the variation in future municipality prices.
  These results highlight the potential of alternative data variables in real estate investment. They underscore the need for further research to identify more predictive factors. Nonetheless, the evidence suggests that such data can provide valuable insights into real estate price drivers, enabling more informed investment decisions in the Japanese market.</description>

      <title>Approximate Factor Models for Functional Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.02532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.02532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel approximate factor model tailored for analyzing time-dependent curve data. Our model decomposes such data into two distinct components: a low-dimensional predictable factor component and an unpredictable error term. These components are identified through the autocovariance structure of the underlying functional time series. The model parameters are consistently estimated using the eigencomponents of a cumulative autocovariance operator and an information criterion is proposed to determine the appropriate number of factors. The methodology is applied to yield curve modeling and forecasting. Our results indicate that more than three factors are required to characterize the dynamics of the term structure of bond yields.</description>

      <title>Fast Forecasting of Unstable Data Streams for On-Demand Service Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.01887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.01887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On-demand service platforms face a challenging problem of forecasting a large collection of high-frequency regional demand data streams that exhibit instabilities. This paper develops a novel forecast framework that is fast and scalable, and automatically assesses changing environments without human intervention. We empirically test our framework on a large-scale demand data set from a leading on-demand delivery platform in Europe, and find strong performance gains from using our framework against several industry benchmarks, across all geographical regions, loss functions, and both pre- and post-Covid periods. We translate forecast gains to economic impacts for this on-demand service platform by computing financial gains and reductions in computing costs.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric estimation of conditional densities by generalized random forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13251v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Considering a continuous random variable $Y$ together with a continuous random vector $X$, I propose a nonparametric estimator $\hat{f}(\cdot|x)$ for the conditional density of $Y$ given $X=x$. This estimator takes the form of an exponential series whose coefficients $\hat{\theta}_{x}=(\hat{\theta}_{x,1}, \dots,\hat{\theta}_{x,J})$ are the solution of a system of nonlinear equations that depends on an estimator of the conditional expectation $E[\phi (Y)|X=x]$, where $\phi$ is a $J$-dimensional vector of basis functions. The distinguishing feature of the proposed estimator is that $E[\phi(Y)|X=x]$ is estimated by generalized random forest (Athey, Tibshirani, and Wager, Annals of Statistics, 2019), targeting the heterogeneity of $\hat{\theta}_{x}$ across $x$. I show that $\hat{f}(\cdot|x)$ is uniformly consistent and asymptotically normal, allowing $J \rightarrow \infty$. I also provide a standard error formula to construct asymptotically valid confidence intervals. Results from Monte Carlo experiments and an empirical illustration are provided.</description>

      <title>Cross-Temporal Forecast Reconciliation at Digital Platforms with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09033v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Platform businesses operate on a digital core and their decision making requires high-dimensional accurate forecast streams at different levels of cross-sectional (e.g., geographical regions) and temporal aggregation (e.g., minutes to days). It also necessitates coherent forecasts across all levels of the hierarchy to ensure aligned decision making across different planning units such as pricing, product, controlling and strategy. Given that platform data streams feature complex characteristics and interdependencies, we introduce a non-linear hierarchical forecast reconciliation method that produces cross-temporal reconciled forecasts in a direct and automated way through the use of popular machine learning methods. The method is sufficiently fast to allow forecast-based high-frequency decision making that platforms require. We empirically test our framework on unique, large-scale streaming datasets from a leading on-demand delivery platform in Europe and a bicycle sharing system in New York City.</description>

      <title>Correlated Dynamics in Marketing Sensitivities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.11702v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding individual customers' sensitivities to prices, promotions, brands, and other marketing mix elements is fundamental to a wide swath of marketing problems. An important but understudied aspect of this problem is the dynamic nature of these sensitivities, which change over time and vary across individuals. Prior work has developed methods for capturing such dynamic heterogeneity within product categories, but neglected the possibility of correlated dynamics across categories. In this work, we introduce a framework to capture such correlated dynamics using a hierarchical dynamic factor model, where individual preference parameters are influenced by common cross-category dynamic latent factors, estimated through Bayesian nonparametric Gaussian processes. We apply our model to grocery purchase data, and find that a surprising degree of dynamic heterogeneity can be accounted for by only a few global trends. We also characterize the patterns in how consumers' sensitivities evolve across categories. Managerially, the proposed framework not only enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging cross-category data, but enables more precise estimation of quantities of interest, like price elasticity.</description>
