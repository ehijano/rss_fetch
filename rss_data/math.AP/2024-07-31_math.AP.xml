      <title>Optimal Boundary Control for the Stochastic Allen-Cahn Navier-Stokes system in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study an optimal boundary control for the stochastic Allen Cahn Navier Stokes system. The governing system of nonlinear partial differential equations consists of the stochastic Navier Stokes equations with non homogeneous Navier slip boundary condition coupled with a phase-field equation, which is the convective Allen Cahn equation type. We investigate the well posedness of the nonlinear system. More precisely, the existence and uniqueness of global strong solution in dimension two is established and we prove the existence of an optimal solution to the control problem.</description>

      <title>Non-uniqueness of H\"older continuous solutions for stochastic Euler and Hypodissipative Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we construct infinitely many H\"older continuous global-in-time and stationary solutions to the stochastic Euler and hypodissipative Navier-Stokes equations in the space $C(\mathbb{R};C^{\vartheta})$ for $0&lt;\vartheta&lt;\frac{5}{7}\beta$, with $0&lt;\beta&lt; \frac{1}{24}$ and $0&lt;\beta&lt;\min\left\{\frac{1-2\alpha}{3},\frac{1}{24}\right\}$ respectively. A modified stochastic convex integration scheme, using Beltrami flows as building blocks and propagating inductive estimates both pathwise and in expectation, plays a pivotal role to improve the regularity of H\"older continuous solutions for the underlying equations. As a main novelty with respect to the related literature, our result produces solutions with noteworthy H\"older exponents.</description>

      <title>A sharp quantitative nonlinear Poincar\'e inequality on convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $p \in ( 1, +\infty)$, we give a new inequality for the first nontrivial Neumann eigenvalue $\mu _ p (\Omega, \varphi)$ of the $p$-Laplacian on a convex domain $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^N$ with a power-concave weight $\varphi$. Our result improves the classical estimate in terms of the diameter, first stated in a seminal paper by Payne and Weinberger: we add in the lower bound an extra term depending on the second largest John semi-axis of $\Omega$ (equivalent to a power of the width in the special case $N = 2$). The power exponent in the extra term is sharp, and the constant in front of it is explicitly tracked, thus enlightening the interplay between space dimension, nonlinearity and power-concavity. Moreover, we attack the stability question: we prove that, if $\mu _ p (\Omega, \varphi)$ is close to the lower bound, then $\Omega$ is close to a thin cylinder, and $\varphi$ is close to a function which is constant along its axis. As intermediate results, we establish a sharp $L^ \infty$ estimate for the associated eigenfunctions, and we determine the asymptotic behaviour of $\mu _ p (\Omega, \varphi)$ for varying weights and domains, including the case of collapsing geometries.</description>

      <title>Solvability of the Neumann problem for elliptic equations in chord-arc domains with very big pieces of good superdomains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ be a bounded chord-arc domain, let $\mathcal L=-{\rm div} A\nabla$ be an elliptic operator in $\Omega$, and let $1&lt;p\leq 2$. In this paper we show that if the regularity problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable in $L^q$ for some $q&gt;p$ in $\Omega$, $\partial \Omega$ supports a weak $p$-Poincar\'e inequality, and $\Omega$ has very big pieces of superdomains for which the Neumann problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable uniformly in $L^q$, then the Neumann problem for $\mathcal L$ is solvable in $L^p$ in $\Omega$.</description>

      <title>$C^\infty$ regularity in semilinear free boundary problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the higher regularity of solutions and free boundaries in the Alt-Phillips problem $\Delta u=u^{\gamma-1}$, with $\gamma\in(0,1)$. Our main results imply that, once free boundaries are $C^{1,\alpha}$, then they are $C^\infty$. In addition $u/d^{\frac{2}{2-\gamma}}$ and $u^{\frac{2-\gamma}{2}}$ are $C^\infty$ too.
  In order to achieve this, we need to establish fine regularity estimates for solutions of linear equations with boundary-singular Hardy potentials $-\Delta v = \kappa v/d^2$ in $\Omega$, where $d$ is the distance to the boundary and $\kappa\leq\frac{1}{4}$. Interestingly, we need to include even the critical constant $\kappa=\frac{1}{4}$, which corresponds to $\gamma=\frac{2}{3}$.</description>

      <title>A regularity result of Cauchy problem of the ideal incompressible Magnetohydrodynamics equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under a homogeneous magnetic field, we establish the local well-posedness of low-regularity solutions for an ideal incompressible Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) system in Lagrangian coordinates. Firstly, we reduce the MHD system to a degenerate wave-elliptic system inherent with a specific null form. After constructing a new solution space, we can prove some good product estimates. Combined with the inside null structure, a bilinear estimate of the Klainerman-Machedon's type for nonlinear terms can be obtained. These lead us to prove the local well-posedness of ideal incompressible MHD equations in Lagrangian coordinates if the initial velocity $\bv_0 \in H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^n), s&gt; \frac{n+1}{2}$ $(n=2,3)$. So our result lowers $\frac12$-order regularity comparing with the classical exponent $s&gt;1+\frac{n}{2}$. Moreover, to the author's knowledge, this is the first result concerning low-regularity solutions of the ideal MHD equations.</description>

      <title>An anisotropic traffic flow model with look-ahead effect for mixed autonomy traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) non-equilibrium traffic flow model to take into account the look-ahead capability of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), and the mixed flow dynamics of human driven and autonomous vehicles. The look-ahead effect of CAVs is captured by a non-local averaged density within a certain distance (the look-ahead distance). We show, using wave perturbation analysis, that increased look-ahead distance loosens the stability criteria. Our numerical experiments, however, showed that a longer look-ahead distance does not necessarily lead to faster convergence to equilibrium states. We also examined the impact of spatial distributions and market penetrations of CAVs and showed that increased market penetration helps stabilizing mixed traffic while the spatial distribution of CAVs have less effect on stability. The results revealed the potential of using CAVs to stabilize traffic, and may provide qualitative insights on speed control in the mixed autonomy environment.</description>

      <title>Positive solutions with prescribed mass for a planar Choquard equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study normalised solutions for a Choquard equation in the plane with polynomial Riesz kernel and exponential nonlinearities, which are critical in the sense of Trudinger-Moser. For all prescribed values of the mass, we prove existence of a positive radial solution by a variational argument, which exploits a delicate analysis on the mountain pass level. Under an additional monotonicity assumption on the nonlinearity, such a solution turns out to be also a ground state in $H^1(\mathbb R^2)$. Our work extends in several directions the results by Deng-Yu.</description>

      <title>H\"older regularity of harmonic functions on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the H\"older regularity condition for harmonic functions on metric measure spaces and prove that under mild volume regular condition and upper heat kernel estimate, the H\"older regularity condition, the weak Bakry-\'Emery non-negative curvature condition, the heat kernel H\"older continuity with or without exponential terms and the heat kernel near-diagonal lower bound are equivalent. As applications, firstly, we prove the validity of the so-called generalized reverse H\"older inequality on the Sierpi\'nski carpet cable system, which was left open by Devyver, Russ, Yang (Int. Math. Res. Not. IMRN (2023), no. 18, 15537-15583). Secondly, we prove that two-sided heat kernel estimates alone imply gradient estimate for the heat kernel on strongly recurrent fractal-like cable systems, which improves the main results of the aforementioned paper. Thirdly, we obtain H\"older (Lipschitz) estimate for heat kernel on general metric measure spaces, which extends the classical Li-Yau gradient estimate for heat kernel on Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>The incompressible Navier-Stokes limit from the lattice BGK Boltzmann equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that a local weak solution to the $d$-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations ($d \geq 2$) can be constructed by taking the hydrodynamic limit of a velocity-discretized Boltzmann equation with a simplified BGK collision operator. Moreover, in the case when the dimension is $d=2,3$, we characterize the combinations of finitely many particle velocities and probabilities that lead to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations in the hydrodynamic limit. Numerical computations conducted in 2D provide information about the rate with which this hydrodynamic limit is achieved when the Knudsen number tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Quantitative spectral stability for compact operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with quantitative spectral stability for compact operators acting on $L^2(X,m)$, where $(X,m)$ is a measure space. Under fairly general assumptions, we provide a characterization of the dominant term of the asymptotic expansion of the eigenvalue variation in this abstract setting. Many of the results about quantitative spectral stability available in the literature can be recovered by our analysis. Furthermore, we illustrate our result with several applications, e.g. quantitative spectral stability for a Robin to Neumann problem, conformal transformations of Riemann metrics, Dirichlet forms under the removal of sets of small capacity, and for families of pseudo-differentials operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a symmetrization with respect to mixed volumes of convex sets, for which a P\'olya-Szeg\"o type inequality holds. We improve the P\'olya-Szeg\"o for the $k$-Hessian integral in a
  quantitative way, and, with similar arguments, we show a quantitative inequality for the comparison proved by Tso for solutions to the $k$-Hessian equation. As an application of the first result we prove a quantitative version of the Faber-Krahn and Saint-Venant inequalities for these equations.</description>

      <title>A second-order Mean Field Games model with controlled diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFG) theory describes strategic interactions in differential games with a large number of small and indistinguishable players. Traditionally, the players' control impacts only the drift term in the system's dynamics, leaving the diffusion term uncontrolled. This paper explores a novel scenario where agents control both drift and diffusion. This leads to a fully non-linear MFG system with a fully non-linear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. We use viscosity arguments to prove existence of solutions for the HJB equation, and then we adapt and extend a result from Krylov to prove a $\mathcal C^3$ regularity for $u$ in the space variable. This allows us to prove a well-posedness result for the MFG system.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of a 2x2 Keyfitz-Kranzer Type Balance System with Varying Generalized Chaplygin Gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a system of two balance laws of Keyfitz-Kranzer type with varying generalized Chaplygin gas, which exhibits negative pressure and is a product of a function of time and the inverse of a power of the density. The Chaplygin gas is a fluid designed to accommodate measurements for the early universe and late-time universal expansion while obeying the pressure-density-time relation. We produce an explanation and description of the non-self-similar Riemann solutions, including the non-classical singular solutions. We also find that due to a direct dependence on time, a change in the regions allowing for combinations of classical and non-classical singular solutions occurs, therefore a Riemann solution can have different solutions over several time intervals. Our findings are confirmed numerically using the local Lax-Friederichs scheme.</description>

      <title>The Weighted Inertia-Energy-Dissipation Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weighted Inertia-Energy-Dissipation (WIDE) principle is a global variational approach to nonlinear evolution equations of parabolic and hyperbolic type. The minimization of the parameter-dependent WIDE functional on trajectories delivers an elliptic-in-time regularization. By taking the limit in the parameter, one recovers a solution to the given differential problem. This survey is intended to provide a comprehensive account of the available results on the WIDE variational approach. The basic concepts are illustrated in the simplest finite-dimensional case, and the existing literature, both theoretical and applied, is systematically reviewed.</description>

      <title>Global smooth solutions of 2D quasilinear wave equations with higher order null conditions and short pulse initial data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the short pulse initial data with a first order outgoing constraint condition and optimal orders of smallness, we establish the global existence of smooth solutions to 2D quasilinear wave equations with higher order null conditions. Such kinds of wave equations include 2D relativistic membrane equations, 2D membrane equations, and some 2D quasilinear equations which come from the nonlinear Maxwell equations in electromagnetic theory or from the corresponding Lagrangian functionals as perturbations of the Lagrangian densities of linear wave operators. The main ingredients of the analysis here include looking for a new good unknown, finding some key identities based on the higher order null conditions and the resulting null frames, as well as overcoming the difficulties due to the slow decay of solutions to the 2-D wave equation, so that the solutions can be estimated precisely.</description>

      <title>Observability of the heat equation from very small sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20954v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the heat equation set on a bounded $C^1$ domain of $\mathbb R^n$ with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The first purpose of this paper is to prove that the heat equation is observable from any measurable set $\omega$ with positive $(n-1+\delta)$-Hausdorff content, for $\delta &gt;0$ arbitrary small. The proof relies on a new spectral estimate for linear combinations of Laplace eigenfunctions, obtained via a Remez type inequality, and the use of the so-called Lebeau-Robbiano's method. Even if this observability result is sharp with respect to the scale of Hausdorff dimension, our second goal is to construct families of sets $\omega$ which have codimension greater than or equal to $1$ for which the heat equation remains observable.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics in all regimes for the Schr\"odinger equation with time-independent coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20991</link>

Abstract: Using the recent analysis of the output of the low-energy resolvent of Schr\"odinger operators on asymptotically conic manifolds (including Euclidean space) when the potential is short-range, we produce detailed asymptotic expansions for the solutions of the initial-value problem for the Schr\"odinger equation (assuming Schwartz initial data). Asymptotics are calculated in all joint large-radii large-time regimes, these corresponding to the boundary hypersurfaces of a particular compactification of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Stackelberg-Nash null controllability for stochastic parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a hierarchical control problem for stochastic parabolic equations involving gradient terms. We employ the Stackelberg-Nash strategy with two leaders and two followers. The leaders are responsible for selecting the policy targeting null controllability, while the followers solve a bi-objective optimal control problem which consists of maintaining the solution process close to prefixed targets. Once the Nash equilibrium is determined, the problem reduces to achieving null controllability of a coupled forward-backward stochastic system. To solve this problem, via Carleman estimates, we establish a suitable observability inequality. Subsequently, we achieve the desired controllability result.</description>

      <title>Malliavin Calculus for the one-dimensional Stochastic Stefan Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the one-dimensional outer stochastic Stefan problem with reflection which models the short-time prediction of the price or spread of one volatile asset traded in a financial market. The problem admits maximal solutions as long as the velocity of the moving boundary stays bounded, [3,6,7]. We apply Malliavin calculus on the transformed equation and prove first that its maximal solution u has continuous paths a.s. In the case of the unreflected problem, the previous enables localization of a proper approximating sequence of the maximal solution. Then, we derive there locally the differentiability of maximal $u$ in the Malliavin sense. The novelty of this work, apart from the derivation of continuity of the paths for the maximal solution with reflection, is that for the unreflected case we introduce a localization argument on maximal solutions and define efficiently the relevant sample space. More precisely, we present a methodology suitable for the proof of the expected local only (in the sample space) existence of the Malliavin derivative.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we prove that the completeness of the Hamilton flow and essential self-adjointness are equivalent for real principal type operators on the circle. Moreover, we study spectral properties of these operators. The proof is based on the construction of eigenfunctions with non-real eigenvalues which is well-known in scattering theory. Moreover, the relationship between scattering theory and the essential self-adjointness is explained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03600v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider 3D compressible isentropic Euler equations describing the motion of a liquid in an unbounded initial domain with a moving boundary and a fixed flat bottom at finite depth. The liquid is under the influence of gravity and surface tension and it is not assumed to be irrotational. We prove local well-posedness by combining a carefully designed approximate system and a hyperbolic approach which allows us to avoid using Nash-Moser iteration. The energy estimates yield no regularity loss and are uniform in Mach number, and they are uniform in surface tension coefficient under the Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition. We thus simultaneously obtain incompressible and zero surface tension limits. Moreover, we can drop the uniform boundedness (with respect to Mach number) on high-order time derivatives by applying the paradifferential calculus to the analysis of the free-surface evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06198v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study $m$-order logarithmic Laplacian $\mathcal{L}_m$, which is a singular integro-differential operator with symbol $\big(2\ln |\cdot|\big)^m$ by the Fourier transform. With help of these logarithmic Laplacians, we build the $n$-th order Taylor expansion for fractional Laplacian with respect to the order and the Riesz operators: for $u \in C^\infty_c(\mathbb{R}^N)$ and $x \in \mathbb{R}^N$, $$
  (-\Delta)^s u (x) = u(x) + \sum^{n}_{m=1} \frac{s^m}{m!}\mathcal{L}_mu(x) + o(s^n) \quad {\rm as}\ \, s\to 0^+ $$ and $$ \big(\Phi_s\ast u\big)(x) = u(x) + \sum^{n}_{m=1}(-1)^m\frac{s^m}{m!}\mathcal{L}_mu(x) + o(s^n) \quad {\rm as}\ \, s\to 0^+, $$ where $ (-\Delta)^s$ is the $s$-fractional Laplacian, $\Phi_s\ast u$ is $s$-order of Riesz operator with the form $\Phi_s(x)=\kappa_{N,s}|x|^{2s-N}$ in $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus\{0\}$.
  Moreover, we analyze qualitative properties of these operators based on the order $m$, such as basic regularity and the Dirichlet eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>A rigorous approach to the sharp interface limit for phase-field models of tumor growth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider two diffuse interface models for tumor growth coupling a Cahn-Hilliard type equation for the tumor phase parameter to a reaction-diffusion type equation for the nutrient. The models are distinguished by the presence of two different coupling source terms. For such problems, we address the question of the limit, as the diffuse interface parameter tends to zero, from diffuse interface models to sharp interface ones, justifying rigorously what was deduced via formal asymptotics in [20]. The resulting evolutions turn out to be varifold solutions to Mullins-Sekerka type flows for the tumor region suitably coupled with the equation for the nutrient.</description>

      <title>Sharp isoanisotropic estimates for fundamental frequencies of membranes and connections with shapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18683v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The underlying motivation of the present work lies on one of the cornerstone problems in spectral optimization that consists of determining sharp lower and upper uniform estimates for fundamental frequencies of a set of uniformly elliptic operators on a given membrane. Our approach allows to give a complete solution of the problem for the general class of anisotropic operators in divergence form generated by arbitrary norms on R^2, including the computation of optimal constants and the characterization of all anisotropic extremizers. Such achievements demand that isoanisotropic type problems be addressed within the broader environment of nonnegative, convex and 1-homogeneous anisotropies and involve a deep and fine analysis of least energy levels associated to anisotropies with maximum degeneracy. As a central outcome we find out a key close relation between shapes and fundamental frequencies for rather degenerate elliptic operators. Our findings also permit to establish that the supremum of anisotropic fundamental frequencies over all fixed-area membranes is infinite for any nonzero anisotropy. This particularly proves the well-known maximization conjecture for fundamental frequencies of the p-laplacian for any p other than 2. Our new sharp lower estimate is just the planar isoanisotropic counterpart of the Faber-Krahn isoperimetric inequality and for the associated optimal constant we provide optimal geometric controls through isodiametric and isoperimetric shape optimization.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions for semilinear waves on asymptotically flat spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08997v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish precise asymptotic expansions for solutions to semilinear wave equations with power-type nonlinearities on asymptotically flat spacetimes. For cubic nonlinearities $a(t,x)\phi^3$, we prove $\phi(t, x) = 2c t^{-2} + O(t^{-3+})$ in compact spatial regions, with $c$ computable. For $a(t,x)\phi^p$ with $p \geq 4$, we show $\phi(t, x) = d t^{-3} + O(t^{-4+})$, extending Price's law to the nonlinear setting. Our approach combines radiation field analysis with a generalized low-energy resolvent expansion, providing a bridge between spectral and physical space methods. These results sharpen previous decay estimates and yield complete asymptotics across the entire spacetime, including black hole backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Comparing three possible hypoelliptic Laplacians on the 5-dimensional Cartan group via div-curl type estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On general Carnot groups, the definition of a possible hypoelliptic Hodge-Laplacian on forms using the Rumin complex has been considered by Rumin, who introduced a 0-order pseudodifferential operator on forms. However, for questions regarding regularity for example, where one needs sharp estimates, this 0-order operator is not suitable. Up to now, there have only been very few attempts to define hypoelliptic Hodge-Laplacians on forms that would allow for such sharp estimates. Indeed, this question is rather difficult to address in full generality, the main issue being that the Rumin exterior differential $d_c$ is not homogeneous on arbitrary Carnot groups.
  In this note, we consider the specific example of the free Carnot group of step 3 with 2 generators, and we introduce three possible definitions of hypoelliptic Hodge-Laplacians. We compare how these three possible Laplacians can be used to obtain sharp div-curl type inequalities akin to those considered by Bourgain &amp; Brezis and Lanzani &amp; Stein for the de Rham complex, or their subelliptic counterparts obtained by Baldi, Franchi &amp; Pansu for the Rumin complex on Heisenberg groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15230v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider minimizers of the one-phase Bernoulli free boundary problem in domains with analytic fixed boundary. In any dimension $d$, we prove that the branching set at the boundary has Hausdorff dimension at most $d-2$. As a consequence, we also obtain an analogous estimate on the branching set for solutions to the two-phase problem under an analytic separation condition. Moreover, as a byproduct of our analysis we obtain strong boundary unique continuation results for quasilinear operators and thin-obstacle variational inequalities. The approach we use is based on the (almost-)monotonicity of a boundary Almgren-type frequency function, obtained via regularity estimates and a Calder\'on-Zygmund decomposition in the spirit of Almgren-De Lellis-Spadaro.</description>

Given two sufficiently close subintervals $I=[\alpha_1,\alpha_2]$ and $J=[\beta_1,\beta_2]$ of $(0,1)$, a nonempty open set $\omega \subset (1,\pi)$, and $T&gt;0$, we construct an external force $f$ supported in $\omega$ acting on the momentum equation such that the corresponding flow map moves the fluid particles initially occupying $I$ exactly onto $J$ in time $T$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01702v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicit solutions to the non-linear field equations of some gravitational theories can be obtained, by means of a Riemann-Hilbert approach, from a canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation of certain matrix functions called monodromy matrices. In this paper we describe other types of factorisation from which solutions can be constructed in a similar way. Our approach is based on an invariance problem, which does not constitute a Riemann-Hilbert problem and allows to construct solutions that could not have been obtained by Wiener-Hopf factorisation of a monodromy matrix. It gives rise to a novel solution generating method based on matrix multiplications. We show, in particular, that new solutions can be obtained by multiplicative deformation of the canonical Wiener-Hopf factorisation, provided the latter exists, and that one can superpose such solutions. Examples of applications include Kasner, Einstein-Rosen wave and gravitational pulse wave solutions.</description>

      <title>A stochastic perturbation approach to nonlinear bifurcating problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16803v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incorporating probabilistic terms in mathematical models is crucial for capturing and quantifying uncertainties of real-world systems. However, stochastic models typically require large computational resources to produce meaningful statistics. For such reason, the development of reduction techniques becomes essential for enabling efficient and scalable simulations of complex scenarios while quantifying the underlying uncertainties. In this work, we study the accuracy of Polynomial Chaos (PC) surrogate expansion of the probability space on a bifurcating phenomena in fluid dynamics, namely the Coand\u{a} effect. In particular, we propose a novel non-deterministic approach to generic bifurcation problems, where the stochastic setting gives a different perspective on the non-uniqueness of the solution, also avoiding expensive simulations for many instances of the parameter. Thus, starting from the formulation of the Spectral Stochastic Finite Element Method (SSFEM), we extend the methodology to deal with solutions of a bifurcating problem, by working with a perturbed version of the deterministic model. We discuss the link between the deterministic and the stochastic bifurcation diagram, highlighting the surprising capability of PC polynomials coefficients of giving insights on the deterministic solution manifold.</description>
