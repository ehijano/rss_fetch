      <title>113 km absolute ranging with nanometer precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate long-distance ranging is crucial for diverse applications, including satellite formation flying, very-long-baseline interferometry, gravitational-wave observatory, geographical research, etc. The integration of the time-of-flight mesurement with phase interference in dual-comb method enables high-precision ranging with a rapid update rate and an extended ambiguity range. Pioneering experiments have demonstrated unprecedented precision in ranging, achieving 5 nm @ 60 ms for 1.1 m and 200 nm @ 0.5 s for 25 m. However, long-distance ranging remains technically challenging due to high transmission loss and noise. In this letter, we propose a two-way dual-comb ranging (TWDCR) approach that enables successful ranging over a distance of 113 kilometers. We employ air dispersion analysis and synthetic repetition rate technique to extend the ambiguity range of the inherently noisy channel beyond 100 km. The achieved ranging precision is 11.5 $\mu$m @ 1.3 ms, 681 nm @ 1 s, and 82 nm @ 21 s, as confirmed through a comparative analysis of two independent systems. The advanced long-distance ranging technology is expected to have immediate implications for space research initiatives, such as the space telescope array and the satellite gravimetry.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable chiral edge states in synthetic dimensions on an integrated photonic chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chiral edge state is a hallmark of topological physics, which has drawn significant attention across quantum mechanics, condensed matter and optical systems. Recently, synthetic dimensions have emerged as ideal platforms for investigating chiral edge states in multiple dimensions, overcoming the limitations of real space. In this work, we demonstrate reconfigurable chiral edge states via synthetic dimensions on an integrated photonic chip. These states are realized by coupling two frequency lattices with opposite pseudospins, which are subjected to programmable artificial gauge potential and long-range coupling within a thin-film lithium niobate microring resonator. Within this system, we are able to implement versatile strategies to observe and steer the chiral edge states, including the realization and frustration of the chiral edge states in a synthetic Hall ladder, the generation of imbalanced chiral edge currents, and the regulation of chiral behaviors as chirality, single-pseudospin enhancement, and complete suppression. This work provides a reconfigurable integrated photonic platform for simulating and steering chiral edge states in synthetic space, paying the way for the realization of high-dimensional and programmable topological photonic systems on chip.</description>

      <title>High SNR 3D Imaging from Millimeter-scale Thick Tissues to Cellular Dynamics via Structured Illumination Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) fluorescence imaging provides a vital approach for study of biological tissues with intricate structures, and optical sectioning structured illumination microscopy (OS-SIM) stands out for its high imaging speed, low phototoxicity and high spatial resolution. However, OS-SIM faces the problem of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) when using traditional decoding algorithms, especially in thick tissues. Here we propose a Hilbert-transform decoding and space domain based high-low (HT-SHiLo) algorithm for noise suppression in OS-SIM. We demonstrate HT-SHiLo algorithm can significantly improve the SNR of optical sectioning images at rapid processing speed, and double the imaging depth in thick tissues. With our OS-SIM system, we achieve high quality 3D images of various biological samples including mouse brains, Drosophila clock neurons, organoids, and live cells. We anticipate that this approach will render OS-SIM a powerful technique for research of cellular organelles or thick tissues in 3D morphology.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic Electro-Optic Modulators based on Epsilon-Near-Zero Materials: Comparing the Classical Drift-Diffusion and Schr\"odinger-Poisson Coupling Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design, modeling, and optimization of high-performance plasmonic electro-optic modulators leveraging voltage-gated carrier density in indium tin oxide (ITO) where the gated carrier density is modeled using both the Classical Drift-Diffusion (CDD) and Schr\"odinger-Poisson Coupling (SPC) methods. The latter ensures a more detailed and precise description of carrier distributions under various gate voltages which gains particular significance when applied to an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) medium such as ITO. Combining the nanoscale confinement and field enhancement enabled by surface plasmon polaritons with the ENZ effect in ITO, modulator designs integrated with silicon waveguides and optimized for operation at {\lambda}0 = 1550 nm achieve a 3-dB bandwidth of 210 GHz, an insertion loss of 3 dB, and an extinction ratio of 5 dB for an overall length of &lt; 4 {\mu}m as predicted by the SPC model. Our results illustrate trade-offs between high-speed modulator operation and low insertion loss, vs. extinction ratio, and the need for precise modelling of carrier distributions in ENZ materials.</description>

      <title>Multifunctional passive metacrystals for enhancing wireless communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent surfaces have emerged as a promising solution to enhance coverage and mitigate signal fading in future wireless communication systems, thereby improving bandwidth and data rates. Passive intelligent surfaces, in particular, demonstrate significant potential for reducing both energy consumption and operational costs. However, their current functionalities are typically constrained to operation within a single polarization, frequency band, and angle of arrival, limiting their applicability in realistic scenarios. In this work, we introduce volumetric dielectric composites, referred to as metacrystals, which are designed through computer optimization to greatly extend the capabilities of intelligent surfaces. Owing to their three-dimensional geometry, which supports a large number of degrees of freedom, metacrystals can simultaneously provide complex multiplexing responses for multiple signals. Each signal can be characterized by distinct parameters, including polarization, angle of incidence, frequency, and/or orbital angular momentum. The proposed metacrystals feature binarized permittivity contrast between low-permittivity materials and air gaps, and can thus be fabricated using filament-based additive manufacturing, supporting frequencies up to 100 GHz. By being cost-effective and scalable, these structures are well-suited for industrial applications, such as integration into building walls, where they can redirect or absorb signals in both indoor and outdoor environments with high versatility at millimeter-wave frequencies and beyond.</description>

      <title>Spatio-spectral light modulator of XUV high harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-order harmonic generation (HHG), characterized by its highly nonlinear nature, often exhibits a complex spatio-temporal profile that poses challenges for practical applications. In this study, we unveil a method for manipulating the spatio-spectral distribution of HHG by guiding the recollision electron trajectory in the spatio-temporal domain using a control field. The resulting far-field high harmonic (HH) radiation inherits the intricate spatio-temporal characteristics of the control field, showcasing diverse features including spatial tilting, spectral shifting, and emission angle deflection. Using the relative delay between the control field and the driving pulse as the primary control parameter, we achieve precise tailoring of the high harmonics in the spatio-spectral domain. This controllability in HH benefits ultrafast metrology and imaging applications in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) regime.</description>

      <title>A high-performance all-silicon photodetector enabling telecom-wavelength detection at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are crucial for advancing optical communications, promising substantial gains in data transmission speed, bandwidth, and energy efficiency compared to conventional electronics. Telecom-wavelength photodetectors, operating near 1550 nm, are indispensable in PICs, where they enable the sensitive and low-noise conversion of optical signals to electrical signals for efficient data processing. While silicon is ideal for passive optical components, its limited absorption in the optical telecommunication range (1260-1625 nm) typically necessitates integrating an alternative material, such as germanium, for photodetection - a process that introduces significant fabrication challenges. Here, we present a high-performance, all-silicon photodetector, grating- and waveguide-coupled, which operates at room temperature within the optical telecom C band. By introducing deep-level impurities into silicon at concentrations close to the solid-solubility limit, we enable efficient sub-bandgap absorption without compromising recombination carrier lifetimes and mobilities. This detector achieves a responsivity of 0.56 A/W, a quantum efficiency of 44.8%, a bandwidth of 5.9 GHz, and a noise-equivalent power of 4.2E-10 W/(Hz)1/2 at 1550 nm, fulfilling requirements for telecom applications. Our approach provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for the monolithic integration of telecom-wavelength photodetectors into silicon-based PICs, advancing the development of compact photonic systems for modern communication infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Electronic Light Scattering Drives Optical Heating of Nonlocal Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light absorption in opaque solids is directly governed by optical transitions between the electronic states near the bandgap. This physical mechanism underlies the optical heating of a medium that efficiently absorbs light at resonance. However, such a strategy is true for a homogeneous bulk medium that is temporally dispersive. This work focuses on the optical heating of spatially dispersive (or nonlocal) materials due to broadband inelastic light scattering rather than absorption. A light-induced optical inhomogeneity (vacancy, ad-atom, etc.) produces an optical near-field photon with expanded momentum that enhances light-matter interaction. As a result, indirect optical transitions become accessible throughout the entire Brillouin zone due to electron-photon momentum matching. The real refractive index of nonlocal media can greatly increase over a wide spectral range beyond resonance. According to the Kramers-Kronig relation, such nonlocal media can capture light solely through electronic light scattering. Herein, we experimentally demonstrate this effect by melting spatially confined semiconductors (silicon atomic-force-microscopy cantilever) and metals (gold shear-force-microscopy tip) under off-resonance continuous-wave laser pump. Light scattering based on electron-photon interaction becomes the dominant physical process in media with strong spatial dispersion. These findings will be critical for cutting-edge technologies in optoelectronics, photovoltaics, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Phase-locked feed forward stabilization for dual comb spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sustained mutual coherence between two combs over extended periods is a prerequisite for dual-comb spectroscopy (DCS), particularly in achieving high-resolution molecular spectroscopy and precise spectral measurements. However, achieving long coherence times remains a challenge for Yb-doped frequency combs. This work introduces an experimental approach for phase-stable DCS using Yb-doped frequency combs at 1.03 ${\mu}$m with a novel feed-forward method, combatting the limitations of mutual coherence. Without relying on computer-based phase correction, we achieve a coherence time of 1000 seconds - three orders of magnitude longer than the current state of the art for DCS. This extended coherence enables time-domain averaging, resulting in a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 2045. We demonstrate high-resolution monitoring of weak overtone transitions in the P and R branches of C${_2}$H${_2}$, with good agreement with HITRAN. The phase-locked multiheterodyne system also enables phase spectrum measurements with a scatter down to 7 mrad. Furthermore, we successfully extend our technique to the visible wavelength range using second harmonic generation, achieving high-resolution spectra of NO${_2}$ with excellent SNR. The method offers high-frequency accuracy and demonstrates the potential of Yb-doped systems for multiplexed metrology, effectively extending the capabilities of DCS as a powerful tool for multi-disciplinary applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Generative, Adaptive, Context-Aware 3D Printing (GRACE), a novel approach combining 3D imaging, computer vision, and parametric modelling to create tailored, context-aware geometries using volumetric additive manufacturing. GRACE rapidly and automatically generates complex structures capable of conforming directly around features ranging from cellular to macroscopic scales with minimal user intervention. We demonstrate its versatility in applications ranging from synthetic objects to biofabrication, including adaptive vascular-like geometries around cell-laden bioinks, resulting in improved functionality. GRACE also enables precise alignment of sequential prints, in addition to the detection and overprinting of opaque surfaces through shadow correction. Compatible with various printing modalities, GRACE transcends traditional additive manufacturing limitations, opening new avenues in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.</description>

      <title>Brewster solitons and omnidirectional solitons in one-dimensional optical structures involving Kerr-type nonlinear materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The possibility of exciting stationary solitons due to the Brewster effect is investigated. The analysis is performed by computing the transmission coefficient of an electromagnetic monochromatic wave obliquely incident on the optical system and linearly polarized with the transverse-electric polarization. The optical system is supposed to be surrounded by a vacuum. Two different optical systems are studied. First, the system under consideration is assumed to be composed of the junction of a single dispersive layer with a linear electromagnetic response and a single nonlinear layer exhibiting Kerr nonlinearity. The obtained results suggest the excitation of stationary solitons in the nonlinear layer induced by the occurrence of the Brewster phenomenon in the linear medium. The second system is considered as a single Kerr nonlinear layer. The Brewster effect is observed for both self-focusing and self-defocusing nonlinearities, which leads to the excitation of soliton states within the nonlinear layer. The Brewster-angle dependence of the intensity of the incident electromagnetic wave is also shown. Finally, the excitation of omnidirectional solitons in the case of single nonlinear layers is discussed. It is shown that matching the magnetic permeability of the surrounding medium and the nonlinear layer leads to maximum transmission states, independent of the incidence angle, for the input-intensity value that causes the homogenization of the electric permittivity.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-enabled small-satellite polarisation imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarisation imaging is used to distinguish objects and surface characteristics that are otherwise not visible with black-and-white or colour imaging. Full-Stokes polarisation imaging allows complex image processing like water glint filtering, which is particularly useful for remote Earth observations. The relatively low cost of small-satellites makes their use in remote sensing more accessible. However, their size and weight limitations cannot accommodate the bulky conventional optics needed for full-Stokes polarisation imaging. We present the modelling of an ultra-thin topology-optimised diffractive metasurface that encodes polarisation states in five different diffraction orders. Positioning the metasurface in a telescope's pupil plane allows the diffraction orders to be imaged onto a single detector, resulting in the capability to perform single-shot full-Stokes polarisation imaging of the Earth's surface. The five rectangular image swaths are designed to use the full width of the camera, and then each successive frame can be stitched together as the satellite moves over the Earth's surface, restoring the full field of view achievable with any chosen camera without comprising the on-ground resolution. Each set of four out of the five orders enables the reconstruction of the full polarisation state, and their simultaneous reconstructions allow for error monitoring. The lightweight design and compact footprint of the polarisation imaging optical system achievable with a metasurface is a novel approach to increase the functionality of small satellites while working within their weight and volume constraints.</description>

      <title>Large Bidirectional Refractive Index Change in Silicon-rich Nitride via Visible Light Trimming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase-sensitive integrated photonic devices are highly susceptible to minor manufacturing deviations, resulting in significant performance inconsistencies. This variability has limited the scalability and widespread adoption of these devices. Here, a major advancement is achieved through continuous-wave (CW) visible light (405 nm and 520 nm) trimming of plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) silicon-rich nitride (SRN) waveguides. The demonstrated method achieves precise, bidirectional refractive index tuning with a single laser source in CMOS-compatible SRN samples with refractive indices of 2.4 and 2.9 (measured at 1550 nm). By utilizing a cost-effective setup for real-time resonance tracking in micro-ring resonators, the resonant wavelength shifts as fine as 10 pm are attained. Additionally, a record red shift of 49.1 nm and a substantial blue shift of 10.6 nm are demonstrated, corresponding to refractive index changes of approximately 0.11 and -0.02. The blue and red shifts are both conclusively attributed to thermal annealing. These results highlight SRN's exceptional capability for permanent optical tuning, establishing a foundation for stable, precisely controlled performance in phase-sensitive integrated photonic devices.</description>

Abstract: Unidirectional optical systems enable selective control of light through asymmetric processing of radiation, effectively transmitting light in one direction while blocking unwanted propagation in the opposite direction. Here, we introduce a reciprocal diffractive unidirectional focusing design based on linear and isotropic diffractive layers that are structured. Using deep learning-based optimization, a cascaded set of diffractive layers are spatially engineered at the wavelength scale to focus light efficiently in the forward direction while blocking it in the opposite direction. The forward energy focusing efficiency and the backward energy suppression capabilities of this unidirectional architecture were demonstrated under various illumination angles and wavelengths, illustrating the versatility of our polarization-insensitive design. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these designs are resilient to adversarial attacks that utilize wavefront engineering from outside. Experimental validation using terahertz radiation confirmed the feasibility of this diffractive unidirectional focusing framework. Diffractive unidirectional designs can operate across different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum by scaling the resulting diffractive features proportional to the wavelength of light and will find applications in security, defense, and optical communication, among others.</description>

Abstract: The simultaneous progress of integrated optical frequency comb (OFC) and radio frequency (RF) photonic signal processing technique have promoted the rapid development of real-time signal processing. Integrated optical frequency comb offer multiple wavelengths as a powerful source for RF photonic signal transversal filter. Here, we review development of real-time signal processing system consisting of integrated OFC and RF photonic signal transversal filter in chronological order, and focus on the applications of this system such as differentiator, integrator, Hilbert transformer, and image processor.

      <title>Responsivity evaluation of photonics integrated photodetectors via pairwise measurements with an attenuation circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated photonics platforms offer a compact and scalable solution for developing next-generation optical technologies. For precision applications involving weak signals, the responsivity as well as the accurate calibration of the integrated photodetectors at low optical powers become increasingly important. It remains challenging to perform a calibration traceable to mW-level primary standards without relying on external attenuation setups. Here, we utilize an on-chip attenuation circuit, composed of a series of cascaded directional couplers (DCs), to evaluate the responsivity of integrated photodetectors (PDs) at uW optical power levels with mW inputs to the chip. Moreover, we show that a pairwise measurement method, involving the simultaneous measurement of the integrated PD photocurrent and an auxiliary optical output which is coupled off-chip, systematically improves the experimental uncertainties compared to a direct PD photocurrent measurement. For 3 cascaded DCs, the pairwise measurement improves the repeatability error from 1.21% to 0.22%, with an overall expanded calibration uncertainty (k=2) of 10.13%. The latter is dominated by the scattering noise floor and fiber-to-chip coupling errors, which can be significantly improved with better device fabrication control. Our method can be extended to a fully integrated calibration solution for waveguide-integrated single-photon detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional electromagnetic induction-based current transformers suffer from issues such as bulky and complex structures, slow response times, and low safety levels. Consequently, researchers have explored combining various sensing technologies with optical fibers to develop optical current transformers that could become the primary choice for power systems in the future. With the maturation of optoelectronic technology, optical current transformers have emerged. They offer outstanding advantages, including high sensitivity, integration, stability, and the ability to operate in complex environments. This review categorizes optical current transformers based on different principles, including all-fiber current transformers, those based on magnetostrictive effects, magneto-optic effects, and thermal effects. It also discusses their principles, structures, manufacturing techniques, and signal processing, while forecasting their future development trends.</description>

      <title>FoV and Efficiency Optimization for Resonant Beam SLIPT with Telescope Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meeting the large bandwidth demands of wireless communication for mobile Internet of Things (IoT) devices while enhancing their endurance is a significant challenge. Simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) technology offers the potential to realize wireless charging and signal transfer, making it suitable for supporting autonomous vehicles and drones. The resonant beam system (RBS) leverages the self-aligning property of a spatially distributed laser resonator (SSLR), allowing energy transmission from the transmitter to the receiver without mechanical alignment. However, the existing resonant beam SLIPT system exhibits a limited field of view (FoV) and transmission efficiency, facing challenges in practical applications. In this paper, we propose a resonant beam SLIPT system enhanced by incorporating an internal telescope and optimizing the communication, energy transfer, and FoV performance by solving the Pareto front set of the system's achievable performance region. The results indicate that the optimized FoV is increased by $17\%$, reaching $\pm26.8^\circ$, while its average end-to-end efficiency is improved by $145\%$, achieving $5.4\%$.</description>

      <title>Filamentation-Assisted Isolated Attosecond Pulse Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated attosecond pulses (IAPs) generated by few-cycle femtosecond lasers are essential for capturing ultrafast dynamics in atoms, molecules, and solids. Nonetheless, the advancement of attosecond science critically depends on achieving stable, high-temporal-contrast IAPs. Our study reveals a universal scenario in which self-compression of the infrared driver in high harmonic generation in extended gas media leads to high-contrast high-frequency IAP generation. Our experimental and theoretical results reveal that filamentation in a semi-infinite gas cell not only shapes the infrared driving pulse spatially and temporally, but also creates a stable propagation region where high harmonic generation is phase-matched, leading to the production of bright IAPs. In an argon-filled gas cell, filamentation notably reduces the pulse duration of Yb-based 1030 nm pulses from 4.7 fs to 3.5 fs, while simultaneously generating high-contrast 200-attosecond IAPs at 70 eV. We demonstrate the universality of filamentation-assisted IAP generation, showing that post-compressed Yb-based laser filaments in neon and helium yield even shorter IAPs: 69-attoseconds at 100 eV, and 65-attoseconds IAPs at 135 eV, respectively. This spatiotemporal reshaping of few-cycle pulses through filamentation possesses immediate impacts on both post-compression techniques and attosecond-based technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manipulating broadband fields in scattering media is a modern challenge across photonics and other wave domains. Recent studies have shown that complex propagation in scattering media can be harnessed to manipulate broadband light wave packets in space-time for focusing, imaging, and computing applications. Interestingly, while many proposed methodologies operate on intensity-based assessment of scattered fields, often in the spectral domain, from a pure transmission-function perspective, scattering operates as a linear field-level combinatory process, i.e., the superposition of transformation of unit excitations. As a result, we recently demonstrated that gaining experimental access to instantaneous scattered fields, as available through time-domain spectroscopy in the terahertz spectral range, in conjunction with sparse light excitation typical of ghost imaging, provides a key advantage in enabling the functionalisation of scattering, exposing a novel modelling paradigm. In this paper, we provide experimental proof of reconstructing 1-dimensional object features through a scattering medium using a fully broadband time-domain terahertz approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-pulse femtosecond laser irradiation of a monolayer of polystyrene microspheres deposited on a polystyrene substrate leads to the formation of carbon nanomaterial exhibiting broadband excitation-dependent luminescence both within the microspheres and in the substrate. Initial polystyrene substrate and microspheres are transparent at the laser wavelength (800 nm). Peak intensity of the laser irradiation focusing by the microspheres reaches 1013 W/cm2, resulting in multiphoton absorption followed by ionization and further carbonization processes. Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy analysis show that carbonization products contain carbon crystalline nanoobjects.</description>

      <title>Step Function in Momentum Space by a Metagrating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06508v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface research has shown significant potential for controlling the polarization, amplitude, phase and propagation direction of light. Nevertheless, control over the angular response of incident light still remains a long-standing problem. In this work, we show the potential of diffractive systems for obtaining a step function in momentum space where the mirror symmetry of the angular transmittance is broken. By engineering the scattering response of an asymmetric particles in a metagrating, we could obtain such a step function in a passive, reciprocal, and lossless fashion. More specifically, the metagrating performs filtering in the momentum space with an abrupt switching from reflection to transmission for an incident electromagnetic wave with an arbitrary spatial profile. This metagrating may find diverse applications in the context of optical spatial analog computing. Moreover, it paves the way for exploring the capabilities of diffractive systems for gaining full control over the angular response of light using arbitrary momentum transfer functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical polarization singularities (PSs) in real space carry rich topological properties and can enable highly precise manipulations of light fields. Conventional studies focus on the PSs in the open space of optical systems. The properties of PSs inside optical cavities remain largely unexplored. By using full-wave finite-element simulations, we investigate the optical PSs inside metallic cavities excited by electric dipole sources. We determine the topological indices, morphology, and spatial evolutions of the singularities inside both spherical and torus cavities. We uncover the relationship between spatial symmetries and the PSs, as well as the mechanism underlying the emergence of polarization Mobius strips in the spherical cavity. In addition, we investigate the topological transitions of the PSs connecting two geometries (i.e., sphere and torus) with distinct topologies. The results provide insight into the singular and topological properties of light fields in optical cavities and can find applications in optical sensing and optical manipulation of small particles.</description>

Abstract: We report on the successful design and fabrication of optical modules using a 50 micron pitch polymer waveguide interface, integrated for low loss, high density optical data transfer with very low space requirements on a Si photonics die. This prototype module meets JEDEC reliability standards and promises to increase the number of optical fibers that can be connected at the edge of a chip, a measure known as beachfront density, by six times compared to state of the art technology. Scalability of the polymer waveguide to less than 20 micron pitch stands to improve the bandwidth density upwards of 10 Tbps/mm.</description>

Abstract: Vortex dynamics, which encompass the motion, evolution, and propagation of vortices, elicit both fascination and challenges across various domains such as fluid dynamics, atmospheric science, and physics. This study focuses on fundamental dynamics of vortex-pair fields, specifically known as vortex-pair beams (VPBs) in optics. VPBs have gained increasing attention due to their unique properties, including vortex attraction and repulsion. Here, we explore the dynamics of pure-phase VPBs (PPVPBs) and observe intriguing helical and intertwined behaviors of vortices, resembling a vortex-pair dance. We uncover the oscillation property of the intervortex distance for PPVPBs in free space. The observed dancing and oscillation phenomena are intricately tied to the initial intervortex distance and can be explained well in the hydrodynamic picture. Notably, the vortex dancing and oscillation alter the process of vortex-pair annihilation, extending the survival range for opposite vortices. This discovery enhances our understanding of vortex interactions and sheds light on the intricate dynamics of both vortex-vortex and vortex-antivortex interactions.</description>

      <title>Polaritons in non-fullerene acceptors for high responsivity angle-independent organic narrowband infrared photodiodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Narrowband infrared organic photodetectors are in great demand for sensing, imaging, and spectroscopy applications. However, most existing strategies for narrowband detection depend on spectral filtering either through saturable absorption, which requires active layers exceeding 500 nm, restricting the choice of materials for producing high-quality films, or cavity effects, which inherently introduce strong angular dispersion. Microcavity exciton-polariton (polariton) modes, which emerge from strong exciton-photon coupling, have recently been explored as an angular dispersion suppression strategy for organic optoelectronics. In this work, we present the first narrowband infrared polariton organic photodiode that combines angle-independent response with a record-high responsivity of 0.24 A/W at 965 nm and -2 V. This device, featuring a 100-nm-thin active layer comprising a non-fullerene acceptor, exhibits a detection mode with a full-width at half maximum of less than 30 nm and a marginal angular dispersion of under 15 nm across $\pm$$45^\circ$. This study highlights the potential of polaritons as an innovative platform for developing next-generation optoelectronic devices that achieve simultaneous enhancements in optical and electronic performance.</description>

      <title>Speckle imaging with blind source separation and total variation deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work is concerned with optical imaging in strongly diffusive environments. We consider a typical setting in optical coherence tomography where a sample is probed by a collection of wavefields produced by a laser and propagating through a microscope. We operate in a scenario where the illuminations are in a speckle regime, namely fully randomized. This occurs when the light propagates deep in highly heterogeneous media. State-of-the-art coherent techniques are based on the ballistic part of the wavefield, that is the fraction of the wave that propagates freely and decays exponentially fast. In a speckle regime, the ballistic field is negligible compared to the scattered field, which precludes the use of coherent methods and different approaches are needed. We propose a strategy based on blind source separation and total variation deconvolution to obtain images with diffraction-limited resolution. The source separation allows us to isolate the fields diffused by the different scatterers to be imaged, while the deconvolution exploits the speckle memory effect to estimate the distance between these scatterers. Our method is validated with numerical simulations and is shown to be effective not only for imaging discrete scatterers, but also continuous objects.</description>

      <title>The effect of cerium doping and rate of crystallization on the microstructure of the Al2O3/YAG eutectic composite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eutectics of Sapphire/Yttrium-Aluminum garnet and Ce-doped Sapphire/Yttrium-Aluminum garnet (Ce up to 1 at.%) with a Chinese script microstructure were obtained by the method of horizontal directional crystallization in a carbon-containing reducing atmosphere based on argon gas. The effects of the pooling rate and Ce-dopant concentration on the microstructure of the eutectic were studied by the modified chord method. The deviation of the dependence of the characteristic eutectic distance on the pooling rate from the Jackson-Hunt model has been established. A change in the pathway for restructuring the structure of the doped eutectic at a certain critical pooling rate was revealed, which may indicate that the development of morphological instability of the crystallization front is carried out as a two-stage process. The conditions for obtaining doped eutectic of high homogeneity have been established. It was shown that increasing cerium ion concentration causes an increase in the structure parameters and its value deviation. Intensive formation of the third phase occurred when the limit of cerium ion concentration was exceeded.</description>

Abstract: We present the first demonstration of a nanofabricated photonic crystal made from the magnetic material yttrium iron garnet (YIG). YIG is a compelling material for quantum technologies due to its unique magnetic and optical properties; however, experiments involving YIG have primarily been limited to millimeter-scale spheres. The successful nanofabrication of YIG structures opens new avenues for advancing quantum technology applications. Notably, the ability to co-localize magnons, phonons, and optical photons within a nanostructured environment paves the way for novel approaches in quantum information processing, including quantum wavelength transduction and enhanced magnon-photon interactions. This work marks a significant step toward integrating YIG-based devices into scalable quantum platforms.</description>

      <title>Detection of Surface Waves During Femtosecond Filamentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrashort pulsed lasers (USPL) can produce thin columns of plasma in air via femtosecond filamentation, and these plasmas have been found to generate broadband TeraHertz (THz) and Radio Frequency (RF) radiation. A recent theory argues that the currents driven at the boundary of the plasma excite a Surface Plasmon Polariton (SPP) surface wave (in particular a Sommerfeld-Goubau wave given the cylindrical symmetry), which proceeds to detach from the end of the plasma to become the RF pulse. We have performed near-field measurements of these plasmas with a D-dot probe, and find an excellent agreement with this theory. The radial field dependence is precisely fit by a Hankel function, with an outer length scale in agreement with plasma conductivity and radius, and a measured longitudinal drift in frequency maxima closely matches both SPP simulations and analytic expectations.</description>

      <title>Quantum delayed "choice" based on vectorially structured photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether a photon exhibits wavelike or particlelike behaviour depends on the observation method, as clearly demonstrated by Wheeler's delayed choice (DC) experiments. A key aspect of such experiments is the random determination of the observation device's status, typically controlled by a random number generator or a quantum-controlling apparatus. Here, we propose a novel version of the quantum delayed choice (QDC) experiment by tailoring the quantum state of the single photon into an arbitrary polarization superposition. In this experiment, the "choice" can be considered as being made by the photon's state itself at the moment of observation, thereby violating classical causality. Additionally, we observe the morphing behaviour of the single photon between wavelike and particlelike characteristics, which challenges the classical picture of waves and particles. Utilizing the quantum state of the photon rather than the quantum-controlling devices not only facilitates the implementation of the QDC experiment but also helps deepen the understanding of Bohr's complementarity principle.</description>

      <title>Hysteresis-controlled Van der Waals tunneling infrared detector enabled by selective layer heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mid-infrared (mid-IR) photodetectors play a crucial role in various applications, including the development of biomimetic vision systems that emulate neuronal function. However, current mid-IR photodetector technologies are limited by their cost and efficiency. In this work, we demonstrate a new type of photodetector based on a tunnel structure made of two-dimensional materials. The effect manifests when the upper and lower layers of the tunnel structure are heated differently. The photoswitching is threshold-based and represents a ``jump'' in voltage to another branch of the current-voltage characteristic when illuminated at a given current. This mechanism provides enormous photovoltage (0.05$-$1~V) even under weak illumination. Our photodetector has built-in nonlinearity and is therefore an ideal candidate for use in infrared vision neurons. Additionally, using this structure, we demonstrated the possibility of selective heating of layers in a van der Waals stack using mid-IR illumination. This method will allow the study of heat transfer processes between layers of van der Waals structures, opening new avenues in the physics of phonon interactions.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional fractional discrete NLS equations: dispersion relations, rogue waves, fundamental and vortex solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce physically relevant new models of two-dimensional (2D) fractional lattice media accounting for the interplay of fractional intersite coupling and onsite self-focusing. Our approach features novel discrete fractional operators based on an appropriately modified definition of the continuous Riesz fractional derivative. The model of the 2D isotropic lattice employs the discrete fractional Laplacian, whereas the 2D anisotropic system incorporates discrete fractional derivatives acting independently along orthogonal directions with different L\'evy indices (LIs). We derive exact linear dispersion relations (DRs), and identify spectral bands that permit linear modes to exist, finding them to be similar to their continuous counterparts, apart from differences in the wavenumber range. Additionally, the modulational instability in the discrete models is studied in detail, and, akin to the linear DRs, it is found to align with the situation in continuous models. This consistency highlights the nature of our newly defined discrete fractional derivatives. Furthermore, using Gaussian inputs, we produce a variety of rogue-wave structures. By means of numerical methods, we systematically construct families of 2D fundamental and vortex solitons, and examine their stability. Fundamental solitons maintain the stability due to the discrete nature of the interactions, preventing the onset of the critical and supercritical collapse. On the other hand, vortex solitons are unstable in the isotropic lattice model. However, the anisotropic one -- in particular, its symmetric version with equal LIs acting in both directions -- maintains stable vortex solitons with winding numbers $S=1$ and $S=3$. The detailed results stress the robustness of the newly defined discrete fractional Laplacian in supporting well-defined soliton modes in the 2D lattice media.</description>

      <title>Impact-parameter selective Rydberg atom collision by optical tweezers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cold collisions between two Rydberg rubidium atoms ($^{87}$Rb) are investigated by controlling the impact parameter and collision energy. Optical tweezers are employed to hold one atom stationary while propelling the other to a constant velocity. After the tweezers are deactivated, both atoms are excited to a Rydberg state by a $\pi$-pulse. After a collision, a second $\pi$-pulse is applied. If the stationary atom does not experience a significant momentum transfer and is de-excited to its ground state, it can be recaptured when reactivating the tweezer. The impact parameter dependent collision probability is extracted from the atom loss from the tweezer and used to evaluate the collisional cross section between Rydberg atoms. Quantum and classical simulations of elastic two-body collisions show good agreement with the present experimental data and provide insights into the critical parameter regime where quantum effects become important.</description>

      <title>Order-disorder phase transition of cell membrane induced by THz irradiation studied via fluorescence recovery after photobleaching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To elucidate the mechanism by which THz radiation non-thermally affects living organisms, the lateral diffusion constants of lipid molecules in the cell membranes of HeLa cells were measured using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching under THz wave irradiation (THz-FRAP) at frequencies of 0.10, 0.29, and 0.48 THz, with power densities ranging from 20 to 89 mW/cm2. The potential heating effects of the THz irradiation were eliminated through temperature calibration using an ultrathin thermocouple, allowing for the investigation of the non-thermal effects of THz radiation. Irradiation at 0.10 and 0.29 THz induced an increase in diffusion constants at temperatures lower than the cell growth temperature. This suggests that THz irradiation induces the order-disorder phase transition of the cell membrane lipids by affecting the dynamics of bound water molecules. Our findings have important implications for the establishment of safety standards for THz radiation and for the potential development of new methods for cell manipulation using THz irradiation in the future</description>

      <title>Frequency entangled W states and quantum frequency translation protocols via forward Brillouin interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex quantum states of light are not only central to advancing our understanding of quantum mechanics, but are also necessary for a variety of quantum protocols. High-dimensional, or multipartite, quantum states are of specific interest, as they can exhibit unique properties both fundamentally and in application. The synthesis of high-dimensional, entangled photonic states can take the form of various schemes, which result in varying forms of entanglement. Frequency-entanglement is specifically attractive due to compatibility with integrated systems and resistance to decoherence in fiber transportation; however, increasing the dimension of frequency-entangled states requires a system that offers quantum interactions between a large set of distinct frequencies. Here, we show how the phonon-photon interactions of forward Brillouin scattering, which offer access to a ladder of optical resonances permitted by a single mechanical mode, can be used for fast-synthesis of frequency-entangled, single-photon W states. In our proposed system, simultaneous laser pulses of different frequencies dynamically evolve either an injected single photon or a heralded single phonon, generating W states of selected dimension and output frequency. This method enables the synthesis of `perfect' W states by adjusting the pulse amplitudes. In addition, we show how this system can be used for quantum frequency translation.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the symmetry of photon-dressed electronic states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong light-matter interaction provides opportunities for tailoring the physical properties of quantum materials on the ultrafast timescale by forming photon-dressed electronic states, i.e., Floquet-Bloch states. While the light field can in principle imprint its symmetry properties onto the photon-dressed electronic states, so far, how to experimentally detect and further engineer the symmetry of photon-dressed electronic states remains elusive. Here by utilizing time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TrARPES) with polarization-dependent study, we directly visualize the parity symmetry of Floquet-Bloch states in black phosphorus. The photon-dressed sideband exhibits opposite photoemission intensity to the valence band at the $\Gamma$ point,suggesting a switch of the parity induced by the light field. Moreover, a "hot spot" with strong intensity confined near $\Gamma$ is observed, indicating a momentum-dependent modulation beyond the parity switch. Combining with theoretical calculations, we reveal the light-induced engineering of the wave function of the Floquet-Bloch states as a result of the hybridization between the conduction and valence bands with opposite parities, and show that the "hot spot" is intrinsically dictated by the symmetry properties of black phosphorus. Our work suggests TrARPES as a direct probe for the parity of the photon-dressed electronic states with energy- and momentum-resolved information, providing an example for engineering the wave function and symmetry of such photon-dressed electronic states via Floquet engineering.</description>

      <title>Light-induced ultrafast glide-mirror symmetry breaking in black phosphorus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry breaking plays an important role in fields of physics, ranging from particle physics to condensed matter physics. In solid-state materials, phase transitions are deeply linked to the underlying symmetry breakings, resulting in a rich variety of emergent phases. Such symmetry breakings are often induced by controlling the chemical composition and temperature or applying an electric field and strain, etc. In this work, we demonstrate an ultrafast glide-mirror symmetry breaking in black phosphorus through Floquet engineering. Upon near-resonance pumping, a light-induced full gap opening is observed at the glide-mirror symmetry protected nodal ring, suggesting light-induced breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry. Moreover, the full gap is observed only in the presence of the light-field and disappears almost instantaneously ($\ll$100 fs) when the light-field is turned off, suggesting the ultrafast manipulation of the symmetry and its Floquet engineering origin. This work not only demonstrates light-matter interaction as an effective way to realize ultrafast symmetry breaking in solid-state materials, but also moves forward towards the long-sought Floquet topological phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using a laser-based ranging method for precise environmental 3D sensing, LiDAR has numerous applications in science and industry. However, conventional LiDAR face challenges in simultaneously achieving high ranging precision and fast measurement rates, which limits their applicability in more precise fields, such as aerospace, smart healthcare and beyond. By employing an asynchronous electrical pulse sampling strategy on a single optical frequency comb with a stable repetition rate and femtosecond-pulse width, we exploit the advantages of optical-frequency-comb ranging method and overcome the limitations of sampling aliasing and low data-utilization inherent in traditional approaches. This enables a significant improvement of LiDAR's performance to achieve micrometer-level precision and megahertz-regimes update rates over meter-range on non-cooperative targets. Specifically, we achieve 38.8-${\mu}$m Allan deviation at 1-MHz update rate and 8.06-${\mu}$m Allan deviation after 2-ms time-averaging based on a 56.091-MHz femtosecond laser. This enhancement enables various advanced measurement applications, including metrology monitoring on high-speed objects, 1-megapixel/s precise 3D scanning imaging and first-ever contactless vital sign detection using time-of-flight LiDAR. This LiDAR unlock new possibilities for precise and fast real-time measurements in diverse fields.</description>

      <title>Generalized Linear Response Theory for Pumped Systems and its Application to Transient Optical Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10768v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the two-time linear response theory for out-of-equilibrium pumped systems, generic pump-probe delays and probe frequencies. Such a theory enormously simplifies the numerical calculations, for instance, of the optical conductivity with respect to the actual procedure, which requires computing the effect of the probe pulse for each time delay with respect to the pump pulse. The theory is given for a generic observable and pumped Hamiltonian and then specialized for a system with a quadratic Hamiltonian and its transient optical properties, exploiting the Dynamical Projective Operatorial Approach (DPOA). The theory is complemented by a set of crucial numerical guidelines that help perform actual calculations in a computationally affordable way. The optical response (differential transient reflectivity and absorption) of a prototypical three-band (core, valence, and conduction) model in the XUV regime is analyzed in detail to illustrate the theory and its application. Using some generalizations of the density of states, we provide a systematic approach to exploring the optical properties in terms of the system band structure features and the pump parameters. Such an analysis can be extremely helpful in understanding the actual results of experimental optical measurements. Moreover, we study the effects of inter-band and intra-band transitions, the local dipole coupling, and single and multi-photon processes. The latter is further investigated by varying the central frequency of the pump pulse to have different regions of the first Brillouin zone in resonance with it. We also study the effect of varying the pump pulse intensity. Finally, we study and analyze the transient optical properties in the probe pulse regime of IR and visible.</description>

Abstract: We predict the existence of a novel type of temporal localized structure in injected Kerr--Gires--Tournois interferometers (KGTI). These bright pulses exist in the normal dispersion regime, yet they do not correspond to the usual scenario of domain wall locking that induces complex shape multistability, weak stability, and a reduced domain of existence. The new states are observed beyond the mean-field limit and out of the bistable region. Their shape is uniquely defined, with peak intensities beyond that of the upper steady state, and they are stable over a broad range of the injection field, highlighting their potential for optical frequency comb (OFC) generation.</description>

      <title>Perturbation theory for resonant states near a bound state in the continuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08162v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a perturbation theory to analyze resonant states near a bound state in the continuum (BIC) in photonic crystal slabs. The theory allows us to rigorously determine the asymptotic behavior of $Q$-factor and the far-field polarization. We show that the resonant states close to a BIC can be nearly circularly polarized if the scattering matrix satisfies a certain condition. Moreover, our theory offers a novel perspective on super-BICs and provides a clear and precise condition to efficiently identify them in both symmetric and asymmetric structures without requiring a merging process. For practical applications, we find a super-BIC in a square lattice of rods on a dielectric substrate. Our theory addresses the non-Hermitian nature of the system, can be generalized to treat other structures that support BICs, and has potential applications in resonance and chiral optics.</description>

      <title>Lithium Niobate Photonic Topological Insulator-based Multi-Wavelength Optical Demultiplexer with Piezoelectric Switch-Off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10658v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic topological insulators provide unidirectional, robust, wavelength-selective transport of light at an interface while keeping it insulated at the bulk of the material. The non-trivial topology results in an immunity to backscattering, sharp turns, and fabrication defects. This work leverages these unique properties to design a 2-channel optical demultiplexer based on a lithium niobate photonic topological insulator with piezoelectric switch-off capabilities. A photonic topological insulator design for the demultiplexer allows for good wavelength selectivity, crosstalk as low as $-$54 dB, and better isolation between output channels. The primary operating wavelengths presented are the telecommunication wavelengths of 1310 nm and 1550 nm, but the use of the lithium niobate material allows operation at multiple operating wavelengths. Furthermore, we propose a post-fabrication method to switch off the topological protection and, thus, optical transmittance via an applied voltage utilizing the inverse piezoelectric effect of lithium niobate. This work will contribute to advancing lithium niobate integrated photonics and developing efficient, multi-wavelength, electrically controlled optical communication systems and integrated photonic circuits.</description>

      <title>Concatenation of Kerr solitary waves in Ceramic YAG: application to coherent Raman imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17040v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A coherent concatenation of multiple Townes solitons may lead to a stable infrared and visible broadband filament in ceramic YAG polycrystal. This self-trapped soliton train is leveraged to implement self-referenced multiplex coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering imaging. Simulations and experiments illustrating the filamentation process and the concatenation of focusing-defocusing cycles in ceramic and crystal YAG are presented. In addition, our simulations and experiments further examine the dependence of the filamentation onset location and supercontinuum generation upon peak input power. Understanding this dependence is key for implementation of viable CARS imaging techniques, due to the comparatively exceptional ability of YAG to generate supercontinuum which can enable higher-sensitivity imaging without delay lines.</description>

      <title>Point-Spread-Function Engineering in MINFLUX: Optimality of Donut and Half-Moon Excitation Patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localization microscopy enables imaging with resolutions that surpass the conventional optical diffraction limit. Notably, the MINFLUX method achieves super-resolution by shaping the excitation point-spread function (PSF) to minimize the required photon flux for a given precision. Various beam shapes have recently been proposed to improve localization efficiency, yet their optimality remains an open question. In this work, we deploy a numerical and theoretical framework to determine optimal excitation patterns for MINFLUX. Such a computational approach allows us to search for new beam patterns in a fast and low-cost fashion, and to avoid time-consuming and expensive experimental explorations. We show that the conventional donut beam is a robust optimum when the excitation beams are all constrained to the same shape. Further, our PSF engineering framework yields two pairs of half-moon beams (orthogonal to each other) which can improve the theoretical localization precision by a factor of about two.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12233v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by neural network algorithms in deep learning, diffractive optical networks have arisen as new platforms for manipulating light-matter interactions. Inherited from the deep learning black box nature, clear physical meanings have never been given for these complex diffractive networks at the layer level, even though the systems are visible in physical space. Using exemplified mode conversion systems, we show how various physical transformation rules within diffractive networks can be unveiled given properly defined input/output mode relations. Surprising physical transformation division phenomenon and an optical analogy of gradientvanishing-effect have been observed and discussed for high-dimensional mode sorting tasks. The use of physical interpretation for efficiently designing a parameter-varying network has also been demonstrated. These physically interpretable optical networks resolve the contradiction between rigorous physical theorem and operationally vague network structure, and pave the way for further interpret advanced deep learning tasks and other physical neural networks.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Weakly Confined CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization could significantly advance ultrafast time-of-flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, we demonstrate that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. We show that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non-radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420 ps lifetime and light yield of ~10'000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non-radiative losses. Temperature-dependent light-guiding experiments on test-bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light-transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band-edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotech scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14354v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transfer and storage of quantum information in a hybrid quantum system, consisting of an ensemble of atoms or spins interacting with a cavity, is adversely affected by the inhomogeneity of the spins, which negates the coherent exchange of excitations between the physical components. Using a full quantum treatment based on variational renormalization group, we show how quantum information encoded in the states of a parametrically driven hybrid system is strongly protected against any decoherence that may arise due to the inhomogeneity in the spin-ensemble.</description>

      <title>Photophysics of O-band and transition metal color centers in monolithic silicon for quantum communications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19510v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Color centers in the O-band (1260-1360 nm) are critical for realizing long-coherence quantum network nodes in memory-assisted quantum communications. However, only a limited number of O-band color centers have been explored in silicon hosts as spin-photon interfaces. This study explores and compares two promising O-band defects in silicon: T centers and $^*$Cu (transition metal) color centers. During T center formation, we observed the formation and dissolution of various defects, including the copper-silver-related defect with a doublet line around 1312 nm ($^*$Cu$^{0}_{n}$), near the optical fiber zero dispersion wavelength. We then investigate the photophysics of both T and $^*$Cu centers, focusing on their emission spectra and spin properties to assess their potential for high-fidelity spin-photon interfaces. Additionally, we report a 25\% broadening of the $^*$Cu$^{0}_{0}$ line under a 0.5 T magnetic field, potentially linked to spin degeneracy, suggesting that this defect may provide a promising alternative to T centers for spin-photon interfaces.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Micro-Bunching based on Transverse-Longitudinal Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, three specific scenarios of a novel accelerator light source mechanism called steady-state micro-bunching (SSMB) have been studied, i.e., longitudinal weak focusing, longitudinal strong focusing and generalized longitudinal strong focusing (GLSF). At present, GLSF is the most promising among them in realizing high-power short-wavelength coherent radiation with a mild requirement on the modulation laser power. Its essence is to exploit the ultrasmall natural vertical emittance of an electron beam in a planar storage ring for efficient microbunching formation, like a partial transverse-longitudinal emittance exchange at the optical laser wavelength range. Based on indepth investigation of related beam physics, a solution of a GLSF SSMB storage ring which can deliver 1 kW-average-power EUV light is presented. The work in this paper, such as the generalized Courant-Snyder formalism, the analysis of theoretical minimum emittances, transverse-longitudinal coupling dynamics, and the derivation of bunching factor and modulation strengths for laser-induced microbunching schemes, is expected to be useful not only for the development of SSMB but also for future accelerator light sources in general that demand increasingly precise electron beam phase space manipulations.</description>

      <title>Tunable Generation of Spatial Entanglement in Nonlinear Waveguide Arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Harnessing high-dimensional entangled states of light presents a frontier for advancing quantum information technologies, from fundamental tests of quantum mechanics to enhanced computation and communication protocols. In this context, the spatial degree of freedom stands out as particularly suited for on-chip integration. But while traditional demonstrations produce and manipulate path-entangled states sequentially with discrete optical elements, continuously-coupled nonlinear waveguide systems offer a promising alternative where photons can be generated and interfere along the entire propagation length, unveiling novel capabilities within a reduced footprint. Here we exploit this concept to implement a compact and reconfigurable source of path-entangled photon pairs based on parametric down-conversion in semiconductor nonlinear waveguides arrays. We use a double-pump configuration to engineer the output quantum state and implement various types of spatial correlations, exploiting a quantum interference effect between the biphoton state generated in each pumped waveguide. This demonstration, at room temperature and telecom wavelength, illustrates the potential of continuously-coupled systems as a promising alternative to discrete multi-component quantum circuits for leveraging the high-dimensional spatial degree of freedom of photons.</description>

      <title>Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.</description>

      <title>Accurate simulation of the European XFEL scintillating screens point spread function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The European XFEL is equipped with scintillating screens as a profile measurement monitor. The scintillating material used is Gadolinium Aluminium Gallium Garnet doped with Cerium (GAGG:Ce). At most of the stations, the screen is positioned perpendicular to the electron beam, with scintillation observed at a backward angle. The scintillator thickness is usually 200 um, making the resolution worse in the plane with the angle, as it allows for the entire particle track within the scintillator to be seen. Besides, aberrations are introduced by the objective used. This study outlines an accurate simulation of the point spread function (PSF) caused by all distortions of the optical system and, in addition, a method to improve the screens resolution by including the PSF into a fitting function, assuming a Gaussian beam shape.</description>

      <title>Light-induced magnetic trapping for cold alkali atoms using a combined optical tweezers and nanofibre platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a magnetic trapping method for cold $^{87}$Rb atoms, utilising the light-induced magnetic fields from the evanescent field of an optical nanofibre (ONF) in conjunction with an optical tweezers. We calculate and plot the trapping potentials for both Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modes of the optical tweezers, and quasi-linear polarisation of the ONF-guided field. Based on the optical powers in the tweezers beam and the ONF-guided mode, we analyse the trap depths and the distances of the trap minima from the surface of the nanofibre. We show that, by controlling the powers in both of the optical fields, one can vary the trap position over a few hundreds of nanometres, while also influencing the trap depth and trap frequencies. Such control over atom position is essential both for studying distance-dependent effects on atoms trapped near dielectric surfaces, and minimising these effects for quantum technology applications.</description>
