      <title>Uniqueness of Inflection Points in Binomial Exceedance Function Compositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine functions representing the cumulative probability of a binomial random variable exceeding a threshold, expressed in terms of the success probability per trial. These functions are known to exhibit a unique inflection point. We generalize this property to their compositions and highlight its applications.</description>

      <title>AI Agents and the Attention Lemons Problem in Two-Sided Ad Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop a theoretical model to examine how the rise of autonomous AI (artificial intelligence) agents disrupts two-sided digital advertising markets. Through this framework, I demonstrate that users' rational, private decisions to delegate browsing to agents create a negative externality, precipitating declines in ad prices, publisher revenues, and overall market efficiency. The model identifies the conditions under which publisher interventions such as blocking AI agents or imposing tolls may mitigate these effects, although they risk fragmenting access and value. I formalize the resulting inefficiency as an "attention lemons" problem, where synthetic agent traffic dilutes the quality of attention sold to advertisers, generating adverse selection. To address this, I propose a Pigouvian correction mechanism: a per-delegation fee designed to internalize the externality and restore welfare. The model demonstrates that, for an individual publisher, charging AI agents toll fees for access strictly dominates both the 'Blocking' and 'Null (inaction)' strategies. Finally, I characterize a critical tipping point beyond which unchecked delegation triggers a collapse of the ad-funded ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Robust Voting under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes normative criteria for voting rules under uncertainty about individual preferences. The criteria emphasize the importance of responsiveness, i.e., the probability that the social outcome coincides with the realized individual preferences. Given a convex set of probability distributions of preferences, denoted by $P$, a voting rule is said to be $P$-robust if, for each probability distribution in $P$, at least one individual's responsiveness exceeds one-half. Our main result establishes that a voting rule is $P$-robust if and only if there exists a nonnegative weight vector such that the weighted average of individual responsiveness is strictly greater than one-half under every extreme point of $P$. In particular, if the set $P$ includes all degenerate distributions, a $P$-robust rule is a weighted majority rule without ties.</description>

      <title>Misspecified Bayesianism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An agent is a misspecified Bayesian if she updates her belief using Bayes' rule given a subjective, possibly misspecified model of her signals. This paper shows that a belief sequence is consistent with misspecified Bayesianism if the prior contains a grain of the average posterior, i.e., is a mixture of the average posterior and another distribution. A partition-based variant of the grain condition is both necessary and sufficient. Under correct specification, the grain condition reduces to the usual Bayes plausibility. The condition imposes no restriction on the posterior given a full-support prior over a finite or compact state space. However, it rules out posteriors that have heavier tails than the prior on unbounded state spaces. The results cast doubt on the feasibility of testing Bayesian updating in many environments. They also suggest that many seemingly non-Bayesian updating rules are observationally equivalent to Bayesian updating under misspecified beliefs.</description>

      <title>Robust Contract with Career Concerns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An employer contracts with a worker to incentivize efforts whose productivity depends on ability; the worker then enters a market that pays him contingent on ability evaluation. With non-additive monitoring technology, the interdependence between market expectations and worker efforts can lead to multiple equilibria (contrasting Holmstrom (1982/1999); Gibbons and Murphy (1992)). We identify a sufficient and necessary criterion for the employer to face such strategic uncertainty--one linked to skill-effort complementarity, a pervasive feature of labor markets. To fully implement work, the employer optimally creates private wage discrimination to iteratively eliminate pessimistic market expectations and low worker efforts. Our result suggests that present contractual privacy, employers' coordination motives generate within-group pay inequality. The comparative statics further explain several stylized facts about residual wage dispersion.</description>

      <title>Cycles Protocol: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Clearing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For centuries, financial institutions have responded to liquidity challenges by forming closed, centralized clearing clubs with strict rules and membership that allow them to collaborate on using the least money to discharge the most debt. As closed clubs, much of the general public has been excluded from participation. But the vast majority of private sector actors consists of micro or small firms that are vulnerable to late payments and generally ineligible for bank loans. This low liquidity environment often results in gridlock and leads to insolvency, and it disproportionately impacts small enterprises and communities.
  On the other hand, blockchain communities have developed open, decentralized settlement systems, along with a proliferation of store of value assets and new lending protocols, allowing anyone to permissionlessly transact and access credit. However, these protocols remain used primarily for speculative purposes, and so far have fallen short of the large-scale positive impact on the real economy prophesied by their promoters.
  We address these challenges by introducing Cycles, an open, decentralized clearing, settlement, and issuance protocol. Cycles is designed to enable firms to overcome payment inefficiencies, to reduce their working capital costs, and to leverage diverse assets and liquidity sources, including cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, and lending protocols, in service of clearing more debt with less money. Cycles solves real world liquidity challenges through a privacy-preserving multilateral settlement platform based on a graph optimization algorithm. The design is based on a core insight: liquidity resides within cycles in the payment network's structure and can be accessed via settlement flows optimized to reduce debt.</description>

      <title>Optimal Wage Band for Job Matching with Signaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01886v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an optimal wage band problem in a competitive matching labor market where education signals worker ability. We prove uniqueness of the competitive signaling equilibrium under a general class of utility and profit functions and show that the optimal wage band problem is isomorphic to a simpler optimal ability threshold problem. Using a parametric model, we analyze how wage bands improve welfare relative to no intervention. Our results highlight novel mechanisms driven by asymmetric information, contrasting with existing literature. The framework is broadly applicable to settings where agents invest in costly signals under asymmetric information in competitive matching environments.</description>

      <title>Monetizing digital content with network effects: A mechanism-design approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15196v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We design profit-maximizing mechanisms to sell an excludable and non-rival good with positive and/or negative network effects. Buyers have heterogeneous private values that depend on how many others also consume the good. In optimum, an endogenous number of the highest types consume the good, and we can implement this allocation in dominant strategies. We apply our insights to digital content creation, and we are able to rationalize features seen in monetization schemes in this industry such as voluntary contributions, community subsidies, and exclusivity bids.</description>

      <title>Limited attention and models of choice: A behavioral equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that many models of choice can be alternatively represented as special cases of choice with limited attention (Masatlioglu, Nakajima, and Ozbay, 2012), singling out the properties of the unobserved attention filters that explain the observed choices.For each specification, information about the DM's consideration sets and preference is inferred from violations of the contraction consistency axiom, and it is compared with the welfare indications obtained from equivalent models. Remarkably, limited attention always supports the elicitation of DM's taste arising from alternative methods. Finally, we examine the intersections between subclasses, and we verify that each of them is independent of the others.</description>

      <title>Separable joint choices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03056v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel choice dataset, called joint choice, in which options and menus are multidimensional. In this general setting, we define a notion of choice separability, which requires that selections from some dimensions are never affected by those performed on the remaining dimensions. This yields an extension of the classical definition of separability for discrete preference relations and utility functions beyond rationality requirements. We thoroughly investigate the stability of separability across dimensions, and then suggest effective tests to check whether a joint choice is separable. Upon defining rationalizable joint choices as those explained by the maximization of a relation of revealed preference, we examine the interplay between the notions of rationalizability and separability. Finally, we show that the rationalizability of a separable joint choice can be tested by verifying the rationalizability of some derived joint choices over fewer dimensions.</description>

      <title>Durable Goods Monopoly with Free Disposal: A Robust Folk Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13137v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a dynamic durable-goods monopoly model featuring differentiated goods and free disposability. We establish that when agents are sufficiently patient, any payoff between the lowest buyer valuation and approximately the seller's maximum static commitment payoff can be sustained as an equilibrium. The underlying intuition is that free disposal provides the seller substantial strategic flexibility, enabling credible implementation of reputational equilibria. We relate our findings to the classical no-gap folk theorem and illustrate these theoretical insights through applications to markets for informational and digital goods.</description>
