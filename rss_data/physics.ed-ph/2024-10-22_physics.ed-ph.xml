      <title>Paddle-wheels, friction, and moving-boundary work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving-boundary work, also called pressure-volume work or expansion work, is perhaps the main form of work discussed in introductory courses about Thermodynamics. Here, we take a particular definition of this kind of thermodynamic work. On this basis, we show with simple reasoning that significant phenomena involving dissipation of mechanical energy, often mentioned as well in those courses but with a vague formalization, can be traced back right to moving-boundary processes. We refer in particular to the conversion of external work into internal energy in paddle-wheel experiments such as the one conducted by J.P.Joule in 1850, and to other processes involving friction.</description>

      <title>Neutralina: promoting science and gender-equality in Latin-America</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Covid-19 pandemic has exposed certain societal weaknesses, including the lack of scientists in the media and the readiness of the public to believe in fake news. "Neutralina" is a science communication personality created on Instagram (@neutralina.lu) in response to the observed need for scientific outreach done by women in Peruvian and Latin American society. The objectives of this project include normalizing the presence of women in science, fighting against stereotypes and fake news, and disseminating scientific knowledge. Neutralina has attracted a sizable young audience and is expanding beyond Instagram into other formats such as podcasts, real-life conferences, and roundtable discussions. Statistics detailing its growth will be presented, alongside strategies employed to engage the young audience.</description>

      <title>Bringing Lecture-Tutorials Online: An Analysis of A New Strategy to Teach Planet Formation in the Undergraduate Classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies conclusively show that pencil-and-paper lecture-tutorials (LTs) are incredibly effective at increasing student engagement and learning gains on a variety of topics when compared to traditional lecture. LTs in astronomy are post-lecture activities developed with the intention of helping students engage with conceptual and reasoning difficulties around a specific topic with the end goal of them developing a more expert-like understanding of astrophysical concepts. To date, all astronomy LTs have been developed for undergraduate courses taught in-person. Increases in online course enrollments and the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted the need for additional interactive, research-based, curricular materials designed for online classrooms. To this end, we developed and assessed the efficacy of an innovative, interactive LT designed to teach planet formation in asynchronous, online, introductory astronomy courses for undergraduates. We utilized the Planet Formation Concept Inventory to compare learning outcomes between courses that implemented the new online, interactive LT, and those that used either a lecture-only approach or utilized a standard pencil-and-paper LT on the same topic. Overall, learning gains from the standard pencil-and-paper LT were statistically indistinguishable from the in-person implementation of the online LT and both of these conditions outperformed the lecture-only condition. However, when implemented asynchronously, learning gains from the online LT were lower and not significantly above the lecture-only condition. While improvements can be made to improve the online LT in the future, the current discipline ideas still outperform traditional lecture, and can be used as a tool to teach planet formation effectively.</description>

      <title>Exploring the impact of gamification on engagement in a statistics classroom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the integration of gamification into educational settings has garnered significant attention as a means to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. By leveraging gamified elements such as points and leaderboards, educators aim to promote active participation, motivation, and deeper understanding among students. This study investigates the effect of gamification on student engagement in a flipped statistics classroom environment. The findings suggest that gamification strategies, when effectively implemented, can have a positive impact on student motivation and engagement. This paper concludes with recommendations for educators, potential challenges such as superficial engagement and demotivation, and future directions for research to address these challenges and further explore the potential of gamification in fostering student success.</description>
