      <title>Towards Efficient and Accurate Spiking Neural Networks via Adaptive Bit Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-bit spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently become a heated research spot, pursuing energy-efficient and high-accurate AI. However, with more bits involved, the associated memory and computation demands escalate to the point where the performance improvements become disproportionate. Based on the insight that different layers demonstrate different importance and extra bits could be wasted and interfering, this paper presents an adaptive bit allocation strategy for direct-trained SNNs, achieving fine-grained layer-wise allocation of memory and computation resources. Thus, SNN's efficiency and accuracy can be improved. Specifically, we parametrize the temporal lengths and the bit widths of weights and spikes, and make them learnable and controllable through gradients. To address the challenges caused by changeable bit widths and temporal lengths, we propose the refined spiking neuron, which can handle different temporal lengths, enable the derivation of gradients for temporal lengths, and suit spike quantization better. In addition, we theoretically formulate the step-size mismatch problem of learnable bit widths, which may incur severe quantization errors to SNN, and accordingly propose the step-size renewal mechanism to alleviate this issue. Experiments on various datasets, including the static CIFAR and ImageNet and the dynamic CIFAR-DVS and DVS-GESTURE, demonstrate that our methods can reduce the overall memory and computation cost while achieving higher accuracy. Particularly, our SEWResNet-34 can achieve a 2.69\% accuracy gain and 4.16$\times$ lower bit budgets over the advanced baseline work on ImageNet. This work will be fully open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Marker Gene Method : Identifying Stable Solutions in a Dynamic Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Competitive Co-evolutionary Algorithms (CCEAs) are often hampered by complex dynamics like intransitivity and the Red Queen effect, leading to unstable convergence. To counter these challenges, this paper introduces the Marker Gene Method (MGM), a framework that establishes stability by using a 'marker gene' as a dynamic benchmark and an adaptive weighting mechanism to balance exploration and exploitation. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs demonstrating that MGM creates strong attractors near Nash Equilibria within the Strictly Competitive Game framework. Empirically, MGM demonstrates its efficacy across a spectrum of challenges: it stabilizes the canonical Rock-Paper-Scissors game, significantly improves the performance of C-RMOEA/D on ZDT benchmarks, and, when augmented with a Memory Pool (MP) extension, it successfully tames the notoriously pathological Shapley Biased Game. This work presents a theoretically sound and empirically validated framework that substantially enhances the stability and robustness of CCEAs in complex competitive environments.</description>

      <title>More Efficient Real-Valued Gray-Box Optimization through Incremental Distribution Estimation in RV-GOMEA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gene-pool Optimal Mixing EA (GOMEA) family of EAs offers a specific means to exploit problem-specific knowledge through linkage learning, i.e., inter-variable dependency detection, expressed using subsets of variables, that should undergo joint variation. Such knowledge can be exploited if faster fitness evaluations are possible when only a few variables are changed in a solution, enabling large speed-ups. The recent-most version of Real-Valued GOMEA (RV-GOMEA) can learn a conditional linkage model during optimization using fitness-based linkage learning, enabling fine-grained dependency exploitation in learning and sampling a Gaussian distribution. However, while the most efficient Gaussian-based EAs, like NES and CMA-ES, employ incremental learning of the Gaussian distribution rather than performing full re-estimation every generation, the recent-most RV-GOMEA version does not employ such incremental learning. In this paper, we therefore study whether incremental distribution estimation can lead to efficiency enhancements of RV-GOMEA. We consider various benchmark problems with varying degrees of overlapping dependencies. We find that, compared to RV-GOMEA and VKD-CMA-ES, the required number of evaluations to reach high-quality solutions can be reduced by a factor of up to 1.5 if population sizes are tuned problem-specifically, while a reduction by a factor of 2-3 can be achieved with generic population-sizing guidelines.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Sparse Coding-based Spiking Neural Network for Real-time Spike Sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.24041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spike sorting is a crucial step in decoding multichannel extracellular neural signals, enabling the identification of individual neuronal activity. A key challenge in brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) is achieving real-time, low-power spike sorting at the edge while keeping high neural decoding performance. This study introduces the Neuromorphic Sparse Sorter (NSS), a compact two-layer spiking neural network optimized for efficient spike sorting. NSS leverages the Locally Competitive Algorithm (LCA) for sparse coding to extract relevant features from noisy events with reduced computational demands. NSS learns to sort detected spike waveforms in an online fashion and operates entirely unsupervised. To exploit multi-bit spike coding capabilities of neuromorphic platforms like Intel's Loihi 2, a custom neuron model was implemented, enabling flexible power-performance trade-offs via adjustable spike bit-widths. Evaluations on simulated and real-world tetrode signals with biological drift showed NSS outperformed established pipelines such as WaveClus3 and PCA+KMeans. With 2-bit graded spikes, NSS on Loihi 2 outperformed NSS implemented with leaky integrate-and-fire neuron and achieved an F1-score of 77% (+10% improvement) while consuming 8.6mW (+1.65mW) when tested on a drifting recording, with a computational processing time of 0.25ms (+60 us) per inference.</description>

      <title>Can "consciousness" be observed from large language model (LLM) internal states? Dissecting LLM representations obtained from Theory of Mind test with Integrated Information Theory and Span Representation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22516v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrated Information Theory (IIT) provides a quantitative framework for explaining consciousness phenomenon, positing that conscious systems comprise elements integrated through causal properties. We apply IIT 3.0 and 4.0 -- the latest iterations of this framework -- to sequences of Large Language Model (LLM) representations, analyzing data derived from existing Theory of Mind (ToM) test results. Our study systematically investigates whether the differences of ToM test performances, when presented in the LLM representations, can be revealed by IIT estimates, i.e., $\Phi^{\max}$ (IIT 3.0), $\Phi$ (IIT 4.0), Conceptual Information (IIT 3.0), and $\Phi$-structure (IIT 4.0). Furthermore, we compare these metrics with the Span Representations independent of any estimate for consciousness. This additional effort aims to differentiate between potential "consciousness" phenomena and inherent separations within LLM representational space. We conduct comprehensive experiments examining variations across LLM transformer layers and linguistic spans from stimuli. Our results suggest that sequences of contemporary Transformer-based LLM representations lack statistically significant indicators of observed "consciousness" phenomena but exhibit intriguing patterns under $\textit{spatio}$-permutational analyses.

      <title>Correlated Mutations for Integer Programming</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even with the recent theoretical advancements that dramatically reduced the complexity of Integer Programming (IP), heuristics remain the dominant problem-solvers for this difficult category. This study seeks to establish the groundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized search heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel in treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by applying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while persistently using the $\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay foundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\ell_1$-norm, accounting for the suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify correlations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for unbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate discrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which we show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down to the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We explore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose a procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which consistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for unbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical evidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other strategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the replacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified and practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the $\ell_1$-norm over the $\ell_2$-norm.</description>

      <title>FF-INT8: Efficient Forward-Forward DNN Training on Edge Devices with INT8 Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Backpropagation has been the cornerstone of neural network training for decades, yet its inefficiencies in time and energy consumption limit its suitability for resource-constrained edge devices. While low-precision neural network quantization has been extensively researched to speed up model inference, its application in training has been less explored. Recently, the Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm has emerged as a promising alternative to backpropagation, replacing the backward pass with an additional forward pass. By avoiding the need to store intermediate activations for backpropagation, FF can reduce memory footprint, making it well-suited for embedded devices. This paper presents an INT8 quantized training approach that leverages FF's layer-by-layer strategy to stabilize gradient quantization. Furthermore, we propose a novel "look-ahead" scheme to address limitations of FF and improve model accuracy. Experiments conducted on NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano board demonstrate 4.6% faster training, 8.3% energy savings, and 27.0% reduction in memory usage, while maintaining competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Mirror Descent Policy Optimisation for Robust Constrained Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Safety is an essential requirement for reinforcement learning systems. The newly emerging framework of robust constrained Markov decision processes allows learning policies that satisfy long-term constraints while providing guarantees under epistemic uncertainty. This paper presents mirror descent policy optimisation for robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), making use of policy gradient techniques to optimise both the policy (as a maximiser) and the transition kernel (as an adversarial minimiser) on the Lagrangian representing a constrained MDP. In the oracle-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{T}\right)$ convergence rate for the squared distance as a Bregman divergence, and an $\mathcal{O}\left(e^{-T}\right)$ convergence rate for entropy-regularised objectives. In the sample-based RCMDP setting, we obtain an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\frac{1}{T^{1/3}}\right)$ convergence rate. Experiments confirm the benefits of mirror descent policy optimisation in constrained and unconstrained optimisation, and significant improvements are observed in robustness tests when compared to baseline policy optimisation algorithms.</description>

      <title>Neural Langevin Machine: a local asymmetric learning rule can be creative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fixed points of recurrent neural networks can be leveraged to store and generate information. These fixed points can be captured by the Boltzmann-Gibbs measure, which leads to neural Langevin dynamics that can be used for sampling and learning a real dataset. We call this type of generative model neural Langevin machine, which is interpretable due to its analytic form of distribution and is simple to train. Moreover, the learning process is derived as a local asymmetric plasticity rule, bearing biological relevance. Therefore, one can realize a continuous sampling of creative dynamics in a neural network, mimicking an imagination process in brain circuits. This neural Langevin machine may be another promising generative model, at least in its strength in circuit-based sampling and biologically plausible learning rule.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Spiking Neural Network Learning Methods with Varying Locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), providing more realistic neuronal dynamics, have been shown to achieve performance comparable to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) in several machine learning tasks. Information is processed as spikes within SNNs in an event-based mechanism that significantly reduces energy consumption. However, training SNNs is challenging due to the non-differentiable nature of the spiking mechanism. Traditional approaches, such as Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT), have shown effectiveness but come with additional computational and memory costs and are biologically implausible. In contrast, recent works propose alternative learning methods with varying degrees of locality, demonstrating success in classification tasks. In this work, we show that these methods share similarities during the training process, while they present a trade-off between biological plausibility and performance. Further, given the implicitly recurrent nature of SNNs, this research investigates the influence of the addition of explicit recurrence to SNNs. We experimentally prove that the addition of explicit recurrent weights enhances the robustness of SNNs. We also investigate the performance of local learning methods under gradient and non-gradient-based adversarial attacks.</description>

      <title>TMN: A Lightweight Neuron Model for Efficient Nonlinear Spike Representation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spike trains serve as the primary medium for information transmission in Spiking Neural Networks, playing a crucial role in determining system efficiency. Existing encoding schemes based on spike counts or timing often face severe limitations under low-timestep constraints, while more expressive alternatives typically involve complex neuronal dynamics or system designs, which hinder scalability and practical deployment. To address these challenges, we propose the Ternary Momentum Neuron (TMN), a novel neuron model featuring two key innovations: (1) a lightweight momentum mechanism that realizes exponential input weighting by doubling the membrane potential before integration, and (2) a ternary predictive spiking scheme which employs symmetric sub-thresholds $\pm\frac{1}{2}v_{th}$ to enable early spiking and correct over-firing. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks and network architectures demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high-precision encoding with significantly fewer timesteps, providing a scalable and hardware-aware solution for next-generation SNN computing.</description>

      <title>Connecting phases of matter to the flatness of the loss landscape in analog variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) promise near-term quantum advantage, yet parametrized quantum states commonly built from the digital gate-based approach often suffer from scalability issues such as barren plateaus, where the loss landscape becomes flat. We study an analog VQA ans\"atze composed of $M$ quenches of a disordered Ising chain, whose dynamics is native to several quantum simulation platforms. By tuning the disorder strength we place each quench in either a thermalized phase or a many-body-localized (MBL) phase and analyse (i) the ans\"atze's expressivity and (ii) the scaling of loss variance. Numerics shows that both phases reach maximal expressivity at large $M$, but barren plateaus emerge at far smaller $M$ in the thermalized phase than in the MBL phase. Exploiting this gap, we propose an MBL initialisation strategy: initialise the ans\"atze in the MBL regime at intermediate quench $M$, enabling an initial trainability while retaining sufficient expressivity for subsequent optimization. The results link quantum phases of matter and VQA trainability, and provide practical guidelines for scaling analog-hardware VQAs.</description>
