      <title>AI-Powered Urban Transportation Digital Twin: Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a survey paper on methods and applications of digital twins (DT) for urban traffic management. While the majority of studies on the DT focus on its "eyes," which is the emerging sensing and perception like object detection and tracking, what really distinguishes the DT from a traditional simulator lies in its ``brain," the prediction and decision making capabilities of extracting patterns and making informed decisions from what has been seen and perceived. In order to add values to urban transportation management, DTs need to be powered by artificial intelligence and complement with low-latency high-bandwidth sensing and networking technologies. We will first review the DT pipeline leveraging cyberphysical systems and propose our DT architecture deployed on a real-world testbed in New York City. This survey paper can be a pointer to help researchers and practitioners identify challenges and opportunities for the development of DTs; a bridge to initiate conversations across disciplines; and a road map to exploiting potentials of DTs for diverse urban transportation applications.</description>

      <title>A flatness-based predictive controller for six-degrees of freedom spacecraft rendezvous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a closed-loop guidance algorithm for six-degrees of freedom spacecraft rendezvous with a passive target flying in an eccentric orbit. The main assumption is that the chaser vehicle has an attitude control system, based on reaction wheels, providing the necessary torque to change its orientation whereas the number of thrusters is arbitrary. The goal is to design fuel optimal maneuvers while satisfying operational constraints and rejecting disturbances. The proposed method is as follows; first, the coupled translational and angular dynamics are transformed to equivalent algebraic relations using the relative translational states transition matrix and the attitude flatness property. Then, a direct transcription method, based on B-splines parameterization and discretization of time continuous constraints, is developed to obtain a tractable static program. Finally, a Model Predictive Controller, based on linearization around the previously computed solution, is considered to handle disturbances. Numerical results are shown and discussed.</description>

      <title>Chance-constrained Model Predictive Control for Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit spacecraft rendezvous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10437v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a robust Model Predictive Controller (MPC) to solve the problem of spacecraft rendezvous in the context of the restricted three-body problem (R3BP) as will be required to dock with space stations in cislunar space. The employed methodology is both valid for chemical and electric thrusters. By exploiting the state transition matrix and using a chance-constrained approach, the robust MPC assures constraints satisfaction under the presence of disturbances in a probabilistic sense. The perturbations parameters are computed on-line using a disturbance estimator. The robust controller is tested for a rendezvous scenario with a target placed in an Earth-Moon Near-Rectilinear Halo Orbit. Numerical results are shown and discussed.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Impulsive Control for Spacecraft Rendezvous Hovering Phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an event-triggered controller for spacecraft rendezvous hovering phases. The goal is to maintain the chaser within a bounded region with respect to the target. The main assumption is that the chaser vehicle has impulsive thrusters. These are assumed to be orientable at any direction and are constrained by dead-zone and saturation bounds. The event-based controller relies on trigger rules deciding when a suitable control law is applied. The local control law consists on a single impulse; therefore the trigger rules design is based on the instantaneous reachability to the admissible set. The final outcome is a very efficient algorithm from both computational burden and footprint perspectives. Because the proposed methodology is based on a single impulse control, the controller invariance is local and assessed through impulsive systems theory. Finally, numerical results are shown and discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimizing a multi-state cold-standby system with multiple vacations in the repair and loss of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex multi-state redundant system with preventive maintenance subject to multiple events is considered. The online unit can undergo several types of failures: internal and those provoked by external shocks. Multiple degradation levels are assumed so as internal and external. Degradation levels are observed by random inspections and if they are major, the unit goes to repair facility where preventive maintenance is carried out. This repair facility is composed of a single repairperson governed by a multiple vacation policy. This policy is set up according to the operational number of units. Two types of task can be performed by the repairperson, corrective repair and preventive maintenance. The times embedded in the system are phase type distributed and the model is built by using Markovian Arrival Processes with marked arrivals. Multiple performance measures besides of the transient and stationary distribution are worked out through matrix-analytic methods. This methodology enables us to express the main results and the global development in a matrix-algorithmic form. To optimize the model costs and rewards are included. A numerical example shows the versatility of the model.</description>

      <title>A Predictive Cooperative Collision Avoidance for Multi-Robot Systems Using Control Barrier Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control barrier function (CBF)-based methods provide the minimum modification necessary to formally guarantee safety in the context of quadratic programming, and strict safety guarantee for safety critical systems. However, most CBF-related derivatives myopically focus on present safety at each time step, a reasoning over a look-ahead horizon is exactly missing. In this paper, a predictive safety matrix is constructed. We then consolidate the safety condition based on the smallest eigenvalue of the proposed safety matrix. A predefined deconfliction strategy of motion paths is embedded into the trajectory tracking module to manage deadlock conflicts, which computes the deadlock escape velocity with the minimum attitude angle. Comparison results show that the introduction of the predictive term is robust for measurement uncertainty and is immune to oscillations. The proposed deadlock avoidance method avoids a large detour, without obvious stagnation.</description>

      <title>Analytical Models of Frequency and Voltage in Large-Scale All-Inverter Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-order frequency response models for power systems have a decades-long history in optimization and control problems such as unit commitment, economic dispatch, and wide-area control. With a few exceptions, these models are built upon the Newtonian mechanics of synchronous generators, assuming that the frequency dynamics across a system are approximately homogeneous, and assume the dynamics of nodal voltages for most operating conditions are negligible, and thus are not directly computed at all buses. As a result, the use of system frequency models results in the systematic underestimation of frequency minimum nadir and maximum RoCoF, and provides no insight into the reactive power-voltage dynamics. This paper proposes a low-order model of both frequency and voltage response in grid-forming inverter-dominated power systems. The proposed model accounts for spatial-temporal variations in frequency and voltage behavior across a system and as a result, demonstrates the heterogeneity of frequency response in future renewable power systems. Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulations are used to validate the utility, accuracy, and computational efficiency of these models, setting the basis for them to serve as fast, scalable alternatives to EMT simulation, especially when dealing with very large-scale systems, for both planning and operational studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an automated water irrigation system aimed at optimizing plant care through precision moisture monitoring and controlled water delivery. The system uses a capacitive soil moisture sensor, an ADC (analog-to-digital converter), and a relay-driven water pump to ensure plants receive adequate hydration based on real-time data. In addition, this work aims to build on existing applications for Raspberry Pi (4B) and Arduino-based automatic irrigation systems by integrating advanced calibration methods, employing optimized algorithms, and introducing new technologies to further enhance overall system efficiency and reliability.</description>

Abstract: Inspired greatly by Mills et al. (2009) and the solution within, this paper aims to more clearly
  explain the mathematics and implementation details of such a powerful control algorithm. While the
  aforementioned paper is well written and of sound mathematics, it is extreamly dense and requires
  some time and patience to decipher, especially as it draws on many other sources to complete the
  algorithm. This dense property is a clear result of the paper being restricted to the brief form and
  important details being ommited as a result. We provide the much needed elaboration here for the
  benifit of the reader.</description>

      <title>Integrating Expert and Physics Knowledge for Modeling Heat Load in District Heating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: New residential neighborhoods are often supplied with heat via district heating systems (DHS). Improving the energy efficiency of a DHS is critical for increasing sustainability and satisfying user requirements. In this paper, we present HELIOS, a dedicated artificial intelligence (AI) model designed specifically for modeling the heat load in DHS. HELIOS leverages a combination of established physical principles and expert knowledge, resulting in superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art models. HELIOS is explainable, enabling enhanced accountability and traceability in its predictions. We evaluate HELIOS against ten state-of-the-art data-driven models in modeling the heat load in a DHS case study in the Netherlands. HELIOS emerges as the top-performing model while maintaining complete accountability. The applications of HELIOS extend beyond the present case study, potentially supporting the adoption of AI by DHS and contributing to sustainable energy management on a larger scale.</description>

      <title>Systems Engineering for Autonomous Vehicles; Supervising AI using Large Language Models (SSuperLLM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) and the idea to use hierarchical models has been around for some years now. GAI has proved to be an extremely useful tool for Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). AVs need to perform robustly in their environment. Thus the AV behavior and short-term trajectory planning needs to be: a) designed and architected using safeguarding and supervisory systems and b) verified using proper Systems Engineering (SysEng) Principles. Can AV Systems Engineering also use Large Language Models (LLM) to help Autonomous vehicles (AV) development? This reader-friendly paper advocates the use of LLMs in 1) requirements (Reqs) development and 2) Reqs verification and 3) provides a proof-of-concept of AV supervisory control. The latter uses a simulation environment of a simple planar (bicycle) vehicle dynamics model and a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control with an LLM Application Interface (API). The Open-Source simulation SW is available from the author accessible to the readers so that they can engage into the AV stack, LLM API and rules, SysEng and Reqs and fundamental vehicle dynamics and control.</description>

      <title>BOOST: Microgrid Sizing using Ordinal Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition to sustainable energy systems has highlighted the critical need for efficient sizing of renewable energy resources in microgrids. In particular, designing photovoltaic (PV) and battery systems to meet residential loads is challenging due to trade-offs between cost, reliability, and environmental impact. While previous studies have employed dynamic programming and heuristic techniques for microgrid sizing, these approaches often fail to balance computational efficiency and accuracy. In this work, we propose BOOST, or Battery-solar Ordinal Optimization Sizing Technique, a novel framework for optimizing the sizing of PV and battery components in microgrids. Ordinal optimization enables computationally efficient evaluations of potential designs while preserving accuracy through robust ranking of solutions. To determine the optimal operation of the system at any given time, we introduce a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach, which achieves lower costs than the commonly used dynamic programming methods. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework identifies optimal designs that achieve a levelized cost of energy (LCOE) as low as 8.84 cents/kWh, underscoring its potential for cost-effective microgrid design. The implications of our work are significant: BOOST provides a scalable and accurate methodology for integrating renewable energy into residential microgrids, addressing economic and environmental goals simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Which price to pay? Auto-tuning building MPC controller for optimal economic cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) controller is considered for temperature management in buildings but its performance heavily depends on hyperparameters. Consequently, MPC necessitates meticulous hyperparameter tuning to attain optimal performance under diverse contracts. However, conventional building controller design is an open-loop process without critical hyperparameter optimization, often leading to suboptimal performance due to unexpected environmental disturbances and modeling errors. Furthermore, these hyperparameters are not adapted to different pricing schemes and may lead to non-economic operations. To address these issues, we propose an efficient performance-oriented building MPC controller tuning method based on a cutting-edge efficient constrained Bayesian optimization algorithm, CONFIG, with global optimality guarantees. We demonstrate that this technique can be applied to efficiently deal with real-world DSM program selection problems under customized black-box constraints and objectives. In this study, a simple MPC controller, which offers the advantages of reduced commissioning costs, enhanced computational efficiency, was optimized to perform on a comparable level to a delicately designed and computationally expensive MPC controller. The results also indicate that with an optimized simple MPC, the monthly electricity cost of a household can be reduced by up to 26.90% compared with the cost when controlled by a basic rule-based controller under the same constraints. Then we compared 12 real electricity contracts in Belgium for a household family with customized black-box occupant comfort constraints. The results indicate a monthly electricity bill saving up to 20.18% when the most economic contract is compared with the worst one, which again illustrates the significance of choosing a proper electricity contract.</description>

      <title>Global Attitude Synchronization for Multi-agent Systems on SO(3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of attitude synchronization for a group of rigid body systems evolving on SO(3). The interaction among these systems is modeled through an undirected, connected, and acyclic graph topology. First, we present an almost global continuous distributed attitude synchronization scheme with rigorously proven stability guarantees. Thereafter, we propose two global distributed hybrid attitude synchronization schemes on SO(3). The first scheme is a hybrid control law that leverages angular velocities and relative orientations to achieve global alignment to a common orientation. The second scheme eliminates the dependence on angular velocities by introducing dynamic auxiliary variables, while ensuring global asymptotic attitude synchronization. This velocity-free control scheme relies exclusively on attitude information. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed attitude synchronization schemes.</description>

      <title>Unlocking the Potential: A Novel Tool for Assessing Untapped Micro-Pumped Hydro Energy Storage Systems in Michigan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an innovative tool designed to unlock the potential of Michigan's lakes and dams for applications such as water resource management and renewable energy generation. Given Michigan's relatively flat landscape, the focus is on systems that could serve as micro-hydro energy storage solutions. To ensure accuracy and reliability, the tool incorporates extensive data gathered from authorized sources, covering more than 420 water facilities and potential reservoirs in the state. These data are used as part of a case study to evaluate the tool's capabilities. Key parameters assessed include horizontal and vertical distances (head), volume, and the total storage capacity of each reservoir, measured in GWh. By analyzing these factors, the tool determines the suitability of various lakes and dams for hydroelectric power generation, and other uses based on the horizontal and vertical threshold distances. Its robust assessment framework integrates these metrics to comprehensively evaluate each site's potential. The tool's friendly interface and advanced data visualization features make the findings easy to interpret, facilitating optimal resource utilization and informed decision-making for state authorities.

      <title>A Dynamic Improvement Framework for Vehicular Task Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the task offloading from vehicles with random velocities is optimized via a novel dynamic improvement framework. Particularly, in a vehicular network with multiple vehicles and base stations (BSs), computing tasks of vehicles are offloaded via BSs to an edge server. Due to the random velocities, the exact trajectories of vehicles cannot be predicted in advance. Hence, instead of deterministic optimization, the cell association, uplink time and throughput allocation of multiple vehicles in a period of task offloading are formulated as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. In the proposed solution framework, we first obtain a reference scheduling scheme of cell association, uplink time and throughput allocation via deterministic optimization at the very beginning. The reference scheduling scheme is then used to approximate the value functions of the Bellman's equations, and the actual scheduling action is determined in each time slot according to the current system state and approximate value functions. Thus, the intensive computation for value iteration in the conventional solution is eliminated. Moreover, a non-trivial average cost upper bound is provided for the proposed solution framework. In the simulation, the random trajectories of vehicles are generated from a high-fidelity traffic simulator. It is shown that the performance gain of the proposed scheduling framework over the baselines is significant.</description>

      <title>Driver Behavior Soft-Sensor Based on Neurofuzzy Systems and Weighted Projection on Principal Components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work has as main objective the development of a soft-sensor to classify, in real time, the behaviors of drivers when they are at the controls of a vehicle. Efficient classification of drivers' behavior while driving, using only the measurements of the sensors already incorporated in the vehicles and without the need to add extra hardware (smart phones, cameras, etc.), is a challenge. The main advantage of using only the data center signals of modern vehicles is economical. The classification of the driving behavior and the warning to the driver of dangerous behaviors without the need to add extra hardware (and their software) to the vehicle, would allow the direct integration of these classifiers into the current vehicles without incurring a greater cost in the manufacture of the vehicles and therefore be an added value. In this work, the classification is obtained based only on speed, acceleration and inertial measurements which are already present in many modern vehicles. The proposed algorithm is based on a structure made by several Neurofuzzy systems with the combination of projected data in components of various Principal Component Analysis. A comparison with several types of classical classifying algorithms has been made.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that linear Active Disturbance-Rejection Control (ADRC) tuned using the "bandwidth method" is equivalent to PI(D) control with set-point weighting and a lowpass filter on the measurement signal. We also provide simple expressions that make it possible to implement linear ADRC for first and second-order systems using commonplace two degree-of-freedom PID implementations. The expressions are equivalent to ADRC in the response from measurements, and a slight approximation in the response from references.</description>

      <title>Efficient Reduction of Interconnected Subsystem Models using Abstracted Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two frameworks for structure-preserving model order reduction of interconnected subsystems, improving tractability of the reduction methods while ensuring stability and accuracy bounds of the reduced interconnected model. Instead of reducing each subsystem independently, we take a low-order abstraction of its environment into account to better capture the dynamics relevant to the external input-output behaviour of the interconnected system, thereby increasing accuracy of the reduced interconnected model. This approach significantly reduces the computational costs of reduction by abstracting instead of fully retaining the environment. The two frameworks differ in how they generate these abstracted environments: one abstracts the environment as a whole, whereas the other abstracts each individual subsystem. By relating low-level errors introduced by reduction and abstraction to the resulting high-level error on the interconnected system, we are able to translate high-level accuracy requirements (on the reduced interconnected system) to low-level specifications (on abstraction and reduction errors) using techniques from robust performance analysis. By adhering to these low-level specifications, restricting the introduced low-level errors, both frameworks automatically guarantee the accuracy and stability of the reduced interconnected system. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both frameworks by applying them to a structural dynamics model of a two-stroke wafer stage, achieving improved accuracy and/or greater reduction compared to an existing method from literature.</description>

      <title>Discrete-Time Passivity-Based Control using Hermite-Obreschkoff Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the implementation of nonlinear state feedback control, designed based on the continuous-time plant model, in a sampled control loop under relatively slow sampling. In previous work we have shown that using one-step predictions of the target dynamics with higher order integration schemes, together with possibly higher order input shaping, is a simple and effective way to increase the feasible sampling times until performance degradation and instability occur. In this contribution we present a unifying derivation for arbitrary orders of the previously used Lobatto IIIA collocation and Hermite interpolation schemes through the Hermite-Obreschkoff formula. We derive, moreover, an IDA-PBC controller for a magnetic levitation system, which requires a non-constant target interconnection matrix, and show experimental results.</description>

      <title>Optimal Trajectory Control of Geometrically Exact Strings with Space-Time Finite Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution, we present a variational space-time formulation which generates an optimal feed-forward controller for geometrically exact strings. More concretely, the optimization problem is solved with an indirect approach, and the space-time finite element method translates the problem to a set of algebraic equations. Thereby, only the positional field and the corresponding adjoint variable field are approximated by continuous shape functions, which makes the discretization of a velocity field unnecessary. In addition, the variational formulation can be solved using commercial or open source finite element packages. The entire approach can also be interpreted as a multiple-shooting method for solving the optimality conditions based on the semi-discrete problem. The performance of our approach is demonstrated by a numerical test.</description>

      <title>Early Stopping Bayesian Optimization for Controller Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manual tuning of performance-critical controller parameters can be tedious and sub-optimal. Bayesian Optimization (BO) is an increasingly popular practical alternative to automatically optimize controller parameters from few experiments. Standard BO practice is to evaluate the closed-loop performance of parameters proposed during optimization on an episode with a fixed length. However, fixed-length episodes can be wasteful. For example, continuing an episode where already the start shows undesirable behavior such as strong oscillations seems pointless. Therefore, we propose a BO method that stops an episode early if suboptimality becomes apparent before an episode is completed. Such early stopping results in partial observations of the controller's performance, which cannot directly be included in standard BO. We propose three heuristics to facilitate partially observed episodes in BO. Through five numerical and one hardware experiment, we demonstrate that early stopping BO can substantially reduce the time needed for optimization.</description>

      <title>DLinear-based Prediction of Remaining Useful Life of Lithium-Ion Batteries: Feature Engineering through Explainable Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is essential for ensuring safety, reducing maintenance costs, and optimizing usage. However, predicting RUL is challenging due to the nonlinear characteristics of the degradation caused by complex chemical reactions. Machine learning allows precise predictions by learning the latent functions of degradation relationships based on cycling behavior. This study introduces an accurate RUL prediction approach based on feature engineering and DLinear, applied to the dataset from NASA's Prognostics Center of Excellence. Among the 20 features generated from current, voltage, temperature, and time provided in this dataset, key features contributing to degradation are selected using Pearson correlation coefficient and Shapley values. Shapley value-based feature selection effectively reflects cell-to-cell variability, showing similar importance rankings across all cells. The DLinear-based RUL prediction using key features efficiently captures the time-series trend, demonstrating significantly better performance compared to Long Short-Term Memory and Transformer models.</description>

      <title>DRL-Based Maximization of the Sum Cross-Layer Achievable Rate for Networks Under Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quasi-static wireless networks characterized by infrequent changes in the transmission schedules of user equipment (UE), malicious jammers can easily deteriorate network performance. Accordingly, a key challenge in these networks is managing channel access amidst jammers and under dynamic channel conditions. In this context, we propose a robust learning-based mechanism for channel access in multi-cell quasi-static networks under jamming. The network comprises multiple legitimate UEs, including predefined UEs (pUEs) with stochastic predefined schedules and an intelligent UE (iUE) with an undefined transmission schedule, all transmitting over a shared, time-varying uplink channel. Jammers transmit unwanted packets to disturb the pUEs' and the iUE's communication. The iUE's learning process is based on the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework, utilizing a residual network (ResNet)-based deep Q-Network (DQN). To coexist in the network and maximize the network's sum cross-layer achievable rate (SCLAR), the iUE must learn the unknown network dynamics while concurrently adapting to dynamic channel conditions. Our simulation results reveal that, with properly defined state space, action space, and rewards in DRL, the iUE can effectively coexist in the network, maximizing channel utilization and the network's SCLAR by judiciously selecting transmission time slots and thus avoiding collisions and jamming.</description>

      <title>PSO-based Sliding Mode Current Control of Grid-Forming Inverter in Rotating Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Grid-Forming Inverter (GFMI) is an emerging topic that is attracting significant attention from both academic and industrial communities, particularly in the area of control design. The Decoupled Average Model-based Sliding Mode Current Controller (DAM-SMC) has been used to address the need such as fast response, fixed switching frequency, and no overshoot to avoid exceeding current limits. Typically, the control parameters for DAM-SMC are chosen based on expert knowledge and certain assumptions. However, these parameters may not achieve optimized performance due to system dynamics and uncertainties. To address this, this paper proposes a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based DAM-SMC controller, which inherits the control laws from DAM-SMC but optimizes the control parameters offline using PSO. The main goal is to reduce chattering and achieve smaller tracking errors. The proposed method is compared with other metaheuristic optimization algorithms, such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Simulations are performed in MATLAB/Simulink across various scenarios to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed controller. The proposed approach achieves a substantial reduction in convergence time, decreasing it by 86.36% compared to the GA and by 88.89% compared to SA. Furthermore, the tracking error is reduced by 11.61% compared to the conventional DAM-SMC algorithm. The robustness of the proposed method is validated under critical conditions, where plant and control model parameters varied by up to 40%.</description>

      <title>KKL Observer Synthesis for Nonlinear Systems via Physics-Informed Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel learning approach for designing Kazantzis-Kravaris/Luenberger (KKL) observers for autonomous nonlinear systems. The design of a KKL observer involves finding an injective map that transforms the system state into a higher-dimensional observer state, whose dynamics is linear and stable. The observer's state is then mapped back to the original system coordinates via the inverse map to obtain the state estimate. However, finding this transformation and its inverse is quite challenging. We propose to sequentially approximate these maps by neural networks that are trained using physics-informed learning. We generate synthetic data for training by numerically solving the system and observer dynamics. Theoretical guarantees for the robustness of state estimation against approximation error and system uncertainties are provided. Additionally, a systematic method for optimizing observer performance through parameter selection is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through numerical simulations on benchmark examples and its application to sensor fault detection and isolation in a network of Kuramoto oscillators using learned KKL observers.</description>

      <title>Power Ramp-Rate Control via Power Regulation for Storageless Grid-Connected Photovoltaic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photovoltaic Power Ramp-Rate Control (PRRC) constitutes a key ancillary service for future power systems. Although its implementation through the installation of storage systems or irradiance sensors has been widely investigated, fewer studies have explored the power curtailment approach. The latter lacks efficiency, as it voluntarily produces power discharges, yet it is a cost-effective solution in terms of capital expenditures. This paper proposes a novel storageless and sensorless photovoltaic PRRC for grid-connected applications in which the photovoltaic power, rather than the voltage, is the controlled magnitude. The aforementioned contribution makes the effective tracking of the power ramp-rate limit possible compared to the existing methods in the literature. The method is assisted by a real-time curve-fitting algorithm that estimates the Maximum Power Point while operating suboptimally. Thus, no direct temperature or irradiance measurement systems are needed. The validation of the proposed PRRC strategy has been tested by simulation and compared to another approach available in the literature, considering real-field highly variable irradiance data. Experimental validation of the proposed strategy has been performed in real time via Controller Hardware-in-the-Loop.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High Reliability by Predictive Interference Management Using Extreme Value Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) require innovative approaches to modeling channel and interference dynamics, extending beyond traditional average estimates to encompass entire statistical distributions, including rare and extreme events that challenge achieving ultra-reliability performance regions. In this paper, we propose a risk-sensitive approach based on extreme value theory (EVT) to predict the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for efficient resource allocation in URLLC systems. We employ EVT to estimate the statistics of rare and extreme interference values, and kernel density estimation (KDE) to model the distribution of non-extreme events. Using a mixture model, we develop an interference prediction algorithm based on quantile prediction, introducing a confidence level parameter to balance reliability and resource usage. While accounting for the risk sensitivity of interference estimates, the prediction outcome is then used for appropriate resource allocation of a URLLC transmission under link outage constraints. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art first-order discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC) approach by reducing outage rates up to 100-fold, achieving target outage probabilities as low as \(10^{-7}\). Simultaneously, it minimizes radio resource usage \(\simnot15 \%\) compared to DTMC, while remaining only \(\simnot20 \%\) above the optimal case with perfect interference knowledge, resulting in significantly higher prediction accuracy. Additionally, the method is sample-efficient, able to predict interference effectively with minimal training data.</description>

      <title>Comparative Analysis of Control Strategies for Position Regulation in DC Servo Motors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A servomotor is a closed-loop system designed for precise movement control, utilizing position feedback to achieve accurate final positions. Due to the ability to deliver higher power output and operate at enhanced speeds, DC servo motors are considered ideal for applications requiring precision and performance. This research aims to design, simulate, and compare various control strategies for precise position control in DC servo motors (DSM). The controllers evaluated in this study include proportional (P), proportional-integral (PI), proportional-integral-derivative (PID), state-feedback controllers (SFC), and state-feedback controllers augmented with integral action (SFCIA). The performance of these controllers was evaluated using MATLAB simulations, characterized by overshoot, settling time, steady-state error, rise time, and peak time. The results indicate that the state-feedback controller with integral action (SFCIA) surpasses other control strategies by achieving zero steady-state error, minimal overshoot, the shortest settling time, and optimized rise and peak times. These findings highlight the effectiveness of SFCIA for tasks requiring high levels of stability, precision, and dynamic performance.</description>

Abstract: Cascading failures, such as bankruptcies and defaults, pose a serious threat for the resilience of the global financial system. Indeed, because of the complex investment and cross-holding relations within the system, failures can occur as a result of the propagation of a financial collapse from one organization to another. While this problem has been studied in depth from a static angle, namely, when the system is at an equilibrium, we take a different perspective and study the corresponding dynamical system. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we carry out a systematic analysis of the regions of attraction and invariance of the system orthants, defined by the positive and negative values of the organizations' equity. Second, we investigate periodic solutions and show through a counterexample that there could exist periodic solutions of period greater than 2. Finally, we study the problem of finding the smallest cash injection that would bring the system to the maximal invariant region of the positive orthant.</description>

      <title>Microgrid Operation Control with State-of-Charge- Dependent Storage Power Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The microgrid concept offers high flexibility and resilience due to the possibility of switching between grid-connected and stand-alone operation. This renders microgrids an auspicious solution for rural areas and critical infrastructure. In standalone or islanded mode, the main objective is cost minimization while ensuring a safe and reliable operation. Optimal operation schemes for microgrids usually assume fixed power limits for energy storage units. This, however, is not sufficient for lithiumion energy storage systems, which often come with dynamic power limits that depend on the state of charge. These limits are especially prominent when the state of charge is close to its boundaries. In this paper, dynamic constraints for energy storages are modelled using convex polytopes and fitted to experimental data acquired from an 11.6 kWh lithium-ion energy storage system. The polytopic constraints are integrated in a model predictive control scheme that was designed for a standalone microgrid composed of a fuel cell, a photovoltaic generator and a lithium-ion energy storage system. To evaluate the advantages, a case study with two configurations is performed. The model predictive controller without polytopic constraints led to constraint violations in 11.77 % of the simulation time steps with a maximum deviation of 118 % above the power limits. The configuration with polytopic constraints in contrary led to no violations over the entire simulation horizon.</description>

      <title>ARM-IRL: Adaptive Resilience Metric Quantification Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resilience of safety-critical systems is gaining importance, particularly with the increasing number of cyber and physical threats. Cyber-physical threats are becoming increasingly prevalent, as digital systems are ubiquitous in critical infrastructure. The challenge with determining the resilience of cyber-physical systems is identifying a set of resilience metrics that can adapt to the changing states of the system. A static resilience metric can lead to an inaccurate estimation of system state, and can result in unintended consequences against cyber threats. In this work, we propose a data-driven method for adaptive resilience metric learning. The primary goal is to learn a single resilience metric by formulating an inverse reinforcement learning problem that learns a reward or objective from a set of control actions from an expert. It learns the structure or parameters of the reward function based on information provided by expert demonstrations. Most prior work has considered static weights or theories from fuzzy logic to formulate a single resilience metric. Instead, this work learns the resilience metric, represented as reward function, using adversarial inverse reinforcement learning, to determine the optimal policy through training the generator discriminator in parallel. We evaluate our proposed technique in scenarios such as optimal communication network rerouting, power distribution network reconfiguration, and a combined cyber-physical restoration of critical load using the IEEE 123-bus system.</description>

      <title>Ion Transmitter for Molecular Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10392v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular communication (MC) is an emerging paradigm that takes inspiration from biological processes, enabling communication at the nanoscale and facilitating the development of the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT). Traditional models of MC often rely on idealized assumptions that overlook practical challenges related to noise and signal behavior. This paper proposes and evaluates the first physical MC ion transmitter (ITX) using an ion exchange membrane. The circuit network model is used to simulate ion transport and analyze both transient and steady-state behavior. This analysis includes the effects of noise sources such as thermal and shot noise on signal integrity and SNR. The main contributions of this paper are to demonstrate how a practical MC ITX can produce a realistic waveform and to highlight future research challenges associated with a physical membrane-based ITX.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Search and Track of Rogue Drones using Multiagent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work considers the problem of intercepting rogue drones targeting sensitive critical infrastructure facilities. While current interception technologies focus mainly on the jamming/spoofing tasks, the challenges of effectively locating and tracking rogue drones have not received adequate attention. Solving this problem and integrating with recently proposed interception techniques will enable a holistic system that can reliably detect, track, and neutralize rogue drones. Specifically, this work considers a team of pursuer UAVs that can search, detect, and track multiple rogue drones over a sensitive facility. The joint search and track problem is addressed through a novel multiagent reinforcement learning scheme to optimize the agent mobility control actions that maximize the number of rogue drones detected and tracked. The performance of the proposed system is investigated under realistic settings through extensive simulation experiments with varying number of agents demonstrating both its performance and scalability.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances of 6G Ultra-Massive MIMO Technologies in Spatial and Beam Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To explore the full potential of ultra-massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, it is fundamental to understand new ultra-massive MIMO channel characteristics and establish pervasive channel models. On this basis, large dimensional spatial-temporal transmission and random access technologies need to be investigated and evaluated for better practical implementation. Firstly, this paper reviews recent advances of ultra-massive MIMO technologies in the traditional spatial domain, including wireless channel characterization and modeling, channel estimation, spatial multiplexing, and precoding. Secondly, considering the dramatic increase of base station (BS) antennas and access users in ultra-massive MIMO systems, the confronted high dimensional complexity and computing burden of these ultra-massive MIMO technologies are indicated. To provide efficient and systematic solution, the emerging tendency to transform related technologies from the traditional spatial domain to beam domain is introduced. The utilities of large sparsity merit, reduced energy consumption, and improved usage of radio frequency (RF) chains in the beam domain channel are elaborated. At last, future challenges of ultra-massive MIMO communication systems are discussed.</description>

      <title>Prediction Model of Aqua Fisheries Using IoT Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aquaculture involves cultivating marine and freshwater organisms, with real-time monitoring of aquatic parameters being crucial in fish farming. This thesis proposes an IoT-based framework using sensors and Arduino for efficient monitoring and control of water quality. Different sensors including pH, temperature, and turbidity are placed in cultivating pond water and each of them is connected to a common microcontroller board built on an Arduino Uno. The sensors read the data from the water and store it as a CSV file in an IoT cloud named Thingspeak through the Arduino Microcontroller. In the experimental part, we collected data from 5 ponds with various sizes and environments. After getting the real-time data, we compared these with the standard reference values. As a result, we can make the decision about which ponds are satisfactory for cultivating fish and what is not. After that, we labeled the data with 11 fish categories including Katla, sing, prawn, rui, koi, pangas, tilapia, silvercarp, karpio, magur, and shrimp. In addition, the data were analyzed using 10 machine learning (ML) algorithms containing J48, Random Forest, K-NN, K*, LMT, REPTree, JRIP, PART, Decision Table, and Logit boost. After experimental evaluation, it was observed among 5 ponds, only three ponds were perfect for fish farming, where these 3 ponds only satisfied the standard reference values of pH (6.5-8.5), Temperature (16-24)oC, Turbidity (below 10)ntu, Conductivity (970-1825){\mu}S/cm, and Depth (1-4) meter. Among the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, Random Forest achieved the highest score of performance metrics as accuracy 94.42%, kappa statistics 93.5%, and Avg. TP Rate 94.4%. In addition, we calculated the BOD, COD, and DO for one scenario. This study includes details of the proposed IoT system's prototype hardware.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of information and physical systems in modern power grids has heightened vulnerabilities to False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs), threatening the secure operation of power cyber-physical systems (CPS). This paper reviews FDIA detection, evolution, and data reconstruction strategies, highlighting cross-domain coordination, multi-temporal evolution, and stealth characteristics. Challenges in existing detection methods, including poor interpretability and data imbalance, are discussed, alongside advanced state-aware and action-control data reconstruction techniques. Key issues, such as modeling FDIA evolution and distinguishing malicious data from regular faults, are identified. Future directions to enhance system resilience and detection accuracy are proposed, contributing to the secure operation of power CPS.</description>

      <title>ACCEPT: Diagnostic Forecasting of Battery Degradation Through Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modeling lithium-ion battery (LIB) degradation offers significant cost savings and enhances the safety and reliability of electric vehicles (EVs) and battery energy storage systems (BESS). Whilst data-driven methods have received great attention for forecasting degradation, they often demonstrate limited generalization ability and tend to underperform particularly in critical scenarios involving accelerated degradation, which are crucial to predict accurately. These methods also fail to elucidate the underlying causes of degradation. Alternatively, physical models provide a deeper understanding, but their complex parameters and inherent uncertainties limit their applicability in real-world settings. To this end, we propose a new model - ACCEPT. Our novel framework uses contrastive learning to map the relationship between the underlying physical degradation parameters and observable operational quantities, combining the benefits of both approaches. Furthermore, due to the similarity of degradation paths between LIBs with the same chemistry, this model transfers non-trivially to most downstream tasks, allowing for zero-shot inference. Additionally, since categorical features can be included in the model, it can generalize to other LIB chemistries. This work establishes a foundational battery degradation model, providing reliable forecasts across a range of battery types and operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Multiclass Queue Scheduling Under Slowdown: An Approximate Dynamic Programming Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10523v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many service systems, especially those in healthcare, customer waiting times can result in increased service requirements. Such service slowdowns can significantly impact system performance. Therefore, it is important to properly account for their impact when designing scheduling policies. Scheduling under wait-dependent service times is challenging, especially when multiple customer classes are heterogeneously affected by waiting. In this work, we study scheduling policies in multiclass, multiserver queues with wait-dependent service slowdowns. We propose a simulation-based Approximate Dynamic Programming (ADP) algorithm to find close-to-optimal scheduling policies. The ADP algorithm (i) represents the policy using classifiers based on the index policy structure, (ii) leverages a coupling method to estimate the differences of the relative value functions directly, and (iii) uses adaptive sampling for efficient state-space exploration. Through extensive numerical experiments, we illustrate that the ADP algorithm generates close-to-optimal policies that outperform well-known benchmarks. We also provide insights into the structure of the optimal policy, which reveals an important trade-off between instantaneous cost reduction and preventing the system from reaching high-cost equilibria. Lastly, we conduct a case study on scheduling admissions into rehabilitation care to illustrate the effectiveness of the ADP algorithm in practice.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Adaptive Value Estimation for Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Wasserstein Adaptive Value Estimation for Actor-Critic (WAVE), an approach to enhance stability in deep reinforcement learning through adaptive Wasserstein regularization. Our method addresses the inherent instability of actor-critic algorithms by incorporating an adaptively weighted Wasserstein regularization term into the critic's loss function. We prove that WAVE achieves $\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ convergence rate for the critic's mean squared error and provide theoretical guarantees for stability through Wasserstein-based regularization. Using the Sinkhorn approximation for computational efficiency, our approach automatically adjusts the regularization based on the agent's performance. Theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrate that WAVE achieves superior performance compared to standard actor-critic methods.</description>

      <title>Assessing Markov Property in Driving Behaviors: Insights from Statistical Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Markov property serves as a foundational assumption in most existing work on vehicle driving behavior, positing that future states depend solely on the current state, not the series of preceding states. This study validates the Markov properties of vehicle trajectories for both Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and Human-driven Vehicles (HVs). A statistical method used to test whether time series data exhibits Markov properties is applied to examine whether the trajectory data possesses Markov characteristics. t test and F test are additionally introduced to characterize the differences in Markov properties between AVs and HVs. Based on two public trajectory datasets, we investigate the presence and order of the Markov property of different types of vehicles through rigorous statistical tests. Our findings reveal that AV trajectories generally exhibit stronger Markov properties compared to HV trajectories, with a higher percentage conforming to the Markov property and lower Markov orders. In contrast, HV trajectories display greater variability and heterogeneity in decision-making processes, reflecting the complex perception and information processing involved in human driving. These results have significant implications for the development of driving behavior models, AV controllers, and traffic simulation systems. Our study also demonstrates the feasibility of using statistical methods to test the presence of Markov properties in driving trajectory data.</description>

      <title>HOPS: High-order Polynomials with Self-supervised Dimension Reduction for Load Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Load forecasting is a fundamental task in smart grid. Many techniques have been applied to developing load forecasting models. Due to the challenges such as the Curse of Dimensionality, overfitting, and limited computing resources, multivariate higher-order polynomial models have received limited attention in load forecasting, despite their desirable mathematical foundations and optimization properties. In this paper, we propose low rank approximation and self-supervised dimension reduction to address the aforementioned issues. To further improve computational efficiency, we also introduce a fast Conjugate Gradient based algorithm for the proposed polynomial models. Based on the ISO New England dataset used in Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2017, the proposed method high-order polynomials with self-supervised dimension reduction (HOPS) demonstrates higher forecasting accuracy over several competitive models. Additionally, experimental results indicate that our approach alleviates redundant variable construction, achieving better forecasts with fewer input variables.</description>

      <title>Non-Expansive Mappings in Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation: Finite-Time Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation is an iterative algorithm used in applications such as optimization, reinforcement learning, and control. Finite-time analysis of these algorithms has primarily focused on fixed point iterations where both time-scales have contractive mappings. In this paper, we study two-time-scale iterations, where the slower time-scale has a non-expansive mapping. For such algorithms, the slower time-scale can be considered a stochastic inexact Krasnoselskii-Mann iteration. We show that the mean square error decays at a rate $O(1/k^{1/4-\epsilon})$, where $\epsilon&gt;0$ is arbitrarily small. We also show almost sure convergence of iterates to the set of fixed points. We show the applicability of our framework by applying our results to minimax optimization, linear stochastic approximation, and Lagrangian optimization.</description>

      <title>Data Enrichment Opportunities for Distribution Grid Cable Networks using Variational Autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electricity distribution cable networks suffer from incomplete and unbalanced data, hindering the effectiveness of machine learning models for predictive maintenance and reliability evaluation. Features such as the installation date of the cables are frequently missing. To address data scarcity, this study investigates the application of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) for data enrichment, synthetic data generation, imbalanced data handling, and outlier detection. Based on a proof-of-concept case study for Denmark, targeting the imputation of missing age information in cable network asset registers, the analysis underlines the potential of generative models to support data-driven maintenance. However, the study also highlights several areas for improvement, including enhanced feature importance analysis, incorporating network characteristics and external features, and handling biases in missing data. Future initiatives should expand the application of VAEs by incorporating semi-supervised learning, advanced sampling techniques, and additional distribution grid elements, including low-voltage networks, into the analysis.</description>

      <title>Sequential Change Detection for Learning in Piecewise Stationary Bandit Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A finite-horizon variant of the quickest change detection problem is investigated, which is motivated by a change detection problem that arises in piecewise stationary bandits. The goal is to minimize the \emph{latency}, which is smallest threshold such that the probability that the detection delay exceeds the threshold is below a desired low level, while controlling the false alarm probability to a desired low level. When the pre- and post-change distributions are unknown, two tests are proposed as candidate solutions. These tests are shown to attain order optimality in terms of the horizon. Furthermore, the growth in their latencies with respect to the false alarm probability and late detection probability satisfies a property that is desirable in regret analysis for piecewise stationary bandits. Numerical results are provided to validate the theoretical performance results.</description>

      <title>A Novel Switch-Type Policy Network for Resource Allocation Problems: Technical Report</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has become a powerful tool for developing control policies in queueing networks, but the common use of Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks in these applications has significant drawbacks. MLP architectures, while versatile, often suffer from poor sample efficiency and a tendency to overfit training environments, leading to suboptimal performance on new, unseen networks. In response to these issues, we introduce a switch-type neural network (STN) architecture designed to improve the efficiency and generalization of DRL policies in queueing networks. The STN leverages structural patterns from traditional non-learning policies, ensuring consistent action choices across similar states. This design not only streamlines the learning process but also fosters better generalization by reducing the tendency to overfit. Our works presents three key contributions: first, the development of the STN as a more effective alternative to MLPs; second, empirical evidence showing that STNs achieve superior sample efficiency in various training scenarios; and third, experimental results demonstrating that STNs match MLP performance in familiar environments and significantly outperform them in new settings. By embedding domain-specific knowledge, the STN enhances the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm's effectiveness without compromising performance, suggesting its suitability for a wide range of queueing network control problems.</description>

      <title>Bounding the Settling Time of Finite-Time Stable Systems using Sum of Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finite-time stability (FTS) of a differential equation guarantees that solutions reach a given equilibrium point in finite time, where the time of convergence depends on the initial state of the system. For traditional stability notions such as exponential stability, the convex optimization framework of Sum-of-Squares (SoS) enables the computation of polynomial Lyapunov functions to certify stability. However, finite-time stable systems are characterized by non-Lipschitz, non-polynomial vector fields, rendering standard SoS methods inapplicable. To this end, in this paper, we show that the computation of a non-polynomial Lyapunov function certifying finite-time stability can be reformulated as computation of a polynomial one under a particular transformation that we develop in this work. As a result, SoS can be utilized to compute a Lyapunov function for FTS. This Lyapunov function can then be used to obtain a bound on the settling time. We first present this approach for the scalar case and then extend it to the multivariate case. Numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in both certifying finite-time stability and computing accurate settling time bounds. This work represents the first combination of SoS programming with settling time bounds for finite-time stable systems.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Certificates for Reachability and Expected Rewards in MDPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility of errors in human-engineered formal verification software, such as model checkers, poses a serious threat to the purpose of these tools. An established approach to mitigate this problem are certificates -- lightweight, easy-to-check proofs of the verification results. In this paper, we develop novel certificates for model checking of Markov decision processes (MDPs) with quantitative reachability and expected reward properties. Our approach is conceptually simple and relies almost exclusively on elementary fixed point theory. Our certificates work for arbitrary finite MDPs and can be readily computed with little overhead using standard algorithms. We formalize the soundness of our certificates in Isabelle/HOL and provide a formally verified certificate checker. Moreover, we augment existing algorithms in the probabilistic model checker Storm with the ability to produce certificates and demonstrate practical applicability by conducting the first formal certification of the reference results in the Quantitative Verification Benchmark Set.</description>

      <title>Clinically Ready Magnetic Microrobots for Targeted Therapies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systemic drug administration often causes off-target effects limiting the efficacy of advanced therapies. Targeted drug delivery approaches increase local drug concentrations at the diseased site while minimizing systemic drug exposure. We present a magnetically guided microrobotic drug delivery system capable of precise navigation under physiological conditions. This platform integrates a clinical electromagnetic navigation system, a custom-designed release catheter, and a dissolvable capsule for accurate therapeutic delivery. In vitro tests showed precise navigation in human vasculature models, and in vivo experiments confirmed tracking under fluoroscopy and successful navigation in large animal models. The microrobot balances magnetic material concentration, contrast agent loading, and therapeutic drug capacity, enabling effective hosting of therapeutics despite the integration complexity of its components, offering a promising solution for precise targeted drug delivery.</description>

      <title>Finding the nearest bounded-real port-Hamiltonian system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider linear time-invariant continuous control systems which are bounded real, also known as scattering passive. Our main theoretical contribution is to show the equivalence between such systems and port-Hamiltonian (PH) systems whose factors satisfy certain linear matrix inequalities. Based on this result, we propose a formulation for the problem of finding the nearest bounded-real system to a given system, and design an algorithm combining alternating optimization and Nesterov's fast gradient method. This formulation also allows us to check whether a given system is bounded real by solving a semidefinite program, and provide a PH parametrization for it. We illustrate our proposed algorithms on real and synthetic data sets.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing Optimal Control for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems: A Parametric Gradient-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a method for designing stabilizing suboptimal controllers for nonlinear stochastic systems. These systems include time-invariant stochastic parameters that represent uncertainty of dynamics, posing two key difficulties in optimal control. Firstly, the time-invariant stochastic nature violates the principle of optimality and Hamilton-Jacobi equations, which are fundamental tools for solving optimal control problems. Secondly, nonlinear systems must be robustly stabilized against these stochastic parameters. To overcome these difficulties simultaneously, this study presents a parametric-gradient-based method with a penalty function. A controller and cost function are parameterized using basis functions, and a gradient method is employed to optimize the controller by minimizing the parameterized cost function. Crucial challenges in this approach are parameterizing the cost function appropriately and deriving the gradient of the cost. This study provides explicit formulations of an optimally parameterized cost and its gradient. Furthermore, a suitable penalty function is proposed to ensure robust stability, even when using the gradient method. Consequently, the gradient method produces a suboptimal feedback controller that guarantees the robust stability. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through numerical simulations, highlighting its performance in comparison with other baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Transmission Scheduling: Structure-guided DRL with a Unified Dual On-policy and Off-policy Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communications prioritize application-driven objectives over data accuracy, enabling intelligent next-generation wireless systems. Efficient scheduling in multi-device, multi-channel systems poses significant challenges due to high-dimensional state and action spaces. We address these challenges by deriving key structural properties of the optimal solution to the goal-oriented scheduling problem, incorporating Age of Information (AoI) and channel states. Specifically, we establish the monotonicity of the optimal state value function (a measure of long-term system performance) w.r.t. channel states and prove its asymptotic convexity w.r.t. AoI states. Additionally, we derive the monotonicity of the optimal policy w.r.t. channel states, advancing the theoretical framework for optimal scheduling. Leveraging these insights, we propose the structure-guided unified dual on-off policy DRL (SUDO-DRL), a hybrid algorithm that combines the stability of on-policy training with the sample efficiency of off-policy methods. Through a novel structural property evaluation framework, SUDO-DRL enables effective and scalable training, addressing the complexities of large-scale systems. Numerical results show SUDO-DRL improves system performance by up to 45% and reduces convergence time by 40% compared to state-of-the-art methods. It also effectively handles scheduling in much larger systems, where off-policy DRL fails and on-policy benchmarks exhibit significant performance loss, demonstrating its scalability and efficacy in goal-oriented communications.</description>

      <title>Navigating Robot Swarm Through a Virtual Tube with Flow-Adaptive Distribution Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of robot swarm technology and its diverse applications, navigating robot swarms through complex environments has emerged as a critical research direction. To ensure safe navigation and avoid potential collisions with obstacles, the concept of virtual tubes has been introduced to define safe and navigable regions. However, current control methods in virtual tubes face the congestion issues, particularly in narrow virtual tubes with low throughput. To address these challenges, we first originally introduce the concepts of virtual tube area and flow capacity, and develop an new evolution model for the spatial density function. Next, we propose a novel control method that combines a modified artificial potential field (APF) for swarm navigation and density feedback control for distribution regulation, under which a saturated velocity command is designed. Then, we generate a global velocity field that not only ensures collision-free navigation through the virtual tube, but also achieves locally input-to-state stability (LISS) for density tracking errors, both of which are rigorously proven. Finally, numerical simulations and realistic applications validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in managing robot swarms within narrow virtual tubes.</description>

      <title>High-Fidelity Coherent-One-Way QKD Simulation Framework for 6G Networks: Bridging Theory and Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) has been emerged as a promising solution for guaranteeing information-theoretic security. Inspired by this, a great amount of research effort has been recently put on designing and testing QKD systems as well as articulating preliminary application scenarios. However, due to the considerable high-cost of QKD equipment, a lack of QKD communication system design tools, wide deployment of such systems and networks is challenging. Motivated by this, this paper introduces a QKD communication system design tool. First we articulate key operation elements of the QKD, and explain the feasibility and applicability of coherent-one-way (COW) QKD solutions. Next, we focus on documenting the corresponding simulation framework as well as defining the key performance metrics, i.e., quantum bit error rate (QBER), and secrecy key rate. To verify the accuracy of the simulation framework, we design and deploy a real-world QKD setup. We perform extensive experiments for three deployments of diverse transmission distance in the presence or absence of a QKD eavesdropper. The results reveal an acceptable match between simulations and experiments rendering the simulation framework a suitable tool for QKD communication system design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for fast sparse optimization is emerging, e.g., to deal with large-dimensional data-driven problems and to track time-varying systems. In the framework of linear sparse optimization, the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm is a valuable method to solve Lasso, which is particularly appreciated for its ease of implementation. Nevertheless, it converges slowly. In this paper, we develop a proximal method, based on logarithmic regularization, which turns out to be an iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm with adaptive shrinkage hyperparameter. This adaptivity substantially enhances the trajectory of the algorithm, in a way that yields faster convergence, while keeping the simplicity of the original method. Our contribution is twofold: on the one hand, we derive and analyze the proposed algorithm; on the other hand, we validate its fast convergence via numerical experiments and we discuss the performance with respect to state-of-the-art algorithms.</description>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel approach for local convergence to Nash equilibrium in quadratic noncooperative games based on a distributed Lie-bracket extremum seeking control scheme. This is the first instance of noncooperative games being tackled in a model-free fashion integrated with the extremum seeking method of bounded update rates. In particular, the stability analysis is carried out using Lie-bracket approximation and Lyapunov's direct method. We quantify the size of the ultimate small residual sets around the Nash equilibrium and illustrate the theoretical results numerically on an example in an oligopoly setting.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. Finally, we extend our result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces an approach for synthesizing feasible safety indices to derive safe control laws under state-dependent control spaces. The problem, referred to as Safety Index Synthesis (SIS), is challenging because it requires the existence of feasible control input in all states and leads to an infinite number of constraints. The proposed method leverages Positivstellensatz to formulate SIS as a nonlinear programming (NP) problem. We formally prove that the NP solutions yield safe control laws with two imperative guarantees: forward invariance within user-defined safe regions and finite-time convergence to those regions. A numerical study validates the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>Distributed MPC for autonomous ships on inland waterways with collaborative collision avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed solution for the problem of collaborative collision avoidance for autonomous inland waterway ships. A two-layer collision avoidance framework that considers inland waterway traffic regulations is proposed to increase navigational safety for autonomous ships. Our approach allows for modifying traffic rules without changing the collision avoidance algorithm, and is based on a novel formulation of model predictive control (MPC) for collision avoidance of ships. This MPC formulation is designed for inland waterway traffic and can handle complex scenarios. The alternating direction method of multipliers is used as a scheme for exchanging and negotiating intentions among ships. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can comply with traffic rules. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm can safely deviate from traffic rules when necessary to increase efficiency in complex scenarios.</description>

      <title>Asymmetry of Frequency Distribution in Power Systems: Sources, Estimation, Impact and Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04287v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper analyses an emerging real-world phenomena in inverter-based renewable-dominated power systems, namely, asymmetry of frequency distribution. The paper first provides a rationale on why asymmetry reduces the "quality" of the frequency control and system operation. Then it provides qualitative theoretical insights that explain asymmetry in terms of the nonlinearity of real-world power systems and associated models. In particular network losses and pitch angle-based frequency control of wind power plants are discussed. Then the paper proposes a nonlinear compensation control to reduce the asymmetry as well as a statistical metric based on the frequency probability distribution to quantify the level of asymmetry in a power system. Real-world data obtained from the Irish and Australian transmission systems serve to support the theoretical appraisal, whereas simulations based on an IEEE benchmark system show the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear compensation. The case study also shows that, while automatic generation control reduces asymmetry, frequency control limits and droop-based frequency support provided by wind generation using a tight deadband of 15 mHz, namely active power control, leads to a significant increase in the asymmetry of the frequency probability distribution.</description>

      <title>Optimal Transmission Power Scheduling for Networked Control System under DoS Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00540v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing networked control systems that are reliable and resilient against adversarial threats, is essential for ensuring the security of cyber-physical systems. This paper addresses the communication-control co-design problem for networked control systems under denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. In the wireless channel, a transmission power scheduler periodically determines the power level for sensory data transmission. Yet DoS attacks render data packets unavailable by disrupting the communication channel. This paper co-designs the control and power scheduling laws in the presence of DoS attacks and aims to minimize the sum of regulation control performance and transmission power consumption. Both finite- and infinite-horizon discounted cost criteria are addressed, respectively. By delving into the information structure between the controller and the power scheduler under attack, the original co-design problem is divided into two subproblems that can be solved individually without compromising optimality. The optimal control is shown to be certainty equivalent, and the optimal transmission power scheduling is solved using a dynamic programming approach. Moreover, in the infinite-horizon scenario, we analyze the performance of the designed scheduling policy and develop an upper bound of the total costs. Finally, a numerical example is provided to demonstrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Ring-LWE based encrypted controller with unlimited number of recursive multiplications and effect of error growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an encrypted dynamic controller that executes an unlimited number of recursive homomorphic multiplications on a Ring Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem without bootstrapping. The proposed controller exhibits lower computational complexity compared to existing encrypted controllers implemented on LWE based schemes due to the polynomial structure of Ring-LWE. However, the structural difference introduces additional difficulties in analyzing the effect of error growth; Ring-LWE based schemes inject multiple error coefficients when encrypting a single message, which accumulate under recursive homomorphic multiplications. We show that their effect on the control performance can be arbitrarily bounded by the closed-loop stability, thus recovering the performance of the unencrypted controller. Furthermore, a novel method to ``pack'' a vector into a polynomial is presented, which enhances computational and memory efficiency when applied to the proposed encrypted controller. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Fast State Stabilization using Deep Reinforcement Learning for Measurement-based Quantum Feedback Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stabilization of quantum states is a fundamental problem for realizing various quantum technologies. Measurement-based-feedback strategies have demonstrated powerful performance, and the construction of quantum control signals using measurement information has attracted great interest. However, the interaction between quantum systems and the environment is inevitable, especially when measurements are introduced, which leads to decoherence. To mitigate decoherence, it is desirable to stabilize quantum systems faster, thereby reducing the time of interaction with the environment. In this paper, we utilize information obtained from measurement and apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms, without explicitly constructing specific complex measurement-control mappings, to rapidly drive random initial quantum state to the target state. The proposed DRL algorithm has the ability to speed up the convergence to a target state, which shortens the interaction between quantum systems and their environments to protect coherence. Simulations are performed on two-qubit and three-qubit systems, and the results show that our algorithm can successfully stabilize random initial quantum system to the target entangled state, with a convergence time faster than traditional methods such as Lyapunov feedback control and several DRL algorithms with different reward functions. Moreover, it exhibits robustness against imperfect measurements and delays in system evolution.</description>

      <title>CSAC Drift Modeling Considering GPS Signal Quality in the Case of GPS Signal Unavailability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Global Positioning System (GPS), one of the Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), provides accurate position, navigation and time (PNT) information to various applications. One of the application that is highly receiving attention is satellite vehicles, especially Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites. Due to their limited ways to get PNT information and low performance of their onboard clocks, GPS system time (GPST) provided by GPS is a good reference clock to synchronize. However, GPS is well-known for its vulnerability to intentional or unintentional interference. This study aims to maintain the onboard clock with less error relative to the GPST even when the GPS signal is disrupted. In this study, we analyzed two major factors that affects the quality of the GPS measurements: the number of the visible satellites and the geometry of the satellites. Then, we proposed a weighted model for a Chip-Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) that mitigates the clock error relative to the GPST while considering the two factors. Based on this model, a stand-alone CSAC could maintain its error less than 4 microseconds, even in a situation where no GPS signals are received for 12 hours.</description>

      <title>Lossless optimal transient control for rigid bodies in 3D space</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose a control scheme for rigid bodies designed to optimise transient behaviors. The search space for the optimal control input is parameterized to yield a passive, specifically lossless, nonlinear feedback controller. As a result, it can be combined with other stabilizing controllers without compromising the stability of the closed-loop system. The controller commands torques generating fictitious gyroscopic effects characteristics of 3D rotational rigid body motions, and as such does not inject nor extract kinetic energy from the system. We validate the controller in simulation using a model predictive control (MPC) scheme, successfully combining stability and performance in a stabilization task with obstacle avoidance constraints.</description>

      <title>Advancing Hybrid Quantum Neural Network for Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20275v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alternative Current Optimal Power Flow (AC-OPF) is essential for efficient planning and real-time operation in power systems but is NP-hard and non-convex, leading to significant computational challenges. Neural networks (NNs) offer computational speedups in solving OPF but face issues like dependency on large datasets, scalability limitations, and inability to enforce physical constraints, compromising solution reliability. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) that integrate quantum computing principles into neural network architectures. Leveraging quantum mechanics properties such as superposition and entanglement, QNNs can capture complex input-output relationships more effectively and learn from small or noisy datasets.To further improve the performance of QNNs and investigate the interplay between classical and quantum components in hybrid architectures, we incorporate advanced techniques, including residual learning and physics-informed machine learning, into the hybrid QNN designs. These enhancements aim to boost convergence efficiency, lower errors, superior generalization, and robustness to quantum noise. Simulation results demonstrate that these enhanced hybrid QNNs outperform typical hybrid QNNs in solving OPF problems. This work provides valuable insights into the design and optimization of hybrid QNNs, highlighting the potential of quantum computation for broader applications in power systems.</description>

      <title>Eavesdropping on Goal-Oriented Communication: Timing Attacks and Countermeasures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Goal-oriented communication is a new paradigm that considers the meaning of transmitted information to optimize communication. One possible application is the remote monitoring of a process under communication costs: scheduling updates based on goal-oriented considerations can significantly reduce transmission frequency while maintaining high-quality tracking performance. However, goal-oriented scheduling also opens a timing-based side-channel that an eavesdropper may exploit to obtain information about the state of the remote process, even if the content of updates is perfectly secure. In this work, we study an eavesdropping attack against pull-based goal-oriented scheduling for the tracking of remote Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and of possible countermeasures, as well as a practical heuristic that can provide a balance between the performance gains offered by goal-oriented communication and the information leakage.</description>

      <title>Linear Model of Aggregated Homogeneous Energy Storage Elements with Realizable Dispatch Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To optimize battery dispatch, a model is required that can predict the state of charge (SOC) trajectory and ensure dispatch is admissible (i.e., does not lead to unexpected SOC saturation). However, battery dispatch optimization is inherently challenging since batteries cannot simultaneously charge and discharge, which begets a non-convex complementarity constraint. In this paper, we consider a composition of energy storage elements that can charge or discharge independently and provide a sufficient linear energy storage model of the composite battery. This permits convex optimization of the composite battery SOC trajectory while ensuring admissibility of the resulting (aggregated) power schedule and disaggregation to the individual energy storage elements.</description>

Abstract: Dataflow Model of Computation and Communications (DF MoCCs) is a formalism used to specify the behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). DF MoCCs are widely used in the design of CPSs, as they provide a high-level of abstraction to specify the system's behavior. DF MoCCs rules give semantics to a dataflow specification of a CPS, and static analysis algorithms rely on these semantics to guarantee safety properties of the dataflow specification, such as bounded memory usage and deadlock freeness. A wide range of DF MoCCs exists, each with its own characteristics and static analyses. This paper presents a survey of those DF MoCCs and a classification in eight categories. In addition, DF MoCCs are characterized by a comprehensive list of features and static analyses, which reflect their expressiveness and analyzability. Based on this characterization, a framework is proposed to compare the expressiveness and the analyzability of DF MoCCs quantitatively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces an innovative interval prediction methodology aimed at addressing the limitations of current evaluation indicators while enhancing prediction accuracy and reliability. To achieve this, new evaluation metrics are proposed, offering a comprehensive assessment of interval prediction methods across both all-sample and single-sample scenarios. Additionally, a novel Pattern-Diversity Conditional Time-Series Generative Adversarial Network (PDCTSGAN) is developed, designed to generate realistic scenarios and support a new interval prediction framework based on scenario generation. The PDCTSGAN model incorporates unique modifications to random noise inputs, enabling the creation of pattern-diverse and realistic scenarios. These scenarios are then utilized to produce multiple interval patterns characterized by high coverage probability and reduced average width. The proposed approach is validated through detailed case studies, and the paper concludes with a discussion of future research directions to further refine interval prediction techniques.</description>

      <title>Reducing real-time complexity via sub-control Lyapunov functions: from theory to experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The techniques to design control Lyapunov functions (CLF), along with a proper stabilizing feedback, possibly in the presence of constraints, often provide control laws that are too complex for proper implementation online, especially when an optimization problem is involved. In this work, we show how to acquire an alternative, computationally attractive feedback. Given a nominal CLF and a nominal state feedback, we say that a different positive definite function is a Sub-control Lyapunov function (SCLF) if its Lyapunov derivative is negative-definite and bounded above by the Lyapunov derivative of the nominal function with the nominal control. It turns out that if we consider a family of basis functions, then a SCLF can be computed by linear programming, with an infinite number of constraints. The idea is that although the offline computational burden to achieve the new controller and solve the linear program is considerable, the online computational burden is drastically reduced. Comprehensive simulations and experiments on drone control are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the study.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09509v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Open Radio Access Network (RAN) paradigm envisions a more flexible, interoperable, and intelligent RAN ecosystem via new open interfaces and elements like the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). However, the impact of these elements on Open RAN's power consumption remains heavily unexplored. This work for the first time evaluates the impact of Key Performance Indicator (KPI) monitoring on RIC's power consumption using real traffic and power measurements. By analyzing various RIC-RAN communication scenarios, we identify that RIC's power consumption can become a scalability bottleneck, particularly in large-scale deployments, even when RIC is limited to its core operational functionalities and without incorporating application-specific processes. In this context, also for the first time we explore potential power savings through the elimination of redundant KPI transmissions, extending existing techniques for identical subscription removal and KPI selection, achieving significant power consumption gains exceeding 87\% of the overall RIC power consumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.20151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent systems driven by large language models (LLMs) have shown promising abilities for solving complex tasks in a collaborative manner. This work considers a fundamental problem in multi-agent collaboration: consensus seeking. When multiple agents work together, we are interested in how they can reach a consensus through inter-agent negotiation. To that end, this work studies a consensus-seeking task where the state of each agent is a numerical value and they negotiate with each other to reach a consensus value. It is revealed that when not explicitly directed on which strategy should be adopted, the LLM-driven agents primarily use the average strategy for consensus seeking although they may occasionally use some other strategies. Moreover, this work analyzes the impact of the agent number, agent personality, and network topology on the negotiation process. The findings reported in this work can potentially lay the foundations for understanding the behaviors of LLM-driven multi-agent systems for solving more complex tasks. Furthermore, LLM-driven consensus seeking is applied to a multi-robot aggregation task. This application demonstrates the potential of LLM-driven agents to achieve zero-shot autonomous planning for multi-robot collaboration tasks.

Margins for profit generation are generally small, shaping a difficult landscape for automated trading strategies. This paper introduces a novel intraday power trading strategy tailored for single-price balancing markets. The strategy relies on a strategically devised mixture model to forecast future system imbalance prices and is formulated as a stochastic optimization problem with decision-dependent distributions to address two primary challenges: (i) the impact of trading positions on the system imbalance price and (ii) the uncertainty inherent in the model. The first challenge is tackled by adjusting the model to account for price changes after taking a position. For the second challenge, a coherent risk measure is added to the cost function to take additional uncertainties into account. This paper introduces a methodology to select the tuning parameter of this risk measure adaptively by continuously quantifying the performance of the strategy on a window of recently observed data. The strategy is validated with a simulation on the Belgian electricity market using real-time market data. The adaptive tuning approach leads to higher absolute profits, while also reducing the number of trades.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of design parameters to improve performance of a planar electromagnetic actuator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planar electromagnetic actuators based on the principle of linear motors are widely employed for micro and nano positioning applications. These actuators usually employ a planar magnetic platform driven by a co-planar electromagnetic coil. While these actuators offer a large motion range and high positioning resolution, their actuation bandwidth is limited due to relatively small electromagnetic stiffness. We report optimization of the design parameters of the electromagnetic coil and the magnetic assembly to maximize the electromagnetic force and stiffness. Firstly, we derive closed-form expressions for the electromagnetic forces and stiffness, which enable us to express these quantities in terms of the design parameters of the actuator. Secondly, based on these derived expressions, we estimate the optimum values of the design parameters to maximize force and stiffness. Notably, for the optimum design parameters, the force and stiffness per unit volume can be increased by two and three orders of magnitude, respectively by reducing the pitch of the electromagnetic coil by a factor of 10. Lastly, we develop an electromagnetic actuator and evaluate its performance using a Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based force sensor. By operating the force sensor in a feedback loop, we precisely measure the generated electromagnetic forces for different design parameters of the actuator. The experimental results obtained align closely with the analytical values, with an error of less than 15%.</description>

      <title>Robust Predictive Motion Planning by Learning Obstacle Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe motion planning for robotic systems in dynamic environments is nontrivial in the presence of uncertain obstacles, where estimation of obstacle uncertainties is crucial in predicting future motions of dynamic obstacles. The worst-case characterization gives a conservative uncertainty prediction and may result in infeasible motion planning for the ego robotic system. In this paper, an efficient, robust, and safe motion-planing algorithm is developed by learning the obstacle uncertainties online. More specifically, the unknown yet intended control set of obstacles is efficiently computed by solving a linear programming problem. The learned control set is used to compute forward reachable sets of obstacles that are less conservative than the worst-case prediction. Based on the forward prediction, a robust model predictive controller is designed to compute a safe reference trajectory for the ego robotic system that remains outside the reachable sets of obstacles over the prediction horizon. The method is applied to a car-like mobile robot in both simulations and hardware experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>N-dimensional Convex Obstacle Avoidance using Hybrid Feedback Control (Extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11279v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the autonomous robot navigation problem in a priori unknown n-dimensional environments containing convex obstacles of arbitrary shapes and sizes. We propose a hybrid feedback control scheme that guarantees safe and global asymptotic convergence of the robot to a predefined target location. The proposed control strategy relies on a switching mechanism allowing the robot to operate either in the move-to-target mode or the obstacle-avoidance mode, based on its proximity to the obstacles and the availability of a clear straight path between the robot and the target. In the obstacle-avoidance mode, the robot is constrained to move within a two-dimensional plane that intersects the obstacle being avoided and the target, preventing it from retracing its path. The effectiveness of the proposed hybrid feedback controller is demonstrated through simulations in two-dimensional and three-dimensional environments.</description>

      <title>Projection-free computation of robust controllable sets with constrained zonotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13730v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing robust controllable sets for discrete-time linear systems with additive uncertainty. We propose a tractable and scalable approach to inner- and outer-approximate robust controllable sets using constrained zonotopes, when the additive uncertainty set is a symmetric, convex, and compact set. Our least-squares-based approach uses novel closed-form approximations of the Pontryagin difference between a constrained zonotopic minuend and a symmetric, convex, and compact subtrahend. Unlike existing approaches, our approach does not rely on convex optimization solvers, and is projection-free for ellipsoidal and zonotopic uncertainty sets. We also propose a least-squares-based approach to compute a convex, polyhedral outer-approximation to constrained zonotopes, and characterize sufficient conditions under which all these approximations are exact. We demonstrate the computational efficiency and scalability of our approach in several case studies, including the design of abort-safe rendezvous trajectories for a spacecraft in near-rectilinear halo orbit under uncertainty. Our approach can inner-approximate a 20-step robust controllable set for a 100-dimensional linear system in under 15 seconds on a standard computer.</description>

      <title>AirPilot: Interpretable PPO-based DRL Auto-Tuned Nonlinear PID Drone Controller for Robust Autonomous Flights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00204v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation precision, speed and stability are crucial for safe Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) flight maneuvers and effective flight mission executions in dynamic environments. Different flight missions may have varying objectives, such as minimizing energy consumption, achieving precise positioning, or maximizing speed. A controller that can adapt to different objectives on the fly is highly valuable. Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controllers are one of the most popular and widely used control algorithms for drones and other control systems, but their linear control algorithm fails to capture the nonlinear nature of the dynamic wind conditions and complex drone system. Manually tuning the PID gains for various missions can be time-consuming and requires significant expertise. This paper aims to revolutionize drone flight control by presenting the AirPilot, a nonlinear Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) - enhanced Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) drone controller using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). AirPilot controller combines the simplicity and effectiveness of traditional PID control with the adaptability, learning capability, and optimization potential of DRL. This makes it better suited for modern drone applications where the environment is dynamic, and mission-specific performance demands are high. We employed a COEX Clover autonomous drone for training the DRL agent within the simulator and implemented it in a real-world lab setting, which marks a significant milestone as one of the first attempts to apply a DRL-based flight controller on an actual drone. Airpilot is capable of reducing the navigation error of the default PX4 PID position controller by 90%, improving effective navigation speed of a fine-tuned PID controller by 21%, reducing settling time and overshoot by 17% and 16% respectively.</description>

      <title>Refined Motion Compensation with Soft Laser Manipulators using Data-Driven Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-contact laser ablation, a precise thermal technique, simultaneously cuts and coagulates tissue without the insertion errors associated with rigid needles. Human organ motions, such as those in the liver, exhibit rhythmic components influenced by respiratory and cardiac cycles, making effective laser energy delivery to target lesions while compensating for tumor motion crucial. This research introduces a data-driven method to derive surrogate models of a soft manipulator. These low-dimensional models offer computational efficiency when integrated into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, while still capturing the manipulator's dynamics with and without control input. Spectral Submanifolds (SSM) theory models the manipulator's autonomous dynamics, acknowledging its tendency to reach equilibrium when external forces are removed. Preliminary results show that the MPC controller using the surrogate model outperforms two other models within the same MPC framework. The data-driven MPC controller also supports a design-agnostic feature, allowing the interchangeability of different soft manipulators within the laser ablation surgery robot system.</description>

      <title>Functional Type Expressions of Sequential Circuits with the Notion of Referring Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces the notion of referring forms as a new metric for analyzing sequential circuits from a functional perspective. Sequential circuits are modeled as causal stream functions, the outputs of which depend solely on the past and current inputs. Referring forms are defined based on the type expressions of functions and represent how a circuit refers to past inputs. The key contribution of this study is identifying a universal property in multiple clock domain circuits using referring forms. This theoretical framework is expected to enhance the comprehension and analysis of sequential circuits.</description>

      <title>Clutter-Aware Target Detection for ISAC in a Millimeter-Wave Cell-Free Massive MIMO System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the performance of an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system within a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Each access point (AP) operates in the millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequency band. The APs jointly serve the user equipments (UEs) in the downlink while simultaneously detecting a target through dedicated sensing beams, which are directed toward a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). Although the AP-RIS, RIS-target, and AP-target channels have both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) parts, it is assumed only knowledge of the LoS paths is available. A key contribution of this study is the consideration of clutter, which degrades the target detection if not handled. We propose an algorithm to alternatively optimize the transmit power allocation and the RIS phase-shift matrix, maximizing the target signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) while ensuring a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for the UEs. Numerical results demonstrate that exploiting clutter subspace significantly enhances detection probability, particularly at high clutter-to-noise ratios, and reveal that an increased number of transmit side clusters impair detection performance. Finally, we highlight the performance gains achieved using a dedicated sensing stream.</description>

      <title>Democratic Resilience and Sociotechnical Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We focus on the potential fragility of democratic elections given modern information-communication technologies (ICT) in the Web 2.0 era. Our work provides an explanation for the cascading attrition of public officials recently in the United States and offers potential policy interventions from a dynamic system's perspective. We propose that micro-level heterogeneity across individuals within crucial institutions leads to vulnerabilities of election support systems at the macro scale. Our analysis provides comparative statistics to measure the fragility of systems against targeted harassment, disinformation campaigns, and other adversarial manipulations that are now cheaper to scale and deploy. Our analysis also informs policy interventions that seek to retain public officials and increase voter turnout. We show how limited resources (for example, salary incentives to public officials and targeted interventions to increase voter turnout) can be allocated at the population level to improve these outcomes and maximally enhance democratic resilience. On the one hand, structural and individual heterogeneity cause systemic fragility that adversarial actors can exploit, but also provide opportunities for effective interventions that offer significant global improvements from limited and localized actions.</description>

      <title>Intra-day Solar and Power Forecast for Optimization of Intraday Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09551v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prediction of solar irradiance enhances reliability in photovoltaic (PV) solar plant generation and grid integration. In Colombia, PV plants face penalties if energy production deviates beyond governmental thresholds from intraday market offers. This research employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Bidirectional-LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models, utilizing meteorological data from a PV plant in El Paso, Cesar, Colombia, to predict solar irradiance with a 6-hour horizon and 10-minute resolution. While Bi-LSTM showed superior performance, the LSTM model achieved comparable results with significantly reduced training time (6 hours versus 18 hours), making it computationally advantageous. The LSTM predictions were averaged to create an hourly resolution model, evaluated using Mean Absolute Error, Root-Mean-Square Error, Normalized Root-Mean-Square Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error metrics. Comparison with the Global Forecast System (GFS) revealed similar performance, with both models effectively capturing daily solar irradiance patterns. The forecast model integrates with an Object-Oriented power production model, enabling accurate energy offers in the intraday market while minimizing penalty costs.</description>
