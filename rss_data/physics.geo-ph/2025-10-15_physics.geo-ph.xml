      <title>Melting phase relation of seifertite and pyrite-type SiO2 determined by machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silica (SiO2) is fundamental to both industrial technology and planetary science, yet the phase relations of its high-pressure polymorphs remain poorly constrained. Here, we develop two machine learning potentials (MLPs) for SiO2 that faithfully represent the SCAN and PBEsol exchange-correlation functionals over a wide temperature (1000-10000 K) and pressure (100-400 GPa) range using deep neural networks. With large-scale two-phase simulations powered by these potentials, we determine the melting curves of seifertite and pyrite-type SiO2 and infer the solid-solid phase boundary between these two phases. The SCAN functional, which captures intermediate-range van der Waals interactions, reproduces structural and thermodynamic properties with high fidelity, predicting melting temperatures 6-10 % higher and a seifertite to pyrite-type transition pressure 22 % higher than the PBEsol. The strongly negative Clapeyron slope (-6.1 MPa/K) of this transition suggests that mantle convection could be highly layered in super-Earth exoplanets, potentially affecting their long-term thermal evolution and habitability.</description>

      <title>Gravity-driven viscous flow over partially lubricated bed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an investigation into the response of a viscous fluid flowing over a sloped bed across a spatially finite patch of basal lubrication. We present a simple analytical model that captures the fundamental structure of such lubrication-induced stress and velocity perturbations in Newtonian fluids, as well as scaling arguments and numerical experiments that extend our analysis to power-law fluids. These analyses concisely reveal the underlying relationships between the system parameters (fluid thickness, $h$, slope, $\alpha$, slippery patch length, $\ell$, and sliding condition outside of the slippery patch, $\gamma$) and the magnitude and spatial extent of the resulting perturbed stresses, $\tau_{xx}$, and velocities, $u_p$. From these results, we conclude that the induced stresses are exponentially decaying functions of distance away from the patch location, and show that the amplitude of the perturbations scales linearly with surface slope and patch length while the decay length scales with thickness and patch length, and is critically dependent on the basal boundary condition outside of the slippery patch. These fundamental relationships can be incorporated into more complex models to investigate whether rapid lake drainages on ice sheets, which create a partially lubricated bed, can generate sufficient stress and velocity perturbations in the overlying ice flow to trigger lake drainage cascades.</description>

      <title>Mapping the Cloud-Driven Atmospheric Dynamics &amp; Chemistry of an Isolated Exoplanet Analog with Harmonic Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Young planetary-mass objects and brown dwarfs near the L/T spectral transition exhibit enhanced spectrophotometric variability over field brown dwarfs. Patchy clouds, auroral processes, stratospheric hot spots, and complex carbon chemistry have all been proposed as potential sources of this variability. Using time-resolved, low-to-mid-resolution spectroscopy collected with the JWST/NIRISS and NIRSpec instruments, we apply harmonic analysis to SIMP J0136, a highly variable, young, isolated planetary-mass object. Odd harmonics (k=3) at pressure levels (&gt; 1 bar) corresponding to iron and forsterite cloud formation suggest North/South hemispheric asymmetry in the cloudy, and likely equatorial, regions. We use the inferred harmonics, along with 1-D substellar atmospheric models, to map the flux variability by atmospheric pressure level. These vertical maps demonstrate robust interaction between deep convective weather layers and the overlying stratified and radiative atmosphere. We identify distinct time-varying structures in the near-infrared that we interpret as planetary-scale wave (e.g., Rossby or Kelvin)-associated cloud modulation. We detect variability in water (S/N = 14.0), carbon monoxide (S/N = 13.0), and methane (S/N = 14.9) molecular signatures. Forsterite cloud modulation is anti-correlated with overlying carbon monoxide and water abundances and correlated with deep methane absorption, suggesting complex interaction between cloud formation, atmospheric chemistry, and temperature structure. Furthermore, we identify distinct harmonic behavior between methane and carbon monoxide absorption bands, providing evidence for time-resolved disequilibrium carbon chemistry. At the lowest pressures (&lt; 100 mbar), we find that the mapped methane lines transition from absorption to emission, supporting evidence of high-altitude auroral heating via electron precipitation.</description>
