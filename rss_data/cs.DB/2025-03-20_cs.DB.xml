      <title>ACE: A Cardinality Estimator for Set-Valued Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cardinality estimation is a fundamental functionality in database systems. Most existing cardinality estimators focus on handling predicates over numeric or categorical data. They have largely omitted an important data type, set-valued data, which frequently occur in contemporary applications such as information retrieval and recommender systems. The few existing estimators for such data either favor high-frequency elements or rely on a partial independence assumption, which limits their practical applicability. We propose ACE, an Attention-based Cardinality Estimator for estimating the cardinality of queries over set-valued data. We first design a distillation-based data encoder to condense the dataset into a compact matrix. We then design an attention-based query analyzer to capture correlations among query elements. To handle variable-sized queries, a pooling module is introduced, followed by a regression model (MLP) to generate final cardinality estimates. We evaluate ACE on three datasets with varying query element distributions, demonstrating that ACE outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of both accuracy and efficiency.</description>

      <title>ImputeGAP: A Comprehensive Library for Time Series Imputation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the prevalence of sensor failures, imputation--the process of estimating missing values--has emerged as the cornerstone of time series data preparation. While numerous imputation algorithms have been developed to address these data gaps, existing libraries provide limited support. Furthermore, they often lack the ability to simulate realistic patterns of time series missing data and fail to account for the impact of imputation on subsequent downstream analysis.
  This paper introduces ImputeGAP, a comprehensive library for time series imputation that supports a diverse range of imputation methods and modular missing data simulation catering to datasets with varying characteristics. The library includes extensive customization options, such as automated hyperparameter tuning, benchmarking, explainability, downstream evaluation, and compatibility with popular time series frameworks.</description>

      <title>Unbalanced Triangle Detection and Enumeration Hardness for Unions of Conjunctive Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.11996v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the enumeration of answers to Unions of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs) with optimal time guarantees. More precisely, we wish to identify the queries that can be solved with linear preprocessing time and constant delay. Despite the basic nature of this problem, it was shown only recently that UCQs can be solved within these time bounds if they admit free-connex union extensions, even if all individual CQs in the union are intractable with respect to the same complexity measure. Our goal is to understand whether there exist additional tractable UCQs, not covered by the currently known algorithms. As a first step, we show that some previously unclassified UCQs are hard using the classic 3SUM hypothesis, via a known reduction from 3SUM to triangle listing in graphs. As a second step, we identify a question about a variant of this graph task that is unavoidable if we want to classify all self-join-free UCQs: is it possible to decide the existence of a triangle in a vertex-unbalanced tripartite graph in linear time? We prove that this task is equivalent in hardness to some family of UCQs. Finally, we show a dichotomy for unions of two self-join-free CQs if we assume the answer to this question is negative. In conclusion, this paper pinpoints a computational barrier in the form of a single decision problem that is key to advancing our understanding of the enumeration complexity of many UCQs. Without a breakthrough for unbalanced triangle detection, we have no hope of finding an efficient algorithm for additional unions of two self-join-free CQs. On the other hand, a sufficiently efficient unbalanced triangle detection algorithm can be turned into an efficient algorithm for a family of UCQs currently not known to be tractable.</description>

      <title>CCaaLF: Concurrency Control as a Learnable Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Concurrency control (CC) algorithms are important in modern transactional databases, as they enable high performance by executing transactions concurrently while ensuring correctness. However, state-of-the-art CC algorithms struggle to perform well across diverse workloads, and most do not consider workload drifts.
  In this paper, we propose CCaaLF (Concurrency Control as a Learnable Function), a novel learned concurrency control algorithm designed to achieve high performance across varying workloads. The algorithm is quick to optimize, making it robust against dynamic workloads. CCaaLF learns an agent function that captures a large number of design choices from existing CC algorithms. The function is implemented as an efficient in-database lookup table that maps database states to concurrency control actions. The learning process is based on a combination of Bayesian optimization and a novel graph reduction algorithm, which converges quickly to a function that achieves high transaction throughput. We compare CCaaLF against five state-of-the-art CC algorithms and show that our algorithm consistently outperforms them in terms of transaction throughput and optimization time.</description>

      <title>E2ETune: End-to-End Knob Tuning via Fine-tuned Generative Language Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Database knob tuning is a significant challenge for database administrators, as it involves tuning a large number of configuration knobs with continuous or discrete values to achieve optimal database performance. Traditional methods, such as manual tuning or learning-based approaches, typically require numerous workload replays and are both time-consuming and resource-intensive. To address this challenge, we introduce E2ETune, an end-to-end knob tuner powered by a fine-tuned generative language model. The key idea is to leverage the exceptional sequence-to-sequence modeling capabilities of generative language models to capture the complex mapping between workloads (inputs) and their corresponding promising configurations (outputs). To achieve this goal, we propose a novel data generation framework to efficiently produce a large amount of training data, where each data sample consists of a workload and its promising configuration. Then, these data are used to fine-tune a generative language model, yielding an end-to-end knob tuner. This tuner offers out-of-the-box configuration recommendations for new workloads. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate E2ETune's efficiency and effectiveness using 10 representative and 3 real-world benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, E2ETune can identify competitive configurations in significantly less time.</description>

      <title>From Commands to Prompts: LLM-based Semantic File System for AIOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11843v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in the development of intelligent applications and systems such as LLM-based agents and agent operating systems (AIOS). However, when these applications and systems interact with the underlying file system, the file system still remains the traditional paradigm: reliant on manual navigation through precise commands. This paradigm poses a bottleneck to the usability of these systems as users are required to navigate complex folder hierarchies and remember cryptic file names. To address this limitation, we propose an LLM-based semantic file system ( LSFS ) for prompt-driven file management. Unlike conventional approaches, LSFS incorporates LLMs to enable users or agents to interact with files through natural language prompts, facilitating semantic file management. At the macro-level, we develop a comprehensive API set to achieve semantic file management functionalities, such as semantic file retrieval, file update monitoring and summarization, and semantic file rollback). At the micro-level, we store files by constructing semantic indexes for them, design and implement syscalls of different semantic operations (e.g., CRUD, group by, join) powered by vector database. Our experiments show that LSFS offers significant improvements over traditional file systems in terms of user convenience, the diversity of supported functions, and the accuracy and efficiency of file operations. Additionally, with the integration of LLM, our system enables more intelligent file management tasks, such as content summarization and version comparison, further enhancing its capabilities.</description>
