      <title>Existentially closed measure-preserving actions of approximately treeable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a countable group $\Gamma$, letting $\mathcal{K}_\Gamma$ denote the class of {\pmp} actions of $\Gamma$, we study the question of when the model companion of $\mathcal{K}_\Gamma$ exists. Berenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\'ia showed that the model companion of $\mathcal{K}_\Gamma$ exists when $\Gamma$ is a nonabelian free group on a countable number of generators. We significantly generalize their result by showing that the model companion of $\cal K_\Gamma$ exists whenever $\Gamma$ is an approximately treeable group. The class of approximately treeable groups contain the class of treeable groups as well as the class of universally free groups, that is, the class of groups with the same universal theory as nonabelian free groups. We prove this result using an open mapping characterization of when the model companion exists; moreover, this open mapping characterization provides concrete, ergodic-theoretic axioms for the model companion when it exists. We show how to simplify these axioms in the case of treeable groups, providing an alternate axiomatization for the model companion in the case of the free group, which was first axiomatized by Berenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\'ia using techniques from model-theoretic stability theory. Along the way, we prove a purely ergodic-theoretic result of independent interest, namely that finitely generated universally free groups (also known as limit groups) have Kechris' property MD. We also show that for groups with Kechris' EMD property, the profinite completion action is existentially closed, and for groups without property (T), the generic existentially closed action is weakly mixing, generalizing results of Berenstein, Henson, and Ibarluc\'ia for the case of nonabelian free groups.</description>

      <title>Abstract computation over first-order structures. Part IIb: Moschovakis' operator and other non-determinisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: BSS RAMs were introduced to provide a mathematical framework for characterizing algorithms over first-order structures. Non-deterministic BSS RAMs help to model different non-deterministic approaches. Here, we deal with different types of binary non-determinisms and study the consequences of the decidability of the identity relation and the decidability of finite sets consisting of one or two constants. We compare the binary non-determinism resulting from a non-deterministic branching process, the digital non-determinism resulting from the restriction of guesses to two constants, and some other non-determinisms resulting from the use of Moschovakis' operator applied to oracle sets restricted to tuples of constants. Moreover, we show that the performance capability and the efficiency of individual machines are influenced by the following properties. 1. The identity relation belongs to the underlying structure. 2. The identity is semi-decidable over the underlying structure. 3. Two single-element sets of constants are semi-decidable. 4. A set of two constants is semi-decidable. The order of these properties corresponds to the strength of their influence. In all cases mentioned, the semi-decidability of the sets implies their decidability.</description>

      <title>On the Isomorphism Relation for Omnigenous Locally Finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The concept of an omnigenous locally finite group was introduced in [2] as a generalization of Hall's universal countable locally finite group. In this paper we show that the class of all countable omnigenous locally finite groups is Borel complete, hence it has the maximum Borel cardinality of isomorphism types among all countable structures.

      <title>On ordering of surjective cardinals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{Card}$ denote the class of cardinals. For all cardinals $\mathfrak{a}$ and $\mathfrak{b}$, $\mathfrak{a}\leqslant\mathfrak{b}$ means that there is an injection from a set of cardinality $\mathfrak{a}$ into a set of cardinality $\mathfrak{b}$, and $\mathfrak{a}\leqslant^\ast\mathfrak{b}$ means that there is a partial surjection from a set of cardinality $\mathfrak{b}$ onto a set of cardinality $\mathfrak{a}$. A doubly ordered set is a triple $\langle P,\preccurlyeq,\preccurlyeq^\ast\rangle$ such that $\preccurlyeq$ is a partial ordering on $P$, $\preccurlyeq^\ast$ is a preordering on $P$, and ${\preccurlyeq}\subseteq{\preccurlyeq^\ast}$. In 1966, Jech proved that for every partially ordered set $\langle P,\preccurlyeq\rangle$, there exists a model of $\mathsf{ZF}$ in which $\langle P,\preccurlyeq\rangle$ can be embedded into $\langle\mathrm{Card},\leqslant\rangle$. We generalize this result by showing that for every doubly ordered set $\langle P,\preccurlyeq,\preccurlyeq^\ast\rangle$, there exists a model of $\mathsf{ZF}$ in which $\langle P,\preccurlyeq,\preccurlyeq^\ast\rangle$ can be embedded into $\langle\mathrm{Card},\leqslant,\leqslant^\ast\rangle$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two logical systems based on dependent types that are comparable to ZFC, both in terms of simplicity and having natural set theoretic interpretations. Our perspective is that of a mathematician trained in classical logic, but nevertheless we hope this paper might go some way to bridging the cultural divide between type theorists coming from computer science.</description>

      <title>Componentwise Polish groupoids and equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Borel equivalence relations equipped with a uniformly Borel family of Polish topologies on each equivalence class, and more generally, standard Borel groupoids equipped with such a family of topologies on each connected component. Such "componentwise Polish topologies" capture precisely the topological information determined by the Borel structure of a Polish group action, by the Becker--Kechris theorem. We prove that conversely, every abstract such Borel componentwise Polish groupoid obeying suitable axioms admits a Borel equivalence of groupoids to a global open Polish groupoid. Together with known results, this implies that every such groupoid is Borel equivalent to an action groupoid of a Polish group action; in particular, the induced equivalence relations are Borel bireducible.
  Our results are also valid for Borel groupoids with componentwise quasi-Polish topologies; and under stronger uniformity assumptions, we show that such groupoids in fact themselves admit global quasi-Polish topologies. As a byproduct, we also generalize several standard tools for Polish groups and their actions to the setting of componentwise quasi-Polish groupoids, including Vaught transforms, Effros's theorem on orbits, and the open mapping theorem.</description>

      <title>Paracomplete Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an advance in the direction of working with probabilities in a paracomplete setting using Logics of Formal Undeterminedness (LFUs). The undeterminedness is interpreted here as missing evidence. A theorem of total paracomplete probability and a paracomplete Bayes' rule have been proved using this setup. We end with a definition of a paracomplete probability space illustrating a way to define probabilities on sets in the presence of undeterminedness.</description>

      <title>Degree of Kripke-incompleteness of Tense Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of Kripke-incompleteness of a logic $L$ in some lattice $\mathcal{L}$ of logics is the cardinality of logics in $\mathcal{L}$ which share the same class of Kripke-frames with $L$. A celebrated result on Kripke-incompleteness is Blok's dichotomy theorem for the degree of Kripke-incompleteness in $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$: every modal logic $L\in\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$ is of the degree of Kripke-incompleteness $1$ or $2^{\aleph_0}$. In this work, we show that the dichotomy theorem for $\mathsf{NExt}(\mathsf{K})$ can be generalized to the lattices $\K$, $\LT$ and $\NExt(\ST)$ of tense logics. We also prove that in $\K$, $\LT$ and $\NExt(\ST)$, iterated splittings are exactly the strictly Kripke-complete logics.</description>

      <title>The Myhill isomorphism theorem does not generalize much</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Myhill isomorphism is a variant of the Cantor-Bernstein theorem. It states that, from two injections that reduces two subsets of $\mathbb{N}$ to each other, there exists a bijection $\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}$ that preserves them. This theorem can be proven constructively. We investigate to which extent the theorem can be extended to other infinite sets other than $\mathbb{N}$. We show that, assuming Markov's principle, the theorem can be extended to the conatural numbers $\mathbb{N}_{\infty}$ provided that we only require that bicomplemented sets are preserved by the bijection. This restriction is essential. Otherwise, the picture is overall negative: among other things, it is impossible to extend that result to either $2 \times \mathbb{N}_{\infty}$, $\mathbb{N} + \mathbb{N}_{\infty}$, $\mathbb{N} \times \mathbb{N}_{\infty}$, $\mathbb{N}_{\infty}^2$, $2^{\mathbb{N}}$ or $\mathbb{N}^{\mathbb{N}}$.</description>

      <title>Interleaving Logic and Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reasoning with quantifier expressions in natural language combines logical and arithmetical features, transcending strict divides between qualitative and quantitative. Our topic is this cooperation of styles as it occurs in common linguistic usage and its extension into the broader practice of natural language plus "grassroots mathematics".
  We begin with a brief review of first-order logic with counting operators and cardinality comparisons. This system is known to be of high complexity, and drowns out finer aspects of the combination of logic and counting. We move to a small fragment that can represent numerical syllogisms and basic reasoning about comparative size: monadic first-order logic with counting. We provide normal forms that allow for axiomatization, determine which arithmetical notions can be defined on finite and on infinite models, and conversely, we discuss which logical notions can be defined out of purely arithmetical ones, and what sort of (non-)classical logics can be induced.
  Next, we investigate a series of strengthenings, again using normal form methods. The monadic second-order version is close, in a precise sense, to additive Presburger Arithmetic, while versions with the natural device of tuple counting take us to Diophantine equations, making the logic undecidable. We also define a system that combines basic modal logic over binary accessibility relations with counting, needed to formulate ubiquitous reasoning patterns such as the Pigeonhole Principle.
  We return to our starting point in natural language, confronting the architecture of our formal systems with linguistic quantifier vocabulary and syntax. We conclude with some general thoughts on yet further entanglements of logic and counting in formal systems, on rethinking the qualitative/quantitative divide, and on connecting our analysis to empirical findings in cognitive science.</description>

      <title>The Flat Cover Conjecture for Monoid Acts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Flat Cover Conjecture holds for the category of (right) acts over any right-reversible monoid $S$, provided that the flat $S$-acts are closed under stable Rees extensions. The argument shows that the class $\mathcal{F}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with flat Rees quotient) is cofibrantly generated in such categories, answering a question of Bailey and Renshaw. But cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{SF}$-Mono ($S$-act monomorphisms with \emph{strongly} flat Rees quotient) appears much stronger, since we show it implies that there is a bound on the size of the indecomposable strongly flat acts. Similarly, cofibrant generation of $\mathcal{U}_{\mathcal{F}}$ (unitary monomorphisms with flat complement) implies a bound on the size of indecomposable flat acts. The key tool is a new characterization of cofibrant generation of a class $\mathcal{M}$ of monomorphisms, in terms of ``almost everywhere" effectiveness of $\mathcal{M}$.</description>

      <title>Shininess, strong politeness, and unicorns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04445v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shininess and strong politeness are properties related to theory combination procedures. In a paper titled "Many-sorted equivalence of shiny and strongly polite theories", Casal and Rasga proved that for decidable theories, these properties are equivalent. We refine their result by showing that: (i) shiny theories are always decidable, and therefore strongly polite; and (ii) there are (undecidable) strongly polite theories that are not shiny. This line of research is tightly related to a recent series of papers that have sought to classify all the relations between theory combination properties. We finally complete this project, resolving all of the remaining problems that were previously left open.</description>

      <title>On the Existence and Disjunction Properties in Structural Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate a definition of the existence property that works with "structural" set theories, in the mode of ETCS (the elementary theory of the category of sets). We show that a range of structural set theories, when formulated using constructive logic, satisfy the disjunction, numerical existence, and existence properties; in particular, intuitionist ETCS, formulated with separation and Shulman's replacement of contexts axiom, satisfies these properties. As a consequence of this, we show that, working constructively, replacement of contexts is strictly weaker than collection.</description>

      <title>Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture and big Ramsey degrees of structures admitting finite monomorphic decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20307v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we show that a countable structure admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if so does every monomorphic part in its minimal monomorphic decomposition. The necessary prerequisite for this result is the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees: a countable monomorphic structure has finite big Ramsey degrees if and only if it is chainable by a chain with finite big Ramsey degrees. Interestingly, both characterizations require deep structural properties of chains. Fra\"{i}ss\'{e}'s Conjecture (actually, its positive resolution due to Laver) is instrumental in the characterization of monomorphic structures with finite big Ramsey degrees, while the analysis of big Ramsey combinatorics of structures admitting a finite monomorphic decomposition requires a product Ramsey theorem for big Ramsey degrees. We find this last result particularly intriguing because big Ramsey degrees misbehave notoriously when it comes to general product statements.</description>

      <title>A Walk on the Wild Side: Notions of maximality in first-order theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classification of complete first-order theories, many dividing lines have been defined in order to understand the complexity and the behavior of some classes of theories. In this paper, using the concept of patterns of consistency and inconsistency, we describe a general framework to study dividing lines and we introduce a notion of maximal complexity by requesting the presence of all the exhibitable patterns of definable sets. Weakening this notion, we define new properties (Positive Maximality and the $\mathrm{PM}^{(k)}$ hierarchy) and prove some results about them. In particular, we show that $\mathrm{PM}^{(k+1)}$ theories are not $k$-dependent. Moreover, we provide an example of a $\mathrm{PM}$ but $\mathrm{NSOP}_4$ theory (showing that $\mathrm{SOP}$ and the $\mathrm{SOP}_n$ hierarchy, for $n \geq 4$, can not be described by \emph{positive} patterns) and, for each $1&lt;k&lt;\omega$, an example of a $\mathrm{PM}^{(k)}$ but $\mathrm{NPM}^{(k+1)}$ theory (showing that the newly defined hierarchy does not collapse).</description>

      <title>A unique $Q$-point and infinitely many near-coherence classes of ultrafilters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that in the model obtained by iteratively pseudo-intersecting a Ramsey ultrafilter via a length-$\omega_2$ countable support iteration of restricted Mathias forcing over a ground model satisfying $\textsf{CH}$, there is a unique $Q$-point up to isomorphism. In particular, it is consistent that there is only one $Q$-point while there are $2^{\mathfrak{c}}$-many near-coherence classes of ultrafilters.</description>

      <title>The Mostowski Bridge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23998v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1950, Novak and Mostowski showed that GB (G\"odel-Bernays theory of classes) is conservative over ZF, and therefore by G\"odel's second incompleteness theorem the consistency of ZF is unprovable in GB. In the same year Mostowski unveiled a contrasting result: GB provides a truth-definition for ZF-formulae. Here we first give an expository account of Mostowski's construction and surrounding results, and then we show that the construction bridges the domain of Tarski-style truth theories over PA with certain subsystems of second order arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Agnostic Online Learning and Excellent Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.05569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.05569v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use algorithmic methods from online learning to explore some important objects at the intersection of model theory and combinatorics, and find natural ways that algorithmic methods can detect and explain (and improve our understanding of) stable structure in the sense of model theory. The main theorem deals with existence of $\epsilon$-excellent sets (which are key to the Stable Regularity Lemma, a theorem characterizing the appearance of irregular pairs in Szemer\'edi's celebrated Regularity Lemma). We prove that $\epsilon$-excellent sets exist for any $\epsilon &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ in $k$-edge stable graphs in the sense of model theory (equivalently, Littlestone classes); earlier proofs had given this only for $\epsilon &lt; 1/{2^{2^k}}$ or so. We give two proofs: the first uses regret bounds from online learning, the second uses Boolean closure properties of Littlestone classes and sampling. We also give a version of the dynamic Sauer-Shelah-Perles lemma appropriate to this setting, related to definability of types. We conclude by characterizing stable/Littlestone classes as those supporting a certain abstract notion of majority: the proof shows that the two distinct, natural notions of majority, arising from measure and from dimension, densely often coincide.</description>

      <title>Formalising Inductive and Coinductive Containers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02603v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Containers capture the concept of strictly positive data types in programming. The original development of containers is done in the internal language of locally cartesian closed categories (LCCCs) with disjoint coproducts and W-types, and uniqueness of identity proofs (UIP) is implicitly assumed throughout. Although it is claimed that these developments can also be interpreted in extensional Martin-L\"of type theory, this interpretation is not made explicit. In this paper, we present a formalisation of the results that 'containers preserve least and greatest fixed points' in Cubical Agda, thereby giving a formulation in intensional type theory. Our proofs do not make use of UIP and thereby generalise the original results from talking about container functors on Set to container functors on the wild category of types. Our main incentive for using Cubical Agda is that its path type restores the equivalence between bisimulation and coinductive equality. Thus, besides developing container theory in a more general setting, we also demonstrate the usefulness of Cubical Agda's path type to coinductive proofs.</description>

      <title>Information geometry for types in the large-$n$ limit of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction between entropy and Wasserstein distance in free probability theory. In particular, we give lower bounds for several versions of free entropy dimension along Wasserstein geodesics, as well as study their topological properties with respect to Wasserstein distance. We also study moment measures in the multivariate free setting, showing the existence and uniqueness of solutions for a regularized version of Santambrogio's variational problem. The role of probability distributions in these results is played by types, functionals which assign values not only to polynomial test functions, but to all real-valued logical formulas built from them using suprema and infima. We give an explicit counterexample showing that in the framework of non-commutative laws, the usual notion of probability distributions using only non-commutative polynomial test functions, one cannot obtain the desired large-$n$ limiting behavior for both Wasserstein distance and entropy simultaneously in random multi-matrix models.</description>

      <title>Counting rational points on transcendental curves in valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove upper bounds on the number of rational points on transcendental curves in arbitrary $1$-h-minimal fields, similar to the Pila--Wilkie counting theorem in the o-minimal setting. These results extend results due to Cluckers--Comte--Loeser from $p$-adic fields to arbitrary valued fields of mixed characteristic. Our methods rely on parametrizations, where we avoid the usage of $r$-th power maps, combined with the determinant method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22592v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that if $\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_2$ then all covering numbers of Hausdorff measures $\operatorname{cov}(\mathcal{N}^s(\mathbb{R}^d))$ ($0 &lt; s &lt; d, d \in \omega$) are equal and all uniformity numbers $\operatorname{non}(\mathcal{N}^s(\mathbb{R}^d))$ ($0 &lt; s &lt; d, d \in \omega$) are equal. This is a partial answer to Problem 5.3 and 5.4 of [4].</description>
