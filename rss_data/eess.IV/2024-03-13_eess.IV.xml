      <title>SAMDA: Leveraging SAM on Few-Shot Domain Adaptation for Electronic Microscopy Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been shown that traditional deep learning methods for electronic microscopy segmentation usually suffer from low transferability when samples and annotations are limited, while large-scale vision foundation models are more robust when transferring between different domains but facing sub-optimal improvement under fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new few-shot domain adaptation framework SAMDA, which combines the Segment Anything Model(SAM) with nnUNet in the embedding space to achieve high transferability and accuracy. Specifically, we choose the Unet-based network as the "expert" component to learn segmentation features efficiently and design a SAM-based adaptation module as the "generic" component for domain transfer. By amalgamating the "generic" and "expert" components, we mitigate the modality imbalance in the complex pre-training knowledge inherent to large-scale Vision Foundation models and the challenge of transferability inherent to traditional neural networks. The effectiveness of our model is evaluated on two electron microscopic image datasets with different modalities for mitochondria segmentation, which improves the dice coefficient on the target domain by 6.7%. Also, the SAM-based adaptor performs significantly better with only a single annotated image than the 10-shot domain adaptation on nnUNet. We further verify our model on four MRI datasets from different sources to prove its generalization ability.</description>

      <title>Aedes aegypti Egg Counting with Neural Networks for Object Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aedes aegypti is still one of the main concerns when it comes to disease vectors. Among the many ways to deal with it, there are important protocols that make use of egg numbers in ovitraps to calculate indices, such as the LIRAa and the Breteau Index, which can provide information on predictable outbursts and epidemics. Also, there are many research lines that require egg numbers, specially when mass production of mosquitoes is needed. Egg counting is a laborious and error-prone task that can be automated via computer vision-based techniques, specially deep learning-based counting with object detection. In this work, we propose a new dataset comprising field and laboratory eggs, along with test results of three neural networks applied to the task: Faster R-CNN, Side-Aware Boundary Localization and FoveaBox.</description>

      <title>CT evaluation of 2D and 3D holistic deep learning methods for the volumetric segmentation of airway lesions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research embarked on a comparative exploration of the holistic segmentation capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in both 2D and 3D formats, focusing on cystic fibrosis (CF) lesions. The study utilized data from two CF reference centers, covering five major CF structural changes. Initially, it compared the 2D and 3D models, highlighting the 3D model's superior capability in capturing complex features like mucus plugs and consolidations. To improve the 2D model's performance, a loss adapted to fine structures segmentation was implemented and evaluated, significantly enhancing its accuracy, though not surpassing the 3D model's performance. The models underwent further validation through external evaluation against pulmonary function tests (PFTs), confirming the robustness of the findings. Moreover, this study went beyond comparing metrics; it also included comprehensive assessments of the models' interpretability and reliability, providing valuable insights for their clinical application.</description>

      <title>Iterative Learning for Joint Image Denoising and Motion Artifact Correction of 3D Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image noise and motion artifacts greatly affect the quality of brain MRI and negatively influence downstream medical image analysis. Previous studies often focus on 2D methods that process each volumetric MR image slice-by-slice, thus losing important 3D anatomical information. Additionally, these studies generally treat image denoising and artifact correction as two standalone tasks, without considering their potential relationship, especially on low-quality images where severe noise and motion artifacts occur simultaneously. To address these issues, we propose a Joint image Denoising and motion Artifact Correction (JDAC) framework via iterative learning to handle noisy MRIs with motion artifacts, consisting of an adaptive denoising model and an anti-artifact model. In the adaptive denoising model, we first design a novel noise level estimation strategy, and then adaptively reduce the noise through a U-Net backbone with feature normalization conditioning on the estimated noise variance. The anti-artifact model employs another U-Net for eliminating motion artifacts, incorporating a novel gradient-based loss function designed to maintain the integrity of brain anatomy during the motion correction process. These two models are iteratively employed for joint image denoising and artifact correction through an iterative learning framework. An early stopping strategy depending on noise level estimation is applied to accelerate the iteration process. The denoising model is trained with 9,544 T1-weighted MRIs with manually added Gaussian noise as supervision. The anti-artifact model is trained on 552 T1-weighted MRIs with motion artifacts and paired motion-free images. Experimental results on a public dataset and a clinical study suggest the effectiveness of JDAC in both tasks of denoising and motion artifact correction, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Dual-domain Regularization Method for Ring Artifact Removal of X-ray CT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ring artifacts in computed tomography images, arising from the undesirable responses of detector units, significantly degrade image quality and diagnostic reliability. To address this challenge, we propose a dual-domain regularization model to effectively remove ring artifacts, while maintaining the integrity of the original CT image. The proposed model corrects the vertical stripe artifacts on the sinogram by innovatively updating the response inconsistency compensation coefficients of detector units, which is achieved by employing the group sparse constraint and the projection-view direction sparse constraint on the stripe artifacts. Simultaneously, we apply the sparse constraint on the reconstructed image to further rectified ring artifacts in the image domain. The key advantage of the proposed method lies in considering the relationship between the response inconsistency compensation coefficients of the detector units and the projection views, which enables a more accurate correction of the response of the detector units. An alternating minimization method is designed to solve the model. Comparative experiments on real photon counting detector data demonstrate that the proposed method not only surpasses existing methods in removing ring artifacts but also excels in preserving structural details and image fidelity.</description>

      <title>Pre-examinations Improve Automated Metastases Detection on Cranial MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials and methods: First, a dual-time approach was assessed, for which the CNN was provided sequences of the MRI that initially depicted new MM (diagnosis MRI) as well as of a prediagnosis MRI: inclusion of only contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (CNNdual_ce) was compared with inclusion of also the native T1-weighted images, T2-weighted images, and FLAIR sequences of both time points (CNNdual_all).Second, results were compared with the corresponding single time approaches, in which the CNN was provided exclusively the respective sequences of the diagnosis MRI.Casewise diagnostic performance parameters were calculated from 5-fold cross-validation.
  Results: In total, 94 cases with 494 MMs were included. Overall, the highest diagnostic performance was achieved by inclusion of only the contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images of the diagnosis and of a prediagnosis MRI (CNNdual_ce, sensitivity = 73%, PPV = 25%, F1-score = 36%). Using exclusively contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images as input resulted in significantly less false-positives (FPs) compared with inclusion of further sequences beyond contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images (FPs = 5/7 for CNNdual_ce/CNNdual_all, P &lt; 1e-5). Comparison of contrast-enhanced dual and mono time approaches revealed that exclusion of prediagnosis MRI significantly increased FPs (FPs = 5/10 for CNNdual_ce/CNNce, P &lt; 1e-9).Approaches with only native sequences were clearly inferior to CNNs that were provided contrast-enhanced sequences.
  Conclusions: Automated MM detection on contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images performed with high sensitivity. Frequent FPs due to artifacts and vessels were significantly reduced by additional inclusion of prediagnosis MRI, but not by inclusion of further sequences beyond contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images. Future studies might investigate different change detection architectures for computer-aided detection.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Learning for Motion-Corrected Reconstruction of Quantitative Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose PHIMO, a physics-informed learning-based motion correction method tailored to quantitative MRI. PHIMO leverages information from the signal evolution to exclude motion-corrupted k-space lines from a data-consistent reconstruction. We demonstrate the potential of PHIMO for the application of T2* quantification from gradient echo MRI, which is particularly sensitive to motion due to its sensitivity to magnetic field inhomogeneities. A state-of-the-art technique for motion correction requires redundant acquisition of the k-space center, prolonging the acquisition. We show that PHIMO can detect and exclude intra-scan motion events and, thus, correct for severe motion artifacts. PHIMO approaches the performance of the state-of-the-art motion correction method, while substantially reducing the acquisition time by over 40%, facilitating clinical applicability. Our code is available at https://github.com/HannahEichhorn/PHIMO.</description>

      <title>The Development and Performance of a Machine Learning Based Mobile Platform for Visually Determining the Etiology of Penile Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine-learning algorithms can facilitate low-cost, user-guided visual diagnostic platforms for addressing disparities in access to sexual health services. We developed a clinical image dataset using original and augmented images for five penile diseases: herpes eruption, syphilitic chancres, penile candidiasis, penile cancer, and genital warts. We used a U-net architecture model for semantic pixel segmentation into background or subject image, the Inception-ResNet version 2 neural architecture to classify each pixel as diseased or non-diseased, and a salience map using GradCAM++. We trained the model on a random 91% sample of the image database using 150 epochs per image, and evaluated the model on the remaining 9% of images, assessing recall (or sensitivity), precision, specificity, and F1-score (accuracy). Of the 239 images in the validation dataset, 45 (18.8%) were of genital warts, 43 (18.0%) were of HSV infection, 29 (12.1%) were of penile cancer, 40 (16.7%) were of penile candidiasis, 37 (15.5%) were of syphilitic chancres, and 45 (18.8%) were of non-diseased penises. The overall accuracy of the model for correctly classifying the diseased image was 0.944. Between July 1st and October 1st 2023, there were 2,640 unique users of the mobile platform. Among a random sample of submissions (n=437), 271 (62.0%) were from the United States, 64 (14.6%) from Singapore, 41 (9.4%) from Candia, 40 (9.2%) from the United Kingdom, and 21 (4.8%) from Vietnam. The majority (n=277 [63.4%]) were between 18 and 30 years old. We report on the development of a machine-learning model for classifying five penile diseases, which demonstrated excellent performance on a validation dataset. That model is currently in use globally and has the potential to improve access to diagnostic services for penile diseases.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Models with Implicit Guidance for Medical Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have advanced unsupervised anomaly detection by improving the transformation of pathological images into pseudo-healthy equivalents. Nonetheless, standard approaches may compromise critical information during pathology removal, leading to restorations that do not align with unaffected regions in the original scans. Such discrepancies can inadvertently increase false positive rates and reduce specificity, complicating radiological evaluations. This paper introduces Temporal Harmonization for Optimal Restoration (THOR), which refines the de-noising process by integrating implicit guidance through temporal anomaly maps. THOR aims to preserve the integrity of healthy tissue in areas unaffected by pathology. Comparative evaluations show that THOR surpasses existing diffusion-based methods in detecting and segmenting anomalies in brain MRIs and wrist X-rays.

      <title>MD-Dose: A Diffusion Model based on the Mamba for Radiotherapy Dose Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiation therapy is crucial in cancer treatment. Experienced experts typically iteratively generate high-quality dose distribution maps, forming the basis for excellent radiation therapy plans. Therefore, automated prediction of dose distribution maps is significant in expediting the treatment process and providing a better starting point for developing radiation therapy plans. With the remarkable results of diffusion models in predicting high-frequency regions of dose distribution maps, dose prediction methods based on diffusion models have been extensively studied. However, existing methods mainly utilize CNNs or Transformers as denoising networks. CNNs lack the capture of global receptive fields, resulting in suboptimal prediction performance. Transformers excel in global modeling but face quadratic complexity with image size, resulting in significant computational overhead. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a novel diffusion model, MD-Dose, based on the Mamba architecture for predicting radiation therapy dose distribution in thoracic cancer patients. In the forward process, MD-Dose adds Gaussian noise to dose distribution maps to obtain pure noise images. In the backward process, MD-Dose utilizes a noise predictor based on the Mamba to predict the noise, ultimately outputting the dose distribution maps. Furthermore, We develop a Mamba encoder to extract structural information and integrate it into the noise predictor for localizing dose regions in the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs). Through extensive experiments on a dataset of 300 thoracic tumor patients, we showcase the superiority of MD-Dose in various metrics and time consumption.</description>

      <title>Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.</description>

      <title>GaussianImage: 1000 FPS Image Representation and Compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) recently achieved great success in image representation and compression, offering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds with 10-1000 FPS, assuming sufficient GPU resources are available. However, this requirement often hinders their use on low-end devices with limited memory. In response, we propose a groundbreaking paradigm of image representation and compression by 2D Gaussian Splatting, named GaussianImage. We first introduce 2D Gaussian to represent the image, where each Gaussian has 8 parameters including position, covariance and color. Subsequently, we unveil a novel rendering algorithm based on accumulated summation. Remarkably, our method with a minimum of 3$\times$ lower GPU memory usage and 5$\times$ faster fitting time not only rivals INRs (e.g., WIRE, I-NGP) in representation performance, but also delivers a faster rendering speed of 1500-2000 FPS regardless of parameter size. Furthermore, we integrate existing vector quantization technique to build an image codec. Experimental results demonstrate that our codec attains rate-distortion performance comparable to compression-based INRs such as COIN and COIN++, while facilitating decoding speeds of approximately 1000 FPS. Additionally, preliminary proof of concept shows that our codec surpasses COIN and COIN++ in performance when using partial bits-back coding.</description>

Abstract: The storage of medical images is one of the challenges in the medical imaging field. There are variable works that use implicit neural representation (INR) to compress volumetric medical images. However, there is room to improve the compression rate for volumetric medical images. Most of the INR techniques need a huge amount of GPU memory and a long training time for high-quality medical volume rendering. In this paper, we present a novel implicit neural representation to compress volume data using our proposed architecture, that is, the Lanczos downsampling scheme, SIREN deep network, and SRDenseNet high-resolution scheme. Our architecture can effectively reduce training time, and gain a high compression rate while retaining the final rendering quality. Moreover, it can save GPU memory in comparison with the existing works. The experiments show that the quality of reconstructed images and training speed using our architecture is higher than current works which use the SIREN only. Besides, the GPU memory cost is evidently decreased</description>

      <title>Exploiting Structural Consistency of Chest Anatomy for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Radiography Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiography imaging protocols focus on particular body regions, therefore producing images of great similarity and yielding recurrent anatomical structures across patients. Exploiting this structured information could potentially ease the detection of anomalies from radiography images. To this end, we propose a Simple Space-Aware Memory Matrix for In-painting and Detecting anomalies from radiography images (abbreviated as SimSID). We formulate anomaly detection as an image reconstruction task, consisting of a space-aware memory matrix and an in-painting block in the feature space. During the training, SimSID can taxonomize the ingrained anatomical structures into recurrent visual patterns, and in the inference, it can identify anomalies (unseen/modified visual patterns) from the test image. Our SimSID surpasses the state of the arts in unsupervised anomaly detection by +8.0%, +5.0%, and +9.9% AUC scores on ZhangLab, COVIDx, and CheXpert benchmark datasets, respectively.

      <title>Diffusion-based Iterative Counterfactual Explanations for Fetal Ultrasound Image Quality Assessment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Obstetric ultrasound image quality is crucial for accurate diagnosis and monitoring of fetal health. However, producing high-quality standard planes is difficult, influenced by the sonographer's expertise and factors like the maternal BMI or the fetus dynamics. In this work, we propose using diffusion-based counterfactual explainable AI to generate realistic high-quality standard planes from low-quality non-standard ones. Through quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in producing plausible counterfactuals of increased quality. This shows future promise both for enhancing training of clinicians by providing visual feedback, as well as for improving image quality and, consequently, downstream diagnosis and monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The currently limited quality of accelerated cardiac cine reconstruction may potentially be improved by the emerging diffusion models, but the clinically unacceptable long processing time poses a challenge. We aim to develop a clinically feasible diffusion-model-based reconstruction pipeline to improve the image quality of cine MRI. A multi-in multi-out diffusion enhancement model together with fast inference strategies were developed to be used in conjunction with a reconstruction model. The diffusion reconstruction reduced spatial and temporal blurring in prospectively undersampled clinical data, as validated by experts inspection. The 1.5s per video processing time enabled the approach to be applied in clinical scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Current deep learning reconstruction for accelerated cardiac cine MRI suffers from spatial and temporal blurring. We aim to improve image sharpness and motion delineation for cine MRI under high undersampling rates. A spatiotemporal diffusion enhancement model conditional on an existing deep learning reconstruction along with a novel paired sampling strategy was developed. The diffusion model provided sharper tissue boundaries and clearer motion than the original reconstruction in experts evaluation on clinical data. The innovative paired sampling strategy substantially reduced artificial noises in the generative results.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of Knee Bones for Osteoarthritis Assessment: A Comparative Analysis of Supervised, Few-Shot, and Zero-Shot Learning Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint disease that induces chronic pain and disability. Bone morphological analysis is a promising tool to understand the mechanical aspect of this disorder. This study proposes a 2D bone morphological analysis using manually segmented bones to explore morphological features related to distinct pain conditions. Furthermore, six semantic segmentation algorithms are assessed for extracting femur and tibia bones from X-ray images. Our analysis reveals that the morphology of the femur undergoes significant changes in instances where pain worsens. Conversely, improvements in pain may not manifest pronounced alterations in bone shape. The few-shot-learning-based algorithm, UniverSeg, demonstrated superior segmentation results with Dice scores of 99.69% for femur and 99.60% for tibia. Regarding pain condition classification, the zero-shot-learning-based algorithm, CP-SAM, achieved the highest accuracy at 66% among all models. UniverSeg is recommended for automatic knee bone segmentation, while SAM models show potential with prompt encoder modifications for optimized outcomes. These findings highlight the effectiveness of few-shot learning for semantic segmentation and the potential of zero-shot learning in enhancing classification models for knee osteoarthritis diagnosis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to the demand for real-time performance and control quality in industrial Internet of Things (IoT) environments, this paper proposes an optimization control system based on deep reinforcement learning and edge computing. The system leverages cloud-edge collaboration, deploys lightweight policy networks at the edge, predicts system states, and outputs controls at a high frequency, enabling monitoring and optimization of industrial objectives. Additionally, a dynamic resource allocation mechanism is designed to ensure rational scheduling of edge computing resources, achieving global optimization. Results demonstrate that this approach reduces cloud-edge communication latency, accelerates response to abnormal situations, reduces system failure rates, extends average equipment operating time, and saves costs for manual maintenance and replacement. This ensures real-time and stable control.</description>

      <title>Versatile Defense Against Adversarial Attacks on Image Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks present a significant security risk to image recognition tasks. Defending against these attacks in a real-life setting can be compared to the way antivirus software works, with a key consideration being how well the defense can adapt to new and evolving attacks. Another important factor is the resources involved in terms of time and cost for training defense models and updating the model database. Training many models that are specific to each type of attack can be time-consuming and expensive. Ideally, we should be able to train one single model that can handle a wide range of attacks. It appears that a defense method based on image-to-image translation may be capable of this. The proposed versatile defense approach in this paper only requires training one model to effectively resist various unknown adversarial attacks. The trained model has successfully improved the classification accuracy from nearly zero to an average of 86%, performing better than other defense methods proposed in prior studies. When facing the PGD attack and the MI-FGSM attack, versatile defense model even outperforms the attack-specific models trained based on these two attacks. The robustness check also shows that our versatile defense model performs stably regardless with the attack strength.</description>

      <title>Learnable Community-Aware Transformer for Brain Connectome Analysis with Token Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neuroscientific research has revealed that the complex brain network can be organized into distinct functional communities, each characterized by a cohesive group of regions of interest (ROIs) with strong interconnections. These communities play a crucial role in comprehending the functional organization of the brain and its implications for neurological conditions, including Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and biological differences, such as in gender. Traditional models have been constrained by the necessity of predefined community clusters, limiting their flexibility and adaptability in deciphering the brain's functional organization. Furthermore, these models were restricted by a fixed number of communities, hindering their ability to accurately represent the brain's dynamic nature. In this study, we present a token clustering brain transformer-based model ($\texttt{TC-BrainTF}$) for joint community clustering and classification. Our approach proposes a novel token clustering (TC) module based on the transformer architecture, which utilizes learnable prompt tokens with orthogonal loss where each ROI embedding is projected onto the prompt embedding space, effectively clustering ROIs into communities and reducing the dimensions of the node representation via merging with communities. Our results demonstrate that our learnable community-aware model $\texttt{TC-BrainTF}$ offers improved accuracy in identifying ASD and classifying genders through rigorous testing on ABIDE and HCP datasets. Additionally, the qualitative analysis on $\texttt{TC-BrainTF}$ has demonstrated the effectiveness of the designed TC module and its relevance to neuroscience interpretations.</description>

      <title>Point Cloud Compression via Constrained Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel point cloud compression method COT-PCC by formulating the task as a constrained optimal transport (COT) problem. COT-PCC takes the bitrate of compressed features as an extra constraint of optimal transport (OT) which learns the distribution transformation between original and reconstructed points. Specifically, the formulated COT is implemented with a generative adversarial network (GAN) and a bitrate loss for training. The discriminator measures the Wasserstein distance between input and reconstructed points, and a generator calculates the optimal mapping between distributions of input and reconstructed point cloud. Moreover, we introduce a learnable sampling module for downsampling in the compression procedure. Extensive results on both sparse and dense point cloud datasets demonstrate that COT-PCC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both CD and PSNR metrics.

      <title>CoroNetGAN: Controlled Pruning of GANs via Hypernetworks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have proven to exhibit remarkable performance and are widely used across many generative computer vision applications. However, the unprecedented demand for the deployment of GANs on resource-constrained edge devices still poses a challenge due to huge number of parameters involved in the generation process. This has led to focused attention on the area of compressing GANs. Most of the existing works use knowledge distillation with the overhead of teacher dependency. Moreover, there is no ability to control the degree of compression in these methods. Hence, we propose CoroNet-GAN for compressing GAN using the combined strength of differentiable pruning method via hypernetworks. The proposed method provides the advantage of performing controllable compression while training along with reducing training time by a substantial factor. Experiments have been done on various conditional GAN architectures (Pix2Pix and CycleGAN) to signify the effectiveness of our approach on multiple benchmark datasets such as Edges-to-Shoes, Horse-to-Zebra and Summer-to-Winter. The results obtained illustrate that our approach succeeds to outperform the baselines on Zebra-to-Horse and Summer-to-Winter achieving the best FID score of 32.3 and 72.3 respectively, yielding high-fidelity images across all the datasets. Additionally, our approach also outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in achieving better inference time on various smart-phone chipsets and data-types making it a feasible solution for deployment on edge devices.</description>

      <title>OccFiner: Offboard Occupancy Refinement with Hybrid Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-based occupancy prediction, also known as 3D Semantic Scene Completion (SSC), presents a significant challenge in computer vision. Previous methods, confined to onboard processing, struggle with simultaneous geometric and semantic estimation, continuity across varying viewpoints, and single-view occlusion. Our paper introduces OccFiner, a novel offboard framework designed to enhance the accuracy of vision-based occupancy predictions. OccFiner operates in two hybrid phases: 1) a multi-to-multi local propagation network that implicitly aligns and processes multiple local frames for correcting onboard model errors and consistently enhancing occupancy accuracy across all distances. 2) the region-centric global propagation, focuses on refining labels using explicit multi-view geometry and integrating sensor bias, especially to increase the accuracy of distant occupied voxels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OccFiner improves both geometric and semantic accuracy across various types of coarse occupancy, setting a new state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset. Notably, OccFiner elevates vision-based SSC models to a level even surpassing that of LiDAR-based onboard SSC models.</description>

      <title>Leveraging Compressed Frame Sizes For Ultra-Fast Video Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classifying videos into distinct categories, such as Sport and Music Video, is crucial for multimedia understanding and retrieval, especially when an immense volume of video content is being constantly generated. Traditional methods require video decompression to extract pixel-level features like color, texture, and motion, thereby increasing computational and storage demands. Moreover, these methods often suffer from performance degradation in low-quality videos. We present a novel approach that examines only the post-compression bitstream of a video to perform classification, eliminating the need for bitstream decoding. To validate our approach, we built a comprehensive data set comprising over 29,000 YouTube video clips, totaling 6,000 hours and spanning 11 distinct categories. Our evaluations indicate precision, accuracy, and recall rates consistently above 80%, many exceeding 90%, and some reaching 99%. The algorithm operates approximately 15,000 times faster than real-time for 30fps videos, outperforming traditional Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) algorithm by seven orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for In-Orbit Cloud Segmentation and Classification in Hyperspectral Satellite Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores the latest Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for cloud detection aboard hyperspectral satellites. The performance of the latest 1D CNN (1D-Justo-LiuNet) and two recent 2D CNNs (nnU-net and 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple) for cloud segmentation and classification is assessed. Evaluation criteria include precision and computational efficiency for in-orbit deployment. Experiments utilize NASA's EO-1 Hyperion data, with varying spectral channel numbers after Principal Component Analysis. Results indicate that 1D-Justo-LiuNet achieves the highest accuracy, outperforming 2D CNNs, while maintaining compactness with larger spectral channel sets, albeit with increased inference times. However, the performance of 1D CNN degrades with significant channel reduction. In this context, the 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple offers the best balance for in-orbit deployment, considering precision, memory, and time costs. While nnU-net is suitable for on-ground processing, deployment of lightweight 1D-Justo-LiuNet is recommended for high-precision applications. Alternatively, lightweight 2D-Justo-UNet-Simple is recommended for balanced costs between timing and precision in orbit.</description>

      <title>Medical Multimodal-Multitask Foundation Model for Superior Chest CT Performance</title>

Abstract: Patient management requires multitasking interaction with multimodal data. While today's AI, particularly large foundation models, promises unprecedented opportunities, progress remains relatively slow in developing medical multimodal multitask foundation models. There are two main challenges along this direction: the data challenge -- the high bar to curate medical multimodal multitask datasets including 3D medical tomographic images in alignment with other clinical datasets, and the model challenge -- the unavailability of a scalable and adaptable foundation model architecture to synergize multimodal datasets for diverse clinical tasks. Here we propose the first-of-its-kind medical multimodal-multitask foundation model (M3FM) with an emphasis on lung cancer screening. To train our M3FM, we first curated a comprehensive multimodal multitask dataset consisting of 163,725 3D chest CT exams, 48 clinical data types, and 17 medical tasks on lung, heart, and other chest diseases. Then, we created and applied a multimodal question-answering framework as a unified training strategy to effectively integrate multimodal information and naturally perform multiple tasks with free-text prompting. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that M3FM consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models. M3FM can identify informative multimodal data elements that are relevant to specific clinical tasks, being instrumental in building AI models and gaining insights into correlations among multimodal data and diseases. M3FM can be adapted to boost the performance of new tasks with a small out-of-distribution dataset. M3FM has enabled superior volumetric CT imaging performance for lung cancer screening, cardiac disease prediction, and other CT-related tasks. M3FM can be extended to incorporate more data types and improve other medical tasks, towards AI-empowered precise and efficient medicine.</description>

      <title>PhagoStat a scalable and interpretable end to end framework for efficient quantification of cell phagocytosis in neurodegenerative disease studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantifying the phagocytosis of dynamic, unstained cells is essential for evaluating neurodegenerative diseases. However, measuring rapid cell interactions and distinguishing cells from background make this task very challenging when processing time-lapse phase-contrast video microscopy. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end, scalable, and versatile real-time framework for quantifying and analyzing phagocytic activity. Our proposed pipeline is able to process large data-sets and includes a data quality verification module to counteract perturbations such as microscope movements and frame blurring. We also propose an explainable cell segmentation module to improve the interpretability of DL methods compared to black-box algorithms. This includes two interpretable DL capabilities: visual explanation and model simplification. We demonstrate that interpretability in DL is not the opposite of high performance, by additionally providing essential DL algorithm optimization insights and solutions. Besides, incorporating interpretable modules results in an efficient architecture design and optimized execution time. We apply our pipeline to analyze microglial cell phagocytosis in FTD and obtain statistically reliable results showing that FTD mutant cells are larger and more aggressive than control cells. The method has been tested and validated on public benchmarks by generating state-of-the art performances. To stimulate translational approaches and future studies, we release an open-source end-to-end pipeline and a unique microglial cells phagocytosis dataset for immune system characterization in neurodegenerative diseases research.

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy is a severe complication of diabetes that can lead to permanent blindness if not treated promptly. Early and accurate diagnosis of the disease is essential for successful treatment. This paper introduces a deep learning method for the detection and stage grading of diabetic retinopathy, using a single fundus retinal image. Our model utilizes transfer learning, employing two state-of-the-art pre-trained models as feature extractors and fine-tuning them on a new dataset. The proposed model is trained on a large multi-center dataset, including the APTOS 2019 dataset, obtained from publicly available sources. It achieves remarkable performance in diabetic retinopathy detection and stage classification on the APTOS 2019, outperforming the established literature. For binary classification, the proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 98.50, a sensitivity of 99.46, and a specificity of 97.51. In stage grading, it achieves a quadratic weighted kappa of 93.00, an accuracy of 89.60, a sensitivity of 89.60, and a specificity of 97.72. The proposed approach serves as a reliable screening and stage grading tool for diabetic retinopathy, offering significant potential to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care.</description>

      <title>Tissue Artifact Segmentation and Severity Analysis for Automated Diagnosis Using Whole Slide Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditionally, pathological analysis and diagnosis are performed by manually eyeballing glass slide specimens under a microscope by an expert. The whole slide image is the digital specimen produced from the glass slide. Whole slide image enabled specimens to be observed on a computer screen and led to computational pathology where computer vision and artificial intelligence are utilized for automated analysis and diagnosis. With the current computational advancement, the entire whole slide image can be analyzed autonomously without human supervision. However, the analysis could fail or lead to wrong diagnosis if the whole slide image is affected by tissue artifacts such as tissue fold or air bubbles depending on the severity. Existing artifact detection methods rely on experts for severity assessment to eliminate artifact affected regions from the analysis. This process is time consuming, exhausting and undermines the goal of automated analysis or removal of artifacts without evaluating their severity, which could result in the loss of diagnostically important data. Therefore, it is necessary to detect artifacts and then assess their severity automatically. In this paper, we propose a system that incorporates severity evaluation with artifact detection utilizing convolutional neural networks. The proposed system uses DoubleUNet to segment artifacts and an ensemble network of six fine tuned convolutional neural network models to determine severity. This method outperformed current state of the art in accuracy by 9 percent for artifact segmentation and achieved a strong correlation of 97 percent with the evaluation of pathologists for severity assessment. The robustness of the system was demonstrated using our proposed heterogeneous dataset and practical usability was ensured by integrating it with an automated analysis system.</description>

      <title>RRWNet: Recursive Refinement Network for Effective Retinal Artery/Vein Segmentation and Classification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The caliber and configuration of retinal blood vessels serve as important biomarkers for various diseases and medical conditions. A thorough analysis of the retinal vasculature requires the segmentation of the blood vessels and their classification into arteries and veins, typically performed on color fundus images obtained by retinography. However, manually performing these tasks is labor-intensive and prone to human error. While several automated methods have been proposed to address this task, the current state of art faces challenges due to manifest classification errors affecting the topological consistency of segmentation maps. In this work, we introduce RRWNet, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that addresses this limitation. The framework consists of a fully convolutional neural network that recursively refines semantic segmentation maps, correcting manifest classification errors and thus improving topological consistency. In particular, RRWNet is composed of two specialized subnetworks: a Base subnetwork that generates base segmentation maps from the input images, and a Recursive Refinement subnetwork that iteratively and recursively improves these maps. Evaluation on three different public datasets demonstrates the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method, yielding more topologically consistent segmentation maps with fewer manifest classification errors than existing approaches. In addition, the Recursive Refinement module within RRWNet proves effective in post-processing segmentation maps from other methods, further demonstrating its potential. The model code, weights, and predictions will be publicly available at https://github.com/j-morano/rrwnet.</description>

      <title>Modular Blind Video Quality Assessment</title>

Abstract: Blind video quality assessment (BVQA) plays a pivotal role in evaluating and improving the viewing experience of end-users across a wide range of video-based platforms and services. Contemporary deep learning-based models primarily analyze the video content in its aggressively downsampled format, while being blind to the impact of actual spatial resolution and frame rate on video quality. In this paper, we propose a modular BVQA model, and a method of training it to improve its modularity. Specifically, our model comprises a base quality predictor, a spatial rectifier, and a temporal rectifier, responding to the visual content and distortion, spatial resolution, and frame rate changes on video quality, respectively. During training, spatial and temporal rectifiers are dropped out with some probabilities so as to make the base quality predictor a standalone BVQA model, which should work better with the rectifiers. Extensive experiments on both professionally-generated content and user generated content video databases show that our quality model achieves superior or comparable performance to current methods. Furthermore, the modularity of our model offers a great opportunity to analyze existing video quality databases in terms of their spatial and temporal complexities. Last, our BVQA model is cost-effective to add other quality-relevant video attributes such as dynamic range and color gamut as additional rectifiers.</description>

      <title>Equipping Computational Pathology Systems with Artifact Processing Pipelines: A Showcase for Computation and Performance Trade-offs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07743v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Histopathology is a gold standard for cancer diagnosis under a microscopic examination. However, histological tissue processing procedures result in artifacts, which are ultimately transferred to the digitized version of glass slides, known as whole slide images (WSIs). Artifacts are diagnostically irrelevant areas and may result in wrong deep learning (DL) algorithms predictions. Therefore, detecting and excluding artifacts in the computational pathology (CPATH) system is essential for reliable automated diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a mixture of experts (MoE) scheme for detecting five notable artifacts, including damaged tissue, blur, folded tissue, air bubbles, and histologically irrelevant blood from WSIs. First, we train independent binary DL models as experts to capture particular artifact morphology. Then, we ensemble their predictions using a fusion mechanism. We apply probabilistic thresholding over the final probability distribution to improve the sensitivity of the MoE. We developed DL pipelines using two MoEs and two multiclass models of state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs). DCNNs-based MoE and ViTs-based MoE schemes outperformed simpler multiclass models and were tested on datasets from different hospitals and cancer types, where MoE using DCNNs yielded the best results. The proposed MoE yields 86.15% F1 and 97.93% sensitivity scores on unseen data, retaining less computational cost for inference than MoE using ViTs. This best performance of MoEs comes with relatively higher computational trade-offs than multiclass models. The proposed artifact detection pipeline will not only ensure reliable CPATH predictions but may also provide quality control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06459v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time visualization system for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), a non-invasive neuromodulation technique for treating various brain disorders and mental health diseases. Our solution targets the current challenges of slow and labor-intensive practices in treatment planning. Integrating Deep Learning (DL), our system rapidly predicts electric field (E-field) distributions in 0.2 seconds for precise and effective brain stimulation. The core advancement lies in our tool's real-time neuronavigation visualization capabilities, which support clinicians in making more informed decisions quickly and effectively. We assess our system's performance through three studies: First, a real-world use case scenario in a clinical setting, providing concrete feedback on applicability and usability in a practical environment. Second, a comparative analysis with another TMS tool focusing on computational efficiency across various hardware platforms. Lastly, we conducted an expert user study to measure usability and influence in optimizing TMS treatment planning. The system is openly available for community use and further development on GitHub: \url{https://github.com/lorifranke/SlicerTMS}.</description>

      <title>Towards optimal multimode fiber imaging by leveraging input polarization and deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17889v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques provide a plausible route towards achieving practical imaging through multimode fibers. The results produced by these methods are often influenced by physical factors like temperature, fiber length, external perturbations, and polarization state of the input light. Literature focuses on these different elements impacting deep-learning-enabled multimode imaging, yet the effects of input polarization remain under-explored. Here, we show experimentally that the state of polarization of light, being injected at multimode fiber input, affects the fidelity of reconstructed images from speckle patterns. Certain polarization states produce high-quality images at fiber output, while some yield degraded results. We have designed a conditional generative adversarial network~(CGAN) for image regeneration at various degrees of input light polarization. At a particular polarization state and with a thinner core multimode fiber, our network can reconstruct images with an average structural similarity index(SSIM) exceeding 0.9. Hence, in the case of multimode fibers that are held fixed, optimal imaging can be achieved by leveraging deep learning models with the input light polarization state, where the fidelity of images is maximum. We also show that the model can be trained to image adequately for all input light polarization states when the fiber has bends or twists. We anticipate that our work will be a stepping stone toward developing high-resolution and less invasive multimode fiber endoscopes.</description>

      <title>Microwave lymphedema assessment using deep learning with contour assisted backprojection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a method for early detection of lymphatic fluid accumulation in lymphedema patients based on microwave imaging of the limb volume across an air gap. The proposed algorithm uses contour information of the imaged limb surface to approximate the wave propagation velocity locally to solve the eikonal equation for implementing the adjoint imaging operator. This modified backprojection algorithm results in focused imagery close to the limb surface where lymphatic fluid accumulation presents itself. Next, a deep neural network based on U-Net architecture is employed to identify the location and extent of the lymphatic fluid. Simulation studies with various upper and lower arm profiles compare the focusing performance of the proposed contour assisted backprojection imaging with the baseline imaging approach that assumes homogeneous media. The empirical results of the simulation experiments show that the proposed imaging method significantly improves the ability of the deepnet model to identify the location and the volume of the excess fluid in the limb.</description>
