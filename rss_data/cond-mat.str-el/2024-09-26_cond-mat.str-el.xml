      <title>Gapped and gapless quantum spin liquids on the ruby lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ruby lattice has been the subject of much interest recently due its realization in Rydberg atom arrays, where its rich variety of frustrated interactions gives rise to topologically ordered quantum spin liquids. Similarly, numerical studies of ruby-lattice spin models, with both isotropic and anisotropic interactions, have provided evidence of gapped and gapless spin-liquid ground states with different low-energy gauge structures. Motivated by these findings, we perform a projective symmetry group (PSG) classification of U(1) and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ fermionic spinon mean-field theories$\unicode{x2014}$respecting space-group and time-reversal symmetries$\unicode{x2014}$for $S=1/2$ spins. We obtain a total of 50 U(1) and 64 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ PSGs, and upon restricting their realization via mean-field $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ with up to second-nearest-neighbor singlet amplitudes (relevant to the models studied here), only 8 U(1) and 18 $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ distinct states are obtained. We present the singlet fields for all $\textit{Ans\"atze}$ up to third-nearest-neighboring bonds and discuss their spinon dispersions as well as their dynamical spin structure factors. Building on this information, we also obtain the phase diagram of the Heisenberg model in the presence of first ($J_{1}$), second ($J_{1}'$), and third ($J_{2}$) neighbor antiferromagnetic couplings within a self-consistent mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Topological order in spin nematics from the quantum melting of a disclination lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological defects of Spin($n+1$) nematics in two spatial dimensions, known as disclinations, are characterized by the $\pi_1(\mathbb{R}P^n) = \textrm{Z}_2$ homotopy group for $n\ge2$. We argue that incompressible quantum liquids of disclinations can exist as stable low-temperature phases and host composite quasiparticles which combine a fractional amount of fundamental Z$_2$ charge with a unit of topological charge. The four-fold topological ground state degeneracy admits a fermionic or semionic quasiparticle exchange statistics. The topological non-triviality of these states is visible through the existence of protected gapless edge modes. The analysis proceeds by recasting the Z$_2$ gauge theory of spin nematics as a continuum limit theory with a larger gauge structure. Nematic fractionalization parallels that of a quantum Hall liquid, but the large gauge symmetry restores time-reversal symmetry and restricts the quasiparticle fusion rules and statistics. The conclusions from field theory analysis are complemented with the construction of plausible host microscopic models.</description>

      <title>The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsic multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using minimal tight-binding models previously calculated by ab initio methods. We close with comments on potential further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.</description>

      <title>Shot noise in a phenomenological model of a marginal Fermi liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strange metal is a mysterious non-Fermi liquid which shows linear-in-$T$ resistivity behavior at finite temperatures, and, as found in recent experiment, vanishingly small shot noise in the linear-in-$T$ regime. Here, we investigate the shot noise of a strange metal based on a phenomenological model of marginal Fermi liquid (MFL), where fermions couple to some collective boson mode, leading to $T$-linear scattering rate at finite $T$. It is found that in the diffusive regime where the MFL scattering length is small compared to the system size, the shot noise vanishes, and the thermal noise becomes a temperature- and voltage-independent constant. Introducing additional impurity scattering increases the shot noise, and is probably consistent with the current experiment.</description>

      <title>Band structure and charge ordering of Dirac semimetal EuAl$_4$ at low temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: EuAl$_4$ is proposed to host a topological Hall state. This material also undergoes four consecutive antiferromagnetic (AFM) transitions upon cooling below TN1 = 15.4 K in the presence of charge density wave (CDW) order that sets in below TCDW = 140 K. We use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density-functional-theory calculations to study how magnetic ordering affects the electronic properties in EuAl$_4$. We found changes in the band structure upon each of the four consecutive AFM transitions including band splitting, renormalizations, and appearance of new bands forming additional Fermi sheets. In addition we also found significant enhancement of the quasiparticles' lifetime due to suppression of spin flip scattering, similar to what was previously reported for ferromagnetic EuCd$_2$As$_2$. Surprisingly, we observe that most significant changes in electronic properties occur not at TN1, but instead at the AFM3 to AFM4 transition, which coincides with the largest drop in resistivity.</description>

      <title>Competition between $d$-wave and $d$+$is$-wave superconductivity in the Hubbard model on a checkerboard lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By employing determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we investigate a checkerboard lattice with next-nearest-neighbor hopping $t'$ as the frustration-control parameter, which exhibits an energetically partial flat-band in the system. Our numerical simulation identifies the dominant pairing symmetry of the checkerboard lattice Hubbard model, and we reveal the competition between the $d$-wave and $d+is$ wave in the parameter space of electron filling $\avg{n}$ and frustration control parameter $t^{\prime}/t$. To ensure the reliability and accuracy of our results, we evaluate the sign problem. We also find that the spin susceptibility, the effective pairing interactions of different pairing symmetries and the superconducting instability are enhanced as the on-site Coulomb interaction increases, demonstrating that superconductivity is driven by strong electron--electron correlation. Our work provides a further understanding of pairing symmetry in the Hubbard model and improves prospects for exploring rich correlated behaviors in frustrated systems.</description>

      <title>Collapsing Behavior of the Ferrimagnetic Ground State of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg Antiferromagnet on the Lieb Lattice due to Frustration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $S = 1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the Lieb lattice accompanied by additional interactions that create frustration. The system exhibits a ferrimagnetic ground state in the absence of frustration. Further, we successfully observe a novel type of collapsing behavior of the ferrimagnetism via numerical diagonalization. The ferrimagnetic state is observed to collapse in a discontinuous manner. Furthermore, different ground states with small spontaneous magnetizations are obtained before the spontaneous magnetization finally disappears.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible duality defects in one, two, and three dimensions via gauging spatially modulated symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatially modulated symmetries have emerged since the discovery of fractons, which characterize unconventional topological phases with mobility-constrained quasiparticle excitations. On the other hand, non-invertible duality defects have attracted substantial attention in communities of high energy and condensed matter physics due to their deep insight into quantum anomalies and exotic phases of matter. However, the connection between these exotic symmetries and defects has not been fully explored. In this paper, we construct concrete lattice models with non-invertible duality defects via gauging spatially modulated symmetries and investigate their exotic fusion rules. Specifically, we construct spin models with subsystem symmetries or dipole symmetries on one, two, and three-dimensional lattices. Gauging subsystem symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects whose fusion rules involve $0$-form subsystem charges in two dimensions and higher-form operators that correspond to ``lineon'' excitations (excitations which are mobile along one-dimensional line) in three dimensions. Gauging dipole symmetries leads to non-invertible duality defects with dipole algebras that describe a hierarchical structure between global and dipole charges. Notably, the hierarchical structure of the dual dipole charges is inverted compared with the original ones. Our work provides a unified and systematic analytical framework for constructing exotic duality defects by gauging relevant symmetries.</description>

      <title>Post-$GW$ theory and its application to pseudogap in strongly correlated system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $GW$ approximation is a widely used framework for studying correlated materials, but it struggles with certain limitations, such as its inability to explain pseudogap phenomena. To overcome these problems, we propose a systematic theoretical framework for Green's function corrections and apply it specifically to the $GW$ approximation. In this new theory, the screened potential is reconnected to the physical response function, i.e. the covariant response function proposed in \cite{cGW_2023}, rather than using the RPA formula. We apply our scheme to calculate Green's function, the spectral function, and the charge compressibility in the two-dimensional Hubbard model. Our scheme yields significant qualitative and quantitative improvements over the standard $GW$ method and successfully captures the pseudogap behavior.</description>

      <title>The cumulant Green's functions method for the single impurity Anderson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the cumulant Green's functions method (CGFM), we study the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM). The CGFM starting point is a diagonalization of the SIAM Hamiltonian expressed in a semi-chain form, containing N sites, viz., a correlated site (simulating an impurity) connected to the remaining N-1 uncorrelated conduction-electron sites. An exact solution can be obtained since the complete system has few sites. That solution is employed to calculate the atomic Green's functions and the approximate cumulants used to obtain the impurity and conduction Green's functions for the SIAM, and no self-consistency loop is required.
  We calculated the density of states, the Friedel sum rule, and the impurity occupation number, all benchmarked against results from the numerical renormalization group (NRG). One of the main insights obtained is that, at very low temperatures, only four atomic transitions contribute to generating the entire SIAM density of states, regardless of the number of sites in the chain and the model's parameters and different regimes: Empty orbital, mixed-valence, and Kondo. We also pointed out the possibilities of the CGFM as a valid alternative to describe strongly correlated electron systems like the Hubbard and t-J models, the periodic Anderson model, the Kondo and Coqblin-Schrieffer models, and their variants.</description>

      <title>Scalable quantum dynamics compilation via quantum machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum dynamics compilation is an important task for improving quantum simulation efficiency: It aims to synthesize multi-qubit target dynamics into a circuit consisting of as few elementary gates as possible. Compared to deterministic methods such as Trotterization, variational quantum compilation (VQC) methods employ variational optimization to reduce gate costs while maintaining high accuracy. In this work, we explore the potential of a VQC scheme by making use of out-of-distribution generalization results in quantum machine learning (QML): By learning the action of a given many-body dynamics on a small data set of product states, we can obtain a unitary circuit that generalizes to highly entangled states such as the Haar random states. The efficiency in training allows us to use tensor network methods to compress such time-evolved product states by exploiting their low entanglement features. Our approach exceeds state-of-the-art compilation results in both system size and accuracy in one dimension ($1$D). For the first time, we extend VQC to systems on two-dimensional (2D) strips with a quasi-1D treatment, demonstrating a significant resource advantage over standard Trotterization methods, highlighting the method's promise for advancing quantum simulation tasks on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BDG) formalism to undertake a microscopic investigation of a vortex lattice in a strongly correlated, type-II, d-wave superconductor (SC) treating strong correlation within Gutzwiller formalism. We demonstrate that in the underdoped region, the vortex core changes from metallic-type to insulating-type in the presence of subdominant charge and bond order, in contrast to Mott-type, when these orders are absent. We have investigated that such subdominant order changes the structure and spectrum of the d-wave vortex in the underdoped region. We have demonstrated the formation of charge and bond modulation at the vortex center by decreasing the doping and reaching an underdoped zone.</description>

      <title>Non-stabilizerness Entanglement Entropy: a measure of hardness in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical and quantum states can be distinguished by entanglement entropy, which can be viewed as a measure of quantum resources. Entanglement entropy also plays a pivotal role in understanding computational complexity in simulating quantum systems. However, stabilizer states formed solely by Clifford gates can be efficiently simulated with the tableau algorithm according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem, although they can host large entanglement entropy. In this work, we introduce the concept of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy which is basically the minimum residual entanglement entropy for a quantum state by excluding the contribution from Clifford circuits. It can serve as a new practical and better measure of difficulty in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems. We discuss why it is a better criterion than previously proposed metrics such as Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy. We also show numerical results of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy with concrete quantum many-body models. The concept of non-stabilizerness entanglement entropy expands our understanding of the ``hardness`` in the classical simulation of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Ensemble density functional theory of ground and excited energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Kohn-Sham density-functional energy expression is derived for any (ground or excited) state within a given many-electron ensemble along with the stationarity condition it fulfills with respect to the ensemble density, thus giving access to both physical energy levels and individual-state densities, in principle exactly. We also provide working equations for the evaluation of the latter from the true static ensemble density-density linear response function. Unlike in Gould's recent ensemble potential functional approach to excited states [arXiv:2404.12593], we use the ensemble density as sole basic variable. While a state-specific KS potential naturally emerges from the present formalism, at the exact ensemble Hartree-exchange-only (Hx) level of approximation, the standard implementation of orbital-optimized DFT for excited states is recovered when recycling the regular ground-state Hx-correlation functional in this context.</description>

Abstract: Collective behavior of spins, frustration-induced strong quantum fluctuations, and subtle interplay between competing degrees of freedom in quantum materials can lead to correlated quantum states with exotic excitations that are essential ingredients for establishing paradigmatic models and have immense potential for quantum technologies. Disorder is ubiquitous in real materials, and the detailed insights into the role of disorder on the intriguing ground state borne out of quenched randomness provide a route toward the design and discovery of functional quantum materials. Herein, we report magnetization, specific heat, electron spin resonance, and muon spin resonance studies on a 3d-electron-based antiferromagnet Sr3CuTa2O9. The negative Curie- Weiss temperature value, obtained from the Curie-Weiss fit of high-temperature magnetic susceptibility data, indicates antiferromagnetic interaction between Cu2+ moments. Specific heat data show the absence of long-range magnetic ordering down to 64 mK despite a reasonably strong exchange interaction between Cu2+ (S =1/2) spins as reflected from a Curie-Weiss temperature of -27 K. The power-law behavior and the data collapse of specific heat and magnetization data evince the emergence of a random-singlet state in Sr3CuTa2O9. The power-law-like spin auto-correlation function and the data collapse of muon polarization asymmetry with longitudinal field dependence of t({\mu}0H)^{\gamma} further support credence to the presence of a randomness-induced quantum disordered state. Our results suggest that randomness induced by disorder is an alternate route to realize a quantum disordered state in this antiferromagnet.</description>

      <title>Instanton confinement-deconfinement transitions: The stability of pseudogap phases and topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the stability of certain many-body quantum states which may exist at zero or finite temperatures, may lack long-range order and even topological order, and still are thermodynamically distinct from uncorrelated disordered phases. We sharply characterize such states by the conservation of topological charge, or equivalently confinement of instantons, using a generalization of the Wilson loop and the correlation length of an emergent gauge field. Our main conclusions are: (i) topological orders can exist at finite temperatures, (ii) relativistic liquids of topological defects can also exist as stable phases at finite temperatures, and (iii) there are two universality classes of instanton suppression. We also relate the instanton dynamics to the problem of the pseudogap state in underdoped cuprates. A universal experimental signature of the instanton deconfinement transition is a change of the quantum noise spectrum, which can perhaps be measured in some situations, for example via a quantum anomaly, or indirectly detected with a specific heat jump. The method of analysis is a functional renormalization group that generalizes the Coulomb gas treatment of Kosterlitz and Thouless to arbitrary interactions and dimensions. In particular, we construct an exact non-perturbative technique for confining interactions between instantons, which introduce irreparable infra-red divergences in the standard perturbative approaches.</description>

      <title>Pseudogap phases, chiral anomaly and topological order with quantum loop entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.01493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A many-body quantum system whose topological defects are conserved, abundant and mobile is a correlated quantum liquid. Since topological defects can be classified by homotopy groups, each homotopy identifies a class of quantum liquids. Here we explore the quantum liquids based on the $\pi_3(S^2)$ homotopy group, i.e. Hopf fibration. Their topologically non-trivial dynamics emerges from the interlinking between magnetic flux or skyrmion loops in the charge and spin sectors respectively. We lay down a field theory foundation for analyzing such states by naturally incorporating the well-known framing regularization into the theory, and constructing the appropriate topological Lagrangian terms. We show that at least two strongly correlated phases of interlinked loops can exist in $d=3$ spatial dimensions at zero and low finite temperatures. These phases are closely related to the chiral quantum anomaly and do not have an obvious topological order, but they are distinguished from the trivial disordered phase with a generalization of the Wilson loop operator. In $d=4$ spatial dimensions, interlinked loops are able to produce topological order at zero temperature, featuring charge, angular momentum and braiding fractionalization. We discuss some possible experimental signatures of loop entanglement in the quantum noise of charge currents.</description>

      <title>Nematic Superconductivity and Its Critical Vestigial Phases in the Quasi-crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a general mechanism to realize nematic superconductivity (SC) and reveal its exotic vestigial phases in the quasi-crystal (QC). Starting from a Penrose Hubbard model, our microscopic studies suggest that the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism driven SC in the QC is usually gapless due to violation of Anderson's theorem, rendering that both chiral and nematic SCs are common. The nematic SC in the QC can support novel vestigial phases driven by pairing phase fluctuations above its $T_c$. Our combined renormalization group and Monte-Carlo studies provide a phase diagram in which, besides the conventional charge-4e SC, two critical vestigial phases emerge, i.e. the quasi-nematic (Q-N) SC and Q-N metal. In the two Q-N phases, the discrete lattice rotation symmetry is counter-intuitively ``quasi-broken'' with power-law decaying orientation correlation. They separate the phase diagram into various phases connected via Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions. These remarkable critical vestigial phases, which resemble the intermediate BKT phase in the $q$-state ($q\ge 5$) clock model, are consequence of the five- (or higher-) fold anisotropy field brought about by the unique QC symmetry, which are absent in conventional crystalline materials.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic pseudogap in the two-dimensional Hubbard model deep in the renormalized classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11803v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Long-wavelength spin fluctuations prohibit antiferromagnetic long-range order at finite temperature in two dimensions. Nevertheless, the correlation length starts to grow rapidly at a crossover temperature, leading to critical slowing down and to a renormalized-classical regime over a wide range of temperature, between a fraction of the mean-field transition temperature and the zero-temperature ordered state. This leads to a single-particle pseudogap of the kind observed in electron-doped cuprates. Very few theoretical methods can claim an accurate description of this regime. The challenge is that in this regime Fermi-liquid quasiparticles are already destroyed and new quasiparticles of the ordered state are not fully formed yet. Here, we study this problem for the two-dimensional Hubbard model by first generalizing the two-particle self-consistent approach. Using a special algorithm, spin fluctuations are treated in the thermodynamic limit even for large correlation lengths. The effects of Kanamori-Br\"uckner screening, of classical and of quantum fluctuations are taken into account. Results are presented at half-filling for the one-band Hubbard model with nearest-neighbor hopping. They agree well with available benchmark diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo at high temperature where the pseudogap opens up. In addition to temperature-dependent spectral properties, we find quantum corrections to the zero-temperature renormalized mean-field antiferromagnetic gap. Finally, analytic continuation of the Matsubara results for spectral functions show that the pseudogap opens up at significantly higher temperature than was previously identified based on the Matsubara data only.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a minimal model of interacting fermions establishing a ferromagnetic insulating phase. It is based on the Hubbard model on a trimerized triangular lattice in the regime of $U\gg t\gg |t^\prime|$ with $t&gt;0$ and $t^\prime$ the intra- and inter-trimer hopping amplitudes, respectively. At the $\frac{1}{3}$-filling, each trimer becomes a triplet spin-1 moment, and the inter-trimer superexchange is ferromagnetic with $J =- \frac{2}{27}\frac{t^{\prime 2}}{t}$ in the limit of $U/t=+\infty$. As $U/t$ becomes finite, the antiferromagnetic superexchange competes with the ferromagnetic one. The system enters into a frustrated antiferromagnetic insulator when $\lambda&gt;U/t\gg 1$ where $\lambda \sim 10$. In contrast, a similar analysis performed on the trimerized Kagome lattice shows that only antiferromagnetic superchange exits at 1/3-filling.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field studies of Wigner crystal transitions in various interacting two-dimensional systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we theoretically study Wigner crystal (WC) transitions in various interacting two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) models, including both conventional 2DEG model and ``$n$-order" Dirac fermion models with energy-momentum dispersion $E_{\mathbf{k}} \sim k^n$, with $n$ being positive integer. A general ``$GW$+RPA" framework to treat single-particle spectra and ground-state energies in 2D systems has been developed. Within such a framework, we first calculate the single-particle excitation spectra of a conventional 2DEG system with $GW$ approximation for both Wigner-crystal state and Fermi-liquid (FL) state, in which the frequency dependent dielectric function is treated using a multiple-plasma-pole approach. Then, the correlation energy with random phase approximation (RPA) is further calculated based on the $GW$ single-particle spectra. By comparing the total energies of WC and FL states, our $GW$+RPA approach gives a critical Wigner-Seitz radius $r_s^*\sim 19.2$ for the WC transition in conventional 2DEG system. We then apply such $GW$+RPA method to single-flavor $n$-order Dirac fermion models, unveiling the unique single-particle excitation spectra in these models. We further find that charge fluctuations would de-stabilize the presumable WC states, including both topologically trivial and nontrivial WC states. Our method can be readily applied to other interacting 2D systems described by continuum models such as moir\'e superlattices.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian skin effects and fragmented condensates in an integrable dissipative Bose-Hubbard model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10261v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strongly interacting non-equilibrium systems are of great fundamental interest, yet their inherent complexity make then notoriously hard to analyze. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model, which by itself evades solvability, can be solved exactly at any interaction strength in the presence of loss tuned to a rate matching the hopping amplitude. Remarkably, the full solvability of the corresponding Liouvillian, and the integrability of the pertinent effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, survives the addition of disorder and generic boundary conditions. By analyzing the Bethe ansatz solutions we find that even weak interactions change the qualitative features of the system, leading to an intricate dynamical phase diagram featuring non-Hermitian Mott-skin effects, disorder induced localization, highly degenerate exceptional points, and a Bose glass-like phase of fragmented condensates. We discuss realistic implementations of this model with cold atoms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

      <title>Interacting holes in a gated WSe$_2$ quantum channel: valley correlations and zigzag Wigner crystal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08655v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory of interacting valence holes in a gate-defined one-dimensional quantum channel in a single layer of a transition metal dichalcogenide material WSe$_2$. Based on a microscopic atomistic tight-binding model and Hartree-Fock and exact configuration-interaction tools we demonstrate the possibility of symmetry-broken valley polarized states for strongly interacting holes. The interplay between interactions, perpendicular magnetic field, and the lateral confinement asymmetry together with the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling present in WSe$_2$ material is analyzed, and its impact on valley polarization is discussed. For weaker interactions, an investigation of the pair correlation function reveals a valley-antiferromagnetic phase. For low hole densities, a formation of a zigzag Wigner crystal phase is predicted. The impact of various hole liquid phases on transport in a high mobility quasi-one dimensional channel is discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08449v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To explore the influence of quantum-geometric effects on the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length in a dilute flat-band superconductor, we adopt a BCS-BEC crossover approach to the multiband pyrochlore-Hubbard model near the critical temperature for superconductivity. Our self-consistent formulation for this three-dimensional lattice benchmarks very well against the so-called zero-temperature coherence length, demonstrating the monotonic decay of the coherence length to zero as the interaction strength increases. Additionally, we show that the effective mass of the many-body bound states (i.e., Cooper pairs) is nearly identical to that of the lowest-lying two-body bound states in the dilute flat-band limit.</description>
