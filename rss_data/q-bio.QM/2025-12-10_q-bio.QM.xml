      <title>A Semi-Supervised Inf-Net Framework for CT-Based Lung Nodule Analysis with a Conceptual Extension Toward Genomic Integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lung cancer is a primary contributor to cancer-related mortality globally, highlighting the necessity for precise early detection of pulmonary nodules through low-dose CT (LDCT) imaging. Deep learning methods have improved nodule detection and classification; however, their performance is frequently limited by the availability of annotated data and variability among imaging centers. This research presents a CT-driven, semi-supervised framework utilizing the Inf-Net architecture to enhance lung nodule analysis with minimal annotation. The model incorporates multi-scale feature aggregation, Reverse Attention refinement, and pseudo-labeling to efficiently utilize unlabeled CT slices. Experiments conducted on subsets of the LUNA16 dataset indicate that the supervised Inf-Net attains a score of 0.825 on 10,000 labeled slices. In contrast, the semi-supervised variant achieves a score of 0.784 on 20,000 slices that include both labeled and pseudo-labeled data, thus surpassing its supervised baseline of 0.755. This study presents a conceptual framework for the integration of genomic biomarkers with CT-derived features, facilitating the development of future multimodal, biologically informed CAD systems. The proposed semi-supervised Inf-Net framework improves CT-based lung nodule assessment and lays the groundwork for flexible multi-omics diagnostic models.</description>

      <title>Understanding the temperature response of biological systems: From empirical fits to mechanistic frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Virtually every biological rate changes with temperature, but the mechanisms underlying these responses differ between different processes. Here, we bring together the main theoretical approaches used to describe temperature-rate relationships, ranging from empirical curve shapes to reaction-level kinetics and network-based dynamical frameworks. These models highlight how temperature influences not only the speed of elementary reactions, but also the behavior that emerges when many reactions interact through regulation, feedback, or stochastic transitions. By outlining the assumptions and implications of each perspective, we aim to clarify how different modeling strategies connect molecular processes to physiological temperature response curves and to point toward integrative frameworks that can better explain the diversity of biological thermal responses.</description>

      <title>Subcellular proteome niche discovery using semi-supervised functional clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracellular compartmentalization of proteins underpins their function and the metabolic processes they sustain. Various mass spectrometry-based proteomics methods (subcellular spatial proteomics) now allow high throughput subcellular protein localization. Yet, the curation, analysis and interpretation of these data remain challenging, particularly in non-model organisms where establishing reliable marker proteins is difficult, and in contexts where experimental replication and subcellular fractionation are constrained. Here, we develop FSPmix, a semi-supervised functional clustering method implemented as an open-source R package, which leverages partial annotations from a subset of marker proteins to predict protein subcellular localization from subcellular spatial proteomics data. This method explicitly assumes that protein signatures vary smoothly across subcellular fractions, enabling more robust inference under low signal-to-noise data regimes. We applied FSPmix to a subcellular proteomics dataset from a marine diatom, allowing us to assign probabilistic localizations to proteins and uncover potentially new protein functions. Altogether, this work lays the foundation for more robust statistical analysis and interpretation of subcellular proteomics datasets, particularly in understudied organisms.</description>

      <title>Spatially-extended Flow Phixer (SpeF-Phixer): A Spatially Extended $\varphi$-Mixing Framework for Gene Regulatory Causal Inference in Spatial Gene Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background and objective: Spatial transcriptomics provides rich spatial context but lacks sufficient resolution for large-scale causal inference. We developed SpeF-Phixer, a spatially extended phi-mixing framework integrating whole-slide image (WSI)-derived spatial cell distributions with mapped scRNA-seq expression fields to infer directed gene regulatory triplets with spatial coherence. Methods: Using CD103/CD8-immunostained colorectal cancer WSIs and publicly available scRNA-seq datasets, spatial gene fields were constructed around mapped cells and discretized for signed phi-mixing computation. Pairwise dependencies, directional signs, and triplet structures were evaluated through kNN-based neighborhood screening and bootstrap consensus inference. Mediation and convergence were distinguished using generalized additive models (GAMs), with spatial validity assessed by real-null comparisons and database-backed direction checks. Results: Across tissue patches, the pipeline reduced approximately 3.6x10^4 triplet candidates to a reproducible consensus set (approximately 3x10^2 per patch). The downstream edge (Y to Z) showed significant directional bias consistent with curated regulatory databases. Spatial path tracing demonstrated markedly higher coherence for real triplets than for null controls, indicating that inferred chains represent biologically instantiated regulatory flows. Conclusion: SpeF-Phixer extracts spatially coherent, directionally consistent gene regulatory triplets from histological images. This framework bridges single-cell molecular profiles with microenvironmental organization and provides a scalable foundation for constructing spatially informed causal gene networks.</description>

      <title>BeeTLe: An Imbalance-Aware Deep Sequence Model for Linear B-Cell Epitope Prediction and Classification with Logit-Adjusted Losses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The process of identifying and characterizing B-cell epitopes, which are the portions of antigens recognized by antibodies, is important for our understanding of the immune system, and for many applications including vaccine development, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Computational epitope prediction is challenging yet rewarding as it significantly reduces the time and cost of laboratory work. Most of the existing tools do not have satisfactory performance and only discriminate epitopes from non-epitopes. This paper presents a new deep learning-based multi-task framework for linear B-cell epitope prediction as well as antibody type-specific epitope classification. Specifically, a sequenced-based neural network model using recurrent layers and Transformer blocks is developed. We propose an amino acid encoding method based on eigen decomposition to help the model learn the representations of epitopes. We introduce modifications to standard cross-entropy loss functions by extending a logit adjustment technique to cope with the class imbalance. Experimental results on data curated from the largest public epitope database demonstrate the validity of the proposed methods and the superior performance compared to competing ones.</description>

      <title>Ultra-large library screening with an evolutionary algorithm in Rosetta (REvoLd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultra-large make-on-demand compound libraries now contain billions of readily available compounds. This represents a golden opportunity for in-silico drug discovery. One challenge, however, is the time and computational cost of an exhaustive screen of such large libraries when receptor flexibility is taken into account. We propose an evolutionary algorithm to search combinatorial make-on-demand chemical space efficiently without enumerating all molecules. We exploit the feature of make-on-demand compound libraries, namely that they are constructed from lists of substrates and chemical reactions. Our algorithm RosettaEvolutionaryLigand (REvoLd) explores the vast search space of combinatorial libraries for protein-ligand docking with full ligand and receptor flexibility through RosettaLigand. A benchmark of REvoLd on five drug targets showed improvements in hit rates by factors between 869 and 1622 compared to random selections. REvoLd is available as an application within the Rosetta software suite (https://docs.rosettacommons.org/docs/latest/revold). This work formulates an evolutionary algorithm for optimization and exploration of ultra-large make-on-demand libraries. We demonstrate that our approach results in strong and stable enrichment, offering the most efficient algorithm for drug discovery in ultra-large chemical space to date.</description>

      <title>AI-powered virtual tissues from spatial proteomics for clinical diagnostics and biomedical discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial proteomics technologies have transformed our understanding of complex tissue architecture in cancer but present unique challenges for computational analysis. Each study uses a different marker panel and protocol, and most methods are tailored to single cohorts, which limits knowledge transfer and robust biomarker discovery. Here we present Virtual Tissues (VirTues), a general-purpose foundation model for spatial proteomics that learns marker-aware, multi-scale representations of proteins, cells, niches and tissues directly from multiplex imaging data. From a single pretrained backbone, VirTues supports marker reconstruction, cell typing and niche annotation, spatial biomarker discovery, and patient stratification, including zero-shot annotation across heterogeneous panels and datasets. In triple-negative breast cancer, VirTues-derived biomarkers predict anti-PD-L1 chemo-immunotherapy response and stratify disease-free survival in an independent cohort, outperforming state-of-the-art biomarkers derived from the same datasets and current clinical stratification schemes.</description>

      <title>SSRCA: a novel machine learning pipeline to perform sensitivity analysis for agent-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00168v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in biology to understand how individual actions scale into emergent population behavior. Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the Simulate, Summarize, Reduce, Cluster, and Analyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA identifies four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. Additionally, we compare the SA results between SSRCA and the popular Sobol' Method and find that SSRCA's identified sensitive parameters are robust to the choice of model descriptors while Sobol's are not. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA Methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.</description>

      <title>Prot2Token: A Unified Framework for Protein Modeling via Next-Token Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The diverse nature of protein prediction tasks has traditionally necessitated specialized models, hindering the development of broadly applicable and computationally efficient Protein Language Models (PLMs). In this work, we introduce Prot2Token, a unified framework that overcomes these challenges by converting a wide spectrum of protein-related predictions-from sequence-level properties and residue-specific attributes to complex inter-protein interactions-into a standardized next-token prediction format. At its core, Prot2Token employs an autoregressive decoder, conditioned on embeddings from pre-trained protein encoders and guided by learnable task tokens, to perform diverse predictions. This architecture uniquely facilitates multi-task learning, enabling general-purpose decoders to generalize across five distinct categories. We present extensive experimental validation across a variety of benchmarks, demonstrating Prot2Token's predictive power in different types of protein-prediction tasks. In 3D structure prediction, Prot2Token delivers substantial speedups (up to 1000x faster than AlphaFold2 with MSA on the same hardware) while, across other numerous tasks, matching or surpassing specialized methods. Beyond that, we introduce an auxiliary self-supervised decoder pre-training approach to improve spatially sensitive task performance. Prot2Token thus offers a step towards standardizing biological prediction into a generative interface, promising to accelerate biological discovery and the development of novel therapeutics. The code is available at https://github.com/mahdip72/prot2token .</description>
