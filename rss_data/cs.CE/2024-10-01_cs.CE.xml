      <title>Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems: A compositional electro-magneto hydrodynamics model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics plays a crucial role in various multiphysics applications, including energy systems, electronics cooling, and biomedical engineering. Developing computational models for complex coupled systems can be challenging and time-consuming. In particular, ensuring the consistent integration of models from diverse physical domains requires meticulous attention. Even if the coupling of specialized simulation tools based on different formalisms were practically feasible, the growing demand to combine first-principles-based modeling with scientific machine learning necessitates an integrated high-level approach to model specification. Considering the example of electro-magneto hydrodynamics (on a fixed spatial domain and with linear polarization and magnetization), this article demonstrates how relatively complex models can be hierarchically composed from simpler parts by means of a formal language for multiphysics modeling. The Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS) modeling language features a simple graphical syntax for expressing the energy-based interconnection of subsystems. This reduces cognitive load and facilitates communication, especially in multidisciplinary environments. As the example demonstrates, existing models can be easily integrated as subsystems of new models. Specifically, the ideal fluid model is used as a subsystem of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier fluid model, which in turn is used as a subsystem of the electro-magneto hydrodynamics model. The compositional approach makes it nearly trivial to encapsulate, reuse, and swap out (parts of) models. Moreover, structural properties of EPHS models guarantee fundamental properties of thermodynamic systems, such as conservation of energy, non-negative entropy production, and Onsager reciprocal relations.</description>

      <title>Hybridized Projected Differential Transform Method For collisional-breakage equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-linear collision induced fragmentation plays a crucial role in modeling several engineering and physical problems. In contrast to linear breakage, it has not been thoroughly investigated in the existing literature. This study introduces an innovative method that leverages the Elzaki integral transform as a preparatory step to enhance the accuracy and convergence of domain decomposition, used alongside the projected differential transform method to obtain closed-form or series approximations of solutions for the collisional breakage equation (CBE). A significant advantages of this technique is its capability to directly address both linear and nonlinear differential equations without the need for discretization or linearization. The mathematical framework is reinforced by a thorough convergence analysis, applying fixed point theory within an adequately defined Banach space. Additionally, error estimates for the approximated solutions are derived, offering more profound insights into the accuracy and dependability of the proposed method. The validity of this approach is demonstrated by comparing the obtained results with exact or finite volume approximated solutions considering several physical examples. Interestingly, the proposed algorithm yields accurate approximations for the number density functions as well as moments with fewer terms and maintains higher precision over extended time periods.</description>

      <title>Modeling Turbulence in the Atmospheric Boundary Layer with Spectral Element and Finite Volume Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present large-eddy-simulation (LES) modeling approaches for the simulation of atmospheric boundary layer turbulence that are of direct relevance to wind energy production. In this paper, we study a GABLS benchmark problem using high-order spectral element code Nek5000/RS and a block-structured second-order finite-volume code AMR-Wind which are supported under the DOE's Exascale Computing Project (ECP) Center for Efficient Exascale Discretizations (CEED) and ExaWind projects, respectively, targeting application simulations on various acceleration-device based exascale computing platforms. As for Nek5000/RS we demonstrate our newly developed subgrid-scale (SGS) models based on mean-field eddy viscosity (MFEV), high-pass filter (HPF), and Smagorinsky (SMG) with traction boundary conditions. For the traction boundary conditions, a novel analytical approach is presented that solves for the surface friction velocity and surface kinematic temperature flux. For AMR-Wind, standard SMG is used and discussed in detail the traction boundary conditions for convergence. We provide low-order statistics, convergence and turbulent structure analysis. Verification and convergence studies were performed for both codes at various resolutions and it was found that Nek5000/RS demonstrate convergence with resolution for all ABL bulk parameters, including boundary layer and low level jet (LLJ) height. Extensive comparisons are presented with simulation data from the literature.</description>

Abstract: A spectral-element-based formulation of incompressible MHD is presented in the context of the open-source fluid-thermal code, Nek5000/RS. The formulation supports magnetic fields in a solid domain that surrounds the fluid domain. Several steady-state and time-transient model problems are presented as part of the code verification process.

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cloud computing has transformed the way organizations manage and scale their IT infrastructure by offering flexible, scalable, and cost-effective solutions. However, the Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model faces performance challenges primarily due to the limitations imposed by virtualization technology. This paper focuses on designing an effective virtualization technique for IaaS, aiming to improve infrastructure-level performance. Through a systematic literature review and a design, development, and evaluation approach, various virtualization techniques such as full virtualization, paravirtualization, and hardware-assisted virtualization are explored. The study also considers the role of hypervisors like Xen, KVM, and VMware ESXi in improving performance. The proposed solution seeks to optimize resource utilization, minimize latency, and enhance overall throughput in IaaS environments. Finally, the research discusses the potential application of this virtualization technique for public cloud computing solutions tailored for Ethiopian Small and Medium Enterprises (ESMEs) using platforms like Amazon EC2.</description>

      <title>The eBPF Runtime in the Linux Kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (\sys) is a runtime that enables users to load programs into the operating system (OS) kernel, like Linux or Windows, and execute them safely and efficiently at designated kernel hooks. Each program passes through a verifier that reasons about the safety guarantees for execution. Hosting a safe virtual machine runtime within the kernel makes it dynamically programmable. Unlike the popular approach of bypassing or completely replacing the kernel, \sys gives users the flexibility to modify the kernel on the fly, rapidly experiment and iterate, and deploy solutions to achieve their workload-specific needs, while working in concert with the kernel.
  In this paper, we present the first comprehensive description of the design and implementation of the \sys runtime in the Linux kernel. We argue that \sys today provides a mature and safe programming environment for the kernel. It has seen wide adoption since its inception and is increasingly being used not just to extend, but program entire components of the kernel, while preserving its runtime integrity. We outline the compelling advantages it offers for real-world production usage, and illustrate current use cases. Finally, we identify its key challenges, and discuss possible future directions.</description>

      <title>EnzymeFlow: Generating Reaction-specific Enzyme Catalytic Pockets through Flow Matching and Co-Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzyme design is a critical area in biotechnology, with applications ranging from drug development to synthetic biology. Traditional methods for enzyme function prediction or protein binding pocket design often fall short in capturing the dynamic and complex nature of enzyme-substrate interactions, particularly in catalytic processes. To address the challenges, we introduce EnzymeFlow, a generative model that employs flow matching with hierarchical pre-training and enzyme-reaction co-evolution to generate catalytic pockets for specific substrates and catalytic reactions. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale, curated, and validated dataset of enzyme-reaction pairs, specifically designed for the catalytic pocket generation task, comprising a total of $328,192$ pairs. By incorporating evolutionary dynamics and reaction-specific adaptations, EnzymeFlow becomes a powerful model for designing enzyme pockets, which is capable of catalyzing a wide range of biochemical reactions. Experiments on the new dataset demonstrate the model's effectiveness in designing high-quality, functional enzyme catalytic pockets, paving the way for advancements in enzyme engineering and synthetic biology. We provide EnzymeFlow code at https://github.com/WillHua127/EnzymeFlow with notebook demonstration at https://github.com/WillHua127/EnzymeFlow/blob/main/enzymeflow_demo.ipynb.</description>

      <title>KANOP: A Data-Efficient Option Pricing Model using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the recently proposed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we introduce the KAN-based Option Pricing (KANOP) model to value American-style options, building on the conventional Least Square Monte Carlo (LSMC) algorithm. KANs, which are based on Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, offer a data-efficient alternative to traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons, requiring fewer hidden layers to achieve a higher level of performance. By leveraging the flexibility of KANs, KANOP provides a learnable alternative to the conventional set of basis functions used in the LSMC model, allowing the model to adapt to the pricing task and effectively estimate the expected continuation value. Using examples of standard American and Asian-American options, we demonstrate that KANOP produces more reliable option value estimates, both for single-dimensional cases and in more complex scenarios involving multiple input variables. The delta estimated by the KANOP model is also more accurate than that obtained using conventional basis functions, which is crucial for effective option hedging. Graphical illustrations further validate KANOP's ability to accurately model the expected continuation value for American-style options.</description>

      <title>FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14688v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The fast simulation of dynamical systems is a key challenge in many scientific and engineering applications, such as weather forecasting, disease control, and drug discovery. With the recent success of deep learning, there is increasing interest in using neural networks to solve differential equations in a data-driven manner. However, existing methods are either limited to specific types of differential equations or require large amounts of data for training. This restricts their practicality in many real-world applications, where data is often scarce or expensive to obtain. To address this, we propose a novel multi-modal foundation model, named \textbf{FMint} (\textbf{F}oundation \textbf{M}odel based on \textbf{In}i\textbf{t}ialization), to bridge the gap between human-designed and data-driven models for the fast simulation of dynamical systems. Built on a decoder-only transformer architecture with in-context learning, FMint utilizes both numerical and textual data to learn a universal error correction scheme for dynamical systems, using prompted sequences of coarse solutions from traditional solvers. The model is pre-trained on a corpus of 40K ODEs, and we perform extensive experiments on challenging ODEs that exhibit chaotic behavior and of high dimensionality. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in terms of both accuracy and efficiency compared to classical numerical solvers, highlighting FMint's potential as a general-purpose solver for dynamical systems. Our approach achieves an accuracy improvement of 1 to 2 orders of magnitude over state-of-the-art dynamical system simulators, and delivers a 5X speedup compared to traditional numerical algorithms. The code for FMint is available at \url{https://github.com/margotyjx/FMint}.</description>

      <title>ReactZyme: A Benchmark for Enzyme-Reaction Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Enzymes, with their specific catalyzed reactions, are necessary for all aspects of life, enabling diverse biological processes and adaptations. Predicting enzyme functions is essential for understanding biological pathways, guiding drug development, enhancing bioproduct yields, and facilitating evolutionary studies. Addressing the inherent complexities, we introduce a new approach to annotating enzymes based on their catalyzed reactions. This method provides detailed insights into specific reactions and is adaptable to newly discovered reactions, diverging from traditional classifications by protein family or expert-derived reaction classes. We employ machine learning algorithms to analyze enzyme reaction datasets, delivering a much more refined view on the functionality of enzymes. Our evaluation leverages the largest enzyme-reaction dataset to date, derived from the SwissProt and Rhea databases with entries up to January 8, 2024. We frame the enzyme-reaction prediction as a retrieval problem, aiming to rank enzymes by their catalytic ability for specific reactions. With our model, we can recruit proteins for novel reactions and predict reactions in novel proteins, facilitating enzyme discovery and function annotation (https://github.com/WillHua127/ReactZyme).</description>
