      <title>Lipschitz extensions of linear operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $E, F, E_0$ be Banach spaces, with $E_0$ a subspace of $E$. For a maximal Banach operator ideal $\mathcal{A}$, we show that a linear operator from $E_0$ to $F$ can be extended to a linear operator from $E$ to $F$ that belongs to $\mathcal{A}$ if and only if it can be extended to a Lipschitz map from $E$ to $F$ belonging to a wide class of Lipschitz Banach operator ideals related with $\mathcal{A}$. As a consequence, we show that linear operators with special Lipschitz factorization through $\ell_{\infty}(\Gamma)$ has analogous linear factorization through $\ell_{\infty}(\Gamma)$.</description>

      <title>Analytic Schur multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study in this paper analytic Schur multipliers on ${\Bbb C}_+^2$ and ${\Bbb D}^2$, i.e. Schur multipliers on ${\Bbb R}^2$ and ${\Bbb T}^2$ that are boundary-value functions of functions analytic in ${\Bbb C}_+^2$ and ${\Bbb D}^2$. Such Schur multipliers are important when studying properties of functions of maximal dissipative operators and contractions under perturbation. We show that if the boundary-value function of a Schur multiplier has certain regularity properties, then it can be represented as an element of the Haagerup tensor product of spaces of analytic functions with similar regularity properties.</description>

      <title>The invariant subspace problem and Rosenblum operators I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $T\in B(\mathcal{H})$ be an invertible operator. From the 1940's, Gelfand, Hille and Wermer investigated the invariant subspaces of $T$ by analyzing the growth of $\|T^n\|$, where $n\in \mathbb{Z}$. In this paper, we study the invariant subspaces of $T$ by estimating the growth of $\|T^n+\lambda T^{-n}\|$, where $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\lambda$ is a nonzero complex constant. The key ingredient of our approach is introducing the notion of shift representation operators, which is based on the Rosenblum operators. In addition, by employing shift representation operators, we provide an equivalent of the Invariant Subspace Problem via the injectivity of certain Hankel operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A characterization of the matrix representation of the compressed shift acting on a finite-dimensional model space endowed with the Takenaka-Malmquist-Walsh basis, among all upper triangular matrices, is proved. For a fixed dimension, this matrix is the unique matrix with spectral norm no greater than one and with a prescribed diagonal and superdiagonal. We also discuss an extension to the setting of infinite matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proper classes of extensions of real field was defined and topological properties of these extensions were studied. These extensions can be connected, in this case such set is not closed under binary operations (addition and multiplication), and not connected, in this case this extension is linearly ordered field. In the future these constructions can be applied to building measure that "feels" set of zero Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <title>The Hexablock: a domain associated with the $\mu$-synthesis in $M_2(\mathbb C)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a new domain in $\mathbb C^4$, namely the hexablock $\mathbb{H}$ that arises in connection with a special case of the $\mu$-synthesis problem in $M_2(\mathbb C)$. Previous attempts to study a few instances of the $\mu$-synthesis problem led to domains such as symmetrized bidisc $\mathbb G_2$, tetrablock $\mathbb E$ and pentablock $\mathbb P$. Throughout, the relations of $\mathbb{H}$ with these three domains are explored. Several characterizations of the hexablock are established. We determine the distinguished boundary $b \mathbb{H}$ of $\mathbb{H}$ and obtain a subgroup of the automorphism group of $\mathbb{H}$. The \textit{rational $\overline{\mathbb{H}}$-inner functions}, i.e., the rational functions from the unit disc $\mathbb{D}$ to $\mathbb{H}$ that map the boundary of $\mathbb{D}$ to $b\mathbb{H}$ are characterized. We obtain a Schwarz lemma for $\mathbb{H}$. Finally, it is shown that $\mathbb{G}_2$, $\mathbb{E}$, and $\mathbb{P}$ are analytic retracts of $\mathbb{H}$. By an application of the theory of the hexablock, we find alternative proofs to a few existing results on geometry and function theory of the pentablock.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is an introduction to measure theory, integration and function spaces, with all the needed preliminaries included, and with some applications included as well. We first discuss some basic motivations, coming from discrete probability, that we develop in detail, as a preliminary to general measure theory. Then we discuss measure theory, integration and function spaces, all developed in a standard way, and with emphasis on the explicit computation of various integrals. Finally, we come back to probability, discrete and continuous, with a more advanced discussion, of quantum flavor.</description>

Abstract: This paper is devoted to a kind of rearrangement of functions on noncollapsed RCD(k,n)-spaces, which satisfy a Polya-Szego type inequality. This allows to prove functional inequalities on a wide class of manifolds, that we describe. As a consequence, we give a characterization, among manifolds with lower bounded Ricci curvature, of those admitting a Moser-Trudinger type inequality</description>

      <title>Multi-Window Approaches for Direct and Stable STFT Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Phase retrieval from phaseless short-time Fourier transform (STFT) measurements is known to be inherently unstable when measurements are taken with respect to a single window. While an explicit inversion formula exists, it is useless in practice due to its instability. In this paper, we overcome this lack of stability by presenting two multi-window approaches that rely on a "good coverage" of the time-frequency plane by the ambiguity functions of the windows. The first is to use the fractional Fourier transform of a dilated Gauss function with various angles as window functions. The essential support of a superposition of the ambiguity function from such window functions is of a "daffodil shape", which converges to a large disc as more angles are used, yielding a much broader coverage in the time-frequency domain. The second approach uses Hermite functions of various degrees as the window functions. The larger the degree, the wider the ambiguity function but with zeros on circles in the time-frequency domain. Combining Hermite functions of different degrees, we can achieve a wide coverage with zeros compensated by the essential support of the ambiguity function from other Hermite windows. Taking advantage of these multi-window procedures, we can stably perform STFT phase retrieval using the direct inversion formula.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap Between Approximation and Learning via Optimal Approximation by ReLU MLPs of Maximal Regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The foundations of deep learning are supported by the seemingly opposing perspectives of approximation or learning theory. The former advocates for large/expressive models that need not generalize, while the latter considers classes that generalize but may be too small/constrained to be universal approximators. Motivated by real-world deep learning implementations that are both expressive and statistically reliable, we ask: "Is there a class of neural networks that is both large enough to be universal but structured enough to generalize?" This paper constructively provides a positive answer to this question by identifying a highly structured class of ReLU multilayer perceptions (MLPs), which are optimal function approximators and are statistically well-behaved. We show that any $(L,\alpha)$-H\"{o}lder function from $[0,1]^d$ to $[-n,n]$ can be approximated to a uniform $\mathcal{O}(1/n)$ error on $[0,1]^d$ with a sparsely connected ReLU MLP with the same H\"{o}lder exponent $\alpha$ and coefficient $L$, of width $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$, depth $\mathcal{O}(\log(d))$, with $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/\alpha})$ nonzero parameters, and whose weights and biases take values in $\{0,\pm 1/2\}$ except in the first and last layers which instead have magnitude at-most $n$. Further, our class of MLPs achieves a near-optimal sample complexity of $\mathcal{O}(\log(N)/\sqrt{N})$ when given $N$ i.i.d. normalized sub-Gaussian training samples. We achieve this by fitting together linear pieces perfectly via the Kuhn triangulation, and we introduce a new proof technique which shows that our construction preserves the regularity of not only the H\"{o}lder functions, but also any uniformly continuous function. Our results imply that neural networks can solve the McShane extension problem on suitable finite sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19002v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a simplified (coarse) version of pseudo-differential calculus for operators of order zero on complete Riemannian manifolds. This calculus works for the usual Hormander (1,0) class of operators, as well as for pseudo-differential operators on filtered manifolds. In fact, we develop the coarse PDO calculus on a more general class of manifolds which we call manifolds with a tangent Lie structure. We prove an index theorem for `h-elliptic' operators where the index is not just an integer, but an element of the K-homology group of the manifold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01190v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Wasserstein barycenter problem in the setting of non-compact, non-smooth extended metric measure spaces. We introduce a couple of new concepts and obtain the existence, uniqueness, absolute continuity of the Wasserstein barycenter, and prove Jensen's inequality in an abstract framework.
  This generalized several results on Euclidean space, Riemannian manifolds and Alexandrov spaces, to metric measure spaces satisfying Riemannian Curvature-Dimension condition \`a la Lott--Sturm--Villani, and some extended metric measure spaces including abstract Wiener spaces and configuration spaces over Riemannian manifolds.
  We also introduce a new curvature-dimesion condition, we call Barycenter-Curvature-Dimension condition. We prove its stability under measured-Gromov--Hausdorff convergence and prove the existence of the Wasserstein barycenter under this new condition. In addition, we get some geometric inequalities including a multi-marginal Brunn--Minkowski inequality and a functional Blaschke--Santal\'o type inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the well-posedness and stability of an impedance passive infinite-dimensional linear system under nonlinear feedback of the form $u(t)=\phi(v(t)-y(t))$, where $\phi$ is a monotone function. Our first main result introduces conditions guaranteeing the existence of classical and generalised solutions in a situation where the original linear system is well-posed. In the absence of the external input $v$ we establish the existence of strong and generalised solutions under strictly weaker conditions. Finally, we introduce conditions guaranteeing that the origin is a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium point of the closed-loop system. Motivated by the analysis of partial differential equations with nonlinear boundary conditions, we use our results to investigate the well-posedness and stablility of abstract boundary control systems, port-Hamiltonian systems, a Timoshenko beam model, and a two-dimensional boundary controlled heat equation.</description>

      <title>Optimal Scheduling of Dynamic Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Flow-based methods for sampling and generative modeling use continuous-time dynamical systems to represent a {transport map} that pushes forward a source measure to a target measure. The introduction of a time axis provides considerable design freedom, and a central question is how to exploit this freedom. Though many popular methods seek straight line (i.e., zero acceleration) trajectories, we show here that a specific class of ``curved'' trajectories can significantly improve approximation and learning. In particular, we consider the unit-time interpolation of any given transport map $T$ and seek the schedule $\tau: [0,1] \to [0,1]$ that minimizes the spatial Lipschitz constant of the corresponding velocity field over all times $t \in [0,1]$. This quantity is crucial as it allows for control of the approximation error when the velocity field is learned from data. We show that, for a broad class of source/target measures and transport maps $T$, the \emph{optimal schedule} can be computed in closed form, and that the resulting optimal Lipschitz constant is \emph{exponentially smaller} than that induced by an identity schedule (corresponding to, for instance, the Wasserstein geodesic). Our proof technique relies on the calculus of variations and $\Gamma$-convergence, allowing us to approximate the aforementioned degenerate objective by a family of smooth, tractable problems.</description>
