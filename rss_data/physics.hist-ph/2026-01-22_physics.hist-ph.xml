      <title>The burden of Fundamentality: Metaphysical ambiguities and the issue of Superdeterminism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we approach the problem of superdeterminism from a novel point of view, highlighting its character as a more metaphysical than scientific proposition. First, we introduce a distinction between two types of superdeterministic theories, na\"ive (NSD) and metaphysical (MSD), and argue how NSD presents significant epistemic flaws. We show how NSD justifies itself through claims to fundamentality, thus connoting itself as a metaphysical theory rather than a scientific one. We finally illustrate that the most developed MSD model so far, Invariant Set Theory, implicitly proposes a confused form of priority monism. Our paper thus reinforces the thesis that theories should demonstrate rather than assume fundamentality and that it is methodologically flawed for a theory to assume its own fundamentality for the sole purpose of defending against criticisms.</description>

      <title>Dirac's Dilemma of the Economy of Inheritance: Parental Care, Equality of Opportunity, and Managed Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a brief reflection on the principles of human society, P. A. M. Dirac articulated a structural tension between two widely affirmed norms: that it is good and natural for parents to improve the prospects of their own children, and that justice requires that all children have equal opportunities in life. These principles, each compelling on its own, cannot be fully realized together. This paper reconstructs Dirac's dilemma, connects it to the dynamics of compounding advantage and inheritance, and situates it within the broader history of political philosophy, including the work of Rawls, Dworkin, Cohen, Brighouse and Swift, Nozick, Murphy and Nagel, and others. The paper argues that attempts to eliminate the resulting injustices entirely risk damaging the non--zero--sum structures that generate general prosperity, and defends a position of "managed inequality": a robust social floor and real mobility, combined with limits on extreme dynastic accumulation and an explicit acceptance of some residual, but constrained, inherited advantage.</description>

      <title>Superluminal Transformations and Indeterminism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum theory is widely regarded as fundamentally indeterministic, yet classical frameworks can also exhibit indeterminism once infinite information is abandoned. At the same time, relativity is usually taken to forbid superluminal signalling, yet Lorentz symmetry formally admits superluminal transformations (SpTs). Dragan and Ekert have argued that SpTs entail indeterminism analogous to the quantum one. Here, we derive a no-go theorem from natural assumptions, which can be interpreted as: superluminal transformations (SpTs) and finite information cannot coexist. Any theory accommodating SpTs must therefore allow unbounded information content, leading to a deterministic ontology akin to that of classical theories formulated over the real numbers. Thus, any apparent indeterminism arising from superluminal transformations reflects only probabilities arising from subjective ignorance, unlike the objective nature of probabilities in quantum theory, indicating that the claimed indeterminacy from superluminal extensions is not quantum.</description>

      <title>Evidential Reconfiguration as Bayesian Confirmation For Dark Matter in 1974: How Existing Data Become Evidence in New Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 1974 papers by Ostriker et al. [1974] and Einasto et al. [1974] are considered by many to be pivotal in establishing the epistemic foundations for the dark matter hypothesis. From a theory confirmation point of view, the circumstances surrounding this pivot are difficult to reconcile with common approaches to epistemic support. First, the papers did not introduce any new observations. Second, they synthesized existing data from two separate contexts to construct a hypothesis under which the joint data became evidentially relevant. Third, this synthesis was motivated in part by non-empirical reasons. The situation excludes both temporal novelty and use novelty because already known data was used in the construction of the hypothesis. Yet, the papers are widely regarded as epistemically transformative. I argue that a Bayesian can model the epistemic significance of the 1974 papers without concession. By recognizing how the papers reconfigured the existing data to bear on a missing mass hypothesis, a novel epistemic aspect emerges. By introducing a shared halo parameterization, they made the previously disjoint data mutually constrained, thereby changing their evidential role. I develop this idea through two concepts - evidential reconfiguration and structural novelty - leveraged through Myrvold's Bayesian account of unification. The result makes Bayesianism faithful to the inferential practices in this significant part of scientific history, explains how the 1974 papers strengthened the evidential case for dark matter, and expands the Bayesian toolbox with a way to treat novel structure as epistemologically salient.</description>
