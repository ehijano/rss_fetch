      <title>Bootstrapping the critical behavior of multi-matrix models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a matrix model, by combining the Schwinger-Dyson equations with positivity constraints on its solutions, in the large $N$ limit one is able to obtain explicit and numerical bounds on its moments. This technique is known as bootstrapping with positivity. In this paper we use this technique to estimate the critical points and exponents of several matrix multi-models. As a proof of concept, we first show it can be used to find the well-studied quartic single matrix model's critical phenomena. We then apply the method to several similar ``unsolved" 2-matrix models with various quartic interactions. We conjecture and present strong evidence for the string susceptibility exponent for some of these models to be $\gamma = 1/2$, which heuristically indicates that the continuum limit will likely be the Continuum Random Tree. For the other 2-matrix models, we find estimates of new string susceptibility exponents that may indicate a new continuum limit. We then study an unsolved 3-matrix model that generalizes the 3-colour model with cubic interactions. Additionally, for all of these models, we are able to derive explicitly the first several terms of the free energy in the large $N$ limit as a power series expansion in the coupling constants at zero by exploiting the structure of the Schwinger-Dyson equations.</description>

      <title>Relative Dynamics of Vortices in Confined Bose--Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the relative dynamics -- the dynamics modulo rotational symmetry in this particular context -- of $N$ vortices in confined Bose--Einstein Condensates (BEC) using a finite-dimensional vortex approximation to the two-dimensional Gross--Pitaevskii equation. We give a Hamiltonian formulation of the relative dynamics by showing that it is an instance of the Lie--Poisson equation on the dual of a certain Lie algebra. Just as in our accompanying work on vortex dynamics with the Euclidean symmetry, the relative dynamics possesses a Casimir invariant and evolves in an invariant set, yielding an Energy--Casimir-type stability condition. We consider three examples of relative equilibria -- those solutions that are undergoing rigid rotations about the origin -- with $N=2, 3, 4$, and investigate their stability using the stability condition.</description>

      <title>ODE/IM correspondence in the semiclassical limit: Large degree asymptotics of the spectral determinants for the ground state potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a Schr\"odinger-like equation for the anharmonic potential $x^{2 \alpha}+\ell(\ell+1) x^{-2}-E$ when the anharmonicity $\alpha$ goes to $+\infty$. When $E$ and $\ell$ vary in bounded domains, we show that the spectral determinant for the central connection problem converges to a special function written in terms of a Bessel function of order $\ell+\frac{1}{2}$ and its zeros converge to the zeros of that Bessel function. We then study the regime in which $E$ and $\ell$ grow large as well, scaling as $E\sim \alpha^2 \varepsilon^2$ and $\ell\sim \alpha p$. When $\varepsilon$ is greater than $1$ we show that the spectral determinant for the central connection problem is a rapidly oscillating function whose zeros tend to be distributed according to the continuous density law $\frac{2p}{\pi}\frac{\sqrt{\varepsilon^2-1}}{\varepsilon}$. When $\varepsilon$ is close to $1$ we show that the spectral determinant converges to a function expressed in terms of the Airy function $\operatorname{Ai}(-)$ and its zeros converge to the zeros of that function. This work is motivated by and has applications to the ODE/IM correspondence for the quantum KdV model.</description>

      <title>Affine extensions of $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $osp(1|2)$ and Virasoro algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there are two inequivalent $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded $osp(1|2)$ Lie superalgebras. Their affine extensions are investigated and it is shown that one of them admits two central elements, one is non-graded and the other is $(1,1)$-graded. The affine $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-$osp(1|2)$ algebras are used by the Sugawara construction to study possible $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded extensions of the Virasoro algebra. We obtain a $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded Virasoro algebra with a non-trivially graded central element. Throughout the investigation, invariant bilinear forms on $\mathbb{Z}_2^2$-graded superalgebras play a crucial role, so a theory of invariant bilinear forms is also developed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class of examples which provide an affine generalization of the nonholonomic problem of a convex body rolling without slipping on the plane. We investigate dynamical aspects of the system such as existence of first integrals, smooth invariant measure and integrability, giving special attention to the cases in which the convex body is a dynamically balanced sphere or a body of revolution.</description>

      <title>Delay ordinary differential equations: from Lagrangian approach to Hamiltonian approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper suggests a Hamiltonian formulation for delay ordinary differential equations (DODEs). Such equations are related to DODEs with a Lagrangian formulation via a delay analog of the Legendre transformation. The Hamiltonian delay operator identity is established. It states the relationship for the invariance of a delay Hamiltonian functional, appropriate delay variational equations, and their conserved quantities. The identity is used to formulate a Noether-type theorem, which provides first integrals for Hamiltonian DODEs with symmetries. The relationship between the invariance of the delay Hamiltonian functional and the invariance of the delay variational equations is also examined. Several examples illustrate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A compact QUBO encoding of computational logic formulae demonstrated on cryptography constructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to advance the state-of-the-art in Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization formulation with a focus on cryptography algorithms. As the minimal QUBO encoding of the linear constraints of optimization problems emerges as the solution of integer linear programming (ILP) problems, by solving special boolean logic formulas (like ANF and DNF) for their integer coefficients it is straightforward to handle any normal form, or any substitution for multi-input AND, OR or XOR operations in a QUBO form. To showcase the efficiency of the proposed approach we considered the most widespread cryptography algorithms including AES-128/192/256, MD5, SHA1 and SHA256. For each of these, we achieved QUBO instances reduced by thousands of logical variables compared to previously published results, while keeping the QUBO matrix sparse and the magnitude of the coefficients low. In the particular case of AES-256 cryptography function we obtained more than 8x reduction in variable count compared to previous results. The demonstrated reduction in QUBO sizes notably increases the vulnerability of cryptography algorithms against future quantum annealers, capable of embedding around $30$ thousands of logical variables.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Embezzlement of Entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Embezzlement of entanglement refers to the task of extracting entanglement from an entanglement resource via local operations and without communication while perturbing the resource arbitrarily little. Recently, the existence of embezzling states of bipartite systems of type III von Neumann algebras was shown. However, both the multipartite case and the precise relation between embezzling states and the notion of embezzling families, as originally defined by van Dam and Hayden, was left open. Here, we show that finite-dimensional approximations of multipartite embezzling states form multipartite embezzling families. In contrast, not every embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. We identify an additional consistency condition that ensures that an embezzling family converges to an embezzling state. This criterion distinguishes the embezzling family of van Dam and Hayden from the one by Leung, Toner, and Watrous. The latter generalizes to the multipartite setting. By taking a limit, we obtain a multipartite system of commuting type III$_1$ factors on which every state is an embezzling state. We discuss our results in the context of quantum field theory and quantum many-body physics. As open problems, we ask whether vacua of relativistic quantum fields in more than two spacetime dimensions are multipartite embezzling states and whether multipartite embezzlement allows for an operator-algebraic characterization.</description>

Abstract: In order to define the complex exceptional Lie groups $ {F_4}^C, {E_6}^C, {E_7}^C, {E_8}^C $ and these compact real forms $ F_4,E_6,E_7,E_8 $, we usually use the Cayley algebra $ \mathfrak{C} $. In the present article, we consider replacing the Cayley algebra $ \mathfrak{C} $ with the field of real numbers $\mathbb R$ in the definition of the groups above, and these groups are denoted as in title above. Our aim is to determine the structure of these groups. We call realization to determine the structure of the groups.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a construction of scattering for wave-type equations with singular potentials on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^n$ in a framework of weak-$L^p$ spaces. First, we use an Yamazaki-type estimate for wave groups on Lorentz spaces and fixed point arguments to prove the global well-posedness for wave-type equations on weak-$L^p$ spaces. Then, we provide a corresponding scattering results in such singular framework. Finally, we use also the dispersive estimates to establish the polynomial stability and improve the decay of scattering.</description>

Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian of two isotropic oscillators with weak coupling from an algebraic approach. We write the Hamiltonian of this problem in terms of the boson generators of the $SU(1,1)$ and $SU(2)$ groups. This allows us to apply two tilting transformations based on both group similarity transformations to obtain its energy spectrum and eigenfunctions. Then, we obtain the Mandel $Q-$parameter of the photon numbers $n_a$ and $n_b$. It is important to note that in our procedure we consider the case of weak coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08180v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the properties of fermionic convolution defined by fermionic Gaussian unitary. A key finding is the purity invariance of pure Gaussian states under this convolution. Leveraging this property, we propose an efficient protocol to test the fermionic Gaussianity of pure states by using 3 copies of the input states. Furthermore, we introduce a new family of measures called ``Non-Gaussian Entropy,'' designed to quantify the fermionic non-Gaussianity of states.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of the perturbed Landau-Dirac operator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.08218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider the Dirac operator with constant magnetic field in $\mathbb R^2$. Its spectrum consists of eigenvalues of infinite multiplicities, known as the Landau-Dirac levels. Under compactly supported perturbations, we study the distribution of the discrete eigenvalues near each Landau-Dirac level. Similarly to the Landau (Schr\"odinger) operator, we demonstrate that a three-terms asymptotic formula holds for the eigenvalue counting function. One of the main novelties of this work is the treatment of some perturbations of variable sign. In this context we explore some remarkable phenomena related to the finiteness or infiniteness of the discrete eigenvalues, which depend on the interplay of the different terms in the matrix perturbation.</description>

      <title>On the space of $2d$ integrable models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study infinite dimensional Lie algebras, whose infinite dimensional mutually commuting subalgebras correspond with the symmetry algebra of $2d$ integrable models. These Lie algebras are defined by the set of infinitesimal, nonlinear, and higher derivative symmetry transformations present in theories with a left(right)-moving or (anti)-holomorphic current. We study a large class of such Lagrangian theories. We classify the commuting subalgebras of the $2d$ free massless scalar, and find the symmetries of the known integrable models such as sine-Gordon, Liouville, Bullough-Dodd, and Korteweg-de Vries. Along the way, we find several new sequences of commuting charges, which we conjecture are charges of integrable models which are new deformations of a single scalar. After quantizing, the Lie algebra is deformed, and so are their commuting subalgebras.</description>

      <title>Ground state of one-dimensional fermion-phonon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.03530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.03530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A new framework for the reflection positivity, based on order-preserving operator inequalities, is proposed. This framework is utilized to investigate one-dimensional fermion-phonon systems, with a particular focus on the detailed examination of ground state properties. Our analysis reveals that the reflection positivity provides a consistent description of the charge-density-wave (CDW) order in such systems. Additionally, we establish the existence of CDW long-range order in the ground state when the Coulomb interaction is long range.</description>

      <title>Thomas-Fermi profile of a fast rotating Bose-Einstein condensate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.04418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.04418v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the minimizers of a magnetic 2D non-linear Schr\"odinger energy functional in a quadratic trapping potential, describing a rotating Bose-Einstein condensate. We derive an effective Thomas-Fermi-like model in the rapidly rotating limit where the centrifugal force compensates the confinement, and available states are restricted to the lowest Landau level. The coupling constant of the effective Thomas-Fermi functional is linked to the emergence of vortex lattices (the Abrikosov problem). We define it via a low density expansion of the energy of the corresponding homogeneous gas in the thermodynamic limit.</description>

      <title>A high-order procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the computation of localized molecular orbits known as Wannier functions. In this manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical integration. Then, using novel analysis, we show that a simple correction can be analytically computed that yields the optimally localized Wannier function. The resulting scheme is robust and capable of achieving high-order accuracy. We illustrate this in a number of numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Complex structure degenerations and collapsing of Calabi-Yau metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.03368</link>
      <description>arXiv:1906.03368v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we make progress on understanding the collapsing behavior of Calabi-Yau metrics on a degenerating family of polarized Calabi-Yau manifolds. In the case of a family of smooth Calabi-Yau hypersurfaces in projective space degenerating into the transversal union of two smooth Fano hypersurfaces in a generic way, we obtain a complete result in all dimensions establishing explicit and precise relationships between the metric collapsing and complex structure degenerations. This result is new even in complex dimension two. This is achieved via gluing and singular perturbation techniques, and a key geometric ingredient involving the construction of certain (not necessarily smooth) K\"ahler metrics with torus symmetry. We also discuss possible extensions of this result to more general settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01757v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The model of directed polymer in a random environment is a fundamental model of interaction between a simple random walk and ambient disorder. This interaction gives rise to complex phenomena and transitions from a central limit theory to novel statistical behaviours. Despite its intense study, there are still many aspects and phases which have not yet been identified. In this review we focus on the current status of our understanding of the transition between weak and strong disorder phases, give an account of some of the methods that the study of the model has motivated and highlight some open questions.</description>

      <title>Towards field theory of multiple D0-branes. Hamiltonian mechanics and quantization of simplest 3D prototype of multiple D0-brane system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently we have constructed a completely supersymmetric nonlinear action possessing the properties expected from multiple D0-brane system. Its quantization should result in an interesting supersymmetric field theory in the (super)space with additional matrix coordinates which can provide an important insights in the study of String Theory. As a first stage toward this aim, in this paper we construct the Hamiltonian mechanics and perform covariant quantization of the simplest three dimensional counterpart of the ten dimensional multiple D0-brane model. We obtain a supersymmetric system of equations in super-spacetime enlarged by bosonic and fermionic matrix coordinates which appears as a result of such quantization and discuss some of its properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18679v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of two dimensional gravity models using ideas motivated by the Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity. This leads to a rather natural formulation of a theory that has close links with Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. After introducing the theory and discussing its vacuum solutions, we present the Hamiltonian analysis. This implies the presence of a single dynamical degree of freedom, which is in sharp contrast to General Relativity, where there are no degrees of freedom in two spacetime dimensions. Our approach can be extended to various other lower-dimensional gravity theories and thus could be of wider interest.</description>

      <title>On $p$-adic solutions to KZ equations, ordinary crystals, and $p^s$-hypergeometric solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the KZ connection associated with a family of hyperelliptic curves of genus $g$ over the ring of $p$-adic integers $\mathbb{Z}_p$. Then the dual connection is the Gauss-Manin connection of that family. We observe that the Gauss-Manin connection has an ordinary $F$-crystal structure and its unit root subcrystal is of rank $g$. We prove that all local flat sections of the KZ connection annihilate the unite root subcrystal, and the space of all local flat sections of the KZ connection is a free $\mathbb{Z}_p$-module of rank $g$. We also consider the reduction modulo $p^s$ of the unit root subcrystal for any $s\geq 1$. We prove that its annihilator is generated by the so-called $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections of the KZ connection. In particular, that means that the reduction modulo $p^s$ of an arbitrary local flat section of the KZ connection over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a linear combination of the $p^s$-hypergeometric flat sections.</description>

      <title>Learning Group Invariant Calabi-Yau Metrics by Fundamental Domain Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present new invariant machine learning models that approximate the Ricci-flat metric on Calabi-Yau (CY) manifolds with discrete symmetries. We accomplish this by combining the $\phi$-model of the cymetric package with non-trainable, $G$-invariant, canonicalization layers that project the $\phi$-model's input data (i.e. points sampled from the CY geometry) to the fundamental domain of a given symmetry group $G$. These $G$-invariant layers are easy to concatenate, provided one compatibility condition is fulfilled, and combine well with spectral $\phi$-models. Through experiments on different CY geometries, we find that, for fixed point sample size and training time, canonicalized models give slightly more accurate metric approximations than the standard $\phi$-model. The method may also be used to compute Ricci-flat metric on smooth CY quotients. We demonstrate this aspect by experiments on a smooth $\mathbb{Z}^2_5$ quotient of a 5-parameter quintic CY manifold.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Majorana Clifford Group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11319v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum information science, Clifford operators and stabilizer codes play a central role for systems of qubits (or qudits). In this paper, we study the analogous objects for systems of Majorana fermions. A crucial role is played by fermion parity symmetry, which is an unbreakable symmetry present in any system in which the fundamental degrees of freedom are fermionic. We prove that the subgroup of parity-preserving fermionic Cliffords can be represented by the orthogonal group over the binary field $\mathbb{F}_2$, and we show how it can be generated by braiding operators and used to construct any (even-parity) Majorana stabilizer code. We also analyze the frame potential for this so-called p-Clifford group, proving that it is equivalent to the frame potential of the ordinary Clifford group acting on a fixed-parity sector of the Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Anisotropy and Bianchi Characterization: Killing vector fields and the implied finding of their metric frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On the largest scales the universe appears to be almost perfectly homogeneous and isotropic, adhering to the cosmological principle. On smaller scales inhomogeneities and anisotropies become increasingly prominent, reflecting the origin, emergence and formation of structure in the Universe and its cosmological impact. Also, a range of tensions between various cosmological observations may suggest it to be necessary to explore the consequences of such deviations from the ideal uniform universe. In this study, we restrict this to an investigation of anisotropies on the nature of the Universe. This motivates a more thorough understanding of the manifestation of anisotropy in cosmological applications. When letting go of the assumption of isotropy, spacetime metrics become homogeneous and completely anisotropic. As such, the Lie algebras of Killing vector fields will be 3D, and fit into the so-called 9-part Bianchi classification. This work strives to, given a suitable 3D Lie algebra of vector fields $\{\xi_a\}_{a=1,2,3}$ reconstruct the basis for a metric on which this Lie algebra is Killing. Through finding a determining equation for the frame invariant under $\{\xi_a\}$ and using the method of characteristics to solve it, expressions for said invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$ are obtained. This leads to general equations for the invariant frame in terms of the $\{\xi_a\}$, organized by Bianchi class. Some examples demonstrating this method are worked out.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the effects of stochastic variations in bathymetry on the solutions of the thermal quasigeostrophic (TQG) equations. These stochastic perturbations generate a variety of different types of ensemble spread in the solution behaviour whilst also preserving the deterministic Lie Poisson structure and Casimir conservation laws. We numerically compare the solution sensitivity, to another type of structure-preserving stochastic perturbation where instead of bathymetry, the velocity is stochastically perturbed.</description>

Abstract: We propose a fully discrete analog of the massive Thirring model in light-cone coordinates by constructing its Lax-pair representation. This Lax-pair representation can also be used to define a new Yang-Baxter map, so we obtain a Yang-Baxter map that admits a continuous limit. We present most of the results for the general case where the dependent variables are matrix-valued.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Breaking in Neural Network Optimization: Insights from Input Dimension Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanisms behind neural network optimization is crucial for improving network design and performance. While various optimization techniques have been developed, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying principles that govern these techniques remains elusive. Specifically, the role of symmetry breaking, a fundamental concept in physics, has not been fully explored in neural network optimization. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to design networks that are both efficient and effective. Here, we propose the symmetry breaking hypothesis to elucidate the significance of symmetry breaking in enhancing neural network optimization. We demonstrate that a simple input expansion can significantly improve network performance across various tasks, and we show that this improvement can be attributed to the underlying symmetry breaking mechanism. We further develop a metric to quantify the degree of symmetry breaking in neural networks, providing a practical approach to evaluate and guide network design. Our findings confirm that symmetry breaking is a fundamental principle that underpins various optimization techniques, including dropout, batch normalization, and equivariance. By quantifying the degree of symmetry breaking, our work offers a practical technique for performance enhancement and a metric to guide network design without the need for complete datasets and extensive training processes.</description>
