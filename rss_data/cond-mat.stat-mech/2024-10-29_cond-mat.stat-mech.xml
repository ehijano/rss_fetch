      <title>Anomalous energy transport in the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonlinear fluctuating hydrodynamic theories with charge and energy conservation in and above two dimensions that describe the large-scale behavior of the Hamiltonian XY model in the disordered and ordered phases. Using renormalization group analysis at one-loop order, we show that while Fourier's law holds in the ordered phase above two dimensions and in the disordered phase in any dimension, the energy diffusivity in the ordered phase exactly in two dimensions, the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase, exhibits a logarithmic divergence in the thermodynamic limit. This divergence arises from elastic energy transport induced by spin-wave excitations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of non-Markovian systems: Markovian embedding vs effective mass approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamics of non-Markovian systems is a classic problem yet it attracts an everlasting activity in physics and beyond. A powerful tool for modeling such setups is the Generalized Langevin Equation, however, its analysis typically poses a major challenge even for numerical means. For this reason, various approximations have been proposed over the years that simplify the original model. In this work we compare two methods allowing to tackle this great challenge: (i) the well-known and successful Markovian embedding technique and (ii) the recently developed effective mass approach. We discuss their scope of applicability, numerical accuracy, and computational efficiency. In doing so we consider a paradigmatic model of a free Brownian particle subjected to power-law correlated thermal noise. We show that when the memory time is short, the effective mass approach offers satisfying precision and typically is much faster than the Markovian embedding. Moreover, the concept of effective mass can be used to find optimal parameters allowing to reach supreme accuracy and minimal computational cost within the embedding. Our work therefore provides a blueprint for investigating the dynamics of non-Markovian systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20798v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An infinite number of solvable Hamiltonians, including the transverse Ising chain, the XY chain with an external field, the cluster model with the next-nearest-neighbor x-x interactions, or with the next-nearest-neighbor z-z interactions, and other series of solvable models that can be mapped to the free fermion system are considered. All the conserved charges of these models written by the string-type products of the interactions are obtained. In the case of the transverse Ising chain, all the known charges are rederived, and in the case of the other models, new conserved charges are obtained.</description>

      <title>Dynamical activity universally bounds precision of response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of far-from-equilibrium systems has been at the forefront of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, with a particular focus on understanding the fluctuations and response of thermodynamic systems to external perturbations. In this study, we introduce a universal response kinetic uncertainty relation, which provides a fundamental trade-off between the precision of response for generic observables and dynamical activity in Markovian nonequilibrium systems. We demonstrate the practical applicability and tightness of the derived bound through illustrative examples. Our results are applicable to a broad spectrum of Markov jump processes, ranging from currents to non-current variables, from steady states to time-dependent driving, from continuous time to discrete time, and including Maxwell's demon or absolute irreversibility. Our findings not only enhance the theoretical foundation of stochastic thermodynamics but also may hold potential implications for far-from-equilibrium biochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Economic Markets through Monte Carlo Simulations and Magnetism-Inspired Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach to modelling economic agents as analogous to spin states in physics, particularly the Ising model. By associating economic activity with spin orientations (up for inactivity, down for activity), the study delves into optimizing market dynamics using concepts from statistical mechanics. Utilizing Monte Carlo simulations, the aim is to maximize surplus by allowing the market to evolve freely toward equilibrium. The introduction of temperature represents the frequency of economic activities, which is crucial for optimizing consumer and producer surplus. The government's role as a temperature regulator (raising temperature to stimulate economic activity) is explored. Results from simulations and policy interventions, such as introducing a "magnetic field," are discussed, showcasing complexities in optimizing economic systems while avoiding undue control that may destabilize markets. The study provides insights into bridging concepts from physics and economics, paving the way for a deeper understanding of economic dynamics and policy interventions.</description>

      <title>Markov spin models for image generation : explicit large deviations with respect to the number of pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the discrete-time or the continuous-time Markov spin models for image generation when each pixel $n=1,..,N$ can take only two values $S_n=\pm 1$, the finite-time forward propagator depends on the initial and final configurations only via their overlap. The large deviations properties with respect to the number $N$ of pixels are analyzed for the overlap and/or the magnetization during the forward noising dynamics and during the backward reconstructive dynamics for various initial conditions, namely (i) a single image (ii) a mixture of two images (iii) when the initial condition corresponds to the Curie-Weiss mean-field ferromagnetic model.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Isotropic-nematic Phase Transition with Generative Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contemporary work implies generative machine learning models are capable of learning the phase behavior in condensed matter systems such as the Ising model. In this Letter, we utilize a score-based modeling procedure called Thermodynamic Maps to describe the isotropic-nematic phase transition in a melt of $N=343$ calamitic Gay-Berne ellipsoids. When trained on samples generated by molecular dynamics simulation from a single temperature on either side of the phase transition, we demonstrate this generative machine learning approach infers information regarding the critical behavior and estimates effectively the nematic order parameter at sampled temperatures between the two training temperatures. These results demonstrate score-based models' ability to learn the physics of a non-trivial liquid crystalline phase transition driven by anisotropic interactions both entropic and energetic in nature.</description>

      <title>Lattice models from CFT on surfaces with holes II: Cloaking boundary conditions and loop models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we continue to investigate the lattice models obtained from 2d CFTs via the construction introduced in [arXiv:2112.01563]. On the side of the 2d CFT we consider the cloaking boundary condition relative to a fixed fusion category F of topological line defects. The resulting lattice model realises the topological symmetry F exactly. We compute the state spaces and Boltzmann weights of these lattice model in the example of unitary Virasoro minimal models. We work directly with amplitudes, rather than with normalised correlators, and we provide a careful treatment of the Weyl anomaly factor in terms of the Liouville action.
  We numerically evaluate the Ising CFT on the torus with one hole and cloaking boundary condition in two channels, and illustrate in this example that the anomaly factors are essential to obtain matching results for the amplitudes. We show that lattice models obtained from Virasoro minimal models at lowest non-trivial cutoff can be exactly mapped to loop models. This provides a first non-trivial check that our lattice models can contain the 2d CFT they were constructed from in their phase diagram, and we propose a condition on the cloaking boundary condition for F under which we expect this to happen in general.</description>

      <title>Majorana fermions solve the tetrahedron equations as well as higher simplex equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Yang-Baxter equations define quantum integrable models. The tetrahedron and higher simplex equations are multi-dimensional generalizations. Finding the solutions of these equations is a formidable task. In this work we develop a systematic method - constructing higher simplex operators [solutions of corresponding simplex equations] from lower simplex ones. We call it lifting. By starting from a solution of Yang-Baxter equations we can construct [lift] a solution of the tetrahedron equation and simplex equation in any dimension. We then generalize this by starting from a solution of any lower simplex equation and lifting it [construct solution] to another simplex equation in higher dimension. This process introduces several constraints among the different lower simplex operators that are lifted to form the higher simplex operators. We show that braided Yang-Baxter operators [solutions of Yang-Baxter equations independent of spectral parameters] constructed using Majorana fermions satisfy these constraints, thus solving the higher simplex equations. As a consequence these solutions help us understand the action of an higher simplex operator on Majorana fermions. Furthermore we show that operators constructed using Dirac (complex) fermions satisfy these constraints as well.</description>

      <title>A twenty-first century statistical physics of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular biology revolution of the last seventy five years has transformed our view of living systems. Scientific explanations of biological phenomena are now synonymous with the identification of the genes, proteins, and signaling molecules involved. The hegemony of the molecular paradigm has only become more pronounced as new technologies allow us to make measurements at scale. Combining this wealth of data with new ``artificial intelligence'' techniques is viewed as the future of biology. Here, we challenge this emerging ``common sense'', laying out a roadmap for developing a theoretical understanding of life. We argue that a twenty-first century theoretical biology must be founded on a new type of statistical physics suited to the living world. Rather than merely constructing statistical models, a statistical theory requires developing ``quantitative abstractions'' for understanding the gene-organism-environment triad. This necessitates overcoming four major challenges that distinguish living matter: (1) living systems are composed of a large number of heterogeneous parts rather than a large number of identical objects; (2) living systems control and manipulate the physical world in a manner that is extremely different from the ways considered in traditional statistical physics; (3) living systems necessarily operate out of equilibrium; (4) living systems are evolved objects with a function, resulting in new types of constraints that must be imposed on probabilistic ensembles. We conclude by discussing a few key themes that we view as promising directions for developing a statistical physics of life: typicality, localized biological control, a linear response of complex systems with non-reciprocal interactions, biological resource allocation, and learning and adaptation in overparameterized systems.</description>

      <title>Discrete Spectrum of Interior Length and Timeshift in Two-sided Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the spectrum of the interior length and the horizon timeshift of a two-sided black hole in Jackiew-Teitelboim gravity. We construct projection operators onto the subspace of fixed length or fixed horizon timeshift states via the replica trick. We find that the density of state for the length and the timeshift is finite. This implies that the spectrum of these quantities is discrete microscopically. Utilizing the projection operator, we construct the microscopic length operator and the timeshift operator. Using these non-perturbative geometric operators, we study the time evolution of the thermofield double state. We find that at early time, the probability distribution of the interior length and the timeshift are sharply peaked at the classical values, while after the Heisenberg time, the distribution is completely uniform over all possible values of the length and the timeshift, indicating maximal uncertainty of the length and the timeshift. In particular, the probability of obtaining the negative timeshift states, which have contracting interior geometry and thus correspond to a white hole, is $O(1)$ after the Heisenberg time.</description>

      <title>A large deviation principle for the multispecies stirring process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the multispecies stirring process on the discrete torus. We prove a large deviation principle for the trajectory of the vector of densities of the different species. The technique of proof consists in extending the method of the foundational paper [1] based on the superexponential estimate to the multispecies setting. This requires a careful choice of the corresponding weakly asymmetric dynamics, which is parametrized by fields depending on the various species. We also prove the hydrodynamic limit of this weakly asymmetric dynamics, which is similar to but different from the ABC model in [2]. Using the appropriate asymmetric dynamics, we also obtain that the mobility matrix relating the drift currents to the fields coincides with the covariance matrix of the reversible multinomial distribution, which then further leads to the Einstein relation</description>

      <title>Complex symmetric, self-dual, and Ginibre random matrices: Analytical results for three classes of bulk and edge statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21032v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a conjecture about the local bulk statistics of complex eigenvalues has been made based on numerics. It claims that there are only three universality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum systems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the expectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials in three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for the three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of non-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive explicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials for finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the global limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum, providing new analytical results for classes AI$^\dag$ and AII$^\dag$. For general $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the non-linear $\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly, they agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone manifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are different and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In particular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed different local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture further.</description>

Abstract: We derive a version of the so-called "best Fokker-Planck approximation" (BFPA) to describe the spatial properties of interacting active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUPs) in arbitrary spatial dimensions. In doing so, we also take into account the odd-diffusive contribution of the Lorentz force acting on a charged particle in a spatially dependent magnetic field, sticking to the overdamped limit. While the BFPA itself does not turn out to be widely useful, our general approach allows to deduce an appropriate generalization of the Fox approximation, which we use to characterize the stationary behavior of a single active particle in an external potential by deriving analytic expressions for configurational probability distributions (or effective potentials). In agreement with computer simulations, our theory predicts that the Lorentz force reduces the effective attraction and thus the probability to find an active particle in the vicinity of a repulsive wall. Even for an inhomogeneous magnetic field, our theoretical findings provide useful qualitative insights, specifically regarding the location of accumulation regions.</description>

      <title>Quantum magic dynamics in random circuits</title>

Abstract: Magic refers to the degree of "quantumness" in a system that cannot be fully described by stabilizer states and Clifford operations alone. In quantum computing, stabilizer states and Clifford operations can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, even though they may appear complicated from the perspective of entanglement. In this sense, magic is a crucial resource for unlocking the unique computational power of quantum computers to address problems that are classically intractable. Magic can be quantified by measures such as Wigner negativity and mana that satisfy fundamental properties such as monotonicity under Clifford operations. In this paper, we generalize the statistical mechanical mapping methods of random circuits to the calculation of Renyi Wigner negativity and mana. Based on this, we find: (1) a precise formula describing the competition between magic and entanglement in many-body states prepared under Haar random circuits; (2) a formula describing the the spreading and scrambling of magic in states evolved under random Clifford circuits; (3) a quantitative description of magic "squeezing" and "teleportation" under measurements. Finally, we comment on the relation between coherent information and magic.</description>

      <title>Pseudochaotic Many-Body Dynamics as a Pseudorandom State Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of quantum many-body dynamics in quantum simulations, namely 'pseudochaotic dynamics,' which generates computationally indistinguishable states from Haar-random states within the limited access to the measurement outcomes and runtime of quantum computations. While it is not chaotic, a defining characteristics of many-body quantum chaos, namely out-of-time-ordered correlators, fail to differentiate the pseudochaotic dynamics from chaotic one. We systematically construct such pseudochaotic unitary evolution and investigate their nature through extensive numerical and analytic calculations. Remarkably, we show that the pseudochaotic dynamics can generate a representative pseudo-quantum state, specifically a random subset-phase state, from initial computational states with a depth tightly bound by polylog(n) with the system size n, which opens up a practical route to realize pseudorandom states in near term quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Entropy of Free Fermions in Timelike Slices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.03134v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the entanglement entropy of free fermion quantum states in an arbitrary spacetime slice of a discrete set of points, and particularly investigate timelike (causal) slices. For 1D lattice free fermions with an energy bandwidth $E_0$, we calculate the time-direction entanglement entropy $S_A$ in a time-direction slice of a set of times $t_n=n\tau$ ($1\le n\le K$) spanning a time length $t$ on the same site. For zero temperature ground states, we find that $S_A$ shows volume law when $\tau\gg\tau_0=2\pi/E_0$; in contrast, $S_A\sim \frac{1}{3}\ln t$ when $\tau=\tau_0$, and $S_A\sim\frac{1}{6}\ln t$ when $\tau&lt;\tau_0$, resembling the Calabrese-Cardy formula for one flavor of nonchiral and chiral fermion, respectively. For finite temperature thermal states, the mutual information also saturates when $\tau&lt;\tau_0$. For non-eigenstates, volume law in $t$ and signatures of the Lieb-Robinson bound velocity can be observed in $S_A$. For generic spacetime slices with one point per site, the zero temperature entanglement entropy shows a clear transition from area law to volume law when the slice varies from spacelike to timelike.</description>

      <title>Residual Entropy of Ice: A Study Based on Transfer Matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Residual entropy of ice systems has long been a significant and intriguing issue in condensed matter physics and statistical mechanics. The exact solutions for the residual entropy of realistic three-dimensional ice systems remain unknown. In this study, we focus on two typical realistic ice systems, namely the hexagonal ice (ice Ih) and cubic ice (ice Ic). We present a transfer matrix description of the number of ice-ruled configurations for these two systems. First, a transfer matrix $M$ is constructed for ice Ic, where each element is the number of ice-ruled configurations of a hexagonal monolayer under certain condition. The product of $M$ and its transpose corresponds to a bilayer unit in ice Ih lattice, therefore is exactly a transfer matrix for ice Ih. Making use of this, we simply show that the residual entropy of ice Ih is not less than that of ice Ic in the thermodynamic limit, which was first proved by Onsager in 1960s. Furthermore, we find an alternative transfer matrix $M'$ for ice Ih, which is based on a monolayer periodic unit. Some interesting properties of $M$, $MM^T$ and $M'$ are illustrated, specifically the summation of all elements, the element in the first row and first column, and the trace. Each property is equivalent with the residual entropy of a two-dimensional ice model. Our work rediscovers the relationship between the residual entropies of ice Ih and ice Ic, and provides an effective description for various two-dimensional ice models.</description>

      <title>Exact sampling and fast mixing of Activated Random Walk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2110.14008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activated Random Walk (ARW) is an interacting particle system on the $d$-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}^d$. On a finite subset $V \subset \mathbb{Z}^d$ it defines a Markov chain on $\{0,1\}^V$. We prove that when $V$ is a Euclidean ball intersected with $\mathbb{Z}^d$, the mixing time of the ARW Markov chain is at most $1+o(1)$ times the volume of the ball. The proof uses an exact sampling algorithm for the stationary distribution, a coupling with internal DLA, and an upper bound on the time when internal DLA fills the entire ball. We conjecture cutoff at time $\zeta$ times the volume of the ball, where $\zeta&lt;1$ is the limiting density of the stationary state.</description>

      <title>Dynamical transitions and aging in the superdiffusive Pomeau-Manneville map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pomeau-Manneville map is a paradigmatic intermittent dynamical system exhibiting weak chaos and anomalous dynamics. In this paper we analyse the parameter dependence of superdiffusion for the map lifted periodically onto the real line. From numerical simulations we compute the generalised diffusion coefficient (GDC) of this model as a function of the map's nonlinearity parameter. We identify two singular dynamical transitions in the GDC, one where it diverges to infinity, and a second one where it is fully suppressed. Using the continuous-time random walk theory of L\'evy walks we calculate an analytic expression for the GDC and show that it qualitatively reproduces these two transitions. Quantitatively it systematically deviates from the deterministic dynamics for small parameter values, which we explain by slow decay of velocity correlations. Interestingly, imposing aging onto the dynamics in simulations eliminates the dynamical transition that led to suppression of the GDC, thus yielding a non-trivial change in the parameter dependence of superdiffusion. This also applies to a respective intermittent model of subdiffusive dynamics displaying a related transition.</description>

      <title>Stable dynamic helix state in the nonintegrable XXZ Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.06146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of external fields on the stability of spin helix states in an XXZ Heisenberg model. Exact diagonalization on a finite system shows that random transverse fields in the x and y directions drive the transition from integrability to nonintegrability. In such a system, the helix state can be regarded as a quantum scar. Simultaneously, the presence of uniform z field enables the helix state to better maintain its dynamical nature, allowing for a clearer understanding of its evolutionary behavior. However, the entanglement entropy reveals that irrespective of the presence of a uniform z field, as long as the system remains chaotic, the scar extent of the helix state shows no significant variation.</description>

      <title>Universal Statistics of Competition in Democratic Elections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05065v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Elections for public offices in democratic nations are large-scale examples of collective decision-making. As a complex system with a multitude of interactions among agents, we can anticipate that universal macroscopic patterns could emerge independent of microscopic details. Despite the availability of empirical election data, such universality, valid at all scales, countries, and elections, has not yet been observed. In this work, we propose a parameter-free voting model and analytically show that the distribution of the victory margin is driven by that of the voter turnout, and a scaled measure depending on margin and turnout leads to a robust universality. This is demonstrated using empirical election data from $34$ countries, spanning multiple decades and electoral scales. The deviations from the model predictions and universality indicate possible electoral malpractices. We argue that this universality is a stylized fact indicating the competitive nature of electoral outcomes.</description>

      <title>Rigid clusters in shear-thickening suspensions: a nonequilibrium critical transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15165v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The onset and growth of rigid clusters in a two-dimensional (2D) suspension in shear flow are studied by numerical simulation. The suspension exhibits the lubricated-to-frictional rheology transition but is studied at stresses above the levels that cause extreme shear thickening. At large solid area fraction, $\phi$, but below the jamming fraction, we find that there is critical $\phi_c$ beyond which the proportion of particles in rigid clusters grows sharply, as $f_{\rm rig} \sim (\phi-\phi_c)^{\beta}$ with $\beta=1/8$, and at which the fluctuations in the net rigidity grow sharply, with a susceptibility measure $\chi_{\rm rig} \sim |\phi-\phi_c|^{-\gamma}$ with $\gamma = 7/4$. By applying finite size scaling, the correlation length, arising from the correlation of rigid domains, is found to scale as $\xi \sim |\phi-\phi_c|^{-\nu}$ with $\nu = 1$. The system is thus found to exhibit criticality, with critical exponents consistent with the 2D Ising transition. This behavior occurs over a range of stresses, with $\phi_c$ increasing as the stress decreases, consistent with the known increase in jamming fraction with reduction of stress for shear-thickening suspensions.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of Density Scaling: Coarse-Graining in Space and Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of liquids is pivotal for the study of larger spatiotemporal processes, especially in glass-forming materials at low temperatures. Density scaling, observed in many molecular systems through experiments, offers an efficient means for exploring a vast range of time scales along a one-dimensional phase diagram. However, the theoretical foundation provided by isomorph theory is of limited use for molecular systems, since currently no first-principles theory exists that can explain the origins of density scaling or make predictions based on it. In this work, we propose a first-principles framework employing coarse-graining in space and time. Spatial coarse-graining reduces a molecule to a center-of-mass-level description by eliminating fast degrees of freedom, while temporal coarse-graining involves averaging fluctuations or correlation functions over characteristic time scales. We show that both approaches enable ab initio estimation of the density scaling coefficient for ortho-terphenyl, consistent with experimental values. Building on these findings, we employ excess entropy scaling to derive a microscopic theory that underpins density scaling from fully atomistic simulations. Our results illuminate the role of coarse-graining in assessing slow fluctuations in molecules and unravel the microscopic nature of density scaling. Ultimately, our proposed framework enables systematic bottom-up approaches for predicting transport coefficients that are otherwise experimentally inaccessible and computationally prohibitive.</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum thermalization occurs in a broad class of systems from elementary particles to complex materials. Out-of-equilibrium quantum systems have long been understood to either thermalize or retain memory of their initial states, but not both. Here we achieve the first coexistence of thermalization and memory in a quantum system, where we use both Rydberg blockade and facilitation in an atom array to engineer a fragmentation of the Hilbert space into exponentially many disjointed subspaces. We find that the kinetically constrained system yields quantum many-body scars arising from the $\mathbb{Z}_{2k}$ class of initial states, which generalizes beyond the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ scars previously reported in other quantum systems. When bringing multiple long-range interactions into resonance, we observe quantum thermalization restricted to Hilbert space fragments, where the thermalized system retains characteristics of the initial configuration. Intriguingly, states belonging to different subspaces do not thermalize with each other even when they have the same energy. Our work challenges established ideas of quantum thermalization while experimentally resolving the longstanding tension between thermalization and memory. These results may be applied to control entanglement dynamics in quantum processors and quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Farmland Biodiversity Loss: A Bio-Economic Model of Land Consolidation and Pesticide Use</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Biodiversity loss driven by agricultural intensification is a pressing global issue, with significant implications for ecosystem stability and human well-being. We design an integrated bio-economic agent-based model, informed by historical data from the French agricultural sector, to project future biodiversity trends and evaluate policy interventions. Our model predicts further biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due to intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing pesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly benefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land consolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small farmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm sizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy results from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside targeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve biodiversity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity of two-level systems, e.g. spins, qubits, magnetic moments etc, are analysed based on the so-called correlational entropy in the case of pure quantum systems and the thermal entropy in case of thermal equilibrium that are suitable quantities essentially free from basis dependence. The complexity is defined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order R\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation measure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for special choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the presence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off diagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence provides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at similar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at finite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising model in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide important evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters help to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.</description>

Abstract: The late time behaviour of OTOCs involving generic non-conserved local operators show exponential decay in chaotic many body systems. However, it has been recently observed that for certain holographic theories, the OTOC involving the $U(1)$ conserved current for a gauge field instead varies diffusively at late times. The present work generalizes this observation to conserved currents corresponding to higher-form symmetries that belong to a wider class of symmetries known as generalized symmetries. We started by computing the late time behaviour of OTOCs involving $U(1)$ current operators in five dimensional AdS-Schwarzschild black hole geometry for the 2-form antisymmetric $B$-fields. The bulk solution for the $B$-field exhibits logarithmic divergences near the asymptotic AdS boundary which can be regularized by introducing a double trace deformation in the boundary CFT. Finally, we consider the more general case with antisymmetric $p$-form fields in arbitrary dimensions. In the scattering approach, the boundary OTOC can be written as an inner product between asymptotic 'in' and 'out' states which in our case is equivalent to computing the inner product between two bulk fields with and without a shockwave background. We observe that the late time OTOCs have power law tails which seems to be a universal feature of the higher-form fields with $U(1)$ charge conservation.</description>
