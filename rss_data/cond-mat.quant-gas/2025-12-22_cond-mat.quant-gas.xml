      <title>The crossover from classical to quantum transport in a weakly-interacting Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an exact solution of the quantum kinetic equation of a weakly interacting Fermi gas in the crossover from the degenerate Fermi-liquid regime to the classical Boltzmann gas. We construct families of orthogonal polynomials tailored to each angular momentum channel, enabling a fast and systematically improvable decomposition of the phase-space distribution. This approach yields accurate, non-variational predictions for the shear viscosity, thermal diffusivity, and spin diffusivity to leading order in the scattering length. We demonstrate that the commonly used relaxation-time approximation fails dramatically at low temperature--by up to 25%. Our method provides a numerically efficient framework for benchmarking transport in strongly correlated regimes and for simulating the kinetics of quantum gases beyond hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Observation of Fano-suppression in scattering resonances of bosonic erbium atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collisional properties of lanthanides exhibit remarkable complexity due to their many valence electrons, leading to an extraordinarily dense Feshbach spectrum showing signs of quantum chaos. Here we explore the situation of bosonic spin mixtures of erbium, adding the additional spin degree of freedom to the problem. We detect several inter- and intra-spin scattering resonances, exhibiting a peculiar asymmetric shape with a pronounced loss minimum. By developing a simplified multi-channel model we are able to recreate this characteristic behavior and to trace its origin to destructive interference between multiple pathways as predicted by Fano. We additionally observe a series of Fano-Feshbach resonances across multiple spin channels connected to the same molecular state, again confirmed by our theory. Our work opens the door for a detailed investigation to study multi-spin strongly-coupled scattering phenomena.</description>

      <title>Scattering Problem in Bose-Einstein Condensates with Magnetic Domain Wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical study of linear wave scattering from magnetic domain walls with varied twist angles $\Theta$ in spin-$1/2$ Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). Using a gauge transformation, we show that scattering observables depend solely on the total twist $\Theta$, independent of chirality. Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) framework, we develop a transfer-matrix method to compute reflection and transmission coefficients for incident phonons and free particles. Our results reveal a scattering threshold at the Zeeman energy $E = \hbar\Omega_0$, separating a pure phonon regime from multi-channel scattering involving both collective and single-particle excitations above threshold. For large twist angles, competition between kinetic and Zeeman energies reduces the effective spin rotation, leading to comb-like density modulations and Fano-like resonances below threshold. The transition probability between phonon and particle channels is strongly tunable with $\Theta$, enhanced for odd multiples of $\pi$ but suppressed for even multiples. These findings establish twist-engineered domain walls as a versatile platform for controlling quantum transport, with implications for atomtronic devices and quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Momentum correlations of the Hawking effect in a quantum fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hawking effect -- the spontaneous emission of correlated quanta from horizons -- can be observed in laboratory systems where an acoustic horizon forms when a fluid transitions from subcritical to supercritical flow. Although most theoretical and experimental studies have relied on real-space observables, the frequency-dependent nature of the Hawking process motivates a momentum-space analysis to access its spectral structure and entanglement features. Here, we numerically compute the momentum-space two-point correlation function in a quantum fluid using the truncated Wigner approximation, a general method applicable to both conservative and driven-dissipative systems. We consider a polaritonic fluid of light in a realistic configuration known to yield strong real-space correlations between Hawking, partner, and witness modes. We find signatures that are directly accessible in state-of-the-art experiments and offer a robust diagnostic of spontaneous emission. Our results form the basis for a new theoretical framework to assess a variety of effects, such as quasi-normal mode emission or modifications of the horizon structure on the Hawking spectrum.</description>

      <title>Time-optimal force sensing with ultracold atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a time-optimal approach to force sensing using a Bose-Einstein condensate in a shaken optical lattice. Optimal control protocols are derived from a Fisher information framework and yield optimal dynamics that spontaneously organize in intereferometer-like structures, where multiple interferences combine to maximize sensitivity. We analyse how measurement precision scales with control time and how the finite momentum dispersion of the condensate changes the optimal dynamics, observing an abrupt change of conformation from single- to double-folded interference structures for robust controls. The protocols are implemented experimentally for cold atoms subjected to inertial and magnetic forces, demonstrating high sensitivity and robustness. Our approach establishes a general route to time-optimal quantum sensing beyond standard interferometric architectures, applcable across all quantum platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an overview of the Gross-Pitaevskii-Poisson equation (GPPE) that is used to model self-gravitating superfluid systems, which include gravitationally collapsed boson and axion stars and dark-matter haloes. We outline how this framework can be used to develop minimal models for neutron stars and for pulsars and their glitches. We account not only for vortices in the neutron superfluid inside these stars, but also for the flux tubes in the proton-superconductor subsystem, using a coupled model with the neutron superfluid, proton superconductor, the Maxwell equations for the vector potential ${\bf A}$, and the Poisson equation for self-gravity.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universality Class in Dissipative Quantum Systems with Dipole Moment Conservation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems remains one of the grand challenges of modern physics. In particular, increasing attention has been devoted to the emergence of non-equilibrium universality classes that have no equilibrium counterparts. A prominent example is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class realized in dissipative Bose-Einstein condensates. In this Letter, motivated by recent experimental advances, we investigate the universal dynamics of dissipative quantum systems with dipole moment conservation. We develop an effective field theory description, supported by a concrete quantum spin model, to capture the resulting universal behaviors. Our analysis unveils a novel strongly interacting non-equilibrium fixed point that governs the equal-time phase fluctuations in systems with either strong or weak dipole symmetries. Moreover, charge transport becomes subdiffusive in the presence of strong dipole symmetry, while it remains diffusive in the weakly symmetric case. Our results reveal the intricate interplay between kinetic constraints and dissipation in quantum many-body systems.</description>

Abstract: We study the formation of topological defects via the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in a polariton supersolid in a liquid crystal microcavity with tunable Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. We predict analytically two different scalings in the slow- and fast-quench regimes, and confirm these predictions numerically. We also present experimental results for the slow-quench regime, demonstrating an original Kibble-Zurek scaling exponent $\eta_{KZM}=1.0\pm 0.2$</description>

      <title>Simulation of topological superconductors and their competing orders using photon-mediated interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing and controlling the unconventional pairing featured by topological superconductors remains a central challenge. We introduce a cavity QED quantum simulator that engineers competing chiral $p_x+ip_y$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ orders by tailoring cavity-mediated couplings between atomic pseudospins that emulate momentum-dependent pairing channels. The desired spatially inhomogeneous cavity-mediated couplings can be engineered in a 2D optical lattice using incommensurate cavity-lattice wavelengths naturally occurring in cavity QED systems. This minimal and fully tunable platform enables controlled state preparation and continuous measurement of superconducting order parameters, revealing phases in both equilibrium and sudden-quench settings with a single dominant pairing channel, as well as coexistence regimes with competing pairing channels. Crucially, our implementation allows direct observation of topological transitions in and out of equilibrium, providing a powerful route to the quantum simulation of competing topological superconducting phases that remain elusive in solid-state and ultracold-atom systems.</description>

      <title>Probing non-ergodicity and symmetry via coherent forward scattering in a shaken rotor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Coherent Backscattering (CBS) peak is a well-known interferential signature of weak localization in disordered or chaotic systems. More recently, a second interference feature -- the Coherent Forward Scattering (CFS) peak -- was predicted to emerge in the regime of strong localization. However, it has never been directly observed. Here we report the first direct observation of the CFS peak and demonstrate its dual role as a signature of non-ergodicity and as a probe of symmetries in quantum chaotic systems. Using a shaken rotor model realized with a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of ultracold atoms in a modulated optical lattice, we investigate dynamical localization in momentum space. The CFS peak emerges in the position distribution as a consequence of non-ergodic dynamics, while its growth timescale reveals the underlying localization length. By finely tuning the modulation, we control time-reversal and parity symmetries and measure their distinct effects on both CBS and CFS peaks. Our results highlight the strong link of both the temporal growth and contrast of the CFS with symmetry and localization, making it a robust probe of these properties. This work opens new directions for characterizing non-ergodicity and symmetries in quantum chaotic or disordered systems, with possible applications in many-body localization and chaos.</description>

Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin $1/2$ particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin-orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature quantum rotor approach for ultracold bosons in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interacting bosons in optical lattices directly expose quantum phases in a clean, highly controllable environment. This requires engineering systems with very low entropies, but the resulting temperature--interaction ratios $T/U$ of present experiments remain well above the domain where zero-temperature theories are expected to be reliable. The quantum-rotor approach (QRA), while analytically powerful and extremely flexible, inherits ground-state phase correlations and therefore breaks down once thermal winding of the phase field becomes significant. Here we construct a finite-temperature extension of QRA by (i) performing resummation of winding-number contributions for temperatures $k_{B}T/U\lesssim 0.2$ and (ii) developing an auxiliary-variable expansion that remains accurate toward the classical limit. The resulting closed expression for the phase correlator is inserted into the standard spherical-approximation QRA without sacrificing the method's flexibility with respect to lattice geometry and dimensionality. The approach reproduces the shrinkage of Mott lobes from $T=0$ up to $k_{B}T/U\simeq 0.2$ in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions and with in-situ imaging experiments. This finite-T QRA thus supplies an analytic, computationally light tool for strongly correlated lattice bosons and sets the stage for amplitude-fluctuation upgrades required at higher temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10494v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an optimal control procedure for the non-adiabatic transport of ultracold neutral thermal atoms in optical tweezers arranged in a one-dimensional array, with focus on reaching minimal transfer time. The particle dynamics are modeled first using a classical approach through the Liouville equation and second through the quantum Wigner equation to include quantum effects. Both methods account for typical experimental noise described as stochastic effects through Fokker-Planck terms. The optimal control process is initialized with a trajectory computed for a single classical particle and determines the phase-space path that minimizes transport time and ensures high transport fidelity to the target trap. This approach provides the fastest and most efficient method for relocating atoms from an initial configuration to a desired target arrangement, minimizing time and energy costs while ensuring high fidelity. Such an approach may be highly valuable to initialize large atom arrays for quantum simulation or computation experiments.</description>

      <title>A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on Surfaces of Variable Negative Curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single-cavity spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological photonic phases are typically identified through band reconstruction, steady-state transmission, or real-space imaging of edge modes. In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems.</description>
