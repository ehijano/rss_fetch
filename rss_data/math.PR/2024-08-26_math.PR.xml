      <title>On Uniform Functions on Configuration Spaces of Large Scale Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic large scale interacting systems can be studied via the observables, i.e. functions on the underlying configuration space. In our previous article, we introduced the concept of uniform functions, which are suitable class of functions on configuration spaces underlying stochastic systems on infinite graphs. An important consequence is the successful characterization of conserved quantities without introducing the notion of stationary distributions. In this article, we further develop the theory of uniform functions and construct the theory independent of any choice of a base state. Furthermore, we generalize the notion of interactions given in our previous article to accommodate the case where there are multiple possible state transitions on adjacent vertices. We then prove that if the interaction is exchangeable, then any uniform function which gives a global conserved quantity can be expressed as a sum of local conserved quantities of the interaction. Contrary to our previous article, we do not need to assume that the interaction is irreducibly quantified. This shows that our theory of uniform functions on configuration spaces over infinite graphs with transition structure given by an exchangeable interaction is a natural framework to study general stochastic large scale interacting systems. While some of the ideas in this article are based on our previous article, the article is logically independent and self-contained.</description>

      <title>Asymptotics for Optimal Empirical Quantization of Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the minimal error in approximating a general probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ by the uniform measure on a finite set with prescribed cardinality $n$. The error is measured in the $p$-Wasserstein distance. In particular, when $1\le p&lt;d$, we establish asymptotic upper and lower bounds as $n \to \infty$ on the rescaled minimal error that have the same, explicit dependency on $\mu$.
  In some instances, we prove that the rescaled minimal error has a limit. These include general measures in dimension $d = 2$ with $1 \le p &lt; 2$, and uniform measures in arbitrary dimension with $1 \le p &lt; d$. For some uniform measures, we prove the limit existence for $p \ge d$ as well.
  For a class of compactly supported measures with H\"older densities, we determine the convergence speed of the minimal error for every $p \ge 1$.
  Furthermore, we establish a new Pierce-type (i.e., nonasymptotic) upper estimate of the minimal error when $1 \le p &lt; d$.
  In the initial sections, we survey the state of the art and draw connections with similar problems, such as classical and random quantization.</description>

      <title>A study of distributional complexity measures for Boolean functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A number of complexity measures for Boolean functions have previously been introduced. These include (1) sensitivity, (2) block sensitivity, (3) witness complexity, (4) subcube partition complexity and (5) algorithmic complexity. Each of these is concerned with "worst-case" inputs. It has been shown that there is "asymptotic separation" between these complexity measures and very recently, due to the work of Huang, it has been established that they are all "polynomially related". In this paper, we study the notion of distributional complexity where the input bits are independent and one considers all of the above notions in expectation. We obtain a number of results concerning distributional complexity measures, among others addressing the above concepts of "asymptotic separation" and being "polynomially related" in this context. We introduce a new distributional complexity measure, local witness complexity, which only makes sense in the distributional context and we also study a new version of algorithmic complexity which involves partial information. Many interesting examples are presented including some related to percolation. The latter connects a number of the recent developments in percolation theory over the last two decades with the study of complexity measures in theoretical computer science.</description>

      <title>The distribution of the length of the longest path in random acyclic orientations of a complete bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Randomly sampling an acyclic orientation on the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,k}$ with parts of size $n$ and $k$, we investigate the length of the longest path. We provide a probability generating function for the distribution of the longest path length, and we use Analytic Combinatorics to perform asymptotic analysis of the probability distribution in the case of equal part sizes $n = k$ tending toward infinity. We show that the distribution is asymptotically Gaussian, and we obtain precise asymptotics for the mean and variance. These results address a question asked by Peter J. Cameron.
  Keywords: bipartite graph, directed graph, random graph, acyclic orientation, poly-Bernoulli numbers, lonesum matrices, generating function, analytic combinatorics, asymptotics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study infinite horizon nonzero-sum stochastic games for controlled discrete-time Markov chains on a Polish state space with risk-sensitive ergodic cost criterion. Under suitable assumptions we show that the associated ergodic optimality equations admit unique solutions. Finally, the existence of Nash-equilibrium in randomized stationary strategies is established by showing that an appropriate set-valued map has a fixed point.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal polynomials in the normal matrix model with two insertions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight $|z^2+a^2|^{cN}e^{-N|z|^2}$ in the whole complex plane. We obtain strong asymptotics and the limiting normalized zero counting measure (mother body) of the orthogonal polynomials of degree $n$ in the scaling limit $n,N\to \infty$ such that $\frac{n}{N}\to t$. We restrict ourselves to the case $a^2\geq 2c$, $cN$ integer, and $t&lt;t^{*}$ where $t^{*}$ is a constant depending only on $a,c$. Due to this restriction, the mother body is supported on an interval. We also find the two dimensional equilibrium measure (droplet) associated with the eigenvalues in the corresponding normal matrix model.
  Our method relies on the recent result that the planar orthogonal polynomials are a part of a vector of type I multiple orthogonal polynomials, and this enables us to apply the steepest descent method to the associated Riemann-Hilbert problem.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Unadjusted Langevin in High Dimensions: Delocalization of Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unadjusted Langevin algorithm is commonly used to sample probability distributions in extremely high-dimensional settings. However, existing analyses of the algorithm for strongly log-concave distributions suggest that, as the dimension $d$ of the problem increases, the number of iterations required to ensure convergence within a desired error in the $W_2$ metric scales in proportion to $d$ or $\sqrt{d}$. In this paper, we argue that, despite this poor scaling of the $W_2$ error for the full set of variables, the behavior for a small number of variables can be significantly better: a number of iterations proportional to $K$, up to logarithmic terms in $d$, often suffices for the algorithm to converge to within a desired $W_2$ error for all $K$-marginals. We refer to this effect as delocalization of bias. We show that the delocalization effect does not hold universally and prove its validity for Gaussian distributions and strongly log-concave distributions with certain sparse interactions. Our analysis relies on a novel $W_{2,\ell^\infty}$ metric to measure convergence. A key technical challenge we address is the lack of a one-step contraction property in this metric. Finally, we use asymptotic arguments to explore potential generalizations of the delocalization effect beyond the Gaussian and sparse interactions setting.</description>

      <title>Conformal Bootstrap for surfaces with boundary in Liouville CFT. Part 1: Segal axioms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the first part of the proof of the conformal bootstrap for Liouville conformal field theory on surfaces with a boundary, devoted to Segal's axioms in this context. We introduce the notion of Segal's amplitudes on surfaces with corners and prove the gluing property for such amplitudes. The semi-group of half-annuli and its generator are studied and we develop the necessary material for proving its spectral decomposition using scattering theory in the companion paper \cite{GRW2}. The Segal gluing properties and the spectral decomposition allows us to prove the conformal bootstrap formula for correlation functions of Liouville conformal field theory with a boundary. This has several important applications to the study of conformal blocks (analyticity and convergence) in \cite{remypreprint}, in the construction of a unitary representation of mapping class group in the space of conformal blocks, and the study of random moduli \cite{ARSmoduliRPM} in Liouville quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Optimal order time discretizations for stochastic semilinear wave equations with multiplicative noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with developing and analyzing two novel implicit temporal discretization methods for the stochastic semilinear wave equations with multiplicative noise. The proposed methods are natural extensions of well-known time-discrete schemes for deterministic wave equations, hence, they are easy to implement. It is proved that both methods are energy-stable. Moreover, the first method is shown to converge with the linear order in the energy norm, while the second method converges with the $\mathcal{O}(\tau^{\frac32})$ order in the $L^2$-norm, which is optimal with respect to the time regularity of the solution to the underlying stochastic PDE. The convergence analyses of both methods, which are different and quite involved, require some novel numerical techniques to overcome difficulties caused by the nonlinear noise term and the interplay between nonlinear drift and diffusion. Numerical experiments are provided to validate the sharpness of the theoretical error estimate results.</description>

      <title>Spin glass to paramagnetic transition and triple point in Spherical SK model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.07629v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies spin glass to paramagnetic transition in the Spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with ferromagnetic Curie-Weiss interaction with coupling constant $J$ and inverse temperature $\beta$. The disorder of the system is represented by a general Wigner matrix. We confirm a conjecture of \cite{Baik2016} and \cite{Baik2017}, that the critical window of temperatures for this transition is $\beta = 1 + bN^{-1/3} \sqrt{\log N}$ with $b\in\mathbb{R}$. The limiting distribution of the scaled free energy is Gaussian for negative $b$ and a weighted linear combination of independent Gaussian and Tracy-Widom components for positive $b$. In the special case where the Wigner matrix is from the Gaussian Orthogonal or Unitary Ensemble, we describe the triple point transition between spin glass, paramagnetic, and ferromagnetic regimes in a critical window for $(\beta, J)$ around the triple point $(1,1)$: the Tracy-Widom component is replaced by the one parameter family of deformations described by Bloemendal and Virag, \cite{BloVirI}.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.06489v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study weighted sums of free identically distributed self-adjoint random variables with weights chosen randomly from the unit sphere and show that the Kolmogorov distance between the distribution of such a weighted sum and Wigner's semicircle law is of order $n^{-1/2}$ with high probability. Replacing the Kolmogorov distance by a weaker pseudometric, we obtain a rate of convergence of order $n^{-1}$, thus providing a free analog of the Klartag-Sodin result in classical probability theory. Moreover, we show that our ideas generalize to the setting of sums of free non-identically distributed bounded self-adjoint random variables leading to a new rate of convergence in the free central limit theorem.</description>

Abstract: We prove, using the celebrated result by Spitzer about winding of planar Brownian motion, and the existence of harmonic morphisms $f:M\to{\mathbb S}^1$ representing cohomology classes in $\text{H}^1(M,\mathbb Z)$, that there is a stochastic process $H_t:{\mathcal C}(M)\to{\text{Hom}(\text{H}^1(M;\mathbb R), \mathbb R)}\simeq{\text{H}_1(M;\mathbb R)}$ ($t\in[0,\infty)$), where ${\mathcal C}(M)= \{ \alpha:[0, \infty) \to M :\alpha \,\, \text{is continuous} \}$, which has a multivariate Cauchy distribution i.e. such that for each nontrivial cohomology class $[\omega]\in{\text{H}^1(M;\mathbb R), \mathbb R)}$, represented by a closed 1-form $\omega$, in the de Rham cohomology, the process $A^\omega_t:{\mathcal C}(M)\to\mathbb R\,$ ($t\in[0,\infty)$) with $A^\omega_t(B)=H_t(B)([\omega]),\, B\in{\mathcal C}(M)$ converges in distribution, with respect to Wiener measure on ${\mathcal C}(M)$, to a Cauchy's distribution, with parameter 1. The process describes the ``homological winding" of the Brownian paths in $M$, thus it can be regarded as a generalization of Spitzer result. The last section discusses the asymptotic behavior of holonomy along Brownian paths.</description>

We prove decision tree generalizations of the Harris--Kleitman (HK), van den Berg--Kesten (vdBK), and other inequalities.

Abstract: In this paper, we compute the expected logarithmic energy of solutions to the polynomial eigenvalue problem for random matrices. We generalize some known results for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two processes are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue problem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases. In particular, the roots of the Shub-Smale polynomials are the ones with the lowest logarithmic energy of the family.</description>

      <title>A new lower bound for deterministic pop-stack-sorting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pop-stack-sorting process is a variation of the stack-sort process. We consider a deterministic version of this process, and provide a new lower bound of $\frac{3}{5}n$ for the number of sorts to fully sort a uniformly randomly chosen permutation via a useful lemma.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Multidimensional Long-Range Random Field Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14150v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend a recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in a class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fr\"ohlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting, proposed by two of us, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fr\"ohlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha &gt; d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative approach that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen suggested that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.</description>

      <title>Detecting random bifurcations via rigorous enclosures of large deviations rate functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main goal of this work is to provide a description of transitions from uniform to non-uniform snychronization in diffusions based on large deviation estimates for finite time Lyapunov exponents. These can be characterized in terms of moment Lyapunov exponents which are principal eigenvalues of the generator of the tilted (Feynman-Kac) semigroup. Using a computer assisted proof, we demonstrate how to determine these eigenvalues and investigate the rate function which is the Legendre-Fenichel transform of the moment Lyapunov function. We apply our results to two case studies: the pitchfork bifurcation and a two-dimensional toy model, also considering the transition to a positive asymptotic Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Uniform Borel amenability is equivalent to randomized hyperfiniteness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether Borel amenability implies hyperfiniteness is a main open question in the theory of Borel equivalence relations. Under a mild extra uniformity condition, we prove that Borel amenability of bounded degree Borel graphs is equivalent to a randomized version of hyperfiniteness. Our new approach yields simple proofs and generalizations for the Ornstein-Weiss theorem, the Quasi-Tiling theorem and the Connes-Feldman-Weiss theorem. One result is that the main conjecture holds up to a compressible set (that is, a set that admits no invariant probability measure).</description>
