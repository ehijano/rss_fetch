      <title>Nanoscale Surfactant Transport: Bridging Molecular and Continuum Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surfactant transport is central to a diverse range of natural phenomena, and for many practical applications in physics and engineering. Surprisingly, this process remains relatively poorly understood at the molecular scale. This study investigates the mechanism behind the transport of surfactant monolayers on flat and curved liquid vapor interfaces using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, which are compared with the continuum transport model. This approach not only provides fresh molecular level insight into surfactant dynamics, but also confirms the nanoscale mechanism of the lateral migration of surfactant molecules along a thin film that continuously deforms as surfactants spread. By connecting the continuum model where the long wave approximations prevail, to the molecular details where such approximations break down, we establish that the transport equation preserves substantial accuracy in capturing the underlying physics. Moreover, the relative importance of the different mechanisms of the transport process are identified. Consequently, we derive a novel, exact molecular equation for surfactant transport along a deforming surface. Finally, our findings demonstrate that the spreading of surfactants at the molecular scale adheres to expected scaling laws and aligns well with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>You Have to Grow Wefts to Fold Them</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knitting turns a one dimensional yarn into a highly ramified three-dimensional structure. As a method of additive manufacturing, it holds promise for a new class of lightweight, ultrastrong materials. Here we present a purely geometric model to predict the three-dimensional folding of knitted fabrics made only of the two traditional stitches, knit and purl.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Interpretation of Simulated Polymer Mean-Square Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a path for making quantitative analyses of mean-square displacement curves of polymer chains in the melt or in solution. The approach invokes a general functional form that accurately describes $g(t) \equiv \langle (\Delta x(t))^{2} \rangle$ for all times at which $g(t)$ was measured, and that gives values for the logarithmic derivative of $g(t)$ for the same times. By these means we can readily distinguish between regimes in which $g(t)$ follows a power law in time, does not follow a power law in time, or has an inflection point. In a power-law regime, the method accurately determines the exponent, without imposing any assumption as to the exponent's value.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Modeling of Lipid Nanoparticle Formation for the Delivery of Nucleic Acid Therapeutics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nucleic acids such as mRNA have emerged as a promising therapeutic modality with the capability of addressing a wide range of diseases. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) as a delivery platform for nucleic acids were used in the COVID-19 vaccines and have received much attention. While modern manufacturing processes which involve rapidly mixing an organic stream containing the lipids with an aqueous stream containing the nucleic acids are conceptually straightforward, detailed understanding of LNP formation and structure is still limited and scale-up can be challenging. Mathematical and computational methods are a promising avenue for deepening scientific understanding of the LNP formation process and facilitating improved process development and control. This article describes strategies for the mechanistic modeling of LNP formation, starting with strategies to estimate and predict important physicochemical properties of the various species such as diffusivities and solubilities. Subsequently, a framework is outlined for constructing mechanistic models of reactor- and particle-scale processes. Insights gained from the various models are mapped back to product quality attributes and process insights. Lastly, the use of the models to guide development of advanced process control and optimization strategies is discussed.</description>

      <title>Early-time wetting kinetics in surface-directed spinodal decomposition for off-critical quenches: A molecular dynamics study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation of surface-directed spinodal decomposition (SDSD) in binary fluid mixtures ($A+B$) with off-critical compositions. The aim is to elucidate the role of composition ratio in the early-time wetting kinetics under the influence of long-range surface potential. In our simulations, the attractive part of surface potential varies as $V(z)= -\epsilon_a/z^{n}$, with $\epsilon_{a}$ being the surface-potential strength. The surface prefers `$A$' species to form the wetting layer. Its thickness [$R_1(t)$] for the majority wetting (number of $A$-type particles [$N_A$] &gt; number of $B$-type particles [$N_B$]), grows as a power-law with an exponent $1/(n+2)$. This is consistent with the early-time kinetics in the form of potential-dependent growth present in the Puri-Binder model. However, for minority wetting ($N_A$ &lt; $N_B$), the growth exponent in $R_1(t)$ is less than $1/(n+2)$. Furthermore, on decreasing the field strength $\epsilon_{a}$, we recover $1/(n+2)$ for a minority wetting case. We provide phenomenological arguments to explain the early-time wetting kinetics for both cases.</description>

      <title>Kinematics of degree-4 rigid origami vertices: Lorentz transformations, fold-angle multipliers, and rigid-foldable polygon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We offer new insight into the folding kinematics of degree-4 rigid origami vertices by drawing an analogy to spacetime in special relativity. Specifically, folded states of the vertex, described by pairs of fold angles in terms of cotangent of half-angles, are related through Lorentz transformations in $1+1$ dimensions. We obtain linear ordinary differential equations describing the tangent vectors on two-dimensional fold-angle planes, with the coefficient matrix depending exclusively on the sector angles. By taking the limit to the flat state, we generalize the fold-angle multipliers previously defined for flat-foldable vertices to general and collinear developable degree-4 vertices, and obtain a compatibility theorem on the rigid-foldability of polygons with $n$ developable degree-4 vertices. We further explore the rigid-foldable polygon of equimodular type and compose tangent vectors involving fold angles at the creases of the central polygon.</description>

      <title>The Joint Solvation Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solvent-induced interactions (SII) between flexible solutes can be separated into two distinct components: the solvation-induced conformational effect, and the joint solvation interaction (JSI). The JSI quantifies the thermodynamic effect of the solvent simultaneously accommodating the solutes, generalizing the typical notion of the hydrophobic interaction. We present a formal definition of the JSI within the framework of the mixture expansion, demonstrate that this definition is equivalent to the SII between rigid solutes, and propose a method, partially-connected molecular dynamics, which allows one to compute the interaction with existing free energy algorithms. We also compare the JSI to the more natural generalization of the hydrophobic interaction, the indirect solvent-mediated interaction, and argue that JSI is a more useful quantity for studying solute binding thermodynamics. Direct calculation of the JSI may prove useful in developing our understanding of solvent effects in self-assembly, protein aggregation, and protein folding, for which the isolation of the JSI from the conformational component of the SII becomes important due to the intra-species flexibility.</description>

      <title>In-situ tunneling control in photonic potentials by Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08582v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tunability of individual coupling amplitudes in photonic lattices is highly desirable for photonic Hamiltonian engineering and for studying topological transitions in situ. In this work, we demonstrate the tunneling control between individual lattice sites patterned inside an optical microcavity. The tuning is achieved by applying a voltage to a liquid crystal microcavity possessing photonic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. This type of spin-orbit coupling emerges due to the high birefringence of the liquid crystal material and constitutes an artificial gauge field for photons. The proposed technique can be combined with strong-light matter coupling and non-Hermitian physics already established in liquid crystal microcavities.</description>

      <title>Gauge Invariance of Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We identify a recently proposed shifting operation on classical phase space as a gauge transformation for statistical mechanical microstates. The infinitesimal generators of the continuous gauge group form a non-commutative Lie algebra, which induces exact sum rules when thermally averaged. Gauge invariance with respect to finite shifting is demonstrated via Monte Carlo simulation in the transformed phase space which generates identical equilibrium averages. Our results point towards a deeper basis of statistical mechanics than previously known and they offer avenues for systematic construction of exact identities and of sampling algorithms.</description>
