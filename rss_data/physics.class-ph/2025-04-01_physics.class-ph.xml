      <title>Coarse-grained entropy balance of the Szilard engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to reconcile the entropy reduction of a system through external interventions that are linked to a measurement with the second law of thermodynamics, there are two main proposals: (i) The entropy reduction is compensated by the entropy increase as a result of the measurement on the system (``Szilard principle"). (ii) The entropy reduction is compensated by the entropy increase as a result of the erasure of the measurement results (``Landauer/Bennett principle"). It seems that the LB principle is widely accepted in the scientific debate. In contrast, in this paper we argue for a modified S principle and criticize the LB principle with regard to various points. Our approach is based on the concept of ``conditional action", which is developed in detail. To illustrate our theses, we consider the entropy balance of a variant of the well-known Szilard engine, understood as a classical mechanical system.</description>

      <title>Complex Berry phase and steady-state geometric amplification in non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the dynamics of coupled oscillators is important for a wide range of scientific and technological endeavors. Two concepts that have generated new insights into this topic are Berry phase (oscillators' memory of how they have been tuned) and non-Hermiticity (damping and its often counter-intuitive consequences). Here we describe measurements of the interplay between these two phenomena that highlight the qualitative changes they induce in each other. In particular, non-Hermiticity changes the Berry phase from a real to a complex number, opening new avenues for controlling the flow of energy in oscillators. We illustrate this by demonstrating a broadly applicable means for converting a system's intrinsic damping into a novel form of amplification.</description>

      <title>Determining diffusivity and dissipation of diffuse body waves in concrete with multiple planar boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23854v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for determining the diffusive properties of diffuse body waves, specifically diffusivity and dissipation, in concrete with multiple planar boundaries. Instead of relying on the analytical solution to the diffusion equation, which accounts for all possible reflections and has a significantly complex form, we propose a simpler method that considers the reflected energy originating from a limited number of image sources, making it easier to perform curve fitting and obtain diffusive properties. Our experimental findings highlight that distant image sources have a negligible effect on the acquired diffusive properties, suggesting that the number of image sources considered should be determined based on their maximum contribution to the main energy. Additionally, failing to account for the reflected energy during the fitting process results in an underestimation of both the diffusivity and dissipation. The obtained diffusive properties can be used to evaluate damage in concrete.</description>

      <title>Attraction of a jerk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jerk plays a pivotal role in the thrilling experience of many amusemement park rides. In addition to exploring the physical aspect of jerks, we tackle the empirical observation of an attractive force between passengers in the popular attraction, the spinning teacups. By modeling the complex system of rotating platforms, we show that pseudotorques induced by changing acceleration lead to jerky movements and an attractive interaction among riders. Our numerical analysis confirms the empirical observations, highlighting the connection between attraction and jerks.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically accurate and locking-free finite element implementation of the refined shell theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A formulation of the 2D refined shell theory incorporating transverse shear in the rescaled coordinates and angles of rotation is considered. This novel approach provides the first asymptotically accurate and inherently locking-free finite element implementation. Numerical simulations of semi-cylindrical shells demonstrate excellent agreement between the analytical solution, the 2D refined shell theory, and three-dimensional elasticity theory, validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the method.</description>

      <title>The limits of knowledge in classical physics resemble the quantum uncertainty relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building upon a recent analysis of the measurement process in Hamiltonian mechanics, this article investigates the Bayesian epistemology of classical physics -- the landscape of accessible probability distributions over phase space. I prove a thermodynamic limitation on the information that can be obtained about a classical system by means of observations: A direct analogue of the Robertson-Schr\"odinger quantum uncertainty relation controls the acquisition of information at the classical microscale. Central to this theorem is the notion of the "quality" of a measuring probe; a temperature-dependent strictly positive quantity that serves as a figure of merit of the probe, and that plays the role of $1/\hbar$ in the classical uncertainty relation. This study sets the stage for a new area of research into resource theories of classical measurement, in which high-quality measurements and high-information states of knowledge are the limited resources.</description>

      <title>Gradient catastrophe and Peregrine soliton in nonlinear flexible mechanical metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the generation of extreme wave events in mechanical metamaterials using the regularization of the gradient catastrophe theory developed by A. Tovbis and M. Bertola for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. According to this theory, Peregrine solitons can locally emerge in the semiclassical limit of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. Our objective is to determine whether the phenomenon of gradient catastrophe can occur in a class of architected structures designated as flexible mechanical metamaterials, both with and without losses. We demonstrate theoretically and numerically that this phenomenon can occur in a canonical example of such flexible mechanical metamaterial, a chain of rotating units, studied earlier for its ability to support robust nonlinear waves such as elastic vector solitons. We find that in the presence of weak losses, the gradient catastrophe persists although the amplitude of extreme generated events is smaller and their onset is delayed compared to the lossless configuration.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other. However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes. Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Influence of elastic deformations on body-wave velocity in solids: a case study considering shear deformations in concrete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the influence of elastic deformation on the velocity of body waves in compressible isotropic materials making use of the framework of acoustoelasticity. Specifically, it examines body waves propagating at an angle to the principal deformation axes, where both shear and normal deformations are present in the coordinate system defined by the wave propagation direction. While numerous efforts have addressed this topic, the theoretical derivations have not yet to provide definitive conclusions about the response of wave velocity to applied shear stresses and strains. To derive more specific conclusions for body waves in concrete, we analyzed three examples using concrete as the medium. The key findings are that, in case of concrete materials when body waves propagate on the shear deformation plane, variations in longitudinal wave velocity are predominantly attributed to changes in normal strains, whereas transverse wave velocity is significantly influenced by both normal and shear strains. This finding can enhance the use of acoustoelasticity for detecting the magnitudes and directions of principal stresses in plane stress state applications.</description>
