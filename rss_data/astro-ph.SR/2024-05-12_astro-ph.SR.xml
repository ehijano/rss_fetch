      <title>Wide post-common envelope binaries from Gaia: orbit validation and formation models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrometry from {\it Gaia} DR3 has enabled the discovery of a sample of 3000+ binaries containing white dwarfs (WD) and main-sequence (MS) stars in relatively wide orbits, with orbital periods $P_{\rm orb} = (100-1000)$ d. This population was not predicted by binary population synthesis models before {\it Gaia} and -- if the {\it Gaia} orbits are robust -- likely requires very efficient envelope ejection during common envelope evolution (CEE). To assess the reliability of the {\it Gaia} solutions, we measured multi-epoch radial velocities (RVs) of 31 WD+MS binary candidates with $P_{\rm orb} = (40-300)$ d and \texttt{AstroSpectroSB1} orbital solutions. We jointly fit the RVs and astrometry, allowing us to validate the {\it Gaia} solutions and tighten constraints on component masses. We find a high success rate for the {\it Gaia} solutions, with only 2 out of the 31 systems showing significant discrepancies between their {\it Gaia} orbital solutions and our RVs. Joint fitting of RVs and astrometry allows us to directly constrain the secondary-to-primary flux ratio $\mathcal{S}$, and we find $\mathcal{S}\lesssim 0.02$ for most objects, confirming the companions are indeed WDs. We tighten constraints on the binaries' eccentricities, finding a median $e\approx 0.1$. These eccentricities are much lower than those of normal MS+MS binaries at similar periods, but much higher than predicted for binaries formed via stable mass transfer. We present MESA single and binary evolution models to explore how the binaries may have formed. The orbits of most binaries in the sample can be produced through CEE that begins when the WD progenitor is an AGB star, corresponding to initial separations of $2-5$ au. Roughly 50\% of all post-common envelope binaries are predicted to have first interacted on the AGB, ending up in wide orbits like these systems.</description>

      <title>Abundances in eight bulge stars from the optical and near-infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: The abundances of the $\alpha$-elements are key for understanding the early chemical enrichment of the Galactic bulge. The elements of interest present lines in different wavelength regions, and some of them show lines only in part of the spectra. In the present work, the CNO trio, the alpha-elements Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti, and odd-Z Na and Al are examined as measured from optical and H-band lines.
  Aims: The aim of this work is to carry out a detailed comparison of stellar parameters and abundances derived in the optical and near-infrared (H-band). We also inspect the best available lines for a list of bulge stars previously analyzed by the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) team in the H-band and by our group in the optical. This work is mainly of interest to spectroscopists.
  Methods: In the present work, we compared the stellar parameters and abundance results derived from APOGEE H-band spectra with optical analyses based on Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope (VLT/UVES) data for eight bulge stars.
  Results:We point out the most suitable wavelength region for each of the studied elements, and highlight difficulties in the derivation of stellar parameters both in the optical and H-band. The near-infrared will allow observations of a large number of stars in the near future given new instruments soon to be available. The identification of spectral lines in this spectral region and the investigation of their reliability are ongoing efforts worldwide. New instruments will also allow simultaneous observation of H-band and optical.</description>

      <title>Toward a live homogeneous database of solar active regions based on SOHO/MDI and SDO/HMI synoptic magnetograms.II.parameters for solar cycle variability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar active regions (ARs) determine solar polar fields and cause solar cycle variability within the framework of the Babcock-Leighton (BL) dynamo. The contribution of an AR to the polar field is measured by its dipole field, which results from flux emergence and subsequent flux transport over the solar surface. The dipole fields contributed by an AR before and after the flux transport are referred to as the initial and final dipole fields, respectively. For a better understanding and prediction of solar cycles, in this paper, we provide a database including AR's initial and final dipole fields and the corresponding results of their bipolar magnetic region (BMR) approximation from 1996 onwards. We also identify the repeated ARs and provide the optimized transport parameters. Based on our database, we find that although the commonly used BMR approximation performs well for the initial dipole field, it exhibits a significant deviation for the final dipole field. To accurately assess an AR's contribution to the polar field, the final dipole field with its real configuration should be applied. Despite the notable contributions of a few rogue ARs, approximately the top 500 ARs ordered by their final dipole fields are necessary to derive the polar field at the cycle minimum. While flux transport may increase or decrease the dipole field for an individual AR, its collective impact over all ARs in a cycle is a reduction in their total dipole field.</description>

      <title>M3DIS - A grid of 3D radiation-hydrodynamics stellar atmosphere models for stellar surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale stellar surveys, such as SDSS-V, 4MOST, WEAVE, and PLATO, require accurate atmospheric models and synthetic spectra of stars for accurate analyses of fundamental stellar parameters and chemical abundances. The primary goal of our work is to develop a new approach to solve radiation-hydrodynamics (RHD) and generate model stellar spectra in a self-consistent and highly efficient framework. We build upon the Copenhagen legacy RHD code, the MULTI3D non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) code, and the DISPATCH high-performance framework. The new approach allows us to calculate 3D RHD models of stellar atmospheres on timescales of a few thousand CPU hours and to perform subsequent spectrum synthesis in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) or NLTE for the desired physical conditions within the parameter space of FGK-type stars. We compare the 3D RHD solar model with other available models and validate its performance against solar observations, including the centre-to-limb variation of intensities and key solar diagnostic lines of H and Fe. We show that the performance of the new code allows to overcome the main bottleneck in 3D NLTE spectroscopy and enables calculations of multi-dimensional grids of synthetic stellar observables for comparison with modern astronomical observations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of an Oscillating Eclipsing Algol: Y Cam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Y Cam is classified as one of the oscillating Eclipsing Algol (oEA) systems, which feature a $\delta$ Scuti-type pulsating component alongside mass transfer phenomena. oEA systems are invaluable for probing the evolutionary processes and internal structures of binary components offering insights through their binary variations and oscillating. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive investigation of Y Cam utilizing high-quality photometric TESS data, and high-resolution ELODIE spectra. Through our analysis, we examined the radial velocity variation, performed binary modeling, and calculated the effective temperature values of binary components. The fundamental stellar parameters, such as mass and radius, were determined with an accuracy of $\sim$ $2-6$ %. Furthermore, we examined the orbital period variation to assess the amount of mass transfer using the available minima times of the system and three new minima times obtained from TESS light curves. Analyzing the pulsation structure of the system with the TESS data revealed the dominant pulsation period and amplitude of the pulsating component to be 0.066 d and 4.65 mmag, respectively. Notably, we observed frequency modulations with the orbital period's frequency, along with variations in the amplitude of the highest amplitude frequency across different orbital phases. Remarkably, the amplitude reaches its peak at phases 0.5 and 1. These findings indicate a candidate of a tidally tilted pulsator. Consequently, we investigated the evolutionary status of the binary components using MESA binary evolution models, determining the age of the system to be 3.28 $\pm$ 0.09 Gyr.</description>

      <title>Solar fusion III: New data and theory for hydrogen-burning stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In stars that lie on the main sequence in the Hertzsprung Russel diagram, like our sun, hydrogen is fused to helium in a number of nuclear reaction chains and series, such as the proton-proton chain and the carbon-nitrogen-oxygen cycles. Precisely determined thermonuclear rates of these reactions lie at the foundation of the standard solar model. This review, the third decadal evaluation of the nuclear physics of hydrogen-burning stars, is motivated by the great advances made in recent years by solar neutrino observatories, putting experimental knowledge of the proton-proton chain neutrino fluxes in the few-percent precision range. The basis of the review is a one-week community meeting held in July 2022 in Berkeley, California, and many subsequent digital meetings and exchanges. Each of the relevant reactions of solar and quiescent stellar hydrogen burning is reviewed here, from both theoretical and experimental perspectives. Recommendations for the state of the art of the astrophysical S-factor and its uncertainty are formulated for each of them. Several other topics of paramount importance for the solar model are reviewed, as well: recent and future neutrino experiments, electron screening, radiative opacities, and current and upcoming experimental facilities. In addition to reaction-specific recommendations, also general recommendations are formed.</description>

      <title>Solar prominence diagnostics and their associated estimated errors from 1D NLTE Mg II h&amp;k modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We present further development of the rolling root mean square (rRMS) algorithm. These improvements consist of an increase in computational speed and an estimation of the uncertainty on the recovered diagnostics. This improvement is named the cross root mean square (xRMS) algorithm.
  Methods. We used the quantile method to recover the statistics of the line profiles in order to study the evolution of the prominence observed by IRIS on 1 October 2019. We then introduced the improvements to rRMS. These improvements greatly increased the computational speed, and this increase in speed allowed us to use a large model grid. Thus, we utilised a grid of 23 940 models to recover the thermodynamic diagnostics. We used the 'good' (but not 'best') fitting models to recover an estimate of the uncertainty on the recovered diagnostics.
  Results. The maximum line-of-sight (LOS) velocities were found to be 70 km/s. The line widths were mostly 0.4 {\AA} with the asymmetries of most pixels around zero. The central temperature of the prominence was found to range from 10 kK to 20 kK, with uncertainties of approximately +/-5 to +/-15 kK. The central pressure was around 0.2 dyn/cm2, with uncertainties of +/-0.2 to +/-0.3 dyn/cm2. The ionisation degree ranged from 1 to 1000, with uncertainties mostly in the range +/-10 to +/-100. The electron density was mostly 10^10 /cm3, with uncertainties of mostly +/-10^9.
  Conclusions. The new xRMS algorithm finds an estimation of the errors of the recovered thermodynamic properties. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at systematically determining the errors from forward modelling. The large range of errors found may hint at the degeneracies present when using a single ion and/or species from forward modelling. In the future, co-aligned observations of more than one ion and/or species should be used to attempt to constrain this problem.</description>

      <title>Origin and Evolution of Angular Momentum of Class II Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. While Class II stars have already accreted most of their mass, the continued inflow of fresh material via Bondi-Hoyle accretion acts as an additional mass reservoir for their circumstellar disks. This may explain the observed accretion rates of pre-main- sequence (PMS) stars, as well as observational inconsistencies in the mass and angular momentum balance of their disks. Aims. Using a new simulation that reproduces the stellar IMF, we want to quantify the role of Bondi-Hoyle accretion in the formation of Class II disks, as well address the prospect of its observational detection with the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Methods. We study the mass and angular momentum of the accreting gas using passively-advected tracer particles in the simulation, and we carry out radiative transfer calculations of near-infrared scattering to generate synthetic JWST observations of Bondi-Hoyle trails of PMS stars. Results. Gas accreting on Class II PMS stars approximately 1 Myr after their formation has enough mass and angular momentum to strongly affect the evolution of the preexisting disks. The accreted angular momentum is large enough to also explain the observed size of Class II disks. The orientation of the angular momentum vector can differ significantly from that of the previously accreted gas, which may result in a significant disk warping or misalignment. We also predict that JWST observations of Class II stars will be able to detect Bondi-Hoyle trails with a 90% success rate with only 2 min exposure time, if stars with accretion rates \dot{M} &gt; 5e-10 Msol/yr and luminosity of L &gt; 0.5 Lsol are selected.</description>

      <title>Separating States in Astronomical Sources Using Hidden Markov Models: With a Case Study of Flaring and Quiescence on EV Lac</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new method to distinguish between different states (e.g., high and low, quiescent and flaring) in astronomical sources with count data. The method models the underlying physical process as latent variables following a continuous-space Markov chain that determines the expected Poisson counts in observed light curves in multiple passbands. For the underlying state process, we consider several autoregressive processes, yielding continuous-space hidden Markov models of varying complexity. Under these models, we can infer the state that the object is in at any given time. The state predictions from these models are then dichotomized with the help of a finite-mixture model to produce state classifications. We apply these techniques to X-ray data from the active dMe flare star EV Lac, splitting the data into quiescent and flaring states. We find that a first-order vector autoregressive process efficiently separates flaring from quiescence: flaring occurs over 30-40% of the observation durations, a well-defined persistent quiescent state can be identified, and the flaring state is characterized by higher temperatures and emission measures.</description>

      <title>ExoplANETS-A: A VO database for host stars and planetary systems: The effect of XUV on planet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ExoplANETS-A is an EU Horizon-2020 project with the primary objective of establishing new knowledge on exoplanet atmospheres. Intimately related to this topic is the study of the host-stars radiative properties in order to understand the environment in which exoplanets lie.
  The aim of this work is to exploit archived data from space-based observatories and other public sources to produce uniform sets of stellar data that can establish new insight on the influence of the host star on the planetary atmosphere. We have compiled X-ray and UV luminosities, which affect the formation and the atmospheric properties of the planets, and stellar parameters, which impact the retrieval process of the planetary-atmosphere's properties and its errors.
  Our sample is formed of all transiting-exoplanet systems observed by HST or Spitzer. It includes 205 exoplanets and their 114 host-stars. We have built a catalogue with information extracted from public, online archives augmented by quantities derived by the Exoplanets-A work. With this catalogue we have implemented an online database which also includes X-ray and OHP spectra and TESS light curves. In addition, we have developed a tool, exoVOSA, which is able to fit the spectral energy distribution of exoplanets.
  We give an example of using the database to study the effects of the host-star high-energy emission on the exoplanet atmosphere. The sample has a planet radius valley which is located at 1.8 Earth radii, in agreement with previous studies. Multiplanet systems in our sample were used to test the photoevaporation model and we find that out of 14 systems, only one significant case poses a contradiction to it (K2-3). In summary, the exoplanet and stellar resources compiled and generated by ExoplANETS-A form a sound basis for current JWST observations and for future work in the era of Ariel.</description>

      <title>A numerical code for the analysis of magnetic white dwarf spectra that includes field effects on the chemical equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new magnetic atmosphere model code for obtaining synthetic spectral fluxes of hydrogen-rich magnetic white dwarfs. To date, observed spectra have been analyzed with models that neglet the magnetic field effects on the atomic populations. In this work, we incorporate to state-of-art theory into the evaluation of numerical densities of atoms, free electrons and ions in local thermodynamical equilibrium under the action of a magnetic field. The energy distribution of atoms is rigorously evaluated for arbitrary field strength. This energy pattern includes from tightly bound states to metastable or truly bound, highly excited states embedded in the continuum, i.e., over the first Landau level. Finite nuclear mass effects and the coupling between the internal atomic structure and the motion of the atom across the magnetic field are also considered. Synthetic fluxes are generated with integrations of numerical solutions of polarized radiative transfer over the visible stellar disk using a spherical $t$-design method. The atmosphere code is tested with observations from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for a group of known magnetic white dwarfs. Physical stellar parameters are obtained from least-squares fits to the observed energy distribution and compared with results of previous works. We show that the use of zerofield ionization equilibrium in spectral analysis can lead to underestimated effective temperatures for high magnetic white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Supernova Explosions of the Lowest-Mass Massive Star Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We here focus on the behavior of supernovae that technically explode in 1D (spherical symmetry). When simulated in 3D, however, the outcomes of representative progenitors of this class are quite different in almost all relevant quantities. In 3D, the explosion energies can be two to ten times higher, and there are correspondingly large differences in the $^{56}$Ni yields. These differences between the 3D and 1D simulations reflect in part the relative delay to explosion of the latter and in the former the presence of proto-neutron star convection that boosts the driving neutrino luminosities by as much as $\sim$50\% at later times. In addition, we find that the ejecta in 3D models are more neutron-rich, resulting in significant weak r-process and $^{48}$Ca yields. Furthermore, we find that in 3D the core is an interesting, though subdominant, source of acoustic power. In summary, we find that though a model might be found theoretically to explode in 1D, one must perform supernova simulations in 3D to capture most of the associated observables. The differences between 1D and 3D models are just too large to ignore.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06026v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations plus 'non-ideal' (Ohmic, Hall, ambipolar) resistivities are widely used to model weakly-ionized astrophysical systems. We show that if gradients in the magnetic field become too steep, the implied charge drift speeds become much faster than microphysical signal speeds, invalidating the assumptions used to derive both the resistivities and MHD equations themselves. Generically this situation will excite microscale instabilities that suppress the drift and current. We show this could be relevant at low ionization fractions especially if Hall terms appear significant, external forces induce supersonic motions, or dust grains become a dominant charge carrier. Considering well-established treatments of super-thermal drifts in laboratory, terrestrial, and Solar plasmas as well as conduction and viscosity models, we generalize a simple prescription to rectify these issues, where the resistivities are multiplied by a correction factor that depends only on already-known macroscopic quantities. This is generalized for multi-species and weakly-ionized systems, and leaves the equations unchanged in the drift limits for which they are derived, but restores physical behavior (driving the system back towards slow drift by diffusing away small-scale gradients in the magnetic field) if the limits are violated. This has important consequences: restoring intuitive behaviors such as the system becoming hydrodynamic in the limit of zero ionization; suppressing magnetic structure on scales below a critical length which can comparable to circumstellar disk sizes; limiting the maximum magnetic amplification; and suppressing the effects of the Hall term in particular. This likely implies that the Hall term does not become dynamically important under most conditions of interest in these systems.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for reconstruction of polarity inversion lines from solar filaments</title>

Abstract: Solar filaments are well-known tracers of polarity inversion lines that separate two opposite magnetic polarities on the solar photosphere. Because observations of filaments began long before the systematic observations of solar magnetic fields, historical filament catalogs can facilitate the reconstruction of magnetic polarity maps at times when direct magnetic observations were not yet available. In practice, this reconstruction is often ambiguous and typically performed manually. We propose an automatic approach based on a machine-learning model that generates a variety of magnetic polarity maps consistent with filament observations. To evaluate the model and discuss the results we use the catalog of solar filaments and polarity maps compiled by McIntosh. We realize that the process of manual compilation of polarity maps includes not only information on filaments, but also a large amount of prior information, which is difficult to formalize. In order to compensate for the lack of prior knowledge for the machine-learning model, we provide it with polarity information at several reference points. We demonstrate that this process, which can be considered as the user-guided reconstruction or super-resolution, leads to polarity maps that are reasonably close to hand-drawn ones, and additionally allows for uncertainty estimation.</description>

      <title>Phosphorus enrichment by ONe novae in the Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent observations have shown that [P/Fe] in the Galactic stars decreases with increasing [Fe/H] for [Fe/H] &gt; -1 whereas it is almost subsolar for [Fe/H]&lt; -2. These [P/Fe] trends with [Fe/H] have not been well reproduced by previous theoretical models incorporating phosphorus (P) enrichment only by core collapse supernoave. We here show, for the first time, that the trends can be naturally explained by our new models incorporating P enrichment by oxygen-neon (ONe) novae which occur at the surface of massive white dwarfs whose masses are larger than 1.25 M_sun with a metallicity-dependence rate. We also show that the observations can be better reproduced by the models by assuming that (i) the total mass of gaseous ejecta per ONe nov (M_ej) is as high as 4 * 10^{-5} M_sun and (ii) the number of such novae per unit mass (N_ONe) is as large as 0.01 at [Fe/H]~-3. The assumed M_ej is consistent with observations, and the high N_ONe is expected from recent theoretical models for ONe nova fractions. We predict that (i) [P/Fe] increases with increasing [Fe/H] for -2 &lt; [Fe/H] &lt; -1 and (ii) [P/Fe] and [Cl/Fe] trends with [Fe/H] are very similar with each other due to very large yields of P and Cl from ONe nova. It is thus worthwhile for future observations to assess the validity of the proposed P enrichment by ONe novae by confirming or ruling out these two predictions.</description>

      <title>Deceleration of kicked objects due to the Galactic potential</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various stellar objects experience a velocity kick at some point in their evolution. These include neutron stars and black holes at their birth or binary systems when one of the two components goes supernova. For most of these objects, the magnitude of the kick and its impact on the object dynamics remains a topic of debate. We investigate how kicks alter the velocity distribution of objects born in the Milky Way disc, both immediately after the kick and at later times, and whether these kicks are encoded in the observed population of Galactic neutron stars. We simulate the Galactic trajectories of point masses on circular orbits in the disc after being perturbed by an isotropic kick, with a Maxwellian distribution of magnitudes with $\sigma=265$ km/s. Then, we simulate the motion of these point masses for $200$ Myr. These trajectories are then evaluated, either for the Milky Way population as a whole or for those passing within two kiloparsecs of the Sun, to get the time evolution of the velocities. During the first $20$ Myr, the bulk velocity of kicked objects becomes temporarily aligned to the cylindrical radius, implying an anisotropy in the velocity orientations. Beyond this age, the velocity distribution shifts toward lower values and settles to a median of $\sim200$ km/s. Around the Sun, the distribution also loses its upper tail, primarily due to unbound objects escaping the Galaxy. We compare this to the velocities of Galactic pulsars and find that pulsars show a similar evolution with characteristic age. The shift of the velocity distribution is due to bound objects spending most of their orbits at larger radii after the kick. They are, therefore, decelerated by the Galactic potential. We find the same deceleration to be predicted for nearby objects and the total population and conclude it is also observed in Galactic pulsars.</description>

      <title>Advancing Precision Particle Background Estimation for Future X-ray Missions: Correlated Variability between AMS and Chandra/XMM-Newton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) particles have a significant impact on the particle-induced background of X-ray observatories, and their flux exhibits substantial temporal variability, potentially influencing background levels. In this study, we present one-day binned high-energy reject rates derived from the Chandra-ACIS and XMM-Newton EPIC-pn instruments, serving as proxies for GCR particle flux. We systematically analyze the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates and compare them with the AMS proton flux. Our analysis initially reveals robust correlations between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates when binned over 27-day intervals. However, a closer examination reveals substantial fluctuations within each 27-day bin, indicating shorter-term variability. Upon daily binning, we observe finer. temporal structures in the datasets, demonstrating the presence of recurrent variations with periods of $\sim$ 25 days and 23 days in ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively, spanning the years 2014 to 2018. Notably, during the 2016--2017 period, we additionally detect periodicities of $\sim$13.5 days and 9 days in the ACIS and EPIC-pn reject rates, respectively. Intriguingly, we observe a time lag of $\sim$ 6 days between the AMS proton flux and the ACIS/EPIC-pn reject rates during the second half of 2016. This time lag is not visible before 2016 and aftern2017. The underlying physical mechanisms responsible for this time lag remain a subject of ongoing investigation.</description>

      <title>Climbing the Cliffs: Classifying YSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs JWST Data using a Probabilistic Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the first observations released to the public from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) was a section of the star-forming region NGC 3324 known colloquially as the "Cosmic Cliffs." We build a photometric catalog of the region and test the ability of using the Probabilistic Random Forest machine learning method to identify its Young Stellar Objects (YSOs). We find 450 candidate YSOs (cYSOs) out of 19~497 total objects within the field, 413 of which are cYSOs not found in previous works. These classifications are verified with several different metrics, including recall and precision. Using the obtained probabilities of objects being YSOs, we employ a Monte Carlo approach to determine the surface density of cYSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs, which we find to be largely coincident with column densities derived from Herschel data, up to a column density of 1.37 $\times$ 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$. The newly determined number and spatial distribution of YSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs demonstrate that JWST is far more capable of detecting YSOs in dusty regions than Spitzer. Comparisons of the observed colors and brightness of faint cYSOs with those of pre-main-sequence models suggest JWST has detected a significant population of sub-stellar YSOs in the Cosmic Cliffs. The size of this population further suggests previous estimates of star formation efficiencies in molecular clouds have been systematically low.</description>

      <title>Fits for the convective envelope mass in massive stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the evolution of massive stars (&gt;8 solar masses) with 1-D models and present analytical fits to the masses and binding energies of the convective portions of their envelopes. These fits are given as functions of total mass, metallicity, and surface temperature (used as a proxy for evolutionary phase). They enable the application of the two-stage common envelope formalism (Hirai &amp; Mandel 2022) in rapid binary population synthesis frameworks. We estimate that the degree of orbital hardening following common-envelope ejection spans 6 orders of magnitude and is a very strong function of the accretor mass, and, to a lesser extent, donor evolutionary phase.</description>

      <title>Compact Binary Formation in Open Star Clusters II: Difficulty of Gaia NS formation in low-mass star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaia mission offers opportunities to search for compact binaries not involved in binary interactions (hereafter inert compact binaries), and results in the discoveries of binaries containing one black hole (BH) or one neutron star (NS), called "Gaia BHs" and "Gaia NSs", respectively. We have assessed if Gaia BHs and NSs can be formed in open clusters through dynamical interactions. In order to obtain a large number of inert compact binaries similar to Gaia BHs and NSs, we have performed gravitational $N$-body simulations for a large number of open clusters whose total mass is $1.2 \times 10^8 M_\odot$. These clusters have various masses, metallicities, densities, and binary fractions. We have found that open clusters form Gaia BHs ($10^{-6}$-$10^{-5} M_\odot^{-1}$) much more efficiently than Gaia NSs ($\lesssim 10^{-7} M_\odot^{-1}$) for any cluster parameters. This is quite inconsistent with observational results, because the reported numbers of Gaia BHs and NSs are $3$ and $21$, respectively. Additionally, we have switched off NS natal kicks for $10^4$ open clusters each weighing $10^3 M_\odot$ in order to retain a large number of NSs in open clusters. Then, open clusters form inert NS binaries originating from primordial binaries rather than formed through dynamical interactions. This means that Gaia NSs are formed dominantly on isolated fields, not in open clusters, if there is no NS natal kick. We have concluded that Gaia BHs can be dominantly formed in open clusters, however Gaia NSs cannot.</description>

      <title>Rediscussion of eclipsing binaries. Paper XIX. The long-period solar-type system V454 Aurigae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: V454 Aur is an eclipsing binary system containing two solar-type stars on an orbit of relatively long period (P = 27.02 d) and large eccentricity (e = 0.381). Eclipses were detected using data from the Hipparcos satellite, and a high-quality double-lined spectroscopic orbit has been presented by Griffin (2001). The NASA Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) has observed the system during eight sectors, capturing ten eclipses in their entirety. V454 Aur is unusual in that the primary star - the star eclipsed at the deeper minimum - is less massive, smaller \emph{and} cooler than its companion. This phenomenon can occur in certain configurations of eccentric orbits when the stars are closer together at the primary eclipse, causing a larger area to be eclipsed than at the secondary. We use the radial velocity measurements from Griffin and the light curves from TESS to determine the masses and radii of the component stars for the first time, finding masses of 1.034 +/- 0.006 Msun and 1.161 +/- 0.008 Msun, and radii of 0.979 +/- 0.003 Rsun and 1.211 +/- 0.003 Rsun. Our measurement of the distance to the system is consistent with that from the Gaia DR3 parallax. A detailed spectroscopic study to determine chemical abundances and more precise temperatures is encouraged. Finally, we present equations to derive the effective temperatures of the stars from the inferred temperature of the system as a whole, plus the ratio of the radii and either the surface brightness or light ratio of the stars.</description>

      <title>The Nature of X-Rays from Young Stellar Objects in the Orion Nebula Cluster -- A Chandra HETGS Legacy Project</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC) is the closest site of very young ($\sim$ 1 Myrs) massive star formation. The ONC hosts more than 1600 young and X-ray bright stars with masses ranging from $\sim$ 0.1 to 35 $M_\odot$. The Chandra HETGS Orion Legacy Project observed the ONC with the Chandra high energy transmission grating spectrometer (HETGS) for $2.1\,$Ms. We describe the spectral extraction and cleaning processes necessary to separate overlapping spectra. We obtained 36 high resolution spectra which includes a high brilliance X-ray spectrum of $\theta^1$ Ori C with over 100 highly significant X-ray lines. The lines show Doppler broadening between 300 and $400\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. Higher spectral diffraction orders allow us to resolve line components of high Z He-like triplets in $\theta^1$ Ori C with unprecedented spectral resolution. Long term light curves spanning $\sim$20 years show all stars to be highly variable, including the massive stars. Spectral fitting with thermal coronal emission line models reveals that most sources show column densities of up to a few times $10^{22}\,$cm$^{-2}$ and high coronal temperatures of 10 to 90 MK. We observe a bifurcation of the high temperature component where some stars show a high component of 40 MK, while others show above 60 MK indicating heavy flaring activity. Some lines are resolved with Doppler broadening above our threshold of $\sim200\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, up to $500\;\mathrm{km}\;\mathrm{s}^{-1}$. This data set represents the largest collection of HETGS high resolution X-ray spectra from young pre-MS stars in a single star-forming region to date.</description>

      <title>The Most Common Habitable Planets III -- Modeling Temperature Forcing and Surface Conditions on Rocky Exoplanets and Exomoons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Small rocky planets, as well as larger planets that suffered extensive volatile loss, tend to be drier and have thinner atmospheres as compared to Earth. Such planets probably outnumber worlds better endowed with volatiles, being the most common habitable planets. For the subgroup of fast rotators following eccentric orbits, atmospheres suffer radiative forcing and their heat capacity provides a method for gauging atmospheric thickness and surface conditions. We further explore the model presented in a previous paper and apply it to real and hypothetical exoplanets in the habitable zone of various classes of stars, simulating atmospheric and orbital characteristics. For planetary eccentricities e ~0.3, the forcing-induced hypothetical temperature variation would reach ~80 K for airless planets and ~10 K for planets with substantial atmospheres. For Kepler-186 f and Kepler-442 b, assuming e ~0.1, temperature variations can reach ~24 K. We also consider habitable exomoons in circular orbits around gas giants within the habitable zone, which suffer radiative forcing due to their epicyclic motion. We study several combinations of parameters for the characterization of planets (mass, eccentricity and semi-major axis) and exomoons (mass, orbital radius, albedo and atmospheric characteristics) for different stellar types. For e ~0.3, exomoon temperature varies up to ~90 K, while for ~0.6 variations can reach ~200 K. Such exomoons may plausibly retain their volatiles by continued volcanic activity fueled by tidal dissipation. Although currently undetectable, such effects might be within reach of future Extremely Large Telescope-class telescopes and space missions with mid-infrared and coronagraphic capabilities.</description>
