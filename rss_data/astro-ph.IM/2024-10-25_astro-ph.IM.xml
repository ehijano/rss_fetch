      <title>A measurement of atmospheric circular polarization with POLARBEAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At millimeter wavelengths, the atmospheric emission is circularly polarized owing to the Zeeman splitting of molecular oxygen by the Earth's magnetic field. We report a measurement of the signal in the 150 GHz band using 3 years of observations of the \textsc{Polarbear} project. Although the detectors are sensitive to linear polarization, we can measure the circular polarization because a continuously rotating half-wave plate in the optics converts part of circular polarization into linear polarization. The atmospheric circular polarization signal appears as a modulated signal at twice the frequency of rotation of the half-wave plate. We reconstruct the azimuthal gradient of the circular polarization signal and measure the dependencies on the scanning azimuth and the detector bandpass. We compare the signal with a simulation based on atmospheric emission theory, the detector bandpass, and the half-wave plate leakage spectrum model. We find the ratio of the observed azimuthal slope to the simulated slope is $0.92 \pm 0.01\rm{(stat)} \pm 0.07\rm{(sys)}$, which demonstrates that our measurement is consistent with theoretical prediction. This result validates our understanding of the instrument and reinforces the feasibility of measuring the circular polarization using the imperfection of the half-wave plate. Quantifying atmospheric circular polarization is the first step toward conducting a search for cosmological circular polarization at these wavelengths.</description>

      <title>POSEIDON: A Multidimensional Atmospheric Retrieval Code for Exoplanet Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectroscopic observations of exoplanet atmospheres can reveal the chemical composition, temperature, cloud properties, and (potentially) the habitability of these distant worlds. The inference of such properties is generally enabled by Bayesian atmospheric retrieval algorithms. However, until recently, many retrieval codes have not been publicly available. Here, we describe the open source release of the POSEIDON exoplanet radiative transfer and retrieval code. POSEIDON is a Python package for the 1D, 2D, or 3D modelling and analysis of exoplanet spectra, which is frequently used to interpret Hubble and JWST observations of exoplanet atmospheres. We provide extensive tutorials on both forward modelling and retrievals in POSEIDON's online documentation, which we hope will serve as a helpful resource for the exoplanet atmosphere community.</description>

      <title>SKATR: A Self-Supervised Summary Transformer for SKA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Square Kilometer Array will initiate a new era of radio astronomy by allowing 3D imaging of the Universe during Cosmic Dawn and Reionization. Modern machine learning is crucial to analyse the highly structured and complex signal. However, accurate training data is expensive to simulate, and supervised learning may not generalize. We introduce a self-supervised vision transformer, SKATR, whose learned encoding can be cheaply adapted for downstream tasks on 21cm maps. Focusing on regression and generative inference of astrophysical and cosmological parameters, we demonstrate that SKATR representations are maximally informative and that SKATR generalises out-of-domain to differently-simulated, noised, and higher-resolution datasets.</description>

      <title>Thermal architecture for a cryogenic super-pressure balloon payload: design and development of the Taurus flight cryostat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the cryogenic system being developed for Taurus: a super-pressure balloon-borne microwave polarimeter scheduled to fly in 2027. The Taurus cryogenic system consists of a 660L liquid helium cryostat which achieves a base temperature of &lt;100mK with the help of a capillary-fed superfluid tank and a closed cycle dilution refrigerator. The main tank is supported with fiberglass flexures and is encased in two layers of vapor-cooled shields which allow Taurus to make full use of the extended flight time offered by the super-pressure balloon platform. The Taurus cryostat is projected to hold for over 50 days while weighing under 1000lbs. We present the design, testing, and thermal analysis of the Taurus cryogenic systems.</description>

      <title>Impact of the observation frequency coverage on the significance of a gravitational wave background detection in PTA data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations gather high-precision timing measurements of pulsars with the aim of detecting gravitational wave (GW) signals. A major challenge lies in the identification and characterization of the different sources of noise that may hamper their sensitivity to GWs. The presence of time-correlated noise that resembles the target signal might give rise to degeneracies that can directly impact the detection statistics. In this work, we focus on the covariance that exists between a "chromatic" dispersion measure (DM) noise and an "achromatic" stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB). "Chromatic" associated to the DM noise means that its amplitude depends on the frequency of the incoming pulsar photons measured by the radio-telescope. Several frequency channels are then required to accurately characterise its chromatic features and when the coverage of incoming frequency is poor, it becomes impossible to disentangle chromatic and achromatic noise contributions. In this paper, we explore this situation by injecting realistic GWB into 100 realizations of two mock versions of the second data release (DR2) of the European PTA (EPTA), characterized by different frequency coverage. The first dataset is a faithful copy of DR2, in which the first half of the data is dominated by only one frequency channel of observation; the second one is identical except for a more homogeneous frequency coverage across the full dataset. We show that for 91% of the injections, a better frequency coverage leads to an improved statistical significance (~1.3dex higher log Bayes factor on average) of the GWB and a better characterization of its properties. We propose a metric to quantify the degeneracy between DM and GWB parameters and show that it is correlated with a loss of significance for the recovered GWB and an increase in the GWB bias towards a higher and flatter spectral shape.</description>

      <title>Precise Measurements of the LMC Bar's Geometry With Gaia DR3 and a Novel Solution to Crowding Induced Incompleteness in Star Counting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present new measurements of the two-dimensional (2-D) geometry of the LMC's stellar bar with precise astrometric observations of red clump stars in Gaia DR3. We develop a novel solution to tackle crowding induced incompleteness in Gaia datasets with the Gaia BP-RP color excess. Utilizing the color excess information, we derive a 2-D completeness map of the LMC's disk. We find that incompleteness biases the bar measurements and induces large uncertainties. With the completeness-corrected 2-D red clump map, we precisely measure the LMC bar's properties for the first time using Fourier decomposition. The bar radius is $R_{bar} = 2.13^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ kpc, and its position angle is $121.26^{\circ} \pm 0.21^{\circ}$. The bar's strength as quantified by the Fourier bi-symmetric amplitude is $S_{bar} = 0.27$, indicating that the LMC has a significant bar perturbation. We find the bar has an axis ratio of $0.54 \pm 0.03$, and is offset with respect to the center of the outer disk isophote at R $\approx$ 5 kpc by $0.76 \pm 0.01$ kpc. These LMC bar properties agree with a hydrodynamic model where the SMC has undergone a recent direct collision with the LMC. We compare the LMC's bar properties with other barred galaxies in the local universe, and discover that the LMC is similar to other barred galaxies in terms of bar-galaxy scaling relations. We discuss how our completeness correction framework can be applied to other systems in the Local Group.</description>

      <title>Joint Modeling of Quasar Variability and Accretion Disk Reprocessing using Latent Stochastic Differential Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasars are bright active galactic nuclei powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Their stochastic brightness variability depends on the physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole. The upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe tens of millions of quasars, so there is a need for efficient techniques like machine learning that can handle the large volume of data. Quasar variability is believed to be driven by an X-ray corona, which is reprocessed by the accretion disk and emitted as UV/optical variability. We are the first to introduce an auto-differentiable simulation of the accretion disk and reprocessing. We use the simulation as a direct component of our neural network to jointly model the driving variability and reprocessing to fit simulated LSST 10-year quasar light curves. The driving variability is reconstructed using a latent stochastic differential equation, a physically motivated, generative deep learning method that can model continuous-time stochastic dynamics. By embedding these physical processes into our network, we achieve a model that is more robust and interpretable. We also use transformers to scale our model to tens of millions of parameters. We demonstrate how our model outperforms a Gaussian process regression baseline and can infer accretion disk parameters and time delays between wavebands, even for out-of-distribution driving signals. Our approach provides a powerful and scalable framework that can be adapted to solve other inverse problems in multivariate time series with irregular sampling.</description>

      <title>Low-resolution Transit Spectroscopy of Three Hot Jupiters Using the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here, we present the low-resolution transmission spectroscopy of three giant planets using the Himalayan Faint Object Spectrograph Camera (HFOSC) on the 2m Himalayan Chandra Telescope (HCT) in Hanle, India. It is the first application of transmission spectroscopy with HCT. This study presents results from a single transit, each for three planets: HAT-P-1b, KELT- 18b and WASP-127b. The selection of suitable reference stars assisted in accurately tracking slit losses for the long cadence observations that are needed to achieve the required Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We employ the Common Mode Correction (CMC) technique, utilizing a white light transit curve to minimize time dependent systematic errors. The observed spectra for WASP-127b and HAT-P-1b agree with previous low-resolution transit spectroscopic observations using other observing facilities. We confirm the presence of Rayleigh scattering in the atmosphere of WASP-127b. In addition, we provide the first low-resolution transmission spectrum for KELT-18b. Modeling the exoplanet atmosphere with HFOSC and available IR observations from HST and SPITZER for WASP-127b and HAT-P-1b shows that HFOSC can be an alternative optical instrument to use in conjunction with IR observations to constrain the atmospheric parameters better.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave-Sensitive Photonic-Like Electronic Transport in Graphene for Efficient High-Frequency Gravitational Wave Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-frequency gravitational waves are crucial for understanding the very early universe and distinguishing between various cosmological models, but detecting them remains a significant challenge. We investigated the effects of high-frequency gravitational waves on photonic-like electronic transport in graphene. The results show that, unlike the influence of gravitational waves on the propagation of light, the influence of gravitational waves on photonic-like electronic transport can accumulate not only in real space but also in $k$-space. This makes photonic-like electronic transport under gravitational waves similar to the propagation of light in a medium where the refractive index varies dramatically due to gravitational waves, and with shorter wavelengths. As a result, the relative intensity variation in photonic-like electronic transport under gravitational waves exceeds that of a laser interferometer with the same arm length by six orders of magnitude. At low temperatures, the influence of phonons on photon-like transport in the context of high-frequency gravitational waves can be ignored. These findings indicate a strong interaction between gravitational waves and electron transport, which helps to deepen the understanding of the interaction between gravitational waves and matter, and provides a different method for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>Temporally resolved Type III solar radio bursts in the frequency range 3-13 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio observations from space allow to characterize solar radio bursts below the ionospheric cutoff, which are otherwise inaccessible, but suffer from low, insufficient temporal resolution. In this Letter we present novel, high-temporal resolution observations of type III solar radio bursts in the range $3-13$ MHz. A dedicated configuration of the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) High Frequency Receiver (HFR) on the Solar Orbiter mission, allowing for a temporal resolution as high as $\sim0.07$s (up to 2 orders of magnitude better than any other spacecraft measurements), provides for the very first time resolved measurements of the typical decay time values in this frequency range. The comparison of data with different time resolutions and acquired at different radial distances indicates that discrepancies with decay time values provided in previous studies are only due to the insufficient time resolution not allowing to accurately characterize decay times in this frequency range. The statistical analysis on a large sample of $\sim500$ type III radio bursts shows a power low decay time trend with a spectral index of $-0.75\pm0.03$ when the median values for each frequency are considered. When these results are combined with previous observations, referring to frequencies outside the considered range, a spectral index of $-1.00\pm0.01$ is found in the range $\sim0.05-300$ MHz, compatible with the presence of radio-wave scattering between 1 and 100 R$_{Sun}$.</description>

      <title>Parity-violating Gravitational Wave Background Search with a Network of Space-borne Triangular Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Circularly polarized gravitational wave backgrounds are predicted in many well-motivated models of inflation and phase transitions involving spontaneous parity violation. In this work, we investigate the detection of such parity-violating signals with the network of two space-borne triangular detectors. We derive the general analytical formula for the overlap reduction functions of networks composed of two triangular detectors, by exploiting the system's symmetrical properties under the long-wave approximation. Based on these results, we further assess the detectability of a parity-violating background with alternative LISA-Taiji network configurations. We find that the sensitivity to the parity-violating component can be significantly enhanced at low frequencies by adjusting the orientation of Taiji's constellation plane. This sensitivity gain is approximately an order of magnitude around the millihertz band, making the peak sensitivity comparable to that of the total intensity. This provides a promising opportunity to constrain various parity-violating theories in the millihertz band with upcoming space-borne detectors.</description>

      <title>Diffuse radio sky models using large scale shapelets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.04428v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sky models used in radio interferometric data processing primarily consist of compact and discrete radio sources. When there is a need to model large scale diffuse structure such as the Galaxy, specialized source models are sought after for the sake of simplicity and computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose the use of shapelet basis functions for modeling large scale diffuse structure in various radio interferometric data processing pipelines.
  Conventional source model construction using shapelet basis functions is restricted to using images of smaller size due to limitations in computational resources such as memory. We propose a novel shapelet decomposition method to lift this restriction, enabling the use of images of millions of pixels (as well as a wide spectral bandwidth) for building models of large scale diffuse structure. Furthermore, the application of direction dependent errors onto diffuse sky models is an expensive operation often performed as a convolution. In this paper, we propose using some specific properties of shapelet basis functions to apply such direction dependent errors as a product of the model coefficients, thus the avoiding the need for convolution.
  We provide results based on simulations and real observations. In order to measure the efficacy of our proposed method in modeling large scale diffuse structure, we consider direction dependent calibration of simulated as well as real LOFAR observations that have a significant amount of large scale diffuse structure. Results show that by including large scale shapelet models of the diffuse sky, we are able to overcome a major problem faced by existing calibration techniques that do not model such large scale diffuse structure, i.e., the suppression of such large scale diffuse structure due to model incompleteness.</description>

      <title>Deep learning interpretability analysis for carbon star identification in Gaia DR3</title>

Abstract: Context. A large fraction of Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars develop carbon-rich atmospheres during their evolution. Based on their color and luminosity, these carbon stars can be easily distinguished from many other kinds of stars. However, numerous G, K, and M giants also occupy the same region as carbon stars on the HR diagram. Despite this, their spectra exhibit differences, especially in the prominent CN molecular bands. Target. We aim to distinguish carbon stars from other kinds of stars using $Gaia$'s XP spectra, while providing attributional interpretations of key features necessary for identification, and even discovering additional new spectral key features. Method. We propose a classification model named `GaiaNet', an improved one-dimensional convolutional neural network specifically designed for handling $Gaia$'s XP spectra. We utilized the SHAP interpretability model to determine SHAP values for each feature in a spectrum, enabling us to explain the output of the `GaiaNet' model and provide further meaningful analysis. Compared to four traditional machine-learning methods, the `GaiaNet' model exhibits an average classification accuracy improvement of approximately 0.3% on the validation set, with the highest accuracy reaching 100%. Utilizing the SHAP model, we present a clear spectroscopic heatmap highlighting molecular band absorption features primarily distributed around CN773.3 and CN895.0, and summarize five key feature regions for carbon star identification. Upon applying the trained classification model to the CSTAR sample with Gaia `xp_sampled_mean' spectra, we obtained 451 new candidate carbon stars as a by-product.</description>

      <title>Partition function approach to non-Gaussian likelihoods: macrocanonical partitions and replicating Markov-chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16218</link>

Abstract: Monte-Carlo techniques are standard numerical tools for exploring non-Gaussian and multivariate likelihoods. Many variants of the original Metropolis-Hastings algorithm have been proposed to increase the sampling efficiency. Motivated by Ensemble Monte Carlo we allow the number of Markov chains to vary by exchanging particles with a reservoir, controlled by a parameter analogous to a chemical potential $\mu$, which effectively establishes a random process that samples microstates from a macrocanonical instead of a canonical ensemble. In this paper, we develop the theory of macrocanonical sampling for statistical inference on the basis of Bayesian macrocanonical partition functions, thereby bringing to light the relations between information-theoretical quantities and thermodynamic properties. Furthermore, we propose an algorithm for macrocanonical sampling, $\texttt{Avalanche Sampling}$, and apply it to various toy problems as well as the likelihood on the cosmological parameters $\Omega_m$ and $w$ on the basis of data from the supernova distance redshift relation.</description>

      <title>Cosmological multifield emulator</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate the use of deep network to learn the distribution of data from state-of-the-art hydrodynamic simulations of the CAMELS project. To this end, we train a generative adversarial network to generate images composed of three different channels that represent gas density (Mgas), neutral hydrogen density (HI), and magnetic field amplitudes (B). We consider an unconstrained model and another scenario where the model is conditioned on the matter density $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and the amplitude of density fluctuations $\sigma_{8}$. We find that the generated images exhibit great quality which is on a par with that of data, visually. Quantitatively, we find that our model generates maps whose statistical properties, quantified by probability distribution function of pixel values and auto-power spectra, agree reasonably well with those of the real maps. Moreover, the cross-correlations between fields in all maps produced by the emulator are in good agreement with those of the real images, which indicates that our model generates instances whose maps in all three channels describe the same physical region. Furthermore, a CNN regressor, which has been trained to extract $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ from CAMELS multifield dataset, recovers the cosmology from the maps generated by our conditional model, achieving $R^{2}$ = 0.96 and 0.83 corresponding to $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ respectively. This further demonstrates the great capability of the model to mimic CAMELS data. Our model can be useful for generating data that are required to analyze the information from upcoming multi-wavelength cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>ProGeny I: a new simple stellar population generator and impact of isochrones / stellar atmospheres / initial mass functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17697v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we introduce ProGeny, a new stellar population library (SPL) software package written in R. This release encapsulates the core software to generate simple/single stellar populations (SSPs); the various data inputs required (in particular isochrones and stellar atmospheres); example scripts to generate the SSPs; and a number of pre-generated static SSP available for immediate use. The most novel feature of ProGeny is its ability to produce SSPs with evolving initial mass functions (IMFs), allowing functional dependencies on stellar age or metallicity. We perform both internal comparisons (within the ProGeny SPL) and external comparisons (with other public SSPs) and tests. The main conclusion is that the choice of isochrone has significantly more impact on the predicted spectra than the choice of stellar atmospheres and/or IMF (comparing Chabrier and Kroupa variants). A number of limiting uncertainties and corrections for star formation rates and stellar masses are also presented.</description>
