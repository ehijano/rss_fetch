      <title>SIMPOL Model for Solving Continuous-Time Heterogeneous Agent Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents SIMPOL (Simplified Policy Iteration), a modular numerical framework for solving continuous-time heterogeneous agent models. The core economic problem, the optimization of consumption and savings under idiosyncratic uncertainty, is formulated as a coupled system of partial differential equations: a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the agent's optimal policy and a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation for the stationary wealth distribution. SIMPOL addresses this system using Howard's policy iteration with an *upwind* finite difference scheme that guarantees stability. A distinctive contribution is a novel consumption policy post-processing module that imposes regularity through smoothing and a projection onto an economically plausible slope band, improving convergence and model behavior. The robustness and accuracy of SIMPOL are validated through a set of integrated diagnostics, including verification of contraction in the Wasserstein-2 metric and comparison with the analytical solution of the Merton model in the no-volatility case. The framework is shown to be not only computationally efficient but also to produce solutions consistent with economic and mathematical theory, offering a reliable tool for research in quantitative macroeconomics.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Structure of Press Releases for Predicting Earnings Announcement Returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24254v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine how textual features in earnings press releases predict stock returns on earnings announcement days. Using over 138,000 press releases from 2005 to 2023, we compare traditional bag-of-words and BERT-based embeddings. We find that press release content (soft information) is as informative as earnings surprise (hard information), with FinBERT yielding the highest predictive power. Combining models enhances explanatory strength and interpretability of the content of press releases. Stock prices fully reflect the content of press releases at market open. If press releases are leaked, it offers predictive advantage. Topic analysis reveals self-serving bias in managerial narratives. Our framework supports real-time return prediction through the integration of online learning, provides interpretability and reveals the nuanced role of language in price formation.</description>

      <title>Simulation of the Heston stochastic local volatility model: implicit and explicit approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heston stochastic-local volatility (HSLV) model is widely used to capture both market calibration and realistic volatility dynamics, but simulating its CIR-type variance process is numerically challenging.This paper compare two alternative schemes for HSLV simulation: the truncated Euler method and the backward Euler method with the conventional Euler and almost exact simulation methods in \cite{van2014heston} by using a Monte Carlo method.Numerical results show that the truncated method achieves strong convergence and remains robust under high volatility, while the backward method provides the smallest errors and most stable performance in stress scenarios, though at higher computational cost.</description>

      <title>AlphaSAGE: Structure-Aware Alpha Mining via GFlowNets for Robust Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25055v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The automated mining of predictive signals, or alphas, is a central challenge in quantitative finance. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for generating formulaic alphas, existing frameworks are fundamentally hampered by a triad of interconnected issues. First, they suffer from reward sparsity, where meaningful feedback is only available upon the completion of a full formula, leading to inefficient and unstable exploration. Second, they rely on semantically inadequate sequential representations of mathematical expressions, failing to capture the structure that determine an alpha's behavior. Third, the standard RL objective of maximizing expected returns inherently drives policies towards a single optimal mode, directly contradicting the practical need for a diverse portfolio of non-correlated alphas. To overcome these challenges, we introduce AlphaSAGE (Structure-Aware Alpha Mining via Generative Flow Networks for Robust Exploration), a novel framework is built upon three cornerstone innovations: (1) a structure-aware encoder based on Relational Graph Convolutional Network (RGCN); (2) a new framework with Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets); and (3) a dense, multi-faceted reward structure. Empirical results demonstrate that AlphaSAGE outperforms existing baselines in mining a more diverse, novel, and highly predictive portfolio of alphas, thereby proposing a new paradigm for automated alpha mining.

      <title>Forecasting Liquidity Withdraw with Machine Learning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Liquidity withdrawal is a critical indicator of market fragility. In this project, I test a framework for forecasting liquidity withdrawal at the individual-stock level, ranging from less liquid stocks to highly liquid large-cap tickers, and evaluate the relative performance of competing model classes in predicting short-horizon order book stress. We introduce the Liquidity Withdrawal Index (LWI) -- defined as the ratio of order cancellations to the sum of standing depth and new additions at the best quotes -- as a bounded, interpretable measure of transient liquidity removal.
  Using Nasdaq market-by-order (MBO) data, we compare a spectrum of approaches: linear benchmarks (AR, HAR), and non-linear tree ensembles (XGBoost), across horizons ranging from 250\,ms to 5\,s. Beyond predictive accuracy, our results provide insights into order placement and cancellation dynamics, identify regimes where linear versus non-linear signals dominate, and highlight how early-warning indicators of liquidity withdrawal can inform both market surveillance and execution.</description>

      <title>From Headlines to Holdings: Deep Learning for Smarter Portfolio Decisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.24144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning offers new tools for portfolio optimization. We present an end-to-end framework that directly learns portfolio weights by combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to model temporal patterns, Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to capture evolving inter-stock relationships, and sentiment analysis of financial news to reflect market psychology. Unlike prior approaches, our model unifies these elements in a single pipeline that produces daily allocations. It avoids the traditional two-step process of forecasting asset returns and then applying mean--variance optimization (MVO), a sequence that can introduce instability. We evaluate the framework on nine U.S. stocks spanning six sectors, chosen to balance sector diversity and news coverage. In this setting, the model delivers higher cumulative returns and Sharpe ratios than equal-weighted and CAPM-based MVO benchmarks. Although the stock universe is limited, the results underscore the value of integrating price, relational, and sentiment signals for portfolio management and suggest promising directions for scaling the approach to larger, more diverse asset sets.</description>

      <title>OrderFusion: Encoding Orderbook for End-to-End Probabilistic Intraday Electricity Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06830v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic forecasting of intraday electricity prices is essential to manage market uncertainties. However, current methods rely heavily on domain feature extraction, which breaks the end-to-end training pipeline and limits the model's ability to learn expressive representations from the raw orderbook. Moreover, these methods often require training separate models for different quantiles, further violating the end-to-end principle and introducing the quantile crossing issue. Recent advances in time-series models have demonstrated promising performance in general forecasting tasks. However, these models lack inductive biases arising from buy-sell interactions and are thus overparameterized. To address these challenges, we propose an end-to-end probabilistic model called OrderFusion, which produces interaction-aware representations of buy-sell dynamics, hierarchically estimates multiple quantiles, and remains parameter-efficient with only 4,872 parameters. We conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on price indices (ID1, ID2, and ID3) using three years of orderbook in high-liquidity (German) and low-liquidity (Austrian) markets. The experimental results demonstrate that OrderFusion consistently outperforms multiple competitive baselines across markets, and ablation studies highlight the contribution of its individual components.

      <title>An Analytical Approach to (Meta)Relational Models Theory, and its Application to Triple Bottom Line (Profit, People, Planet) -- Towards Social Relations Portfolio Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18764v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Investigating the optimal nature of social interactions among actors (e.g., people or firms), who seek to achieve certain mutually-agreed objectives, has been the subject of extensive academic research. Using the relational models theory (describing all social interactions as combinations of four basic sociality ingredients: Communal Sharing, Authority Ranking, Equality Matching, and Market Pricing), the common approach revolves around qualitative arguments for determining sociality configurations most effective in realizing specific purposes, at times supplemented by empirical data. In the current treatment, we formulate this question as a mathematical optimization problem, in order to quantitatively derive the most suitable combination of sociality forms for dyadic actors, which optimizes their mutually-agreed objective. For this purpose, we develop an analytical framework of the (meta)relational models theory, and demonstrate that combining the four sociality forms to define a specific meaningful social situation inevitably prompts an inherent tension among them, codified by a single elementary and universal metarelation. In analogy with financial portfolio management, we subsequently introduce the concept of Social Relations Portfolio (SRP) management, and propose a generalizable methodology capable of quantitatively identifying the efficient SRP, which, in turn, enables effective stakeholder and change management initiatives. As an important illustration, the methodology is applied to the Triple Bottom Line (Profit, People, Planet) paradigm to derive its efficient SRP. This serves as a guide to practitioners for precisely measuring, monitoring, reporting and steering stakeholder and change management efforts concerning Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) within and / or across organizations.</description>
