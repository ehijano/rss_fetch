      <title>Developing Application Profiles for Enhancing Data and Workflows in Cultural Heritage Digitisation Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a result of the proliferation of 3D digitisation in the context of cultural heritage projects, digital assets and digitisation processes - being considered as proper research objects - must prioritise adherence to FAIR principles. Existing standards and ontologies, such as CIDOC CRM, play a crucial role in this regard, but they are often over-engineered for the need of a particular application context, thus making their understanding and adoption difficult. Application profiles of a given standard - defined as sets of ontological entities drawn from one or more semantic artefacts for a particular context or application - are usually proposed as tools for promoting interoperability and reuse while being tied entirely to the particular application context they refer to. In this paper, we present an adaptation and application of an ontology development methodology, i.e. SAMOD, to guide the creation of robust, semantically sound application profiles of large standard models. Using an existing pilot study we have developed in a project dedicated to leveraging virtual technologies to preserve and valorise cultural heritage, we introduce an application profile named CHAD-AP, that we have developed following our customised version of SAMOD. We reflect on the use of SAMOD and similar ontology development methodologies for this purpose, highlighting its strengths and current limitations, future developments, and possible adoption in other similar projects.</description>

      <title>Corpus Christi: Establishing Replicability when Sharing the Bread is Not Allowed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide practical tools to improve the scientific soundness of firmware corpora beyond the state of the art. We identify binary analysis challenges that significantly impact corpus creation. We use them to derive a framework of key corpus requirements that nurture the scientific goals of replicability and representativeness. We apply the framework to 44 top tier papers and collect 704 data points to show that there is currently no common ground on corpus creation. We discover in otherwise excellent work, that incomplete documentation and inflated corpus sizes blur visions on representativeness and hinder replicability. Our results show that the strict framework provides useful and practical guidelines that can identify miniscule step stones in corpus creation with significant impact on soundness.
  Finally, we show that it is possible to meet all requirements: We provide a new corpus called LFwC. It is designed for large-scale static analyses on Linux-based firmware and consists of 10,913 high-quality images, covering 2,365 network appliances. We share rich meta data and scripts for replicability with the community. We verify unpacking, perform deduplication, identify contents, and provide bug ground truth. We identify ISAs and Linux kernels. All samples can be unpacked with the open source tool FACT.</description>

      <title>A multi-level analysis of data quality for formal software citation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.17535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Software is a central part of modern science, and knowledge of its use is crucial for the scientific community with respect to reproducibility and attribution of its developers. Several studies have investigated in-text mentions of software and its quality, while the quality of formal software citations has only been analyzed superficially. This study performs an in-depth evaluation of formal software citation based on a set of manually annotated software references. It examines which resources are cited for software usage, to what extend they allow proper identification of software and its specific version, how this information is made available by scientific publishers, and how well it is represented in large-scale bibliographic databases. The results show that software articles are the most cited resource for software, while direct software citations are better suited for identification of software versions. Moreover, we found current practices by both, publishers and bibliographic databases, to be unsuited to represent these direct software citations, hindering large-scale analyses such as assessing software impact. We argue that current practices for representing software citations -- the recommended way to cite software by current citation standards -- stand in the way of their adaption by the scientific community, and urge providers of bibliographic data to explicitly model scientific software.</description>
