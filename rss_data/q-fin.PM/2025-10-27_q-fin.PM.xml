      <title>Revisiting the Structure of Trend Premia: When Diversification Hides Redundancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has emphasized the diversification benefits of combining trend signals across multiple horizons, with the medium-term window-typically six months to one year-long viewed as the "sweet spot" of trend-following. This paper revisits this conventional view by reallocating exposure dynamically across horizons using a Bayesian optimization framework designed to learn the optimal weights assigned to each trend horizon at the asset level. The common practice of equal weighting implicitly assumes that all assets benefit equally from all horizons; we show that this assumption is both theoretically and empirically suboptimal. We first optimize the horizon-level weights at the asset level to maximize the informativeness of trend signals before applying Bayesian graphical models-with sparsity and turnover control-to allocate dynamically across assets. The key finding is that the medium-term band contributes little incremental performance or diversification once short- and long-term components are included. Removing the 125-day layer improves Sharpe ratios and drawdown efficiency while maintaining benchmark correlation. We then rationalize this outcome through a minimum-variance formulation, showing that the medium-term horizon largely overlaps with its neighboring horizons. The resulting "barbell" structure-combining short- and long-term trends-captures most of the performance while reducing model complexity. This result challenges the common belief that more horizons always improve diversification and suggests that some forms of time-scale diversification may conceal unnecessary redundancy in trend premia.</description>

      <title>Building Trust in Illiquid Markets: an AI-Powered Replication of Private Equity Funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In response to growing demand for resilient and transparent financial instruments, we introduce a novel framework for replicating private equity (PE) performance using liquid, AI-enhanced strategies. Despite historically delivering robust returns, private equity's inherent illiquidity and lack of transparency raise significant concerns regarding investor trust and systemic stability, particularly in periods of heightened market volatility. Our method uses advanced graphical models to decode liquid PE proxies and incorporates asymmetric risk adjustments that emulate private equity's unique performance dynamics. The result is a liquid, scalable solution that aligns closely with traditional quarterly PE benchmarks like Cambridge Associates and Preqin. This approach enhances portfolio resilience and contributes to the ongoing discourse on safe asset innovation, supporting market stability and investor confidence.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Trend: How to Avoid Cherry-Picked Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10914v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our empirical results, illustrated in Fig.5, show an impressive fit with the pretty complex theoretical Sharpe formula of a Trend following strategy depending on the parameter of the signal, which was derived by Grebenkov and Serror (2014). That empirical fit convinces us that a mean-reversion process with only one time scale is enough to model, in a pretty precise way, the reality of the trend-following mechanism at the average scale of CTAs and as a consequence, using only one simple EMA, appears optimal to capture the trend. As a consequence, using a complex basket of different complex indicators as signal, do not seem to be so rational or optimal and exposes to the risk of cherry-picking.</description>

      <title>The Boosted Difference of Convex Functions Algorithm for Value-at-Risk Constrained Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A highly relevant problem of modern finance is the design of Value-at-Risk (VaR) optimal portfolios. Due to contemporary financial regulations, banks and other financial institutions are tied to use the risk measure to control their credit, market, and operational risks. Despite its practical relevance, the non-convexity induced by VaR constraints in portfolio optimization problems remains a major challenge. To address this complexity more effectively, this paper proposes the use of the Boosted Difference-of-Convex Functions Algorithm (BDCA) to approximately solve a Markowitz-style portfolio selection problem with a VaR constraint. As one of the key contributions, we derive a novel line search framework that allows the application of the algorithm to Difference-of-Convex functions (DC) programs where both components are non-smooth. Moreover, we prove that the BDCA linearly converges to a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker point for the problem at hand using the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property. We also outline that this result can be generalized to a broader class of piecewise-linear DC programs with linear equality and inequality constraints. In the practical part, extensive numerical experiments under consideration of best practices then demonstrate the robustness of the BDCA under challenging constraint settings and adverse initialization. In particular, the algorithm consistently identifies the highest number of feasible solutions even under the most challenging conditions, while other approaches from chance-constrained programming lead to a complete failure in these settings. Due to the open availability of all data sets and code, this paper further provides a practical guide for transparent and easily reproducible comparisons of VaR-constrained portfolio selection problems in Python.</description>
