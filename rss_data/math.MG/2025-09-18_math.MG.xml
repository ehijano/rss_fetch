      <title>Approximate isoperimetry for convex polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all $n,\phi\in \mathbb{N}$ with $\phi\geqslant n+1$, the smallest possible isoperimetric quotient of an $n$-dimensional convex polytope that has $\phi$ facets is shown to be bounded from above and from below by positive universal constant multiples of $\max\big\{n/\sqrt{1+\log (\phi/n)},\sqrt{n}\big\}$. For all $n\in \mathbb{N}$ and $2n\leqslant \beta\in 2\mathbb{N}$, it is shown that every $n$-dimensional origin-symmetric convex polytope that has $\beta$ vertices admits an affine image whose isoperimetric quotient is at most a universal constant multiple of $\min\big\{\sqrt{\log(\beta/n)},n\big\}$, which is sharp. The weak isomorphic reverse isoperimetry conjecture is proved for $n$-dimensional convex polytopes that have $O(n)$ facets by demonstrating that any such polytope $K$ has an image $K'$ under a volume preserving matrix and a convex body $L\subseteq K'$ such that the isoperimetric quotient of $L$ is at most a universal constant multiple of $\sqrt{n}$, and also $\sqrt[n]{\mathrm{vol}_n(L)/\mathrm{vol}_n(K)}$ is at least a positive universal constant.</description>

      <title>Classification of foliations via disintegration maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach for analyzing the relationship between the supports of conditional measures and their geometric arrangement in Wasserstein space via the disintegration map. Our method establishes criteria to determine when such conditional measures arise from a metric measure foliation. Additionally, we provide a concrete example demonstrating how this framework can be applied to study deformations (or perturbations) of disintegration-induced foliations.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic of triangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5865</link>
      <description>arXiv:1303.5865v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a set of similar triangles with parallel sides, along with a set of points in the plane. It turns out that the set $\mathbb{R}_2= \{\pm &lt;x &gt;=\pm (x^2,x,1); x\in\mathbb{R} \}$ describes this set of triangles quite well. The set $\mathbb{R}_2$ is a subset of the ring $\mathbb{R}^3=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}= \{ (x,y,z) ; x,y,z\in\mathbb{R} \}$ with addition and multiplication defined coordinate-wise.
  The set $\mathbb{R}_2$ is equipped with two operations. Multiplication is inherited from the ring $\mathbb{R}^3$, while addition is a ternary operation that represents homothety and translation of elements in $\mathbb{R}_2$.
  However, the defined addition has its limitations. It turns out that, within this framework, the reduction of terms with different signs is not always possible. This leads to the distinction between an equation that is true in the arithmetic sense and one that is true in the geometric sense.
  A novel form of addition in $\mathbb{R}_2$ leads to intriguing properties of multiplication in $\mathbb{R}_2$, which are examined in a dedicated chapter.
  In the next section we use the construction of adding to describe the dissection of the triangle into 15 triangles of different sides.
  In the final two sections, we consider a set of two kinds of vectors, along with a set of points on the line. The set $\mathbb{R}_1= \{\pm &lt;x &gt;=\pm (x,1); x\in\mathbb{R} \}$ describes this set vectors quite well and it is a one-dimensional reduction of the set $\mathbb{R}_2$.</description>

      <title>H\"older curves with exotic tangent spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An important implication of Rademacher's Differentiation Theorem is that every Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$ infinitesimally looks like a line at almost all of its points in the sense that at $\mathcal{H}^1$-almost every point of $\Gamma$, the only tangent to $\Gamma$ is a straight line through the origin. In this article, we show that, in contrast, the infinitesimal structure of H\"older curves can be much more extreme. First we show that for every $s&gt;1$ there exists a $(1/s)$-H\"older curve $\Gamma_s$ in a Euclidean space with $\mathcal{H}^s(\Gamma_s)&gt;0$ such that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many topologically distinct tangents. Second, we study the tangents of self-similar connected sets (which are canonical examples of H\"older curves) and prove that the curves $\Gamma_s$ have the additional property that $\mathcal{H}^s$-almost every point of $\Gamma_s$ admits infinitely many homeomorphically distinct tangents to $\Gamma_s$ which are not admitted as (not even bi-Lipschitz to) tangents to any self-similar set at typical points.</description>

      <title>Spectral structure of infinite size squared distances matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let a finite set of points $\{\xi_1,...,\xi_k\}$ be chosen in a metric space $(X,d)$, and let the squared distance matrix $\mathfrak{D}=(\mathfrak{D}(\xi_i,\xi_j)^2)_{i,j=1}^{k}$ be constructed from them. We propose a geometric approach to studying the spectral properties of squared distance matrices of infinite size, constructed from a countable set of points $\{\xi_k\}_{k\in \mathbb{Z}}$ on Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$. We move from the discrete problem to a continuous one using walk matrices. We describe the structure of the spectrum and study the properties of spectral flows.</description>

      <title>The Riemannian hemisphere is almost calibrated in the injective hull of its boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2104.04498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An exact differential two-form is constructed in the injective hull of the Riemannian circle, whose comass norm, defined via the inscribed Riemannian area on normed planes, is stationary at every point of the open hemisphere spanned by the circle. As a consequence, in any metric space, the induced Finsler mass of a two-dimensional Ambrosio-Kirchheim rectifiable current with boundary a Riemannian circle of length $2\pi$ admits a lower bound of $2\pi$ plus a second-order term in the Hausdorff distance to an isometric copy of the hemisphere. This estimate applies to all oriented Lipschitz surfaces spanning the circle, regardless of their topology, and thus offers positive evidence for Gromov's filling area conjecture.</description>

      <title>Super Guarding and Dark Rays in Art Galleries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04613v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore an Art Gallery variant where each point of a polygon must be seen by k guards, and guards cannot see through other guards. Surprisingly, even covering convex polygons under this variant is not straightforward. For example, covering every point in a triangle k=4 times (a 4-cover) requires 5 guards, and achieving a 10-cover requires 12 guards. Our main result is tight bounds on k-covering a convex polygon of n vertices, for all k and n. The proofs of both upper and lower bounds are nontrivial. We also obtain bounds for simple polygons, leaving tight bounds an open problem.</description>
