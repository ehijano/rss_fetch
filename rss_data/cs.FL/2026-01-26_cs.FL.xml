      <title>Topological transitivity of group cellular automata is decidable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological transitivity is a fundamental notion in topological dynamics and is widely regarded as a basic indicator of global dynamical complexity. For general cellular automata, topological transitivity is known to be undecidable. By contrast, positive decidability results have been established for one-dimensional group cellular automata over abelian groups, while the extension to higher dimensions and to non-abelian groups has remained an open problem. In this work, we settle this problem by proving that topological transitivity is decidable for the class of $d$-dimensional ($d\geq 1$) group cellular automata over arbitrary finite groups. Our approach combines a decomposition technique for group cellular automata, reducing the problem to the analysis of simpler components, with an extension of several results from the existing literature in the one-dimensional setting. As a consequence of our results, and exploiting known equivalences among dynamical properties for group cellular automata, we also obtain the decidability of several related notions, including total transitivity, topological mixing and weak mixing, weak and strong ergodic mixing, and ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Linear Subsequences of $k$-Automatic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct automata with input(s) in base $k$ recognizing some basic relations and study their number of states. We also consider some basic operations on $k$-automatic sequences and discuss their state complexity. We find a relationship between subword complexity of the interior sequence $(h'(i))_{i \geq 0}$ and state complexity of the linear subsequence $(h(ni+c))_{i \geq 0}$. We resolve a recent question of Zantema and Bosma about linear subsequences of $k$-automatic sequences with input in most-significant-digit-first format. We also discuss the state complexity and runtime complexity of using a reasonable interpretation of B\"uchi arithmetic to actually construct some of the studied automata recognizing relations or carrying out operations on automatic sequences.</description>

      <title>Rewriting Systems on Arbitrary Monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10564v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce monoidal rewriting systems (MRS), an abstraction of string rewriting in which reductions are defined over an arbitrary ambient monoid rather than a free monoid of words. This shift is partly motivated by logic: the class of free monoids is not first-order axiomatizable, so "working in the free setting" cannot be treated internally when applying first-order methods to rewriting presentations.
  To analyze these systems categorically, we define $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ as the 2-category of Noetherian Confluent MRS. We then prove the existence of a canonical biadjunction between $\mathbf{NCRS_2}$ and $\mathbf{Mon}$.
  Finally, we classify all Noetherian Confluent MRS that present a given fixed monoid. For this, we introduce Generalized Elementary Tietze Transformations (GETTs) and prove that any two presentations of a monoid are connected by a (possibly infinite) sequence of these transformations, yielding a complete characterization of generating systems up to GETT-equivalence.</description>
