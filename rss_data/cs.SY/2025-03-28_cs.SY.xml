      <title>Bounds on Deep Neural Network Partial Derivatives with Respect to Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool with a growing body of literature exploring Lyapunov-based approaches for real-time system identification and control. These methods depend on establishing bounds for the second partial derivatives of DNNs with respect to their parameters, a requirement often assumed but rarely addressed explicitly. This paper provides rigorous mathematical formulations of polynomial bounds on both the first and second partial derivatives of DNNs with respect to their parameters. We present lemmas that characterize these bounds for fully-connected DNNs, while accommodating various classes of activation function including sigmoidal and ReLU-like functions. Our analysis yields closed-form expressions that enable precise stability guarantees for Lyapunov-based deep neural networks (Lb-DNNs). Furthermore, we extend our results to bound the higher-order terms in first-order Taylor approximations of DNNs, providing important tools for convergence analysis in gradient-based learning algorithms. The developed theoretical framework develops explicit, computable expressions, for previously assumed bounds, thereby strengthening the mathematical foundation of neural network applications in safety-critical control systems.</description>

      <title>Local Stability and Stabilization of Quadratic-Bilinear Systems using Petersen's Lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic-bilinear (QB) systems arise in many areas of science and engineering. In this paper, we present a scalable approach for designing locally stabilizing state-feedback control laws and certifying the local stability of QB systems. Sufficient conditions are established for local stability and stabilization based on quadratic Lyapunov functions, which also provide ellipsoidal inner-estimates for the region of attraction and region of stabilizability of an equilibrium point. Our formulation exploits Petersen's Lemma to convert the problem of certifying the sign-definiteness of the Lyapunov condition into a line search over a single scalar parameter. The resulting linear matrix inequality (LMI) conditions scale quadratically with the state dimension for both stability analysis and control synthesis, thus enabling analysis and control of QB systems with hundreds of state variables without resorting to specialized implementations. We demonstrate the approach on three benchmark problems from the existing literature. In all cases, we find our formulation yields comparable approximations of stability domains as determined by other established tools that are otherwise restricted to systems with up to tens of state variables.</description>

      <title>Dissipativity-Based Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for DC Microgrids with ZIP Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel dissipativity-based distributed droop-free control approach for voltage regulation, current sharing, and Constant Power Load (CPL) stability in DC microgrids (MGs). We describe the closed-loop DC MG as a networked system where DGs, lines, and nonlinear loads (including destabilizing CPLs) are interconnected via a static interconnection matrix. Each DG has a local controller and a distributed global controller, designed using dissipativity properties and sector-bounded techniques. For controller synthesis, we formulate a Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) problem that simultaneously addresses voltage regulation, current sharing, and CPL stability guarantees. To support the feasibility of this problem, we propose a sector-bounded approach that characterizes CPL nonlinearities and integrates them into the dissipativity framework through S-procedure techniques. Our approach provides a unified framework for co-designing distributed controllers and communication topologies that ensure stability despite the presence of destabilizing CPL effects. The effectiveness of the proposed solution was verified by simulating an islanded DC MG under different scenarios, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional control approaches when handling CPLs.</description>

      <title>Validation and Calibration of Energy Models with Real Vehicle Data from Chassis Dynamometer Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate estimation of vehicle fuel consumption typically requires detailed modeling of complex internal powertrain dynamics, often resulting in computationally intensive simulations. However, many transportation applications-such as traffic flow modeling, optimization, and control-require simplified models that are fast, interpretable, and easy to implement, while still maintaining fidelity to physical energy behavior. This work builds upon a recently developed model reduction pipeline that derives physics-like energy models from high-fidelity Autonomie vehicle simulations. These reduced models preserve essential vehicle dynamics, enabling realistic fuel consumption estimation with minimal computational overhead. While the reduced models have demonstrated strong agreement with their Autonomie counterparts, previous validation efforts have been confined to simulation environments. This study extends the validation by comparing the reduced energy model's outputs against real-world vehicle data. Focusing on the MidSUV category, we tune the baseline Autonomie model to closely replicate the characteristics of a Toyota RAV4. We then assess the accuracy of the resulting reduced model in estimating fuel consumption under actual drive conditions. Our findings suggest that, when the reference Autonomie model is properly calibrated, the simplified model produced by the reduction pipeline can provide reliable, semi-principled fuel rate estimates suitable for large-scale transportation applications.</description>

      <title>Cubature Kalman Filter as a Robust State Estimator Against Model Uncertainty and Cyber Attacks in Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the conventional estimators such as extended Kalman filter (EKF) and unscented Kalman filter (UKF) may provide favorable performance; However, they may not guarantee the robustness against model uncertainty and cyber attacks. In this paper, we compare the performance of cubature Kalman filter (CKF) to the conventional nonlinear estimator, the EKF, under the affect of model uncertainty and cyber-attack. We show that the CKF has better estimation accuracy than the EKF under some conditions. In order to verify our claim, we have tested the performance various nonlinear estimators on the single machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system under different scenarios. We show that (1) the CKF provides better estimation results than the EKF; (2) the CKF is able to detect different types of cyber attacks reliably which is superior to the EKF.</description>

      <title>Extending Silicon Lifetime: A Review of Design Techniques for Reliable Integrated Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reliability has become an increasing concern in modern computing. Integrated circuits (ICs) are the backbone of modern computing devices across industries, including artificial intelligence (AI), consumer electronics, healthcare, automotive, industrial, and aerospace. Moore Law has driven the semiconductor IC industry toward smaller dimensions, improved performance, and greater energy efficiency. However, as transistors shrink to atomic scales, aging-related degradation mechanisms such as Bias Temperature Instability (BTI), Hot Carrier Injection (HCI), Time-Dependent Dielectric Breakdown (TDDB), Electromigration (EM), and stochastic aging-induced variations have become major reliability threats. From an application perspective, applications like AI training and autonomous driving require continuous and sustainable operation to minimize recovery costs and enhance safety. Additionally, the high cost of chip replacement and reproduction underscores the need for extended lifespans. These factors highlight the urgency of designing more reliable ICs. This survey addresses the critical aging issues in ICs, focusing on fundamental degradation mechanisms and mitigation strategies. It provides a comprehensive overview of aging impact and the methods to counter it, starting with the root causes of aging and summarizing key monitoring techniques at both circuit and system levels. A detailed analysis of circuit-level mitigation strategies highlights the distinct aging characteristics of digital, analog, and SRAM circuits, emphasizing the need for tailored solutions. The survey also explores emerging software approaches in design automation, aging characterization, and mitigation, which are transforming traditional reliability optimization. Finally, it outlines the challenges and future directions for improving aging management and ensuring the long-term reliability of ICs across diverse applications.</description>

      <title>System-wide Instrument Transformer Calibration and Line Parameter Estimation Using PMU Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uncalibrated instrument transformers (ITs) can degrade the performance of downstream applications that rely on the voltage and current measurements that ITs provide. It is also well-known that phasor measurement unit (PMU)-based system-wide IT calibration and line parameter estimation (LPE) are interdependent problems. In this paper, we present a statistical framework for solving the simultaneous LPE and IT calibration (SLIC) problem using synchrophasor data. The proposed approach not only avoids the need for a perfect IT by judiciously placing a revenue quality meter (which is an expensive but non-perfect IT), but also accounts for the variations typically occurring in the line parameters. The results obtained using the IEEE 118-bus system as well as actual power system data demonstrate the high accuracy, robustness, and practical utility of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>On Learning-Based Traffic Monitoring With a Swarm of Drones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient traffic monitoring is crucial for managing urban transportation networks, especially under congested and dynamically changing traffic conditions. Drones offer a scalable and cost-effective alternative to fixed sensor networks. However, deploying fleets of low-cost drones for traffic monitoring poses challenges in adaptability, scalability, and real-time operation. To address these issues, we propose a learning-based framework for decentralized traffic monitoring with drone swarms, targeting the uneven and unpredictable distribution of monitoring needs across urban areas. Our approach introduces a semi-decentralized reinforcement learning model, which trains a single Q-function using the collective experience of the swarm. This model supports full scalability, flexible deployment, and, when hardware allows, the online adaptation of each drone's action-selection mechanism. We first train and evaluate the model in a synthetic traffic environment, followed by a case study using real traffic data from Shenzhen, China, to validate its performance and demonstrate its potential for real-world applications in complex urban monitoring tasks.</description>

      <title>On Tensor-based Polynomial Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that a linear system with a system matrix A constitutes a Hamiltonian system with a quadratic Hamiltonian if and only if A is a Hamiltonian matrix. This provides a straightforward method to verify whether a linear system is Hamiltonian or whether a given Hamiltonian function corresponds to a linear system. These techniques fundamentally rely on the properties of Hamiltonian matrices. Building on recent advances in tensor algebra, this paper generalizes such results to a broad class of polynomial systems. As the systems of interest can be naturally represented in tensor forms, we name them tensor-based polynomial systems. Our main contribution is that we formally define Hamiltonian cubical tensors and characterize their properties. Crucially, we demonstrate that a tensor-based polynomial system is a Hamiltonian system with a polynomial Hamiltonian if and only if all associated system tensors are Hamiltonian cubical tensors-a direct parallel to the linear case. Additionally, we establish a computationally tractable stability criterion for tensor-based polynomial Hamiltonian systems. Finally, we validate all theoretical results through numerical examples and provide a further intuitive discussion.</description>

      <title>Distributed Forgetting-factor Regret-based Online Optimization over Undirected Connected Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evaluation of final-iteration tracking performance is a formidable obstacle in distributed online optimization algorithms. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel evaluation metric named distributed forgetting-factor regret (DFFR). It incorporates a weight into the loss function at each iteration, which progressively reduces the weights of historical loss functions while enabling dynamic weights allocation across optimization horizon. Furthermore, we develop two distributed online optimization algorithms based on DFFR over undirected connected networks: the Distributed Online Gradient-free Algorithm for bandit-feedback problems and the Distributed Online Projection-free Algorithm for high-dimensional problems. Through theoretical analysis, we derive the upper bounds of DFFR for both algorithms and further prove that under mild conditions, DFFR either converges to zero or maintains a tight upper bound as iterations approach infinity. Experimental simulation demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithms and the superior performance of DFFR.</description>

      <title>ALADIN-$\beta$: A Distributed Optimization Algorithm for Solving MPCC Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCC) are critical in various real-world applications but notoriously challenging due to non-smoothness and degeneracy from complementarity constraints. The $\ell_1$-Exact Penalty-Barrier enhanced \texttt{IPOPT} improves performance and robustness by introducing additional inequality constraints and decision variables. However, this comes at the cost of increased computational complexity due to the higher dimensionality and additional constraints introduced in the centralized formulation. To mitigate this, we propose a distributed structure-splitting reformulation that decomposes these inequality constraints and auxiliary variables into independent sub-problems. Furthermore, we introduce Augmented Lagrangian Alternating Direction Inexact Newton (ALADIN)-$\beta$, a novel approach that integrates the $\ell_1$-Exact Penalty-Barrier method with ALADIN to efficiently solve the distributed reformulation. Numerical experiments demonstrate that even without a globalization strategy, the proposed distributed approach achieves fast convergence while maintaining high precision.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network-Based Control for Grid-Forming Converter's Stability Under Overload Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Grid-forming converters (GFCs) are pivotal in maintaining frequency and voltage stability in modern distribution systems. However, a critical challenge arises when these converters encounter sudden power demands that exceed their rated capacity. Although GFCs are designed to manage DC source saturation and limit excessive AC currents, their ability to ensure sufficient power delivery under such constraints remains a significant concern. Existing studies often overlook this limitation, potentially compromising system stability during high-demand scenarios. This paper proposes a control strategy based on a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to improve GFC performance under overloaded conditions, effectively preventing switch failures and mitigating DC source saturation. The proposed approach outperforms conventional methods by maintaining stable voltage and frequency, even under significant load increases where traditional droop control alone proves inadequate. The post-disturbance operating point of GFCs remains unchanged using PINN-based control. Peak voltage deviation observed during transient reduced to 42.85\%. Furthermore, the proposed method ensures that the rate of change of frequency (ROCOF) and the rate of change of voltage (ROCOV) remain within acceptable limits, significantly improving system resilience in inertia-less power networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a fast mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) framework for multi-robot navigation by combining graph attention networks and distributed optimization. We formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem for receding horizon motion planning of a multi-robot system, taking into account the surrounding obstacles. To address the resulting multi-agent MICP problem in real time, we propose a framework that utilizes heterogeneous graph attention networks to learn the latent mapping from problem parameters to optimal binary solutions. Furthermore, we apply a distributed proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm for solving the convex continuous optimization problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through experiments conducted on a robotic testbed.</description>

      <title>Real-time Tracking System with partially coupled sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a pull-based real-time tracking system consisting of multiple partially coupled sources and a sink. The sink monitors the sources in real-time and can request one source for an update at each time instant. The sources send updates over an unreliable wireless channel. The sources are partially coupled, and updates about one source can provide partial knowledge about other sources. We study the problem of minimizing the sum of an average distortion function and a transmission cost. Since the controller is at the sink side, the controller (sink) has only partial knowledge about the source states, and thus, we model the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and then cast it as a belief-MDP problem. Using the relative value iteration algorithm, we solve the problem and propose a control policy. Simulation results show the proposed policy's effectiveness and superiority compared to a baseline policy.</description>

      <title>AUTOBargeSim: MATLAB(R) toolbox for the design and analysis of the guidance and control system for autonomous inland vessels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces AUTOBargeSim, a simulation toolbox for autonomous inland vessel guidance and control system design. AUTOBargeSim is developed using MATLAB and provides an easy-to-use introduction to various aspects of autonomous inland navigation, including mapping, modelling, control design, and collision avoidance, through examples and extensively documented code. Applying modular design principles in the simulator structure allows it to be easily modified according to the user's requirements. Furthermore, a GUI interface facilitates a simple and quick execution. Key performance indices for evaluating the performance of the controller and collision avoidance method in confined space are also provided. The current version of AUTOBargeSim attempts to improve reproducibility in the design and simulation of marine systems while serving as a foundation for simulating and evaluating vessel behaviour considering operational, system, and environmental constraints.</description>

      <title>Economy and sustainability analysis with a novel modular configurable multi-modal white-box building model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel modeling approach for building performance simulation, characterized as a white-box model with a high degree of modularity and flexibility, enabling direct integration into complex large-scale energy system co-simulations. The introduced model is described in detail, with a focus on its modular structure, and proposes various configurations that include various building insulation, heating methods, occupancy patterns, and weather data to analyze different scenarios, and the energy consumption, CO2 emissions, and heating costs are compared and analyzed across 36 introduced scenarios. The thermodynamic behavior of the model is shown to be consistent with real-world conditions, and the comparison of the scenarios concludes that the use of heat pumps for indoor heating in well-insulated buildings has significant economic and sustainability benefits, whereas the use of natural gas-fueled boilers is more cost-effective for buildings with low energy ratings.</description>

      <title>The Construction of Asymptotic Bode Plots: A New Direct Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bode plots represent an essential tool in control and systems engineering. In order to perform an initial qualitative analysis of the considered systems, the construction of asymptotic Bode plots is often sufficient. The standard methods for constructing asymptotic Bode plots are characterized by the same drawbacks: they are not systematic, may be not precise and time-consuming. This is because they require the detailed analysis of the different factors composing the considered transfer function, meaning that more and more intermediate steps are required as the number of factors increases. In this paper, a new method for the construction of asymptotic Bode plots is proposed, which is based on the systematic calculations of the so-called generalized approximating functions and on the use of well defined properties. The proposed method is referred to as a direct method since it allows to directly draw the asymptotic Bode magnitude and phase plots of the complete transfer function without requiring the detailed analysis nor the plots construction of each factor. This latter feature also makes the proposed direct method more systematic, potentially more precise and less time-consuming compared to standard methods, especially when dealing with a large number of factors in the transfer function. The comparison of the proposed direct method with the standard approaches is performed, in order to examine the benefits offered by the direct method.</description>

      <title>TAR: Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning for Quadrupedal Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal locomotion via Reinforcement Learning (RL) is commonly addressed using the teacher-student paradigm, where a privileged teacher guides a proprioceptive student policy. However, key challenges such as representation misalignment between the privileged teacher and the proprioceptive-only student, covariate shift due to behavioral cloning, and lack of deployable adaptation lead to poor generalization in real-world scenarios. We propose Teacher-Aligned Representations via Contrastive Learning (TAR), a framework that leverages privileged information with self-supervised contrastive learning to bridge this gap. By aligning representations to a privileged teacher in simulation via contrastive objectives, our student policy learns structured latent spaces and exhibits robust generalization to Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, surpassing the fully privileged "Teacher". Results showed accelerated training by 2x compared to state-of-the-art baselines to achieve peak performance. OOD scenarios showed better generalization by 40 percent on average compared to existing methods. Additionally, TAR transitions seamlessly into learning during deployment without requiring privileged states, setting a new benchmark in sample-efficient, adaptive locomotion and enabling continual fine-tuning in real-world scenarios. Open-source code and videos are available at https://ammousa.github.io/TARLoco/.</description>

      <title>TAGA: A Tangent-Based Reactive Approach for Socially Compliant Robot Navigation Around Human Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robot navigation in densely populated environments presents significant challenges, particularly regarding the interplay between individual and group dynamics. Current navigation models predominantly address interactions with individual pedestrians while failing to account for human groups that naturally form in real-world settings. Conversely, the limited models implementing group-aware navigation typically prioritize group dynamics at the expense of individual interactions, both of which are essential for socially appropriate navigation. This research extends an existing simulation framework to incorporate both individual pedestrians and human groups. We present Tangent Action for Group Avoidance (TAGA), a modular reactive mechanism that can be integrated with existing navigation frameworks to enhance their group-awareness capabilities. TAGA dynamically modifies robot trajectories using tangent action-based avoidance strategies while preserving the underlying model's capacity to navigate around individuals. Additionally, we introduce Group Collision Rate (GCR), a novel metric to quantitatively assess how effectively robots maintain group integrity during navigation. Through comprehensive simulation-based benchmarking, we demonstrate that integrating TAGA with state-of-the-art navigation models (ORCA, Social Force, DS-RNN, and AG-RL) reduces group intrusions by 45.7-78.6% while maintaining comparable success rates and navigation efficiency. Future work will focus on real-world implementation and validation of this approach.</description>

      <title>AcL: Action Learner for Fault-Tolerant Quadruped Locomotion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots can learn versatile locomotion skills but remain vulnerable when one or more joints lose power. In contrast, dogs and cats can adopt limping gaits when injured, demonstrating their remarkable ability to adapt to physical conditions. Inspired by such adaptability, this paper presents Action Learner (AcL), a novel teacher-student reinforcement learning framework that enables quadrupeds to autonomously adapt their gait for stable walking under multiple joint faults. Unlike conventional teacher-student approaches that enforce strict imitation, AcL leverages teacher policies to generate style rewards, guiding the student policy without requiring precise replication. We train multiple teacher policies, each corresponding to a different fault condition, and subsequently distill them into a single student policy with an encoder-decoder architecture. While prior works primarily address single-joint faults, AcL enables quadrupeds to walk with up to four faulty joints across one or two legs, autonomously switching between different limping gaits when faults occur. We validate AcL on a real Go2 quadruped robot under single- and double-joint faults, demonstrating fault-tolerant, stable walking, smooth gait transitions between normal and lamb gaits, and robustness against external disturbances.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Contact-Aware Control Method for Real-Time Deformable Tool Manipulation: A Case Study in the Environmental Swabbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deformable Object Manipulation (DOM) remains a critical challenge in robotics due to the complexities of developing suitable model-based control strategies. Deformable Tool Manipulation (DTM) further complicates this task by introducing additional uncertainties between the robot and its environment. While humans effortlessly manipulate deformable tools using touch and experience, robotic systems struggle to maintain stability and precision. To address these challenges, we present a novel State-Adaptive Koopman LQR (SA-KLQR) control framework for real-time deformable tool manipulation, demonstrated through a case study in environmental swab sampling for food safety. This method leverages Koopman operator-based control to linearize nonlinear dynamics while adapting to state-dependent variations in tool deformation and contact forces. A tactile-based feedback system dynamically estimates and regulates the swab tool's angle, contact pressure, and surface coverage, ensuring compliance with food safety standards. Additionally, a sensor-embedded contact pad monitors force distribution to mitigate tool pivoting and deformation, improving stability during dynamic interactions. Experimental results validate the SA-KLQR approach, demonstrating accurate contact angle estimation, robust trajectory tracking, and reliable force regulation. The proposed framework enhances precision, adaptability, and real-time control in deformable tool manipulation, bridging the gap between data-driven learning and optimal control in robotic interaction tasks.</description>

      <title>Formation Shape Control using the Gromov-Wasserstein Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article introduces a formation shape control algorithm, in the optimal control framework, for steering an initial population of agents to a desired configuration via employing the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. The underlying dynamical system is assumed to be a constrained linear system and the objective function is a sum of quadratic control-dependent stage cost and a Gromov-Wasserstein terminal cost. The inclusion of the Gromov-Wasserstein cost transforms the resulting optimal control problem into a well-known NP-hard problem, making it both numerically demanding and difficult to solve with high accuracy. Towards that end, we employ a recent semi-definite relaxation-driven technique to tackle the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. A numerical example is provided to illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>consexpressionR: an R package for consensus differential gene expression analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivation: Bulk RNA-Seq is a widely used method for studying gene expression across a variety of contexts. The significance of RNA-Seq studies has grown with the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. Computational methods have been developed for each stage of the identification of differentially expressed genes. Nevertheless, there are few studies exploring the association between different types of methods. In this study, we evaluated the impact of the association of methodologies in the results of differential expression analysis. By adopting two data sets with qPCR data (to gold-standard reference), seven methods were implemented and assessed in R packages (EBSeq, edgeR, DESeq2, limma, SAMseq, NOISeq, and Knowseq), which was performed and assessed separately and in association. The results were evaluated considering the adopted qPCR data. Results: Here, we introduce consexpressionR, an R package that automates differential expression analysis using consensus of at least seven methodologies, producing more assertive results with a significant reduction in false positives. Availability: consexpressionR is an R package available via source code and support are available at GitHub (https://github.com/costasilvati/consexpressionR).</description>

      <title>Predictable Interval MDPs through Entropy Regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16711v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Regularization of control policies using entropy can be instrumental in adjusting predictability of real-world systems. Applications benefiting from such approaches range from, e.g., cybersecurity, which aims at maximal unpredictability, to human-robot interaction, where predictable behavior is highly desirable. In this paper, we consider entropy regularization for interval Markov decision processes (IMDPs). IMDPs are uncertain MDPs, where transition probabilities are only known to belong to intervals. Lately, IMDPs have gained significant popularity in the context of abstracting stochastic systems for control design. In this work, we address robust minimization of the linear combination of entropy and a standard cumulative cost in IMDPs, thereby establishing a trade-off between optimality and predictability. We show that optimal deterministic policies exist, and devise a value-iteration algorithm to compute them. The algorithm solves a number of convex programs at each step. Finally, through an illustrative example we show the benefits of penalizing entropy in IMDPs.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear system identification (NL-SI) has proven to be effective in obtaining accurate models for highly complex systems. In particular, recent encoder-based methods for artificial neural networks state-space (ANN-SS) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, while offering consistency and computational efficiency. Inclusion of prior knowledge of the system can be exploited to increase (i) estimation speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) interpretability of the resulting models. This paper proposes an encoder-based model augmentation method that incorporates prior knowledge from first-principles (FP) models. We introduce a novel \linear-fractional-representation (LFR) model structure that allows for the unified representation of various augmentation structures including the ones that are commonly used in the literature, and an identification algorithm for estimating the proposed structure together with appropriate initialization methods. The performance and generalization capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated in a hardening mass-spring-damper simulation.</description>

      <title>SPARC: Prediction-Based Safe Control for Coupled Controllable and Uncontrollable Agents with Conformal Predictions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15660v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the problem of safe control synthesis for systems operating in environments with uncontrollable agents whose dynamics are unknown but coupled with those of the controlled system. This scenario naturally arises in various applications, such as autonomous driving and human-robot collaboration, where the behavior of uncontrollable agents, like pedestrians, cannot be directly controlled but is influenced by the actions of the autonomous vehicle or robot. In this paper, we present SPARC (Safe Prediction-Based Robust Controller for Coupled Agents), a novel framework designed to ensure safe control in the presence of coupled uncontrollable agents. SPARC leverages conformal prediction to quantify uncertainty in data-driven prediction of agent behavior. Particularly, we introduce a joint distribution-based approach to account for the coupled dynamics of the controlled system and uncontrollable agents. By integrating the control barrier function (CBF) technique, SPARC provides provable safety guarantees at a high confidence level. We illustrate our framework with a case study involving an autonomous driving scenario with walking pedestrians.</description>

      <title>Stacked-Residual PINN for State Reconstruction of Hyperbolic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a more connected world, modeling multi-agent systems with hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) offers a potential solution to the curse of dimensionality. However, classical control tools need adaptation for these complex systems. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a powerful framework to fix this issue by inferring solutions to PDEs by embedding governing equations into the neural network. A major limitation of original PINNs is their inability to capture steep gradients and discontinuities in hyperbolic PDEs. This paper proposes a stacked residual PINN method enhanced with a vanishing viscosity mechanism. Initially, a basic PINN with a small viscosity coefficient provides a stable, low-fidelity solution. Residual correction blocks with learnable scaling parameters then iteratively refine this solution, progressively decreasing the viscosity coefficient to transition from parabolic to hyperbolic PDEs. Applying this method to traffic state reconstruction improved results by an order of magnitude in relative $\mathcal{L}^2$ error, demonstrating its potential to accurately estimate solutions where original PINNs struggle with instability and low fidelity.</description>

      <title>LQG Risk-Sensitive Single-Agent and Major-Minor Mean-Field Game Systems: A Variational Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.15364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a variational approach to address risk-sensitive optimal control problems with an exponential-of-integral cost functional in a general linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) single-agent setup, offering new insights into such problems. Our analysis leads to the derivation of a nonlinear necessary and sufficient condition of optimality, expressed in terms of martingale processes. Subject to specific conditions, we find an equivalent risk-neutral measure, under which a linear state feedback form can be obtained for the optimal control. It is then shown that the obtained feedback control is consistent with the imposed condition and remains optimal under the original measure. Building upon this development, we (i) propose a variational framework for general LQG risk-sensitive mean-field games (MFGs) and (ii) advance the LQG risk-sensitive MFG theory by incorporating a major agent in the framework. The major agent interacts with a large number of minor agents, and unlike the minor agents, its influence on the system remains significant even with an increasing number of minor agents. We derive the Markovian closed-loop best-response strategies of agents in the limiting case where the number of agents goes to infinity. We establish that the set of obtained best-response strategies yields a Nash equilibrium in the limiting case and an $\varepsilon$-Nash equilibrium in the finite-player case.</description>

      <title>Model-Predictive Trajectory Generation for Aerial Search and Coverage</title>

Abstract: This paper introduces a trajectory planning algorithm for search and coverage missions with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) based on an uncertainty map that represents prior knowledge of the target region, modeled by a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The trajectory planning problem is formulated as an Optimal Control Problem (OCP), which aims to maximize the uncertainty reduction within a specified mission duration. However, this results in an intractable OCP whose objective functional cannot be expressed in closed form. To address this, we propose a Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm based on a relaxed formulation of the objective function to approximate the optimal solutions. This relaxation promotes efficient map exploration by penalizing overlaps in the UAV's visibility regions along the trajectory. The algorithm can produce efficient and smooth trajectories, and it can be efficiently implemented using standard Nonlinear Programming solvers, being suitable for real-time planning. Unlike traditional methods, which often rely on discretizing the mission space and using complex mixed-integer formulations, our approach is computationally efficient and easier to implement. The MPC algorithm is initially assessed in MATLAB, followed by Gazebo simulations and actual experimental tests conducted in an outdoor environment. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategy can generate efficient and smooth trajectories for search and coverage missions.</description>

      <title>Topological Graph Simplification Solutions to the Street Intersection Miscount Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00258v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Street intersection counts and densities are ubiquitous measures in transport geography and planning. However, typical street network data and typical street network analysis tools can substantially overcount them. This article explains the three main reasons why this happens and presents solutions to each. It contributes algorithms to automatically simplify spatial graphs of urban street networks -- via edge simplification and node consolidation -- resulting in faster parsimonious models and more accurate network measures like intersection counts and densities, street segment lengths, and node degrees. These algorithms' information compression improves downstream graph analytics' memory and runtime efficiency, boosting analytical tractability without loss of model fidelity. Finally, this article validates these algorithms and empirically assesses intersection count biases worldwide to demonstrate the problem's widespread prevalence. Without consolidation, traditional methods would overestimate the median urban area intersection count by 14%. However, this bias varies drastically across regions, underscoring these algorithms' importance for consistent comparative empirical analyses.</description>

      <title>Immersive and Wearable Thermal Rendering for Augmented Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In augmented reality (AR), where digital content is overlaid onto the real world, realistic thermal feedback has been shown to enhance immersion. Yet current thermal feedback devices, heavily influenced by the needs of virtual reality, often hinder physical interactions and are ineffective for immersion in AR. To bridge this gap, we have identified three design considerations relevant for AR thermal feedback: indirect feedback to maintain dexterity, thermal passthrough to preserve real-world temperature perception, and spatiotemporal rendering for dynamic sensations. We then created a unique and innovative thermal feedback device that satisfies these criteria. Human subject experiments assessing perceptual sensitivity, object temperature matching, spatial pattern recognition, and moving thermal stimuli demonstrated the impact of our design, enabling realistic temperature discrimination, virtual object perception, and enhanced immersion. These findings demonstrate that carefully designed thermal feedback systems can bridge the sensory gap between physical and virtual interactions, enhancing AR realism and usability.</description>
