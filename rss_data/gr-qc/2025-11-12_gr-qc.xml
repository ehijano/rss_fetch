      <title>Quasi-Periodic Oscillations and Parameter Constraints in ModMax Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the impact of ModMax parameter on the dynamics of test particles around black holes and its effect on the characteristics of Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs). The effect of the ModMax parameter $\eta$ is studied using the effective potential, angular momentum and the energy of the circular orbits of the test particles. Our analysis shows that increasing $\eta$ brings about a continuous transition from the RN regime toward the Schwarzschild limit, accompanied by noticeable modifications in the Innermost Stable Circular Orbit (ISCO) and the corresponding Keplerian frequencies. We also explore the dependence of QPO radii on the ModMax parameter $\eta$ within the framework of the PR, RP, WD, and ER models. Finally, to place observational constraints, we perform a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using QPO data from a range of black hole sources spanning stellar-mass, intermediate-mass, and supermassive scales.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Mode Spectroscopy via Horizon-Brightened Quantum Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a quantum optical framework for probing black hole quasinormal modes (QNMs) using two-level atoms in the spirit of the horizon-brightened acceleration radiation (HBAR) program. Starting from the QNM contribution to the Wightman function of a scalar field on a static, spherically symmetric black hole background, we derive the response function of a two-level Unruh--DeWitt detector following simple trajectories (static at fixed radius, with comments on radial free fall). The QNM sector imprints a set of Lorentzian resonances in the detector spectrum at the redshifted real parts of the QNM frequencies, with widths determined by the imaginary parts. We then treat a single dominant QNM as an effective non-Hermitian cavity mode coupled to an ensemble of driven two-level atoms, and derive a master equation of Dicke laser type. The resulting lasing threshold condition depends explicitly on the QNM damping rate, providing a direct quantum optical interpretation of the imaginary part of the QNM frequency. Specializing to the Schwarzschild geometry, we express the resonant frequencies, linewidths, and threshold in terms of photon-sphere data in the eikonal limit. We discuss several extensions and propose our framework as a unifying language connecting black hole ringdown, near-horizon conformal quantum mechanics, and quantum optics, thereby enriching the emerging program of black hole spectroscopy in the gravitational-wave era.</description>

      <title>Tests of General Relativity with Einstein Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences offer a powerful and reliable probe of General Relativity. To date, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration has provided stringent consistency tests of General Relativity predictions. In this work, we present forecasts for the accuracy with which General Relativity can be tested using third-generation ground-based interferometers, focusing on Einstein Telescope (ET) and binary black hole mergers. Given the expected high detection rate, performing full Bayesian analyses for each event becomes computationally challenging. To overcome this, we adopt a Fisher matrix approach, simulating parameter estimation in an idealized observation scenario, which allows us to study large populations of compact binary coalescences with feasible computational efforts. Within this framework, we investigate the constraints that ET, in its different configurations, can impose on inspiral post-Newtonian coefficients, by jointly analyzing events using a Bayesian hierarchical methodology. Our results indicate that ET could in principle achieve an accuracy of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ on the dipole radiation term and $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ on higher-order post-Newtonian coefficients, for both the triangular and the two L-shaped designs, with $10^4$ catalog events. We also assess the number of detections required to confidently identify deviations from General Relativity at various post-Newtonian orders and for different detector configurations.</description>

      <title>Algebraic classification of 2+1 geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new effective method of algebraic classification of 2+1 geometries. Our approach simply classifies spacetimes using five real scalars, defined as specific projections of the Cotton tensor onto a suitable null basis. The algebraic type of a spacetime is determined by gradual vanishing of these scalars. We derive the Bel-Debever criteria, together with the multiplicity of the Cotton aligned null directions (CANDs). Additionally, we provide a frame-independent algorithm for classification based on the polynomial curvature invariants and show the equivalence to previous methods of classification.</description>

      <title>Ringdown of a black hole embedded in a Burkert dark matter halo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a new static, spherically symmetric black hole spacetime embedded in a dark matter halo whose density follows the cored Burkert profile. Starting from the halo-only geometry determined by the rotation curve relation, we solve the Einstein equations with the Burkert stress-energy and enforce a Schwarzschild boundary condition, obtaining closed form metric functions in which the halo contribution deforms the redshift or shape functions and reduces to the Schwarzschild limit when the halo parameters vanish. On this background we study linear perturbations of test fields with spins $s=0,1,2$ and compute their quasinormal spectra using both a high order WKB scheme and continued fraction method, complemented by time domain evolutions. We find that increasing either the Burkert core radius $r_0$ or the central density $\rho_0$ generically shifts the real part of the frequencies upward and enhances damping, while the multipole index $l$ primarily increases the oscillation frequency with a milder impact on the decay rate. The two frequency extraction methods agree to within small, systematic offsets across the explored parameter space. Our results quantify how a cored dark matter environment imprints itself on the ringdown of a central black hole and provide benchmarks for future gravitational wave tests of halo properties.</description>

      <title>The Influence of Stable Photon Sphere Advent on Orbital Precession in moving towards the Extremality: Periapsis Shift as a Gateway to the Weak Gravity Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the effects of solar mass change can be neglected in studies of solar periapsis shifts-given the relevant timescales and magnitude of change-the influence of a black hole's dynamic and chaotic mass variation on the Periapsis Shift of test particles in its surrounding spacetime demands a detailed and meticulous investigation. Recognizing that black hole mass variation is inherently a continuous and dynamic process, but the extended timescales required for such variations allow us, to employ a static, frame-by-frame approach. We're assuming constant mass within individual frames, while permitting inter-frame mass evolution to prob the effects of mass loss on orbital dynamics. Using this method, we investigate whether the Periapsis Shift in the extremal limit can serve as evidence for the Weak Gravity Conjecture (WGC), addressing the conjecture's role in preserving black hole integrity during evaporation. Subsequently, we analyze the Periapsis Shift under Aschenbach-like conditions, where a stable photon sphere generates non-monotonic orbital velocity profiles, to assess its dynamical impact on relativistic precession. Finally, we synthesize the combined effects of extremality and the presence of stable photon sphere, revealing profound modifications to the Periapsis Shift profile, including prograde-to-retrograde transitions and radial dependencies. Our results demonstrate that the Periapsis Shift--not merely its magnitude but its qualitative orbital behavior--allows a meaningful experimental probe for the WGC in strong-field regimes.</description>

      <title>Detecting Parity-Violating Gravitational Wave Backgrounds with Pulsar Polarization Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays probe isotropic stochastic gravitational wave (GW) backgrounds in the nanohertz band but are insensitive to its parity-violating component. Motivated by recent progress in pulsar polarization arrays, we study the response of pulsar polarimetry to GWs and evaluate its potential to detect circular polarization in isotropic stochastic GW backgrounds, which characterizes parity violation. Based on geometric optics, we derive the rotation of the polarization of electromagnetic waves induced by propagation through a GW background. We show that the cross-correlation between pulsar timing and polarimetry signals isolates the circular polarization component from the GW intensity, sharing the same Hellings-Downs angular pattern. With future facilities such as the SKA, timing-polarimetry correlations could reach sensitivities to the circular polarization of GWs comparable to those of the current astrometric methods.</description>

      <title>Decoding Horizonless Spacetime: Plasma-Induced Features in a Rotating Wormhole Shadow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the shadow properties in a recently proposed geometry of a rotating wormhole under realistic astrophysical conditions, particularly in the presence of a cold and non magnetized plasma environment surrounding the wormhole throat. Using the Hamilton Jacobi formalism, we derive the orbit equation under specific plasma density profiles, where we consider plasma as dispersive medium and disregard its influence on the background geometry. The electron density distribution is chosen to preserve a generalized Carter constant. We explore the shadow cast by this class of rotating wormhole in the presence of both homogeneous and non homogeneous plasma as seen by an asymptotic observer. The photon regions are visualized, and the influence of geometric parameters, plasma parameters, and the observer inclination angle with the rotation axis on the resulting shadow morphology is analyzed. We tried to implement constraints on the plasma and the geometrical parameters of the wormhole such as the spin parameter and the deviation (from Kerr) parameter in the back drop of recent observational bounds coming from the deviation from circularity of the shadow boundary ($\Delta C$) and deviation of the average shadow radius from Schwarzschild ($\delta$). The bound on $\Delta C$ is satisfied by the theoretically allowed range of parameters thus not found very useful to put any constraint, we could impose stringent constraints on the parameters based on the observed value of $\delta$. By comparing the optical characteristics of the image of these wormholes with those of Kerr black holes under analogous plasma conditions, we identify the features that could serve as discriminants for similar types of compact objects.</description>

      <title>Solar-system experimental constraints on nonlocal gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the constraints on the characteristic parameters $(\zeta,b)$ of the Deser-Woodard nonlocal gravity model in a static and spherically symmetric background, using four classes of high-precision Solar-System experiments: stellar light deflection, Shapiro time delay, perihelion advance, and geodetic precession. From geodesic equations, we derive observable geometric quantities that can be directly compared with VLBI/VLBA astrometry, the Cassini time-delay measurement, MESSENGER data and the GP-B/LLR results. Our results show that a larger value of $b$ suppresses the nonlocal effect more rapidly with radius, thereby weakening the overall constraints on $\zeta$. The perihelion advance exhibits the strongest sensitivity to $\zeta$ around $b\simeq 1.06$, providing the tightest single experiment bound, whereas away from this region the combined constraint becomes dominated by the Shapiro time delay. Incorporating all four experiments yields a well-defined and sharply bounded allowed region for the parameter space $(\zeta,b)$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dispersion over inhomogeneous space-times: General relativity, screened theories of gravity and non-minimal dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) are direct probes of cosmological gravity, sensitive to space-time inhomogeneities along their propagation. The presence of massive objects breaks homogeneity and isotropy, allowing for new interactions between different GW polarizations, and opening up the intriguing opportunity to test modified gravity theories. This setup generalizes the notion of gravitational deflection and lensing, revealing novel phenomena in modified theories. Any non-minimal theory introduces effective mass terms for GWs, causing \textit{lens-induced dispersion} (LID), a frequency-dependent phase shift on the waveform. We compute GW dispersion in Einstein's general relativity (GR) for a spherical matter distribution, finding a small but non-zero phasing that is potentially accessible to next-generation detectors. We then extend our analysis to scalar-tensor theories, focusing on symmetron gravity as an example of screened theory, combining cosmological deviations and consistency with local gravity tests. We find enhanced GW dispersion in a large region of the symmetron parameter space, compared to both GR and Brans-Dicke theory. We argue that dispersion, associated to an effective mass for the metric fluctuations, can in some cases prevent the propagation of GWs through some astrophysical bodies, turning them into reflectors. Our analysis shows that the Earth becomes an efficient GW shield for a hitherto unconstrained region of the symmetron parameter space, leading to a $\sim 50\%$ fraction of events becoming unobservable or at least displaying a dramatic modification of the detector antenna response. The richness and universality of dispersive phenomena in non-minimal theories open a new avenue to test theories of dynamical dark-energy, relevant in light of recent observational results challenging the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass ratio inspirals into black holes surrounded by matter: Resonance crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forthcoming space-based gravitational-wave observatory Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) should enable the detection of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs), in which a stellar-mass compact object gradually inspirals into a supermassive black hole while emitting gravitational waves. Modeling the waveforms of such systems is a challenging task, requiring precise computation of energy and angular momentum fluxes as well as proper treatment of orbital resonances, during which two fundamental orbital frequencies become commensurate. In this work, we perform a systematic comparison of fluxes derived from three approaches: the quadrupole formula, post-Newtonian approximations, and time-domain solutions of the Teukolsky equation. We show that quadrupole-based fluxes remain in good agreement with Teukolsky results across a broad range of orbital configurations, including perturbed orbits. Building on these insights, we explore the dynamical impact of resonance crossings within the adiabatic approximation. By introducing novel numerical methods, we reduce computational costs and uncover diverse resonance-crossing behaviors. These results contribute to the effort to understand theoretically and model adequately resonance crossings during an EMRI.</description>

      <title>Directional Quantum Singularities in Curzon Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The scalar quantum probe method developed by Horowitz and Marolf is applied to the cylindrically symmetric Curzon solution. The main cause for choosing the Curzon solution is that it is the best known example that exhibits directional singularity. Interestingly the singularity at $r=0$, for the uncharged Curzon spacetime, which is classically very strong with a divergence rate of the order $\frac{1}{r^{10}}$ becomes regular when examined using scalar quantum field. The charged Curzon spacetime, however, due to the emergence of a second singularity off the $r=0$ singularity does not regularize quantum mechanically. All three different charged versions, i.e. electric, magnetic and dyonic share the same feature.</description>

      <title>Constraining modified theories of gravity through the detection of one extremely large mass-ratio inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extremely large mass-ratio inspirals (XMRIs), formed by brown dwarfs inspiraling into a massive black hole, emit gravitational waves (GWs) that fall within the detection band of future space-borne detectors such as LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Their detection will measure the astrophysical properties of the MBH in the center of our galaxy (SgrA$^\ast$) with unprecedented accuracy and provide a unique probe of gravity in the strong field regime. Here, we estimate the benefit of using the GWs from XMRIs to constrain the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that XMRI signals radiated from the late stages of the evolution are particularly sensitive to differences between Chern-Simons theory and general relativity. For low-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the Chern-Simons parameter $\zeta$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-3}$. For high-eccentricity sources, XMRIs can put bounds on the parameter $\zeta$ at the level of $10^{-1}$ to an accuracy of $10^{-6}$. Furthermore, using the time-frequency MCMC method, we obtain the posterior distribution of XMRIs in the Chern-Simons theory. Our results show that almost all the parameters can be recovered within $1\sigma$ confidence interval. For most of the intrinsic parameters, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-3}$. For the brown dwarf mass, the estimation accuracy reaches $10^{-1}$, while for $\zeta$, the estimation accuracy reaches $\Delta\log_{10}\zeta=0.08$ for high eccentricity sources and 1.27 for low eccentricity sources.</description>

      <title>Chaotic motion of particles around a dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ the Poincar\'{e} section, fast Lyapunov indicator, recurrence analysis, bifurcation diagram and basins of attraction to investigate the dynamical behaviors of the motion of particles around a new dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe presented in [A. Di Pinto, S. Klemm, and A. Vigan\`o, J. High Energy Phys. {\bf 06}, 150 (2025)]. We note that the swirling parameter $j$ and magnetic field strength $B$ make the equations of motion for particles nonseparable, and confirm the presence of chaotic behavior in the motion in this dyonic Kerr-Newman-Melvin-swirling spacetime and its sub-cases by removing the conical singularities and removing both the conical singularities and the Dirac strings. We observe that both the number of chaotic orbits and the chaotic region increase with the increase of the parameters $j$ and $B$, but decrease as the electric charge $Q$, magnetic charge $H$ or spin parameter $a$ increases. Moreover, we find that the presence of $j$ changes the ranges of $B$, $Q$, $H$ and $a$ where the chaotic motion appears for particles. The swirling parameter together with the magnetic field strength, electric charge, magnetic charge and spin parameter yields richer physics in the motion of particles for the spacetime of a dyonic Kerr-Newman black hole immersed in the Melvin-swirling universe.</description>

      <title>Earth-orbit bounds on screened dark energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test dark-energy-motivated screening mechanisms with near-Earth space-based measurements. Within a post-Newtonian treatment, we compute leading corrections to three observables, namely geodetic precession (Gravity Probe B), pericenter advance of LAGEOS-2, and Sagnac time delay in a prospective orbital configuration. We then map these corrections to bounds on chameleon, symmetron, and dilaton models. LAGEOS-2 data yield the strongest Earth-orbit limits for symmetron and dilaton models, while a prospective Sagnac setup provides the tightest constraint for chameleons. These results highlight the relevance of low-density, space-based experiments as sensitive probes of screened dark energy and exclude previously allowed regions of parameter space.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures from Periodic Orbits around a non-commutative inspired black hole surrounded by quintessence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational wave emission from periodic orbits of a test particle around a noncommutative-inspired black hole surrounded by quintessence. Using the zoom-whirl taxonomy, which is characterized by three topological numbers $(z, w, v)$, we classify these orbits and calculate several representative gravitational waveforms for certain periodic orbits. We find that the noncommutative parameter $\Theta$ and the quintessence field significantly modify both the orbital structure and the emitted waveforms. In particular, increasing $\Theta$ leads to a phase shift and a change in amplitude in the waveform, while higher zoom numbers produce more complicated substructures. The characteristic strain spectra peak in the millihertz range, lying within the sensitivity band of the LISA detector. Moreover, the presence of the quintessence field introduces significant modifications to these waveforms, imprinting measurable deviations that could be tested or constrained by future space-based gravitational wave detectors. These results suggest that future space-based gravitational wave missions could probe or constrain noncommutative effects in strong gravitational fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A universal contribution exists in the infrared (low frequency) regime of all gravitational waves, which results from nonlinear memory. Nonlinear memory is sourced by linear order gravitational waves and exists for any gravitational-wave background. We calculate the stochastic nonlinear memory signal of various stochastic backgrounds of cosmological (scalar induced, reheating, phase transition, topological defect, turbulence) and astrophysical (binary mergers of stellar-mass, intermediate mass, supermassive, and primordial black holes) origins. These results allow us to derive the complete frequency spectrum of cosmological and astrophysical SGWB. We calculate how to probe the thermal state of the universe, i.e. the equation of the state, via the memory spectrum's slope and also discuss the detection prospects at various frequency bands with future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we construct a family of spherically symmetric thin-shell wormholes within scalar-tensor theories of gravity. In the case of wormholes symmetric across the throat, we study the matter content and analyze the stability of the static configurations under radial perturbations. We apply the formalism to two particular examples involving Einstein-Maxwell gravity coupled to a conformal scalar field. In both scenarios, we show that stable configurations are possible for suitable values of the parameters involved.</description>

      <title>Production of Gravitational Waves from Preheating and Tachyonic Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.27586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze GW production during preheating for an $\alpha$-attractor potential terminating in the positive-curvature regime, with energy transfer via $\phi\chi^{2}$. Linear Floquet analysis and nonlinear simulations show that $\phi$ fluctuations grow by parametric resonance, while $\chi$ undergoes tachyonic bursts. The GW spectrum features two peaks: a dominant low-frequency peak from the parametric channel and a subdominant high-frequency peak from the tachyonic channel. Redshifted to today, the peak reaches $h^{2}\Omega_{\rm GW}^{(0)} \sim 10^{-11}$ at $f^{(0)}_{p} \sim 10^{7}$ Hz. This multi-peak structure is a characteristic imprint of trilinear preheating in $\alpha$-attractors.</description>

      <title>A New Derivation of Classical Gravitational Second Law of Thermodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is established that black holes have entropy and behave as thermodynamical systems. Associating entropy to gravitational fields has not remained limited to black holes, necessitating the notion of the second law of thermodynamics in gravitating systems. There have been many ideas and attempts to prove the second law in gravitational systems starting from first principles. Within the covariant phase space formalism, we define gravitational entropy as the charge associated with the local boosts, detaching the gravitational entropy from horizons or trapped surfaces. Our definition encompasses and generalizes the existing notions of entropy. Using this definition for the Einstein gravity case, we compute variations of the entropy along the path of any causal observer and establish that the entropy variations are always non-negative if the matter content satisfies the strong energy condition integrated along any segment of the causal path.</description>

      <title>Celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ Symmetries and Subleading Phase Space of Null Hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pursuing our analysis of [1], we study the gravitational solution space around a null hypersurface in the bulk of spacetime, such as a black hole or a cosmological horizon. We discuss the corresponding characteristic initial value problem both in the metric and Newman-Penrose formalisms, and establish an explicit dictionary between the two. This allows us to identify Weyl-covariant structures in the solution space, including hierarchies of recursion relations encoding the flux-balance laws. We then establish a correspondence between the gravitational phase space at null infinity and the subleading phase space around the null hypersurface at finite distance. This connection is naturally formulated within the Newman-Penrose formalism by performing a partially off-shell conformal compactification and identifying the analogue of the Ashtekar-Streubel symplectic structure in the radial expansion near the null hypersurface. Using this framework, we identify the celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in the subleading phase space at finite distance by constructing their canonical generators and imposing self-duality conditions. This allows us to define a notion of covariant radiation, whose absence gives rise to an infinite tower of conserved charges, revealing physical quantities relevant to observers near black hole or cosmological horizons. As a concrete illustration, we consider the case of the self-dual Taub-NUT black hole.</description>

      <title>The impact of precession and higher-order multipoles on cosmological inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave astronomy presents an exciting opportunity to provide an independent measurement of the expansion rate of the Universe. By combining inferences for the binary component masses and luminosity distances from individual observations, it is possible to infer $H_0$ without direct electromagnetic counterparts or galaxy catalogs. However, this relies on theoretical gravitational-wave models, which are known to be incomplete descriptions of the full predictions of general relativity. Although the accuracy of our models are improving, they are also becoming increasingly expensive as additional phenomena are incorporated. In this work, we demonstrate that there is no significant advantage in including spin-precession and higher-order multipole moments when inferring $H_0$ via the mass spectrum method for current and near-future gravitational-wave event numbers. Even when simulating a population of highly precessing and preferentially asymmetric-mass-ratio binaries, we show that the inferred $H_0$ posterior changes minimally. Using a simpler, less accurate model, achieves comparable $H_0$ estimates with six times less computational cost (on average). Using computationally cheaper models for single event inference may become crucial as thousands of gravitational-wave observations are expected to be detected in the near future.</description>

      <title>Alternative approach to time-delay interferometry with optical frequency comb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spaceborne gravitational wave observatories, exemplified by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission, are designed to remove laser noise and clock noise from interferometric phase measurements in postprocessing. The planned observatories will utilize electro-optic modulators (EOMs) to encode the onboard clock timing onto the beam phase. Recent research has demonstrated the advantage of introducing an optical frequency comb (OFC) in the metrology system with the modified framework of time-delay interferometry (TDI): the removal of the EOM and the simultaneous suppression of the stochastic jitter of the laser and the clock in the observation band. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach with the OFC-based metrology system. We report that after proper treatment, it is possible to use the measured carrier-carrier heterodyne frequencies to monitor the time derivative of the pseudoranges, which represent the physical light travel time and the clock difference. This approach does not require changing the existing TDI framework, as previous OFC based efforts did. We also present the experimental demonstration of our scheme using two separate systems to model two spacecraft. Using this novel approach, we synchronize the two independent phase measurement systems with an accuracy better than 0.47 ns, while the stochastic jitter in the observation band is suppressed down to the setup sensitivity around the LISA performance levels at 15 pm/sqrt(Hz).</description>

      <title>Kerr Polarization Transport: Accuracy and Performance in General Relativistic Light Propagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a compact and reproducible method for general relativistic polarization transport in the Kerr metric that achieves median electric vector position angle (EVPA) residuals of $\langle \Delta \mathrm{PA} \rangle \approx 0.09^\circ$, a 95th percentile of $0.31^\circ$, and a worst case $\Delta \mathrm{PA} \lesssim 0.32^\circ$ for spins up to $|a/M|=0.9$, while maintaining a fivefold or greater speedup relative to a strict reference integrator. Across the benchmark grid, typical residuals remain at the sub-tenth-degree level, with only modest degradation ($\Delta \mathrm{PA} \lesssim 2^\circ$) near the Thorne spin limit. Photon four-momenta $k^\mu$ and polarization four-vectors $f^\mu$ are advanced using a fourth order Runge-Kutta scheme with cached Christoffel symbols, maintaining the constraints $u\cdot f=0$ and $n\cdot f=0$, where $u^\mu$ is the ZAMO four-velocity and $n^\mu$ is the disk normal, while keeping $k\cdot f \simeq 0$. A physically motivated gauge is enforced by projecting the polarization into the local zero-angular-momentum observer (ZAMO) screen at every substep, ensuring numerical stability of the orthogonality constraints. Accuracy and performance are benchmarked over a representative grid in spin, inclination, image-plane azimuth, and radius. The method comfortably meets IXPE and NICER polarization tolerances and approaches EHT requirements. The approach provides a practical foundation for future general relativistic polarimetry and simulation pipelines.</description>

      <title>Could the stochastic gravitational wave background from newborn magnetars be detected by the advanced LIGO and Einstein Telescope?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Newborn magnetars are important gravitational wave sources due to their ultra-strong magnetic fields and fast spins, and the entire population in the Universe may significantly contribute to the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). In this work, we investigate the SGWB from newborn magnetars and assess its detectability by the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) and Einstein Telescope (ET) based on three typical formation mechanisms of magnetars, i.e., the $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo, convective dynamo, and magnetic flux conservation. For the two dynamo scenarios, when calculating the SGWB, we creatively incorporate the anti-correlations between the magnetic fields and initial spin periods $P_{\rm i}$ with the initial dipole-field distribution of newborn magnetars. For the flux-conservation scenario, a bimodal lognormal form is adopted to describe the distribution of initial dipole fields, and all magnetars are assumed to have the same $P_{\rm i}$. Our results show that the SGWB from newborn magnetars may be undetectable by the aLIGO and ET if the magnetars are formed due to these mechanisms since the signal-to-noise ratio of the SGWB with respect to the ET for an observation time of one year is only 0.37 for the $\alpha-\Omega$ dynamo, $3\times10^{-4}$ for the convective dynamo, and at most 0.21 for the flux conservation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend Beem's three completeness notions -- finite compactness, timelike Cauchy completeness, and Condition A -- originally defined for spacetimes, to Lorentzian length spaces and study their relationships.
  We prove that finite compactness implies timelike Cauchy completeness and that
  timelike Cauchy completeness implies Condition A for globally hyperbolic Lorentzian length spaces.
  Furthermore, for globally hyperbolic $C^{1}$-spacetimes under suitable assumptions
  ensuring good behavior of causal geodesics, we show that the three conditions are equivalent.
  These results can be regarded as a Hopf-Rinow type theorem for low-regularity Lorentzian geometry.
  The appendix presents examples of $C^{1}$-spacetimes -- where geodesic uniqueness may fail -- in which causal geodesics nevertheless behave well, illustrating the scope of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy, which is a non-Hermitian generalization of entanglement entropy in a two-dimensional conformal field theory (CFT), is equivalent to the perturbative Einstein equation in three-dimensional de Sitter (dS) space, assuming the dS/CFT correspondence. Our analysis reveals that the geodesic that accurately satisfies the first law of holographic pseudo-entropy consists of a timelike curve and a curve whose coordinates are complex. We also demonstrate that infinitesimal changes to the pseudo entropy satisfy a Klein-Gordon equation in two-dimensional de Sitter space. These imply the emergence of a time coordinate from a Euclidean CFT in dS/CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an entropy-based framework to analyze gravitational-wave signals from core-collapse supernovae. We use waveforms generated by numerical simulations and analyze them in both the time domain and the time-frequency domain using short-time Fourier and continuous wavelet transforms. From each representation, we compute four entropy measures -- Shannon, exponential, R\'enyi, and Tsallis -- and apply three feature selection methods to identify the most informative features. We then train machine-learning classifiers on these features to compare the performance of different methodological combinations. We find that the combination of R\'enyi entropy from the wavelet domain and the Relief-F selection method yields the most effective discrimination among different gravitational-wave signals.</description>

      <title>Accelerated inference of microlensed gravitational waves with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GWs) propagating through the universe can be microlensed by stellar and intermediate-mass objects. Lensing induces frequency-dependent amplification of GWs, which can be computed using \texttt{GLoW}, an accurate code suitable for evaluating this factor for generic lens models and arbitrary impact parameters depending on the lens configuration. For parameter inference, we employ the DINGO algorithm, a machine learning framework based on neural posterior estimation, a simulation-based inference method that uses normalizing flows to efficiently approximate posterior distributions of the physical parameters. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that it enables efficient parameter estimation of diffracted GW signals using an isolated point mass lens model. This method can be useful for rapidly identifying microlensed events within large GW catalogs and for conducting population studies of compact binaries. Compared to traditional parameter estimation techniques, we find that combining DINGO with importance sampling can provide efficient estimation of the background Bayes-factor distribution, which is required in evaluating the significance of candidate lensed events. However, for foreground (lensed) events, care must be taken, as sampling efficiency can decrease when the lensed data lie outside the distribution learned by the unlensed DINGO network. Our framework can be naturally extended to more complex and realistic lens models, allowing detailed analyses of the microlensed GWs.</description>

      <title>Early Formation of Supermassive Black Holes via Dark Star Gravitational Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that dark stars, which are dark-matter-powered stars in the early universe, can grow by accretion to masses in the range $\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^4\right )-\mathscr{O}\left ({10}^7\right)\,{M_\odot}$ before the general-relativistic Feynman-Chandrasekhar instability causes their dynamical collapse to black holes. These accreting dark star configurations avoid standard stellar nuclear- and weak-interaction evolution that would lead to their demise long before they reached this supermassive size. Remarkably, this mechanism for supermassive black hole (SMBH) genesis is relatively robust to initial dark star mass, formation epoch, accretion rate and its history. The SMBHs produced this way can serve as seeds for even larger SMBHs $({\gtrsim}10^9\,M_\odot)$ that have been discovered at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact of Systematic Bias in Type Ia Supernova Cosmology Across Diverse Dark Energy Parametrizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of instrumental and astrophysical systematics on dark energy constraints derived from Type~Ia supernova (SN-Ia) observations. Using simulated datasets consistent with current SN-Ia measurements, we explore how uncertainties in photometric calibration, intergalactic dust, progenitor evolution in luminosity and light-curve stretch, and intrinsic color scatter affect the inferred dark energy equation of state parameters (w0, wa). We test the Generalised Scale Factor (GEN) evolution and benchmark it against three time-evolving dark energy models; namely Chevallier Polarski Linder (CPL), Jassal Bagla Padmanabhan (JBP) and Logarithmic (LOG) parametrizations; comparing their sensitivity to these systematic effects. Calibration biases and progenitor evolution emerge as the dominant sources of uncertainty, while simpler parametrisations, viz. GEN, which directly describes the expansion rate, remains relatively stable under all systematic injections, unlike CPL, JBP and LOG that rely on the dark energy equation of state. These findings underscore the need for sub-per cent calibration precision and enhanced astrophysical modelling to ensure the robustness of dark energy inferences from current and future SN-Ia cosmology experiments.</description>

      <title>Stable evolution of relativistic hydrodynamics order-by-order in gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a systematic framework for solving the initial value problem for relativistic hydrodynamics formulated as a gradient expansion. Secular growth is handled by a suitable covariant resummation scheme, which reorganises the degrees of freedom at each order in the expansion while preserving the sum. Our scheme can be applied to any order in the gradient expansion; we provide the explicit formulation at first and second orders. When working to first order, we find that the BDNK equations of motion emerge as an intermediate step in a calculation performed in the Landau frame. We show that non-hydrodynamic modes appear only in such intermediate calculations and cancel when evaluating solutions to the required order. Our procedure does not introduce any other fields or require any additional initial data beyond those appearing in the theory of ideal fluids.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the scattering of gravitino wave in a Schwarzschild gravitational field. Employing the simulating wave function method within the framework of perturbative techniques, we derive the differential scattering cross section for the gravitino wave in the long-wavelength limit. It is proven that the cross section of gravitino wave follows the same spin-dependent pattern as those of scalar, neutrino, and electromagnetic waves.</description>

Abstract: A bouncing Universe avoids the big-bang singularity. Using the time-like and null Raychaudhhuri equations, we explore whether the bounce near the big-bang, within a broad spectrum of modified theories of gravity, allows for cosmologically relevant power-law solutions under reasonable physical conditions. Our study shows that certain modified theories of gravity, such as Stelle gravity, do not demonstrate singularity resolution under any reasonable conditions, while others including $f(R)$ gravity and Brans-Dicke theory can demonstrate singularity resolution under suitable conditions. For these theories, we show that the accelerating solution is slightly favoured over ekypyrosis.</description>

      <title>Source Confusion of Massive Black Hole Binaries for the Taiji Mission</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09679v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the source confusion of massive black hole binaries (MBHBs) for the Taiji space-based gravitational wave mission. Source confusion, arising from the overlap of signals in both time and frequency domains, can degrade parameter recovery accuracy. To assess this effect, we simulate three representative models MBHB populations to estimate event overlap events. Assuming 100 detections per year, only 0.31-4.2 overlaps are expected annually. Based on Fisher information matrix with the $\texttt{IMRPhenomD}$ and $\texttt{IMRPhenomHM}$ waveform models, we find that overlap significantly enlarges parameter uncertainties, while the inclusion of higher-order modes (HMs) effectively mitigates this effect. Severe confusion ($\Delta \mathcal{M}_z / \mathcal{M}_z&lt;$ 0.2%) occurs in fewer than 0.14% across the three population models. The full Bayesian analysis further corroborates the Fisher predictions, and also reveals that HMs help break key parameter degeneracies, with or without signal overlap. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating HMs for accurate inference in future space-based observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22545v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a canonical quantization framework for static spherically symmetric spacetimes described by the Einstein-Hilbert action with a cosmological constant. In addition to recovering the classical Schwarzschild-(Anti)-de Sitter solutions via the Ehrenfest theorem, we investigate the quantum uncertainty relations that arise among the geometric operators in this setup. Our analysis uncovers an intriguing relation to black hole thermodynamics and opens a new angle towards generalized uncertainty relations. We further obtain an upper and a lower limit of the mass that is allowed in our model, for a given value of the cosmological constant. Both limits, when evaluated for the known value of the cosmological constant, have a stunning relation to observed bounds. These findings open a promising avenue for deeper insights into how quantum effects manifest in spacetime geometry and gravitational systems.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal Modes of a Massive Scalar Field in Slowly Rotating Einstein-Bumblebee Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the impacts of black hole spin, Lorentz-violating parameter, and the scalar field's mass on quasinormal modes (QNMs) of rotating Einstein-Bumblebee black holes, including computations up to the second-order expansion in rotation parameters. We investigate two classes of Lorentz-violating rotating black holes: one constructed via the Newman-Janis algorithm and the other obtained by solving the field equations through a series expansion. Within the slow-rotation approximation framework, we derive the master equations governing a massive scalar field and compute the corresponding QNM frequencies numerically using both the continued fraction method and the matrix method. The numerical results indicate that the QNM frequencies exhibit increased sensitivity to negative $\ell$ variations, which reduces the influence of the field mass parameter $\tilde{\mu}$. Meanwhile, the spectral "cube" of NJA black holes shows slight compression for $m&gt;0$ with $ \ell&gt;0 $ and expansion for $m&lt;0$ with $ \ell&gt;0 $ compared to another black holes, where $m$ is approximately proportional to the spin parameter at first order, while richer structures and lifted degeneracy emerge at second order.</description>

      <title>Can the latent signatures of quantum superposition be detected through correlation harvesting?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore correlation harvesting in quantum superposition, specifically focusing on the entanglement and mutual information extracted by two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum field in a mass-superposed BTZ black hole spacetime. Our findings reveal that the superposed nature of spacetime induces constructive interference between the field modes that can significantly enhance the entanglement harvesting relative to a single spacetime background. In contrast to entanglement, the mutual information obtained in spacetime superposition is influenced by the proper distance between the two detectors. While the mutual information harvested in a superposed spacetime remains lower than that in a single spacetime when the proper distance between detectors is small, it exceeds that in a single spacetime for specific mass ratios as the distance increases. Notably, we find that both entanglement and mutual information harvesting reach their maxima when the final spacetime superposition state is conditioned to align with the initial spacetime state.</description>

      <title>Self-Gravity in Superradiance Clouds: Implications for Binary Dynamics and Observational Prospects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08367v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spinning black holes could produce ultralight particles via the superradiance instability. These particles form a dense cloud around the host black hole, introducing new opportunities for the detection of ultralight new physics. When the black hole is part of a binary system, the binary can trigger transitions among different states of the cloud configuration. Such transitions backreact on the orbital dynamics, modifying the frequency evolution of the emitted gravitational waves. Based on this observation, black hole binaries were proposed as a way to test the existence of ultralight particles. We investigate the effects of the self-gravity of the cloud on the orbital evolution and on the gravitational wave emission. We find that cloud self-gravity could lead to a density-dependent modification of the energy levels of ultralight particles and that it could alter the order of hyperfine energy levels. The crossing of hyperfine levels prevents binaries from triggering resonant hyperfine transitions and allows them to approach radii that could trigger resonant transitions of fine levels. We study the implications of these findings, especially in the context of future space-borne gravitational wave observatory, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). For quasi-circular, prograde and equatorial orbits, we find that LISA could probe ultralight particles in the mass range $10^{-15}\,{\rm eV} \, - \, 10^{-13}\, {\rm eV}$ through gravitational wave observations.</description>

We discuss the design requirements and example use cases for this data product, constructed from $&gt; 4.33\times10^8$ injections during O4a alone. We also identify subtle effects with high confidence, like diurnal duty cycles within detectors. This paper accompanies a public data release of the curated injection set, and the appendixes give detailed examples of how to use the publicly available data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the precise Leaver method and time-domain integration, we analyze the quasinormal modes and late-time behavior of massive neutral and charged scalar fields in the background of a charged, asymptotically flat black hole in the presence of Euler-Heisenberg nonlinear electrodynamics. We show that as the field mass increases, the damping rate decreases significantly, approaching arbitrarily long-lived states known as quasi-resonances. However, these modes cannot be identified in time-domain profiles due to the dominance of asymptotic tails in this regime, which decay slowly and exhibit oscillations with a power-law envelope. We observe that a larger field charge leads to a significantly higher quality factor, as it increases the oscillation frequency while reducing the damping rate.</description>

      <title>MaxWave: Rapid Maximum Likelihood Wavelet Reconstruction of Non-Gaussian features in Gravitational Wave Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in the sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors have increased the detection rate of transient astrophysical signals. We improve the existing BayesWave initialization algorithm and present a rapid, low latency approximate maximum likelihood solution for reconstructing non-Gaussian features. We include three enhancements: (1) using a modified wavelet basis to eliminate redundant inner product calculations, (2) shifting from traditional time-frequency-quality factor (TFQ) wavelet transforms to time-frequency-time extent (TF$\tau$) transforms to optimize wavelet subtractions, and (3) implementing a downsampled heterodyned wavelet transform to accelerate initial calculations. Our model can be used to denoise long-duration signals, which include the stochastic gravitational wave background from numerous unresolved sources and continuous wave signals from isolated sources such as rotating neutron stars. Through our model, we can also supplement machine learning applications that use spectrographic training data to classify and understand glitches by providing non-whitened, time and frequency domain reconstructions of any glitch.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00702v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate asymptotic Schwarzschild exterior solutions in the context of modified gravity theories, specifically within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, where the asymptotic behavior recovers the standard Schwarzschild solution of General Relativity. Unlike previous studies that rely mainly on analytical approximations, our approach combines asymptotic analysis with numerical integration of the underlying differential equations. Using these solutions, we analyze strong lensing effects to obtain the photon sphere radius and the corresponding capture parameter. Considering rings produced by total reflection, we define the photon sphere width as the difference between the first total reflection and the capture parameter; and study how it is modified in the $f(R)$ scenario. Our results show that the photon sphere width increases in the presence of $f(R)$-type modifications, indicating deviations from GR that could be observable in the strong-field regime.</description>

      <title>Ringdown in Vaidya spacetimes: time-dependent frequencies, Penrose limit and time-domain analyses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25062v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the possible characterization of ringdown waves in a dynamical Vaidya spacetime using the Penrose limit geometry around the dynamical photon sphere. In the case of a static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, it is known that the quasinormal frequency in the eikonal limit can be characterized by the angular velocity and the Lyapunov exponent for the null geodesic congruence on the orbit of the unstable circular null geodesic. This correspondence can be further backed up by the analysis of the Penrose limit geometry around the unstable circular null geodesic orbit. We try to extend this analysis to a Vaidya spacetime, focusing on the dynamical photon sphere in it. Then we discuss to what extent the Penrose limit geometry can be relevant to the ringdown waves in the Vaidya spacetime, comparing the results with the numerically calculated waveform in the Vaidya spacetime.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative dyonic black holes sourced by nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the first-order noncommutative (NC) corrections to the general nonlinear electrodynamics (NLE) Lagrangian depending on two electromagnetic invariants. The NC deformation of Einstein-NLE theory is implemented using the $\partial_t\wedge\partial_\varphi$ Drinfel'd twist and the NC effects are encoded in the matter sector through the Seiberg-Witten map. The resulting equations of motion reflect two distinct sources of nonlinearity in this framework; one arising from replacing Maxwell's electrodynamics with its nonlinear modifications and another from the NC deformations. Assuming a general form of static, spherically symmetric dyonic black hole as a seed solution in the commutative limit, we solve the equations of motion perturbatively to the first order in the NC parameter $a$. Finally, we evaluate the obtained corrections to the metric tensor and gauge potential for several prominent NLE theories.</description>

      <title>Effect of spin in binary neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of spin on equal and unequal mass binary neutron star mergers using finite-temperature, composition-dependent Steiner-Fischer-Hempel equation of state with parameter set ``o'' (SFHo), via 3+1 general relativistic hydrodynamics simulations which take into account neutrino emission and absorption. Equal mass, irrotational cases that have a mass of $M_{1,2}$ =$1.27M_{\odot}$, result in a long-lived neutron star, while $1.52$ and $2.05M_{\odot}$ cases lead to a prompt collapse to a black hole. For all cases, we analyse the effect of initial spin on dynamics, on the structure of the final remnant, its spin evolution, the amount and composition of the ejected matter, gravitational waves, neutrino energies {and luminosities}, and disc masses. We show that in equal mass binary neutron star mergers, the ejected mass could reach $\sim0.06M_{\odot}$ for highly aligned-spins ($\chi=0.67$). The black hole which results from such a highly spinning, high-mass binary neutron star merger reaches a dimensionless spin of $0.92$; this is the highest spin reached in binary neutron star mergers, to date.</description>

      <title>Probing Decaying Dark Matter Using the Post-EoR HI 21-cm signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the HI 21-cm power spectrum from the post-reionization epoch as a probe of a cosmological model with decaying dark matter particles. The unstable particles are assumed to undergo a 2-body decay into a massless and massive daughter. We assume that a fraction $f$ of the total dark matter budget to be unstable and quantify the decay using the life time $\Gamma^{-1}$ and the relative mass splitting $\epsilon$ between the parent and the massive daughter. The redshift space anisotropic power spectrum of the post-reionization 21-cm signal brightness temperature, as a tracer of the dark matter clustering, imprints the decaying dark matter model through its effect on background evolution and the suppression of power on small scales. We find that with an idealized futuristic intensity mapping experiment with a SKA1-Mid like radio-array, $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ can be measured at $3.37\%$ and $6.86\%$ around their fiducial values of $\epsilon = 0.012$ and $\Gamma = 0.008 {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$ respectively. When only the foreground-free window is considered in the $k-$ space, these percentage errors in $\epsilon$ and $\Gamma$ degrade to $9.91\%$ and $12.03\%$ respectively.The forecasts under identical assumptions for a second, literature-anchored benchmark ($\epsilon=1.14\times10^{-4}$, $\Gamma=1.04\times10^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gyr}^{-1}$) yields projected uncertainties of $6.16\%$ on $\epsilon$ and $8.29\%$ on $\Gamma$ while, restricting to the foreground-free window increases these to $18.77\%$ and $14.22\%$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tides in neutron stars with first-order phase transitions: the role of the discontinuity mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the late stages of a binary neutron star inspiral, dynamical tides induced in each star by its companion become significant and should be included in complete gravitational-wave (GW) modeling. We investigate the coupling between the tidal field and quasi-normal modes in hybrid stars and show that the discontinuity mode ($g$-mode) - intrinsically associated with first-order phase transitions and buoyancy - contributes non-negligibly compared with the fundamental $f$-mode. We find that the $g$-mode overlap integral can reach up to $\sim 10\%$ of the $f$-mode value for hybrid star masses in the range 1.4-2.0$M_{\odot}$, with the largest values generally associated with larger density jumps. This leads to a GW phase shift due to the $g$-mode of $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$-$1$ rad (i.e., up to $\sim5\%-10\%$ of $\Delta \phi_f$), with the largest shifts occurring for masses near the phase transition. At higher masses, the shifts remain smaller and nearly constant, with $\Delta \phi_g \lesssim 0.1$ rad (roughly $\sim 1\%$ of $\Delta \phi_f$). These GW shifts may be relevant even at the design sensitivity of current second-generation GW detectors in the most optimistic cases. Moreover, if a $g$-mode is present and lies near the $f$-mode frequency, neglecting it in the GW modeling can lead to systematic biases in neutron star parameter estimation, resulting in radius errors of up to $1\%-2\%$. These results show the importance of dynamical tides to probe neutron stars' equation of state, and to test the existence of dense-matter phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves of quasi-circular, inspiraling black hole binaries in an ultralight vector dark-matter environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational waves emitted by massive black hole binaries can be affected by a variety of environmental effects, which, if detected, could inform astrophysics and cosmology. We here study how gravitational waves emitted by black holes in quasi-circular orbits are affected by the presence of an ultra-light, vector-field, dark-matter environment that is minimally coupled to the binary. This dark-matter environment induces oscillatory gravitational potentials that perturb the orbit of the binary, leaving an imprint in the binary's binding energy, and thus, on the gravitational waves emitted. We here compute the effect of this environment on the gravitational-wave phase using the stationary-phase approximation within the post-Newtonian formalism. We then perform a Fisher analysis to estimate the detectability of this environmental effect with a four-year LISA observation, focusing on vector fields with ultra-light masses in the $(10^{-19}, 10^{-16}) \; \rm{eV}$ range. We conclude that the observation of such gravitational waves with space-borne interferometers, like LISA, could yield a measurement or constraint on local, vector dark-matter environments, provided the dark-matter density is larger than roughly $10^{14} \rm{M}_\odot/{\rm{pc}}^3$.</description>

      <title>Higgs pole inflation with loop corrections in light of ACT results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the Coleman-Weinberg potential for the inflaton in the pole inflation scenarios such as the Higgs pole inflation and the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) pole inflation. The loop corrections stem from the Standard Model particles and extra singlet scalar fields in the former case, making the quartic coupling for the Higgs inflaton modified by the inflaton-dependent power corrections during inflation. We also obtain similar power corrections to the quartic coupling for the PQ inflaton, depending on the realizations of the PQ symmetry in KSVZ and DFSZ models. We show that the loop corrections can shift the spectral index in the pole inflation to a larger value in favor of the ACT results, while being compatible with the bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio. For a positive one-loop beta function for the inflaton quartic coupling (namely, $b_1&gt;0$), a sub-dominant contribution from the two-loop corrections can be accommodated. On the other hand, if the one-loop beta function for the inflaton coupling is negative (namely, $b_1&lt;0$), we need sizable contributions from two-loops that are larger than the one-loop corrections due to the ACT results.</description>

      <title>A theoretical prediction for the dipole in nearby distances using cosmography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmography is a widely applied method to infer kinematics of the Universe at small cosmological scales while remaining agnostic about the theory of gravity at play. Usually cosmologists invoke the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric in cosmographic analyses, however generalised approaches allow for analyses outside of any assumed geometrical model. These methods have great promise to be able to model-independently map the cosmic neighborhood where the Universe has not yet converged to isotropy. In this regime, anisotropies can bias parameter inferences if they are not accounted for, and thus must be included for precision cosmology analyses, even when the principle aim is to infer the background cosmology. In this paper, we develop a method to predict the dipole in luminosity distances that arises due to nearby inhomogeneities. This is the leading-order correction to the standard isotropic distance-redshift law. Within a very broad class of general-relativistic universe models, we provide an interpretation of the dipole in terms of the gradients in expansion rate and density which is free from any underlying background cosmology. We use numerical relativity simulations, with improved initial data methods, alongside fully relativistic ray tracing to test the power of our prediction. We find our prediction accurately captures the dipole signature in our simulations to within ~10% for redshifts $z\lesssim 0.07$ in reasonably smooth simulations. In the presence of more non-linear density fields, we find this reduces to $z\lesssim 0.02$. This represents up to an order of magnitude improvement with respect to what is achieved by naive, local cosmography-based predictions. Our paper thus addresses important issues regarding convergence properties of anisotropic cosmographic series expansions that would otherwise limit their applicability to very narrow redshift ranges.</description>

      <title>Strong Confinement of a Nanodiamond in a Needle Paul Trap: Towards Matter-Wave Interferometry with Massive Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14272v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics (QM) and General relativity (GR), also known as the theory of gravity, are the two pillars of modern physics. A matter-wave interferometer with a massive particle, can test numerous fundamental ideas, including the spatial superposition principle - a foundational concept in QM - in completely new regimes, as well as the interface between QM and GR, e.g., testing the quantization of gravity. Consequently, there exists an intensive effort to realize such an interferometer. While several paths are being pursued, we focus on utilizing nanodiamonds as our particle, and a spin embedded in the nanodiamond together with Stern-Gerlach forces, to achieve a closed loop in space-time. There is a growing community of groups pursuing this path [1]. We are posting this technical note (as part of a series of seven such notes), to highlight our plans and solutions concerning various challenges in this ambitious endeavor, hoping this will support this growing community. In this work, we achieve strong confinement of a levitated particle, which is crucial for angular confinement, precise positioning, and perhaps also advantageous for deep cooling. We designed a needle Paul trap with a controllable distance between the electrodes, giving rise to a strong electric gradient. By combining it with an effective charging method - electrospray - we reach a trap frequency of up to 40 kHz, which is more than twice the state of the art. We believe that the designed trap could become a significant tool in the hands of the community working towards massive matter-wave interferometry. We would be happy to make more details available upon request.</description>

      <title>Detecting Gravitational Waves from Exoplanets Orbiting Binary Neutron Stars with B-DECIGO and DECIGO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first detection of a gravitational-wave (GW) signal in 2015 has opened a new observational window to probe the universe. This probe can not only reveal previously inaccessible binaries, black holes, and other compact objects, but also can detect exoplanets through their imprint on GW signals, thereby significantly extend current exoplanet surveys. To date, nearly 6000 exoplanets have been confirmed, yet most of them reside either in the solar neighbourhood or along the sightline toward the Galactic bulge, reflecting the range limits of traditional electromagnetic techniques. In this work, we follow the method proposed in N.Tamanini&amp;C.Danielski(2019) to investigate frequency modulations in GW signals from early-stage binary neutron stars (BNSs) induced by circumbinary planets (CBPs) and obtain that CBPs can be detected by the future space-borne detector DECi-hertz Interferometer Gravitational wave Observatory (DECIGO). For BNS system with the masses of two components both being 1.4 $M_{\odot}$, DECIGO could detect CBPs with mass being dozens of times that of Jupiter out to distances of $\sim 1$ Gpc, well beyond the Local Supercluster, offering an unprecedented opportunity to study planetary formation and evolution for the post main-sequence stage.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by string theory topics, we investigate the Reissner Nordstrom AdS black holes in noncommutative spacetime with Lorentzian smeared distributions. Concretely, we study certain thermodynamic properties including the criticality behaviors by computing the relevant quantities. For large radius approximations, we first derive the asymptotic expansions of the mass and charge functions appearing in the metric function of such black holes. Then, we approach the thermodynamics in the extended phase space. After the stability discussion, we examine the P V criticality in noncommutative geometry by calculating the corresponding thermodynamic quantities. As a result, we show that the proposed black holes exhibit certain similarities with Van der Waals fluid systems. Finally, we present a discussion on the Joule Thomson expansion showing perfect universality results appearing in charged AdS black holes.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Analysis of the Neutron Star Equation of State and Model Comparison: Insights from PSR J0437+4715, PSR J0614+3329, and Other Multi-Physics Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive Bayesian analysis to constrain the neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) using a wide range of terrestrial and astrophysical data. The terrestrial inputs include quantities related to symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and symmetry energy up to two times saturation density ($\rho_0\sim$0.16 fm$^{-3}$), derived from finite nuclei and heavy-ion collisions (HICs). The astrophysical constraints incorporate NS radii and tidal deformabilities from recent NICER observations and GW170817, respectively. We consider five different EoS models: Taylor, $n/3$, Skyrme, RMF, and sound speed(CS), are analyzed by sequentially updating the priors with (i) $\chi$EFT based pure neutron matter, (ii) terrestrial, empirical and earlier astrophysical data, (iii) case (ii) including NICER radii of PSR J0437+4715 and J0614+3329, (iv) all data combined, and (v) excluding empirical nuclear inputs. We also perform Bayesian model comparison which favors the Skyrme model under all combined data (scenario (iv)), yielding tight constraints on symmetry energy parameters: $L_0 = 56 \pm 3$~MeV, $K_{\mathrm{sym}0} = -132 \pm 15$~MeV and also on SNM parameters: $K_0 = 265 \pm 12$~MeV, $Q_0 = -366 \pm 43$~MeV. The mass-radius and mass-tidal deformability posterior distributions are also well constrained. The radius and tidal deformability of a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star are found to be $R_{1.4} = 11.85 \pm 0.11$~km and $\Lambda_{1.4} = 354 \pm 25$, respectively.</description>

Abstract: Black holes constitute nature's fastest quantum information scramblers, a phenomenon captured by gravitational analogue systems such as position-dependent XY spin chains. In these models, scrambling dynamics are governed exclusively by the hopping interactions profile, independent of system size. Utilizing such curved spacetime analogues as quantum batteries, we explore how the black hole scrambling affects charging via controlled quenches of preset scrambling parameters. Our analysis reveals that the intentionally engineered difference between post-quench and pre-quench scrambling parameters could significantly enhance both maximum stored energy $E_{\max}$ and peak charging power $P_{\max}$ in the quench charging protocol. Furthermore, the peaks of extractable work and stored energy coincide. This is because the system's evolution under a weak perturbation remains close to the ground state, resulting in a passive state energy nearly identical to the ground state energy. The optimal charging time $\tau_*$ exhibits negligible dependence on the preset initial horizon parameter $x_{h0}$, while decreasing monotonically with increasing quench horizon parameter $x_{ht}$. This temporal compression confines high-power operation to regimes with strong post-quench scrambling $x_{ht} &gt; x_{h0}$, demonstrating accelerated charging mediated by spacetime-mimicking scrambling dynamics.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Relative Entropy to the Semiclassical Einstein Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide arguments indicating that the semiclassical Einstein equations follow from quantum relative entropy and its proportionality to an area variation. Using modular theory, we establish that the relative entropy between the vacuum state and coherent excitations of a scalar quantum field on a bifurcate Killing horizon is given by the energy flux across the horizon. Under the assumption of the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy-area formula, this energy flux is proportional to a variation in the surface area of the horizon cross section. The semiclassical Einstein equations follow automatically from this identification. Our approach provides a quantum field theoretic generalization of Jacobson's thermodynamic derivation of the Einstein equations, replacing classical thermodynamic entropy with the well-defined quantum relative (Araki-Uhlmann) entropy. This suggests that quantum information plays a central role in what is often seen as a zeroth order approximation of a theory of quantum gravity, namely quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Direct multi-model dark-matter search with gravitational-wave interferometers using data from the first part of the fourth LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA observing run</title>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave detectors can probe the existence of dark matter with exquisite sensitivity. Here, we perform a search for three kinds of dark matter -- dilatons (spin-0), dark photons (spin-1) and tensor bosons (spin-2) -- using three independent methods on the first part of the most recent data from the fourth observing run of LIGO--Virgo--KAGRA. Each form of dark matter could have interacted with different standard-model particles in the instruments, causing unique differential strains on the interferometers. While we do not find any evidence for a signal, we place the most stringent upper limits to-date on each of these models. For scalars with masses between $[4\times 10^{-14},1.5\times 10^{-13}]$ eV that couple to photons or electrons, our constraints improve upon those from the third observing run by one order of magnitude, with the tightest limit of $\sim 10^{-20}\,\text{GeV}^{-1}$ at a mass of $\sim2\times 10^{-13}\text{ eV}$. For vectors with masses between $[7\times 10^{-13},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV that couple to baryons, our constraints supersede those from MICROSCOPE and E\"ot-Wash by one to two orders of magnitude, reaching a minimum of $\sim 5\times 10^{-24}$ at a mass of $\sim 10^{-12}$ eV. For tensors with masses of $[4\times 10^{-14},8.47\times 10^{-12}]$ eV (the full mass range analyzed) that couple via a Yukawa interaction, our constraints surpass those from fifth-force experiments by four to five orders of magnitude, achieving a limit as low as $\sim 8\times 10^{-9}$ at $\sim2\times 10^{-13}$ eV. Our results show that gravitational-wave interferometers have become frontiers for new physics and laboratories for direct multi-model dark-matter detection.</description>

      <title>Entanglement inequalities, black holes and the architecture of typical states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using holographic realizations of the Araki-Lieb (AL) inequality, we show that typical pure states in large-N holographic conformal field theories (CFTs) possess two characteristic length scales determined solely by energy and conserved charges: a microscopic L_UV and an infrared L_IR &gt; L_UV. Degrees of freedom between these scales effectively factorize -- one purifying the ultraviolet (scales &lt; L_UV) and the other the infrared sector (scales &gt; L_IR). Remarkably, the pure-state factor including the ultraviolet sector is determined solely by energy and conserved charges up to exponentially suppressed corrections. Our results imply that all black holes in anti-de Sitter space can be isolated from an asymptotic region, the "corona", formed by the inclusion of entanglement wedges for which the AL inequality is saturated, and that an effective factorization emerges in the buffer region between the corona and the outer horizon.</description>

      <title>Nearly forgotten results in development of physical cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.06018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It would be reasonable to recall some critical issues in physical cosmology development. GR was created by A. Einstein in 1915. In 1917 Einstein proposed the first (static) cosmological model. Soon after the A. Eddington proved that the model is unstable therefore it can not be realizable in nature. In 1922 and 1924 A. A. Friedmann found non-stationary solutions for cosmological equations written in the framework of GR. In 1927 G. Lemaitre obtained very similar results and, in addition, he derived the Hubble law (E. Hubble obtained this law from observations). Unfortunately, G. Lemaitre published his paper in not very popular Belgium journal. In 1931 Lemaitre proposed the first version of hot Universe model (he called it hypothesis of the primeval atom). In his book Lemaitre predicted even a background radiation as a signature of his model.
  One of the important property of the Lemaitre -- Gamow model was a prediction of CMB radiation with a temperature around a few K. It was recalled that the discovery of CMB radiation was done by T. Shmaonov in 1956 and his paper was published in 1957 (several years before Penzias and Wilson).
  In 1965, 1970 E. B. Gliner proposed vacuum like equation of matter which could correspond to exponential explosion of the Universe which was later called inflation. For decades in USSR, Friedmann's cosmological non-stationary models were treated as purely mathematical results without cosmologocal applications. On September 16, 1925 passed away untimely and it would be reasonable to remind today his great contribution in physical cosmology since the authors of book on Friedmann wrote that "similarly to Copernicus who forced the Earth to move Friedmann forced the Universe to expand".</description>
