      <title>Thermalization of Bottomonium in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the approach to equilibrium of bottomonium in the quark-gluon plasma within the open quantum system framework. We perform large-scale simulations of the long-time behavior in three dimensions using the quantum trajectory method to observe the emergence of steady states and determine the timescale of thermalization in position-, angular-momentum-, and color-space. We find that the thermalization timescale increases with decreasing temperature and decreasing coupling to the medium, which is given by transport coefficients of the medium. Additionally, we observe that the steady states exhibit small corrections to the Gibbs state due to medium interactions and show that these corrections diminish for weaker medium coupling and higher temperature. At a temperature of $450\,$MeV, quarkonium relaxes to a state that is approximately thermal, with the most significant correction being a smaller overlap of the $1S$ state with respect to the Gibbs state. We compare these findings with the master equation obtained at leading order in the expansion of the binding energy over the temperature, which we find to have a trivial steady state.</description>

      <title>TeV-scale scalar leptoquarks motivated by B anomalies improve Yukawa unification in SO(10) GUT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is common practice to explain deviations between data and Standard-Model predictions by postulating new particles at the TeV scale ad-hoc. This approach becomes much more convincing, if one successfully embeds the postulated particles into a UV completion which addresses other conceptual or phenomenological shortcomings of the SM. We present a study of an SO(10) grand unified theory which contains scalar leptoquark fields employed to explain the ``flavour anomalies'' in $b\rightarrow s$ and $b\rightarrow c$ decays. We find that the additional degrees of freedom improve the renormalization group evolution of the SM parameters and may explain some of the observed fermion masses. In particular, the light leptoquarks modify the renormalization-group evolution of the Yukawa couplings such that successful bottom-tau unification becomes possible in a minimal SO(10) GUT with only a $126$-plet coupling to fermions.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Neutrinos from Cosmic-Ray Scatterings with Supernova Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmic rays scattering with neutrinos produced in supernovae induce a flux of supernova neutrinos boosted to high energies. We calculate the neutrino flux arising from this new mechanism in environments with large cosmic-ray and supernova densities, such as some Active Galactic Nuclei. Under plausible astrophysical conditions, this flux may be detectable with high-energy neutrino telescopes, just considering the proton-neutrino scattering cross section expected in the Standard Model. Furthermore, the center of mass energy of such scatterings can reach $ \sqrt{s} \sim 10-100$ TeV, where the proton-neutrino cross section may be enhanced by new physics such as extra-dimensional theories. The boosted neutrino signal benefits from such an enhancement in the cross section not only at the detection point on Earth, but also at production in astrophysical sources, which allows us to set novel constraints on the ultra-high energy proton-neutrino cross section with neutrino telescopes.</description>

      <title>In-medium heavy quark-antiquark $T$-matrix without partial wave expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The T-matrix of the heavy quark-antiquark ($Q\bar{Q}$) pair interacting through a screened Cornell potential in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is computed without employing the partial wave expansion. This is compared with the results obtained using the conventional method of partial wave expansion. Through a comprehensive survey over a range of screening mass and center-of-mass energy, which, when combined, determine the orbital angular momentum involved in the scattering through the associated force range and incident momentum, it is demonstrated that a substantial number of partial wave terms are necessary to precisely match the full scattering amplitude directly obtained from the method without partial wave expansion. For moderate screening masses (corresponding to one to two times the crossover transition temperature) and center-of-mass energy, the number of partial waves required for satisfactory matching turns out as large as 10-20, substantially larger than what one would expect based on simply measuring the magnitudes of the first few partial wave amplitudes. This highlights the efficiency of the new method in directly obtaining the full scattering amplitude needed for further computation of phenomenological observables. We also employ the new method to calculate the T-matrix at center-of-mass energies below the $Q\bar{Q}$ mass threshold, and demonstrate the presence of bound states of different orbital quantum numbers simultaneously in a single energy scan.</description>

      <title>Simulation of heavy quarkonium equilibration in the quark-gluon plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the heavy quarkonium equilibration through transport in a static and homogeneous quark-gluon plasma (QGP) box within the semi-classical Boltzmann approach incorporating both the leading-order and next-to-leading-order dissociation and regeneration reactions. The scattering amplitudes involved are taken from perturbative computations based on effective color-electric dipole coupling of the heavy quarkonium with thermal gluons. By coupling the Langevin simulation of single heavy quark diffusion and the Boltzmann transport of the heavy quarkonium in a real-time fashion, we demonstrate how the kinetic and chemical equilibrium of heavy quarkonium with single heavy quarks in the medium is achieved in terms of both the bound state's yields and momentum distributions. The pertinent equilibration time turns out to be comparable to the lifetime of the QGP created in the most central heavy-ion collisions at the LHC energies. The role of the intricate interplay between the open and hidden heavy sector in the process of equilibration is highlighted. This work provides a dynamical way of understanding the phenomenological success of statistical hadronization model for charmonium production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions, and also paves the way for realistic phenomenological applications to heavy quarkonium transport.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ in QCD sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, the electroweak transition form factors of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_c$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_c$ are analyzed within the framework of three-point QCD sum rules. In phenomenological side, all possible couplings of interpolating current to hadronic states are considered. In QCD side, the perturbative part and the contributions of vacuum condensates up to dimension 8 are also considered. With the calculated form factors, we study the decay widths and branching ratios of semileptonic decays $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ and $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ ($l=e,\mu$ and $\tau$). Our results for the branching ratios of $\Lambda_b\to\Lambda_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ are comparable with experimental data and the results of other collaborations. In addition, our predictions for $\Xi_b\to\Xi_cl\bar{\nu}_l$ can provide a valuable reference for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Dynamical quark mass and finite volume effects in the Dyson-Schwinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of Dyson-Schwinger equations(DSEs) and by means of the Multiple Reflection Expansion approximation, we study the finite volume effects of the constituent quark mass in a strong external magnetic field. Since the magnetic field has influence on the coupling constant, the coupling constant controls the strength of strongly interaction in QCD, so we adopt the magnetic-field-dependent running coupling constant in simulation. The results show that in addition to the magnetic field, the masses of constituent quarks also have a significant dependence on the volume and the running coupling constant. The model behaves close to the infinite volume limit for large size, but the effect of the finite volume is significant when the system size $R$ is about $2-6$ fm.The finite volume effects and the magnetic-field-dependent running coupling constant have considerable influence on the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Charmed hadron production in the QGSJET-III model: relevance to calculations of the prompt atmospheric neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treatment of charmed hadron production in the framework of the QGSJET-III Monte Carlo generator is developed, including both perturbative and nonperturbative contributions. For the former, a leading order (LO) perturbative formalism is employed. The so-called $K$-factor designed to take effectively into account higher order corrections, which controls the magnitude of the LO perturbative contribution, is fixed based on a comparison with experimental data on $D$ meson production at the Large Hadron Collider. For the nonperturbative intrinsic charm, a phenomenological Regge-based treatment is developed, with the corresponding normalization being chosen based on measurements of the spectra of $\Lambda_c$ baryons at large values of Feynman $x$. The model is applied for a calculation of the prompt atmospheric muon neutrino flux in the $10-100$ TeV and $1-10$ PeV energy intervals.</description>

      <title>Pomeron evolution, entanglement entropy and Abramovskii-Gribov-Kancheli cutting rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use Pomeron evolution equation in zero transverse dimension based on the Abramovskii-Gribov-Kancheli~(AGK) cutting rules to calculate the von Neumann entropy and $q$-moments that used as an experimental test for the Koba-Nielsen-Olesen~(KNO) scaling. In order to avoid the negative probabilities that emerge from the negative AGK weights in the Minkowski space, we reformulate
  the Pomeron evolution in the Euclidean space. The resulting positive definite probabilities for cut and uncut Pomerons are used in calculating the $q$-moments.
  The comparison to the experimental data shows that our AGK based model successfully describes $q$-moments dependence on the mean multiplicity without any adjustable parameter in the experimental data of the $\mathtt{p-p}$ collisions by $\mathtt{ALICE}$ Collaboration.</description>

      <title>QCD Sum Rule Study of the Tensor $\Delta^0\Delta^0$ Dibaryon State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the exotic $\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}$ dibaryon state with quantum numbers $J^{P} = 2^{+}$ within the framework of QCD sum rules. A tensor interpolating current is constructed to determine the mass and residue of this state, including explicit calculations of contributions from quark, gluon, and mixed vacuum condensates up to dimension nine. The numerical analysis yields a mass of $m_{\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}} = 2426^{+101}_{-108}~\mathrm{MeV}$ and a residue of $f_{\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}} = \left( 2.30^{+0.49}_{-0.45} \right) \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{GeV}^{8}$. The predicted mass lies about $38~\mathrm{MeV}$ below the $2m_{\Delta^{0}}$ threshold, which indicates the possible existence of a bound molecular configuration. Consequently, the tensor $\Delta^{0}\Delta^{0}$ dibaryon may serve as a promising candidate for future experimental searches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Being simultaneously a bound state and a pseudo-Goldstone boson of chiral symmetry breaking, the pion is an ideal probe of the intertwined phenomena of confinement and chiral symmetry breaking in QCD. Here, we compute the low energy pion observables with light-front holography, taking into account longitudinal dynamics using an ansatz that explores the strong degeneracy of the `t Hooft and Li-Vary models as well as their underlying connection in $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ as recently noted by Vegh.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that the widely used parton model expression for $ g_1$ in polarized proton-lepton scattering is incorrect as it ignores gluon-quark spin entanglement. Therefore, there is no spin crisis. A brief summary of results of the theoretical evaluation of non-octet axial vector current renormalization constants and anomaly -anomaly vacuum correlator is given. It suggests that anomaly plays an important role in the transformation of current quarks to constituent quarks and chiral symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Prospects for $P$ and $C\!P$ violation in $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ decays with polarized beam at Super Tau-Charm Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weak decays of the charmed baryons offer an ideal platform to study parity ($P$) and charge conjugation-parity ($C\!P$) violation in quark sector, to stringently test the Standard Model and search for new physics. It is a key goal in the next-generation positron-electron collider, such as the Super Tau-Charm Facility (STCF). Thanks to the quantum-entangled pair production with super high luminosity and the possibility of beam polarization, STCF provides a unique environment to probe such symmetry violations with unprecedented sensitivity. In this paper, we evaluate the precisions of the $P$-violating parameters and subsequently obtain the expected sensitivity of the $C\!P$-violating parameters in charmed baryon decays of $\Lambda_{c}^{+}\to p\pi^0$, $p\eta$, $\Lambda K^+$, $\Sigma^0 K^+$, and $\Sigma^+ K^0_S$, regarding to different polarization setups in STCF. The study suggests that the implementation of longitudinal beam polarization in STCF would greatly enhance the experimental capability in studying $P$ and $C\!P$ violation.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Calibration of the Crossterms Eigenvolume HRG Model: Integrating Lattice QCD and Experimental Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a Bayesian calibration of the Crossterms Eigenvolume Hadron Resonance Gas (Cross EV-HRG) model, which incorporates flavor-dependent repulsive interactions in a thermodynamically consistent framework. For the first time, the model is simultaneously constrained using lattice QCD (LQCD) thermodynamic observables and centrality-resolved hadron yield data from Pb--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 2.76$~TeV, measured by the ALICE Collaboration. Model parameters, including species-dependent eigenvolume radii and chemical freeze-out conditions, are inferred using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling. We find that LQCD data alone do not tightly constrain the parameters, particularly in the strange hadron sector, suggesting possible incompleteness in the hadron resonance spectrum. To account realistically for experimental uncertainties, we construct a phenomenological covariance matrix incorporating correlated systematic errors, which significantly affect both the marginal distributions and interdependencies of the inferred parameters. In the joint calibration, we extract a consistent set of hadron radii that simultaneously describe both LQCD and experimental data, demonstrating the viability of a unified thermal description of the hadronic medium. Residual uncertainties in the strange sector highlight the need for future studies incorporating QCD-predicted states and higher-order fluctuation observables.</description>

      <title>Non-invertible Symmetry as a Solution to the Strong CP Problem in a GUT-inspired Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a three-zero texture for the down-quark mass matrix within a $SU(5)$ GUT-inspired Standard Model, enforced by a non-invertible selection rule originating from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetries. Assuming CP invariance at the high-energy scale, our framework solves the strong CP problem while reproducing a realistic quark mass matrix. The CP symmetry is spontaneously broken down at an intermediate scale via complex vacuum expectation values of new scalar fields $\eta_i$, which generate the CP phase in the CKM matrix without inducing the QCD $\bar{\theta}$ term. The present model incorporates three generations of matter, Higgs, and additional scalars with a common structure under the non-invertible symmetry, which may be naturally embedded into $SO(10)$ GUTs at high energies.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the possible existence of triple-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark states in the off-shell coupled-channel formalism. The open-charm meson-baryon $\bar{D}_s\Omega_c$, $\bar{D}_s\Omega_c^*$, $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c$, and $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channels are considered, together with the hidden-charm $J/\psi\Omega$ channel. The two-body kernel Feynman amplitudes are constructed from an effective Lagrangian based on hidden local symmetry and heavy-quark spin symmetry. The coupled Blankenbecler-Sugar equation is solved in the partial-wave helicity basis. We observe two triple-strangeness hidden-charm pentaquark states: $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ and $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$, both with $J^P=1/2^-$. The $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ couples dominantly to the $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c$ and $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channels, while the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$ couples almost exclusively to the $\bar{D}_s^*\Omega_c^*$ channel. The total transition cross sections of $\bar{D}_s^{(\ast)}\Omega_c^{(\ast)}\to J/\psi\,\Omega$ indicate that the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4787)$ is clearly visible in the $J/\psi\,\Omega$ invariant mass spectrum, whereas the $P_{c\bar{c}sss}(4841)$ is obscured by cusp structures and background contributions.</description>

      <title>Complete Light Long-Lived Particles searches in Type-I 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the study of long-lived particles (LLPs) has attracted increasing attention. In this work, we analyze the full parameter space of the Type-I Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) that allows for light long-lived scalar ($H$) and pseudoscalar ($A$) particles. When involving a light beyongd Standard Model (BSM) Higgs, the $\Delta S$ could be the main contribution during the global fit of the oblique parameters, which is different to $\Delta T$ being the main factor for heavy BSM Higgs cases. By imposing theoretical constraints such as vacuum stability and perturbative unitarity, together with current experimental bounds, we summarize a complete region for a potential light $H$ with $\cos(\beta - \alpha) \simeq \frac{1}{\tan \beta}$, light $A$ with $\cos(\beta - \alpha) \simeq \frac{1}{\tan\beta} \frac{2m_H^2 - m_h^2}{m_H^2 - m_h^2}$, and point out the invisible Higgs decay is the most important constraint. We further identify viable regions for LLPs and propose four benchmark regions that simultaneously accommodate a light long-lived particle and explain the $W$ boson mass anomaly. For these benchmarks, we present the reaches of FASER and FASER~2, where FASER~2 improves the sensitivity by approximately two orders of magnitude compared to FASER.</description>

      <title>The spectra of $bc\bar{b}\bar{c}$ tetraquark states from a diquark-antidiquark perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the diquark-antidiquark framework, this study investigates the masses of ground-state tetraquarks composed of heavy charm ($c$) and bottom ($b$) quarks and antiquarks, using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. We establish the Bethe-Salpeter equations for the fully heavy $bc\bar{b}\bar{c}$ tetraquarks to the leading order in $1/m_Q$ expansion. These equations are subsequently solved numerically under the covariant instantaneous approximation with kernels containing scalar confinement and one-gluon exchange terms. Our results show that the spectra of all possible $S$-wave tetraquark states are above the corresponding two lowest meson decay thresholds via the quark rearrangement. This implies that the ground $bc\bar{b}\bar{c}$ tetraquark states should be broad.</description>

      <title>Stringy Constraints on Modular Flavor Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stringy constraints on moduli spaces in modular flavor models by analyzing moduli-dependent threshold corrections in heterotic string vacua. While moduli play a crucial role in determining the flavor structure of fermions predicted by modular flavor models, the parameter space in which their vacuum expectation values are allowed has not been fully explored. In this work, within the framework of perturbative heterotic string theory on toroidal orbifolds, we derive constraints on the moduli space and study their systematic behavior. We characterize the stringy constraints in terms of the dilaton, the beta-function coefficients, and the ratio between a complex-structure modulus and a K\"ahler modulus. It is found that the large value of the modulus controlling the flavor structure, i.e., $\tau\simeq i \infty$, lies in the Swampland, and the self-dual point $\tau=i$ is also disfavored in the large volume regime of toroidal backgrounds. In addition, we discuss the phenomenological implications of these stringy constraints.</description>

      <title>Roles of $\bar{D}^{*}K^{*}$ and $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular states in decay $B^+ \to D^{*+} D^- K^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12686v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the three-body decay process $B^+ \to D^{*+} D^- K^+$, aiming to explore the possible origins of $T^*_{\bar{c}\bar{s}0}(2870)^0$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ as intermediate states. Within the molecular state framework, $T^*_{\bar{c}\bar{s}0}(2870)^0$ and $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ are considered as possible $\bar{D}^{*}K^{}$ and $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular states, respectively. Using effective Lagrangians, the interaction kernels of the $\bar{D}^{*}K^{*}$ and $D^*\bar{D}$ systems are constructed within the one-boson-exchange model. The corresponding rescattering amplitudes and pole positions are obtained by solving the quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation. These amplitudes are incorporated into the decay amplitude of the three-body process, and the $D^-K^+$ and $D^{*+}D^-$ invariant mass spectra are simulated via Monte Carlo methods. To better reproduce the experimental data, additional Breit-Wigner contributions from $T^*_{\bar{c}\bar{s}1}(2900)^0$, $\chi_{c1}(4010)$, and $h_c(4300)$ are included. The results show a pronounced enhancement near 2900 MeV in the $D^-K^+$ invariant mass spectrum, strongly supporting the interpretation of $T^*_{\bar{c}\bar{s}0}(2870)^0$ as a $\bar{D}^{*}K^{*}$ molecular state. While the $\bar{D}^{*}K^{*}$ molecular state provides a reasonable contribution to the $D^-K^+$ spectrum, the $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular state yields no significant effect on either the $D^-K^+$ or $D^{*+}D^-$ distributions. This suggests that the observed $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ structure around 3872 MeV may not be interpreted as a $D^*\bar{D}$ molecular state.</description>

      <title>Completing Axion Double Level Crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present the refinement of axion double level crossings within the context of multi-axion mass mixing, specifically focusing on cases where the number of axions exceeds two. Our investigation reveals that double level crossings are a common phenomenon in the mass mixing of the $Z_{\mathcal N}$ axion and axion-like particles. We introduce the general model for double level crossings, along with several toy examples, and redefine the light and heavy axion scenarios. In the light axion scenario, double level crossings can occur multiple times in the large ${\mathcal N}$ limit. However, excessively large values of ${\mathcal N}$ may also prevent the occurrence of double level crossings. Conversely, in the heavy axion scenario, excessively small ${\mathcal N}$ may similarly prevent their occurrence. Our findings also have some intriguing implications for axion cosmology.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Heavy Quarkonium in a Bayesian Holographic QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraging high-precision lattice QCD data on the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility at vanishing chemical potential, we construct a Bayesian holographic QCD model and systematically analyze the thermodynamic properties of heavy quarkonium in QCD matter under varying temperatures and chemical potentials. We compute the quark-antiquark interquark distance, potential energy, entropy, binding energy, and internal energy. We present detailed posterior distribution results of the thermodynamic quantities of heavy quarkonium, including maximum a posteriori (MAP) value estimates and 95\% confidence levels (CL). Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we find that increasing temperature and chemical potential decrease the quark distance, thereby facilitating the dissociation of heavy quarkonium and leading to suppressed potential energy. The increase in temperature and chemical potential also raise the entropy and entropy force, further accelerating the dissociation of heavy quarkonium. The calculated results of binding energy indicate that higher temperature and chemical potential enhance the tendency of heavy quarkonium to dissociate into free quarks. Internal energy also increases with rising temperature and chemical potential. These findings provide significant theoretical insights into the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions and lay a solid foundation for the interpretation and validation of future experimental data. Finally, we also present the results for the free energy, entropy, and internal energy of single quark.</description>

      <title>Scaling behaviour of charged particles generated in Xe$-$Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.44 TeV using the AMPT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spatial configurations of particles produced in the kinematic phase space during a heavy-ion collision reflect the characteristics of the system created in the collision. The scaling behaviour of the multiplicity fluctuations is studied for the charged particles generated in Xe--Xe collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm{NN}}}$ = 5.44 TeV using the String Melting (SM) mode of the AMPT (A Multi-Phase Transport) model. The scaling behaviour of the normalized factorial moments ($F_\text{q}$) give significant information about the dynamics of the systems under study. A linear power-law growth of the $F_\text{q}$ with the increasing phase space resolution, termed as intermittency, is investigated. The anomalous fractal dimension $D_\text{q}$ is determined, which is linked to the self-similarity and fractal nature of the particle emission spectra, a dependence of which on the order of the moment ($q$) is characterised by the intermittency index ($\varphi_{\text{q}}$). Relating $q^{\rm{th}}$ order Normalised Factorial Moment (NFM) with $F_{2}$, the scaling exponent ($\nu$) is determined that quantifies the dynamics of the system created by these collisions and is analyzed for its dependence on the transverse momentum bin width ($\Delta p_\text{T}$). A comparative study of experimental and model results may help to understand the dynamics of multiparticle production in the heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Polarized electromagnetic radiation by chiral media with time-dependent chiral chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate photon production from media characterized by a time-dependent chiral chemical potential $\mu_5(t)$. We first consider the chiral anomaly as a small perturbation and show that $\mu_5\to 2\gamma$ process generates non-polarized radiation, as the probabilities of producing right and left-handed photons are equal. In chiral semimetal with a vanishing chiral chemical potential but a finite separation of Weyl nodes, ${\bf \Delta}(t)$, the photon production vanishes at the leading order of perturbation theory. We then employ the method of Bogolyubov transformation to obtain the photon spectrum that sums up all powers of $\mu_5$. Employing the exactly solvable model $\mu_5(t) \propto A+B\tanh(t/\tau)$, we demonstrate that the spectrum exhibits strong circular polarization, whose direction is determined by the sign of $\mu_5$. The spectrum contains resonances associated with the instability of the electromagnetic field in chiral media. We discuss potential phenomenological applications of these findings.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Neutrino Scattering: Domain Adaptation with GANs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize transfer learning to extrapolate the physics knowledge encoded in a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model trained on synthetic charged-current (CC) neutrino-carbon inclusive scattering data. This base model is adapted to generate CC inclusive scattering events (lepton kinematics only) for neutrino-argon and antineutrino-carbon interactions. Furthermore, we assess the effectiveness of transfer learning in re-optimizing a custom model when new data comes from a different neutrino-nucleus interaction model. Our results demonstrate that transfer learning significantly outperforms training generative models from scratch. To study this, we consider two training data sets: one with 10,000 and another with 100,000 events. The models obtained via transfer learning perform well even with smaller training data. The proposed method provides a promising approach for constructing neutrino scattering event generators in scenarios where experimental data is sparse.</description>

      <title>Unravelling Pentaquarks with Born--Oppenheimer effective theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13050v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The hidden-charm pentaquark states $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4312\right)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4380\right)^+$, $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4440\right)^+$, and $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4457\right)^+$, all with isospin $I = 1/2$, were discovered by the LHCb collaboration in the decay process $\Lambda_b^0 \to J/\psi p K^-$. Although their quantum numbers remain undetermined, these states have generated significant theoretical interest. We analyze their spectrum and decay patterns-including those of their spin partners-within the Born--Oppenheimer effective field theory (BOEFT), a framework grounded in QCD. At leading order in BOEFT, we identify these pentaquark states as bound states in BO potentials that exhibit at short-distance a repulsive octet behavior and a nonperturbative shift due to the adjoint baryons masses, while asymptotically approaching the $\Sigma_c\bar{D}$ threshold. We further incorporate ${\cal O}(1/m_Q)$ spin-dependent corrections to compute pentaquark multiplet spin splittings. Based on the spectrum, semi-inclusive decay widths to $J/\psi$ and $\eta_c$, and the decay width ratios to $\Lambda_c\bar{D}$ and $\Lambda_c\bar{D}^*$, we provide the first theoretical predictions for the adjoint baryon masses, which can be confirmed by future lattice QCD studies. Moreover, our analysis supports the quantum number assignments: $J^{P} = (1/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4312\right)^+$, $(3/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4380\right)^+$, $(1/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4457\right)^+$, and $(3/2)^-$ for $P_{c\bar{c}}\left(4440\right)^+$. We also present results for the lowest bottom pentaquarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Direct detection of light dark matter (DM) is generally difficult due to its small recoil energy. The inelastic scattering of DM can produce unique signatures in the DM direct detection experiments. Using the low-energy unpaired ionization data from PandaX-4T, we newly analyze the probe of the exothermic inelastic dark matter (ineDM). We demonstrate that PandaX-4T can probe the ineDM mass-splitting down to 0.05 keV and probe the ineDM mass to the sub-GeV range. For the ineDM with a dark photon mediator, we use the PandaX-4T data to impose stringent bounds on the mixing parameter between the dark photon and photon.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Constraints on Higgs reheating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many models of inflation, reheating is realized through a coupling between the inflaton and the Higgs boson. Often, the mass of the inflaton is of order $10^{13}~$GeV determined by the amplitude of the scalar fluctuation spectrum. However, in models where the inflaton potential is of the form $V \sim \phi^k$ about its minimum, the inflaton is massless for $k\ge 4$ unless a bare mass term, $\frac12 m_\phi^2 \phi^2$, is present. In this case, the inflaton mass may be of order the electroweak scale and may be subject to existing collider constraints. In particular, we investigate the constraints on the inflaton mass and reheating temperature $T_{\rm rh}$ arising from the decay of $\phi$ into $\mathcal{H}$ through an interaction term $\mu \phi |\mathcal{H}|^2$.
  We perform a renormalization group analysis to determine the relative values of $\mu$ and $m_\phi$ such that the Higgs potential remains stable (and perturbative) at high energy.
  Taking into account the running of the Higgs quartic self-coupling and the experimental constraints from the LHC via the $\texttt{HiggsTools}$ public code, we find that $3.4 \times 10^6 $ GeV $\lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 3.9 \times 10^{12} $ GeV with a corresponding constraint on the inflaton bare mass $260~{\rm GeV} \lesssim m_\phi \lesssim 3.8 \times 10^{10}~{\rm GeV}$. The dependencies between $T_{\rm rh}$ and the inflaton bare mass $m_\phi$ as well as between $\mu$ and $m_\phi$ are provided.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of fermionic excitations in heavy-quark QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of fermionic excitations in heavy-quark QCD on the lattice with Wilson fermions. The grand potential is calculated analytically in the hopping parameter expansion (HPE) on the basis of the cumulant expansion. Using the grand potential, we compute the quark number susceptibilities and their ratios up to next-to-leading order in the HPE. The ratio of fourth- to second-order susceptibilities is shown to be unity (nine) in the deconfined (confined) phase at the leading order. Excitation properties of baryonic and quark modes in each phase are also investigated utilizing the Boltzmann statistics. We obtain an analytic formula for the quark excitation energy in the deconfined phase, while that for baryonic excitations in the confined phase is decomposed into flavor multiplets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deuteron passage through a nonpolarized target is accompanied by birefringence effect which reveals as diverse phenomena, namely: rotation of spin and tensor polarization about the momentum direction, spin oscillations, vector polarization conversion to tensor that and vice versa, spin dichroism. Possibility to study deuteron spin dichroism effect i.e. the effect of tensor polarization acquiring by a nonpolarized deuteron beam moving in NuclotronM and passing through its internal target is discussed.</description>

      <title>Log Gaussian Cox Process Background Modeling in High Energy Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background modeling is one of the most critical components in high energy physics data analyses, and for smooth backgrounds it is often performed by fitting using an analytic functional form. In this paper a novel method based on Log Gaussian Cox Processes (LGCP) is introduced to model smooth backgrounds while making minimal assumptions on the underlying shape. In LGCP, samples are assumed to be drawn from a non-homogeneous Poisson process, with an intensity function drawn from a Gaussian process. Markov Chain Monte Carlo is used for optimizing the hyper parameters and drawing the final fit for the background estimate from the posterior. Synthetic experiments comparing background modeling from functional forms and the LGCP are used to compare the different methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LDMX, The Light Dark Matter EXperiment, is a missing momentum search for hidden sector dark matter in the MeV to GeV range. It will be located at SLAC in End Station A, and will employ an 8 GeV electron beam parasitically derived from the SLAC LCLS-II accelerator. LDMX promises to expand the experimental sensitivity of these searches by between one and two orders of magnitude depending on the model. It also has sensitivity in visible ALP searches as well as providing unique data on electron-nucleon interactions.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and the Early Formation of Supermassive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the growth of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at high redshift ($z \ge 10$) from a combination of dark matter capture, black-hole mergers, and gas accretion. It has previously been shown that SMBHs can form by $z \approx 10$ via black-hole mergers, Eddington-limited Bondi gas accretion and tidal disruption events with stars within dense nuclear clusters. Here, we show that the capture of collisionless dark matter by a growing SMBH also substantially contributes, in some cases by an order of magnitude to the final SMBH mass. In particular, we show that a small seed stellar-remnant black hole can more easily reach $&gt; 10^7$ M$_{\odot}$ by $z = 10$ in the core of dense nuclear star clusters when dark matter is included. This remains true for either cold dark matter or ultralight dark matter if the mass of the ULDM particle is $^&gt;_\sim 10^{-20}$ eV. We highlight the unique evolution of ULDM capture by the growing SMBH when the ULDM de Broglie wavelength exceeds the initial nuclear star cluster half-mass radius.</description>

      <title>From Hyperons to Hypernuclei: A New Route to Unravel Proton Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12193v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions create the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) known as the hottest, least viscous, and most vortical fluid ever produced in terrestrial laboratories. Its vortical structure has been uncovered through the spin polarization of Lambda ($\Lambda$) hyperons, attributed to the spin-orbit coupling that transfers the system's orbital angular momentum to the quark spin, which is then inherited by hadrons via quark recombination or coalescence. However, $\Lambda$ polarization reflects primarily the strange-quark component, leaving the spin dynamics of the up and down quarks largely unexplored. Although the proton is an ideal probe, its stability makes direct measurements experimentally challenging. Here, we propose to reveal proton spin polarization via hypertriton ($^3_\Lambda \text{H}$) measurements, exploiting the fact that spin information is preserved when polarized nucleons and $\Lambda$ coalesce to form hypertriton. We show that, over a broad range of collision energies, the polarizations of proton, $\Lambda$, and hypertriton are related by a simple linear scaling law. Since both $\Lambda$ and hypertriton polarizations can be measured via their self-analyzing weak decays, this linear relation provides a practical experimental avenue for accessing spin polarizations of protons and neutrons-the dominant baryonic degrees of freedom in nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Interact or Twist: Cosmological Correlators from Field Redefinitions Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In cosmology, correlation functions on a late-time boundary can arise from both field redefinitions and bulk interactions, which are usually believed to generate distinct results. In this letter, we propose a counterexample showcasing that correlators from local field redefinitions can be identical to the ones from bulk interactions. In particular, we consider a two-field model in de Sitter space, where the field space gets twisted by field redefinitions to yield a nontrivial reheating surface. We then exploit conformal symmetry to compute the three-point function, and show that the result takes the form of contact correlators with a total-energy singularity. Our finding suggests that in the effective field theory, a class of lower-dimensional operators, which were overlooked previously, may lead to nontrivial signals in cosmological correlators. As an illustration, we apply our result to cosmic inflation and derive a possibly leading signature of the Higgs in the primordial bispectrum.</description>

      <title>Toward extracting scattering phase shift from integrated correlation functions V: complex $\phi^4$ field model in $3+1$ dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.12881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Ref.~\cite{Guo:2024zal} and associated studies, a relativistic finite-volume formalism in $1+1$ dimensions is proposed to extract infinite-volume scattering phaseshift.
  It is based on the difference of integrated correlation functions (ICF) rather than energy spectrum in the finite volume, and can be regarded as complementary to the well-known L\"{uscher} formalism.
  In the present work, the formalism is further extended into $3+1$ dimensional spacetime. The aim is to explore and demonstrate the challenges in applying the formalism to more practical settings. Specifically, Monte Carlo simulations of a complex $\phi^4$ relativistic field model are carried out in both 2+1 and 3+1 dimensions on lattices of varying sizes, and phaseshifts for the contact interaction are extracted from the formalism using modest computing resources.</description>

      <title>Experimentally distinguishable origin for electroweak symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.10265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.10265v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a classically conformal $U(1)$ gauge extension of the Standard Model (SM), in which the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry is radiatively broken by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. This breaking triggers the electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking through a mixed quartic coupling between the $U(1)$ Higgs field and the SM Higgs doublet. For two Higgs boson mass eigenstates after the symmetry breaking, $h_1$ (SM-like Higgs boson) and $h_2$ (SM singlet-like Higgs boson), we calculate the Higgs boson trilinear coupling ($g_{h_{1} h_{2} h_{2}}$) in the model by setting the Higgs boson mass spectrum to be $M_{h_1} &gt; 2 M_{h_2}$. For a common Higgs mass spectrum and mixing angle between two Higgs fields, we find that $g_{h_{1} h_{2} h_{2}}$ in the classically conformal model is highly suppressed compared to that calculated for the conventional Higgs potential, where the $U(1)$ and EW symmetry breaking originate from the negative squared masses for the Higgs fields at the tree-level. Thus, this coupling suppression is a striking nature of the radiative origin of EW symmetry breaking. We then consider how to distinguish this origin at the proposed International Linear Collider (ILC) via precise measurements of anomalous SM Higgs boson couplings and the search for anomalous SM Higgs boson decay $h_1 \rightarrow h_2 h_2$ followed by $h_2 \to b \bar{b}$. We conclude that once the anomalous couplings are measured at the ILC, the observation of the anomalous Higgs boson decay is promising in the conventional Higgs potential, while this decay process is highly suppressed and undetectable for the classically conformal model.</description>

      <title>Novel azimuthal observables from two-photon collision at $e^+e^-$ colliders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09381v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we advocate a set of novel azimuthal-angle-related observables associated with exclusive hadron production from two-photon fusion at $e^+ e^-$ colliders, taking the $\gamma\gamma\to \pi\pi$ as a benchmark process. As a direct consequence of the linearly polarized quasi-real photons emitted off the electron and positron beams, the $\cos 2\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry in dipion production is predicted within the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization framework. In numerical analysis, we take the helicity amplitudes of $\gamma\gamma\to \pi\pi$ determined from the partial wave solutions in dispersion relation as input, and find that the predicted $\cos2\phi$ azimuthal modulation may reach 40\% for the typical kinematical setup of {\tt Belle 2} and {\tt BESIII} experiments. Future accurate measurement of this azimuthal asymmetry may facilitate the direct extraction of the relative phase between two helicity amplitudes with photon helicity configurations $++$ and $+-$. This knowledge provides a valuable input for the dispersive determination of the hadronic light-by-light (Hlbl) contributions.</description>

      <title>On sum rules for semi-leptonic $b \to c$ and $b \to u$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The semi-leptonic $b \to c l \nu$ processes are receiving a lot of attention, as the lepton flavor universality violation has been hinted by the measured ratios $R_{D^{(*)}} = \Gamma(B \to D^{(*)} \tau\nu)/\Gamma(B \to D^{(*)} \ell\nu)$ for $\ell = e,\mu$. Recently, it has also been pointed out that the baryonic counterpart, $R_{\Lambda_c} = \Gamma (\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \tau\nu)/\Gamma (\Lambda_b \to \Lambda_c \ell\nu)$, has a strong correlation with $R_{D^{(*)}}$, referred to as the R ratio sum rule in this paper. The correlation is almost independent of the new physics (NP) contributions and hence can predict $R_{\Lambda_c}$ from the measured $R_{D^{(*)}}$. On the other hand, we have fewer measurements and/or theoretical studies of the semi-leptonic $b \to u l \nu$ processes, although the same arguments can be applied to the ratios $R_\pi$, $R_\rho$, and $R_p$ as above. Since these processes are measurable at the ongoing LHCb run-3 and/or Belle~II experiments, precise studies on them are important as well. In this paper, we obtain the semi-analytic formulae for all the aforementioned $R_X$ ratios in the presence of model-independent NP contributions by using the available lattice QCD and/or light-cone sum rule fits to the form factors. Two novel points are highlighted: (i) We evaluate uncertainties of $R_X$ including both the Standard Model (SM) and NP terms, inherited from the form factor fits, and discuss how the uncertainties affect the $R$ ratio sum rules. (ii) We obtain the R ratio sum rule among the semi-leptonic $b \to u l \nu$ processes for the first time, which provides a complementary motivation for observing these processes. In addition, based on our model-independent results, we investigate how the different NP scenarios work in the $b\to c$ and $b\to u$ sectors and perform a combined study in the framework of SM effective field theory with specific flavor symmetries.</description>

      <title>Rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlation as a robust signal of diffusion wake induced by di-jets in high-energy heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion wake accompanying a Mach cone is a unique feature of the medium response to projectiles traveling at a speed faster than the velocity of sound. This is also the case for jet-medium interaction inside the quark-gluon plasma in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. It leads to a depletion of soft hadrons in the opposite direction of the propagating jet and has been recently observed in $Z$-jet events of Pb+Pb collisions at LHC. In di-jet events, however, the diffusion wake of one jet usually overlaps with the medium-induced hadron enhancement of other jet without a clear signal except a reduction of the hadron enhancement, unless there is a large rapidity gap between the two jets. We propose to use the rapidity asymmetry of jet-hadron correlations in di-jets with a finite rapidity gap relative to that without, as a robust and background-free signal of the diffusion wake. The asymmetry emerges because the diffusion wake of one jet is shifted to a finite rapidity relative to the other jet. Consequently, a depletion of soft hadrons appears in the shifted rapidity region of the diffusion wake and an enhancement in the rapidity region of the other jet whose soft hadron enhancement is no longer or less reduced by the diffusion wake as in di-jets without a rapidity gap. We predict the rapidity asymmetry using both theoretical and mixed-event background subtraction for different values of the rapidity gap within the CoLBT-hydro model. Future measurements of this rapidity asymmetry with high statistics data on di-jets should provide more precise insights into the jet-induced diffusion wake and properties of the quark-gluon plasma.</description>

We define and compute the quantum field theory object that replaces this ansatz for neutron beta decay, where neither of these limits hold. We present a new factorization formula that applies in the limit of small electron mass, analyze the components of this formula through two loop order, and resum perturbative corrections that are enhanced by large logarithms. We apply our results to the neutron lifetime, supplying the first two-loop input to the long-distance corrections. Our result can be summarized as \begin{equation*}
  \tau_n \times |V_{ud}|^2\big[1+3\lambda^2\big]\big[1+\Delta_R\big]
  =
  \frac{5263.284(17)\,{\rm s}}
  {1 + 27.04(7)\times 10^{-3} }~, \end{equation*} with $|V_{ud}|$ the up-down quark mixing parameter, $\tau_n$ the neutron's lifetime, $\lambda$ the ratio of axial to vector charge, and $\Delta_R$ the short-distance matching correction. We find a shift in the long-distance radiative corrections compared to previous work, and discuss implications for extractions of $|V_{ud}|$ and tests of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>The bound and resonant states of $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ with the complex scaling method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the possible molecular states composed of a pair of heavy mesons such as $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$, $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ in the framework of the one-boson-exchange model. The exchanged bosons include the pseudoscalar, scalar and vector mesons($\pi$, $\sigma$, $\rho$, $\omega$). We use the Bonn approximation to get the interaction potential of one-boson-exchange model, then apply the complex scaling method to calculate the bound and resonant states. The results indicate that the $D^{(*)}D^{(*)}$ and $D^{(*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ system can not only form several bound states, but also a P-wave resonant state. The hadron molecular state model can explain the structure of $T_{cc}^+$ as a bound state $DD^{*}$ with quantum number $I(J^P) = 0(1^+)$. In addition, we also discovered other bound and resonant states, which have the potential to be observed experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10051v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the two-loop amplitude of $gg\rightarrow HH$ mediated by bottom quarks, which provides a correction of percent level at leading order in the low invariant mass region. In order to compute the corresponding master integrals, we perform an expansion for the bottom quark mass, using the method of differential equations and fixing the boundary constants by a numerical approach. The results of 177 planar master integrals which are expressed in terms of multiple polylogarithms are provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.15043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new, state-of-the-art predictions for the associated production of the SM Higgs boson with top quarks, computed in accordance with the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Working Group. The NNLO QCD predictions, derived through suitable approximations of the two-loop virtual contribution, are supplemented with soft-gluon resummation up to NNLL accuracy. Two distinct resummation frameworks are employed - one based on direct QCD and the other on soft-collinear effective theory - and their features are compared in detail. These results are further combined with the complete-NLO corrections, yielding the most precise SM predictions for this process to date. The relevant sources of theoretical uncertainties are thoroughly estimated and discussed.</description>

      <title>A Dilaton Sum Rule for the Conformal Anomaly Form Factor in QCD at Order $\alpha_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an off-shell dispersive analysis of the graviton-gluon-gluon ($TJJ$) vertex, extending previous investigations carried out in both QED and QCD. Within the framework of a non-Abelian gauge theory, we extract the conformal anomaly form factor from the trace component of the correlator and demonstrate that it satisfies a one-loop sum rule, valid under the most general kinematic conditions. Analogously to the chiral and chiral-gravitational cases, a spectral flow emerges in which the exchanged intermediate state becomes localized at zero invariant mass along the graviton line as the quark mass approaches zero. The total integral of the spectral density precisely reproduces the anomaly. We examine how the behaviour of these spectral densities evolves as the system approaches the conformal limit with on-shell gluons. The perturbative analysis reveals that such sum rules are fundamental dynamical features of anomaly-induced interactions. In particular, the appearance or absence of associated dilaton poles is closely tied to whether the sum rule is saturated by a pole contribution or by a dispersive continuum. In the conformal, on-shell limit, the particle-pole interaction yields a nonlocal S-matrix element entirely supported on the light-cone.</description>

      <title>The Discriminant Power of Bubble Wall Velocities: Gravitational Waves and Electroweak Baryogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A precise determination of the bubble wall velocity $v_w$ is crucial for making accurate predictions of the baryon asymmetry and gravitational wave (GW) signals in models of electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG). Working in the local thermal equilibrium approximation, we exploit entropy conservation to present efficient algorithms for computing $v_w$, significantly streamlining the calculation. We then explore the parameter dependencies of $v_w$, focusing on two sample models capable of enabling a strong first-order electroweak phase transition: a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric singlet extension of the SM, and a model for baryogenesis with CP violation in the dark sector. We study correlations among $v_w$ and the two common measures of phase transition strength, $\alpha_n$ and $v_n/T_n$. Interestingly, we find a relatively model-insensitive relationship between $v_n/T_n$ and $\alpha_n$. We also observe an upper bound on $\alpha_n$ for the deflagration/hybrid wall profiles naturally compatible with EWBG, the exact value for which varies between models, significantly impacting the strength of the GW signals. In summary, our work provides a framework for exploring the feasibility of EWBG models in light of future GW signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study cosmic strings in the complex symmetron model, a scalar-tensor theory with a spontaneously broken local $U(1)$ symmetry in low matter density regions. Using numerical simulations, we show that these strings preferentially attach to matter halos, leading to the stabilization of string loops. While the requirement for screening of fifth-force interactions in the solar system limits observable signatures in theories with universal coupling to matter, analogous topological defects in the dark sector may still influence cosmic structure formation, offering a novel avenue to constrain dark-sector interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03241v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the exclusion constraints on the parameters of a narrow dark photon set by direct experimental searches. We investigate how a dark photon with a larger decay width impacts these limits, in particular, in the case where the dark photon also decays into light dark matter. As an example, taking the upper limits on the mixing parameter, $\epsilon$, reported by the CMS collaboration, we find that they could be significantly relaxed. Indeed, even a very modest coupling of the dark photon to dark matter can lead to an increase in the bound on the mixing parameter by an order of magnitude.</description>

Abstract: Within the framework of the quark model and the variational method, the bound states of four heavy quarks (tetraquarks) are investigated. The basis variational wave functions are chosen in the Gaussian form. The matrix elements of the Hamiltonian are calculated analytically. Numerical calculation of the energy levels of tetraquarks is performed using a program in the Matlab system. Hyperfine structure of the spectrum is calculated. To increase the accuracy of the calculation, relativistic corrections are taken into account.</description>

      <title>CP Violation in Hadronic Weak Decays of Charmed Baryons in the Topological Diagrammatic Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CP violation in the charmed baryon sector is generally expected to be very small, of order $10^{-4}$ or even smaller. Nevertheless, large long-distance penguin topologies can be induced through final-state rescattering. At the hadron level, they are manifested as the triangle and bubble diagrams. However, these diagrams consist of not only the penguin but also other tree topologies. Therefore, we focus on the flavor structure of the these diagrams and project out their contributions to penguin and tree topologies. The analysis is performed within the framework of the topological diagram approach and the irreducible SU(3) approach in which the SU(3) flavor symmetry of QCD is realized to describe the nonleptonic decays of charmed baryons. CP violation at the per mille level is found in the following decay modes: $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \pi^0,~\Lambda_c^+ \to p \eta', ~\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^0\eta$ and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Sigma^+ \eta$. CP asymmetries in the last three modes receive sizable contributions from the SU(3)-flavor-singlet hairpin diagram.</description>

Abstract: We discuss in detail the relativistic spatial distribution of transverse angular momentum, including both orbital and intrinsic spin contributions. Using the quantum phase-space formalism, we begin with the definition of the three-dimensional spatial distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum and intrinsic spin in a generic Lorentz frame. By integrating these three-dimensional spatial distributions over the longitudinal axis, we derive for the first time the relativistic spatial distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum, intrinsic spin, and total angular momentum for spin-0 and spin-1/2 targets in the transverse plane. We verify the transverse spin sum rule about the relativistic center of spin for spin-0 and spin-1/2 systems, and find that the transverse total angular momentum distribution is non-trivial, even for spin-0 targets. We also show how the distributions of transverse orbital angular momentum, intrinsic spin, and total angular momentum change with the target momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent LHCb measurements of the ratios between the branching ratios (BRs), $R_{\chi_{c2}/J/\psi} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c2} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+)$ and $R_{\chi_{c1}/\chi_{c2}} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c1} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c2} \pi^+)$, we analyze the decays $B_c^+ \to \chi_{cJ} (P, V)^+$ in the improved perturbative QCD (iPQCD) formalism, where $\chi_{cJ}$ denotes the $p$-wave charmonia with $J=0, 1, 2$, and $P (V)$ denotes the pseudoscalars $\pi$ and $K$ (the vectors $\rho$ and $K^*$). Our results $R_{\chi_{c2}/J/\psi} = 0.32 \pm 0.05$ and $R_{\chi_{c1}/\chi_{c2}}= 0.11 \pm 0.01$ at leading order in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ agree well with the data within uncertainties. The result $R_{\chi_{c0}/J/\psi} \equiv {\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to \chi_{c0} \pi^+)/{\rm BR}(B_c^+ \to J/\psi \pi^+) = 0.17 \pm 0.02$ is lower than $1.41^{+0.50}_{-0.45}$ inferred by the $B_c^+ \to \chi_{c0} \pi^+$ measurement. The large longitudinal polarization fractions imply that these components dominate the $B_c^+ \to \chi_{c1,c2} \rho^+$ BRs. A peculiar constructive (destructive) interference between the twist-2 and twist-3 contributions is identified in the $B_c^+\to \chi_{c1} \rho^+$ ($B_c^+\to \chi_{c1} \pi^+$) mode, but not in the corresponding ones with $\chi_{c0,c2}$ mesons. Inputting the BRs of the strong decays $\chi_{c0,c2} \to \pi^+ \pi^- / K^+ K^-$ and $\chi_{cJ} \to \pi^+\pi^-(\pi^+ \pi^-/K^+K^-)$ reported by the BESIII Collaboration, we obtain those of $B_c^+ \to \chi_{cJ} (\rho, \pi)^+$ followed by secondary decay chains under the narrow-width approximation. All the above iPQCD predictions can be confronted by more precise experiments in the future to deepen our understanding of QCD dynamics in $B_c\to\chi_{cJ}$ transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An effective Lagrangian for the interaction between a pseudo-scalar (axion-like) field and massive fermions is considered. At high density and non-zero temperature axions can be produced through bremsstrahlung. If the axion-neutron interaction is greater than a certain value we can have a mean free path smaller than the size of a neutron star. The influence of such trapped axions on the mass-radius function of the neutron star is investigated by solving numerically the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations. We show that causality limits the applicability of the trapping regime. We find specific ranges of central densities and temperatures of a neutron star for which axions give a conspicuous contribution to the neutron-star mass. For other densities and temperatures axions do not have a significant effect on the structure of a neutron star. Since we use an effective approach our results can be easily applied to specific axion models.</description>

Abstract: The rare four-fold decay $B_s \to K^*(\to K\pi)\mu^+\mu^- $, governed by the flavor-changing neutral current transition $b \to d\mu^+\mu^-$, provides a sensitive probe for testing the Standard Model (SM) and investigating signatures of new physics (NP). This work presents a comprehensive model-independent analysis of the decay using the framework of the weak effective field theory. We compute a set of key physical observables, including the differential branching ratio, forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal polarization fraction, and several normalized angular coefficients $\langle I_i\rangle$, as a function of the dilepton invariant mass squared $q^2$. The impact of NP is explored via both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) scenarios involving NP Wilson coefficients $C_7^{\text{NP}}$, $C_9^{(\prime)\text{NP}}$, and $C_{10}^{(\prime)\text{NP}}$. Our findings reveal notable deviations from the SM predictions across multiple observables. Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between different observables and their 2D contour plots which would be useful to further constrain the parametric space of possible NP contributions. This study reinforces the potential of $B_s \to K^* \mu^+ \mu^-$ decay as a complementary channel in the search for physics beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Constraint on ultralight Nelson-Barr dark matter from time-dependent nuclear decay</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many experiments have notably reported anomalies in radioactive decay rates with periodic variations and challenged the traditional belief of time-independent decays. This periodicity could potentially be explained by the presence of a periodic dark matter (DM) candidate. In this work, we investigate the impact of time-dependent nuclear decay rates on the ultralight scalar DM in Nelson-Barr solution to the strong CP problem. The light scalar DM field in this framework induces periodic modulations of both CKM matrix elements and quark mass parameters. These modulations generate corresponding periodic perturbations in the neutron-proton mass difference and nuclear binding energies. Consequently, nuclear decay rates receive oscillating residuals. By analyzing the tritium decay rate, we derive new exclusion bounds on the Nelson-Barr DM parameters.</description>

      <title>Flavor SU(3) analysis of the charmless semileptonic $B \to PV\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: All charmless $B \to PV\ell^+\nu_\ell$ ($P$ denotes the light pseudoscalar meson and $V$ denotes the vector meson) decays have not been experimentally observed to date, but some of them might be measured in the near future. The charmless $B \to PV\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays with the axial-vector ($A$) resonance states, the tensor ($T$) resonance states and the excited vector ($V_{E,D}$) resonance states are studied based on flavor SU(3) analysis in this work, where $V_E$ contains $\{\rho(1450), K^*(1410), \omega(1420), \phi(1680)\}$ with quantum numbers $n^{2S+1}L_J=2^3S_1$ and $V_D$ contains $\{\rho(1700), K^*(1680), \omega(1650), \phi(2170)\}$ with quantum numbers $n^{2S+1}L_J=1^3D_1$. The hadronic amplitudes of the $B \to A/T \ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ decays are related by the nonperturbative parameters, and the branching ratio predictions of $B \to A/T/V_{E,D} \ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ are obtained, and then the branching ratios of the $B\to A(A\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B\to T(T\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$, $B\to V_E(V_E\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $B\to V_D(V_D\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ are obtained by the narrow width approximation or further considering the width effects. We find that most branching ratios of the $B \to A \ell^+\nu_{\ell}$ decays and many branching ratios of the $B\to A(A\to PV)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays are on the order of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-4}-10^{-3})$, and all branching ratios with the tensor resonance states and the excited vector resonance states are small. Our results could be tested in the future BelleII and LHCb experiments.</description>

      <title>BSM: Extended Scalar Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In particle physics the world is described by a function, the Lagrangian. Each of its sectors characterizes the interactions between the particles of the Standard Model (SM). The addition of hypothetical new particles is done by including new terms in the Lagrangian. The scalar or Higgs sector of the SM is built with only one scalar complex field and it is extended by including new spin zero fields. This can help to solve questions that cannot be answered by the SM alone, like introducing dark matter candidates or new sources of CP-violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe. The corresponding theories have to be probed experimentally. For the high energy region, the standard tools are collider experiments such as the Large Hadron Collider, or other possible future facilities. Dark matter experiments scrutinize the connection between the visible and the dark world.</description>

      <title>Rephasing Invariant Formula for CP Phase in Kobayashi-Maskawa Parametrization and Exact Sum Rule with Unitarity Triangle $\delta_{\rm PDG} + \delta_{\rm KM} = \pi - \alpha + \gamma$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we obtain a rephasing invariant formula for the CP phase in the Kobayashi--Maskawa parameterization $\delta_{\rm KM} = \arg [ - { V_{ud} \det V_{\rm CKM} / V_{us} V_{ub} V_{cd} V_{td}} ]$. General perturbative expansion of the formula and observed value $\delta_{\rm KM} \simeq \pi/2$ reveal that the phase difference of the 1-2 mixings $e^{i (\rho_{12}^{d} - \rho_{12}^{u})}$ is close to maximal for sufficiently small 1-3 quark mixings $s_{13}^{u,d}$. Moreover, combining this result with another formula for the CP phase $\delta_{\rm PDG}$ in the PDG parameterization, we derived an exact sum rule $\delta_{\rm PDG} + \delta_{\rm KM} = \pi - \alpha + \gamma$ which relating the phases and the angles $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ of the unitarity triangle.</description>

      <title>Resonant history of gravitational atoms in black hole binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03147v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotating black holes can produce superradiant clouds of ultralight bosons. When the black hole is part of a binary system, its cloud can undergo resonances and ionization. These processes leave a distinct signature on the gravitational waveform that depends on the cloud's properties. To determine the state of the cloud by the time the system enters the band of future millihertz detectors, we study the chronological sequence of resonances encountered during the inspiral. For the first time, we consistently take into account the nonlinearities induced by the orbital backreaction and we allow the orbit to have generic eccentricity and inclination. We find that the resonance phenomenology exhibits striking new features. Resonances can "start" or "break" above critical thresholds of the parameters, which we compute analytically, and induce dramatic changes in eccentricity and inclination. Applying these results to realistic systems, we find two possible outcomes. If the binary and the cloud are sufficiently close to counter-rotating, the cloud survives in its original state until the system enters in band; otherwise, the cloud is destroyed during a resonance at large separations, but leaves an imprint on the eccentricity and inclination. In both scenarios, we characterize the observational signatures, with particular focus on future gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Space-borne Interferometers to Detect Thousands of Memory Signals Emitted by Stellar-mass Binary Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18053v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The gravitational memory effect manifests gravitational nonlinearity, degenerate vacua, and asymptotic symmetries; its detection is considered challenging. We propose using the space-borne interferometer to detect memory signals from stellar-mass binary black holes (BBHs), typically targeted by ground-based detectors. We use DECIGO detector as an example. Over 5 years, DECIGO is estimated to detect $\sim$2,036 memory signals (SNRs $&gt;$3) from stellar-mass BBHs. Simulations used frequency-domain memory waveforms for direct SNR estimation. Predictions utilized a GWTC-3 constrained BBH population model (Power Law + Peak mass, DEFAULT spin, Madau-Dickinson merger rate). The analysis used conservative lower merger rate limits and considered orbital eccentricity. The high detection rate stems from strong memory signals within DECIGO's bandwidth and the abundance of stellar-mass BBHs. This substantial, conservative detection count enables statistical use of the memory effect for fundamental physics and astrophysics. DECIGO exemplifies that space interferometers may better detect memory signals from smaller mass binaries than their typical targets. Detectors in lower frequency bands are expected to find strong memory signals from $\sim 10^4 M_\odot$ binaries.</description>

      <title>Estimating the gravitational wave background anisotropy: a Bayesian approach boosted by cross-correlation angular power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new method designed for Bayesian inference of the angular power spectrum of the Gravitational Wave Background (GWB) anisotropy. This scheme works with time-series data and can optionally incorporate the cross-correlations between the GWB anisotropy and other cosmological tracers, enhancing the significance of Bayesian inference. We employ the realistic LISA response and noise model to demonstrate the validity of this approach. The findings indicate that, without considering any cross-correlations, the 4-year LISA data is insufficient to achieve a significant detection of multipoles. However, if the anisotropies in the GWB are strongly correlated with the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), the 4-year data can provide unbiased estimates of the quadrupole moment ($\ell = 2$). This reconstruction process is generic and not restricted to any specific detector, offering a new framework for extracting anisotropies in the GWB data from various current and future gravitational wave observatories.</description>

Abstract: High-energy nuclear collisions have recently emerged as a promising ``imaging-by-smashing'' approach that may reveal the intrinsic shapes of atomic nuclei. Here, I outline a conceptual framework for this technique, explaining how nuclear shapes are encoded during quark-gluon plasma formation and evolution, and how they can be decoded from final-state particle distributions. I highlight the method's potential to advance our understanding of both nuclear structure and quark-gluon plasma physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>

      <title>Synthetic and cosmological axion hybridization: entangled photons, (HBT) and quantum beats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article it is argued that synthetic axions, emergent collective excitations in topological insulators or Weyl semimetals hybridize with the cosmological axion, a compelling dark matter candidate via a common two photon decay channel since they both couple to electromagnetic fields via a Chern-Simons term. We point out an analogy to a V-type three level system with the two upper levels identified with the synthetic and cosmological axions decaying into a two-photon state. The Weisskopf-Wigner theory of spontaneous decay in multi level atoms is complemented and extended to describe the dynamics of hybridization. The final two-photon state features both kinematic and polarization entanglement and displays quantum beats as a consequence of the interference between the decay paths. An initial population of either axion induces a population of the other via hybridization. Consequently, a dark matter axion condensate induces a condensate of the synthetic axion, albeit with small amplitude. We obtain a momentum and polarization resolved Hanbury- Brown Twiss (HBT) second order coherence describing coincident correlated two-photon detection. It exhibits quantum beats with a frequency given by the difference between the energies of the synthetic and cosmological axion and \emph{perhaps may be harnessed} to detect either type of axion excitations. The case of synthetic axions individually is obtained in the limit of vanishing coupling of the cosmological axion and features similar two-photon correlations. Hence second order (HBT) two-photon coherence \emph{may} provide an alternative detection mechanism for emergent condensed matter axionic collective excitations. Similarities and differences with parametrically down converted photons are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: After obtaining the flavor $D6$-brane gauge fields/their fluctuations in the type IIA dual of T&gt;T_c QCD-like theories at intermediate coupling (via the ${\cal M}$-theory uplift's ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections) in the absence/presence of a strong magnetic field, we compute the photoproduction spectral function and get a nice agreement with gauged supergravity backgrounds arXiv:2204.00024 [hep-th]. We demonstrate from the EoS that the holographic dual, in principle, could correspond to several $T&gt;T_c$ scenarios: anisotropic paramagnetic plasma transitioning via a smooth crossover to exotic matter as the universe cools, the stable wormhole, and a paramagnetic pressure/energy-anisotropic plasma. Given that $T&gt;T_c$ QGP is expected to be paramagnetic, see Bali et al '14, the third possibility appears to be the preferred one. We also show that it is not possible that the anisotropic plasma leads to the formation of a compact star. IR renormalization of the DBI action requires a boundary Log-det-Ricci-tensor counter term. {\it Noting (i) photoproduction spectral function determined from gauge field fluctuations receiving ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrections, if complexified, include a non-analytic-complexified gauge-coupling dependence, and correspond to Contact 3-Structures; (ii) pressure/energy density, etc. determined from world-volume gauge fields and not ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected, if complexified, are analytic in the complexified gauge coupling, and correspond to Almost Contact 3-Structures (AC3S) both induced from the $G_2$ structure of a closed seven-fold, we conjecture (i) the lack of $N$-path connectedness in the parameter space associated with AC3S and C3S arXiv:2211.13186[hep-th] to be equivalent to that gauge field fluctuations can not be finite, and (zero-instanton sector) ${\cal O}(R^4)$ non-renormalized gauge fields produce ${\cal O}(R^4)$-corrected gauge fluctuation; (ii) C3S--UV--&gt; AC3S.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Bogoliubov vs Boltzmann approaches in gravitational production</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21877v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral behavior of scalar fluctuations generated by gravity during inflation and the subsequent reheating phase. We consider a non-perturbative Bogoliubov treatment within the context of pure gravitational reheating. We compute both long and short-wavelength spectra, first for a massless scalar field, revealing that the spectral index in part of the infrared (IR) regime varies between $-6$ and $-3$, depending on the post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $0\leq w_\phi\leq1$. Furthermore, we study the mass-breaking effect of the IR spectrum by including finite mass, $m_{\chi}$, of the daughter scalar field. We show that for $m_{\chi}/H_{\rm e} \gtrsim 3/2$, where $H_{\rm e}$ is the Hubble parameter during inflation, the IR spectrum of scalar fluctuations experiences exponential mass suppression, while for smaller masses, $m_{\chi}/H_{\rm e}&lt;3/2$, the spectrum remains flat in the IR regime regardless of the post-inflationary EoS. For any general EoS, we also compute a specific IR scale, $k_m$, of fluctuations below which the IR spectrum will suffer from this finite mass effect. In the UV regime, oscillations of the inflaton background lead to interference terms that explain the high-frequency oscillations in the spectrum. Interestingly, we find that for any EoS, $1/9 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$, the spectral behavior turns out to be independent of the EoS, with a spectral index $ -6$. We have compared this Bogoliubov treatment for the UV regime to perturbative computations with solutions to the Boltzmann equation and found an agreement between the two approaches for any EoS, $0 \lesssim w_\phi \lesssim 1$. We also explore the relationship between the gravitational reheating temperature and the reheating EoS employing the non-perturbative analytic approach, finding that reheating can occur for $w_\phi \gtrsim 0.6$.</description>

      <title>Kaon radiative leptonic decay rates from lattice QCD simulations at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the radiative leptonic decay rates of the kaon, improving upon our previous work, arXiv:2006.05358. Our analysis uses gauge ensembles generated by the Extended Twisted Mass Collaboration (ETMC) with $N_{f} = 2 + 1 + 1$ flavors of Wilson-clover twisted mass fermions. For the first time, we go beyond the electroquenched approximation by including quark-disconnected contributions. Several key improvements have been implemented: (i) the simulations are now performed directly at physical light- and strange-quark masses, (ii) finite-size effects are carefully investigated using lattices with spatial extents ranging from $L \simeq 3.8\,\mathrm{fm}$ to $L \simeq 7.7\,\mathrm{fm}$, and (iii) the continuum extrapolation is based on three lattice spacings in the range $a \in [0.08, 0.058]\,\mathrm{fm}$. As a result of the high-precision determination of the relevant correlation functions, we reduce the uncertainties on both the axial and vector form factors by nearly a factor of two compared to our previous analysis. When compared to experimental measurements in the electron channel ($K^- \to e^- \bar{\nu}_e \gamma$), our results show a tension -- at the level of $2.6$ standard deviations -- with respect to KLOE data. On the other hand, they are compatible with measurements from the E36 Collaboration at J-PARC. In the muonic decay channel ($K^- \to \mu^- \bar{\nu}_\mu \gamma$), we confirm the tensions, already observed in our previous study, between lattice QCD predictions and ISTRA+ and OKA data, which are both primarily sensitive to the value of the negative-helicity form factor $F^{-}$.</description>

Abstract: We present the design and current status of SPLENDOR, a novel detector platform that combines narrow-gap semiconductor targets with low-noise charge readout to achieve sensitivity to dark matter energy deposits well below the eV scale. SPLENDOR is designed to be a modular and scalable system able to accommodate different target materials and signal readout technologies. SPLENDOR's present strategy entails: (i) the use of strongly correlated f-electron semiconductors with anisotropic electronic structures to enable not only sub-eV energy thresholds, but also directional sensitivity to the incoming dark matter flux, allowing for signal-background discrimination via daily modulation, and (ii) custom charge readout based on cryogenic high-electron-mobility transistor (cryoHEMT) amplifiers approaching single-electron resolution. We report on the selection and characterization of Eu$_5$In$_2$Sb$_6$ as the target material for SPLENDOR's first prototype detector, as well as the development and calibration of the prototype amplifier chain, achieving a measured charge resolution of 20$\pm$7 electrons in silicon test samples, consistent with predicted performance. This provides a demonstration of the detector architecture, which is now ready for deployment in a dark matter search campaign to deliver SPLENDOR's first science results. Finally, we present estimates of sensitivity reach in the parameter space of athermally produced relic dark matter under high- and low-background environments, and for various amplifier technology upgrades with increasing performance, including planned quantum sensing upgrades in order to achieve our ultimate goal of sub-electron resolution in optimized systems. SPLENDOR provides a novel approach to dark matter direct detection, combining quantum sensing with material's design to open new avenues of exploration in the sub-MeV mass range of dark matter parameter space.</description>

      <title>Probing Spin and Lifetime Correlations in Entangled Hyperon-AntiHyperon Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement has now been demonstrated in several hadronic systems, revealing that non-classical spin correlations survive even through the strong-interaction hadronization process. To date, however, all studies have focused exclusively on angular observables, leaving the possibility untouched that quantum coherence might also influence the decay times of entangled partners. In this work we propose data-driven tests of spin-lifetime and lifetime-lifetime correlations for Lambda-antiLambda pairs produced in high-energy collisions. By examining the opening-angle distribution in slices of Delta t, constructing a pair-wise spin-lifetime correlator, and testing a simple lifetime-lifetime covariance, we search for deviations from independent exponential decay that align with known spin correlations. Observation of nonzero lifetime correlations would compel a reassessment of how entanglement manifests in decaying systems, revealing hitherto unexplored temporal coherence.</description>

      <title>Single-valued periods of meromorphic modular forms and a motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A well-known conjecture of Gross and Zagier states that the values of the higher automorphic Green's function at pairs of points with complex multiplication in the upper half-plane are proportional to the logarithm of an algebraic number. It was recently settled in the case of congruence subgroups of the form $\Gamma_0(N)$ by analytic methods. In this paper we provide a geometric and motivic interpretation of the general conjecture, and show that it is a consequence of a standard conjecture in the theory of motives. In addition, we define a new class of matrix-valued higher Green's functions for both odd and even weight modular forms, and show that they are single-valued periods of a motive constructed from a suitable moduli stack of elliptic curves with marked points. The motive has the structure of a biextension involving symmetric powers of the motives of elliptic curves. This suggests a very general extension of the Gross-Zagier conjecture relating values of matrix-valued higher Green's functions at points which do not necessarily have complex multiplication to special values of $L$-functions. In particular, our motivic interpretation of the Gross-Zagier log-algebraicity conjecture enables us to give a completely geometric proof in level 1 and weight 4 by showing that the motive of the moduli stack $\mathcal{M}_{1,3}$ of elliptic curves with 3 marked points is mixed Tate.
  In the course of this paper we develop many new foundational results on: the theory of weak harmonic lifts, meromorphic modular forms, biextensions of modular motives, and their corresponding algebraic de Rham cohomology and single-valued periods, which may all be of independent interest.</description>
