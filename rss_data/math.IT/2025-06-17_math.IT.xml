      <title>Functional Multi-Reference Alignment via Deconvolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the multi-reference alignment (MRA) problem of estimating a signal function from shifted, noisy observations. Our functional formulation reveals a new connection between MRA and deconvolution: the signal can be estimated from second-order statistics via Kotlarski's formula, an important identification result in deconvolution with replicated measurements. To design our MRA algorithms, we extend Kotlarski's formula to general dimension and study the estimation of signals with vanishing Fourier transform, thus also contributing to the deconvolution literature. We validate our deconvolution approach to MRA through both theory and numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Communication Complexity of Exact Sampling under R\'enyi Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of communicating a sample from a probability distribution $P$ given shared access to a sequence distributed according to another probability distribution $Q$. Li and El Gamal used the Poisson functional representation to show that the minimum expected message length to communicate a sample from $P$ can be upper bounded by $D(P||Q) + \log (D(P||Q) + 1) + 4$, where $D(\, \cdot \, || \, \cdot\, )$ is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We generalize this and related results to a cost which is exponential in the message length, specifically $L(t)$, Campbell's average codeword length of order $t$, and to R\'enyi's entropy. We lower bound the Campbell cost and R\'enyi entropy of communicating a sample under any (possibly noncausal) sampling protocol, showing that it grows approximately as $D_{1/\alpha}(P||Q)$, where $D_\beta(\,\cdot \,|| \,\cdot\,)$ is the R\'enyi divergence of order $\beta$. Using the Poisson functional representation, we prove an upper bound on $L(t)$ and $H_\alpha(K)$ which has a leading R\'enyi divergence term with order within $\epsilon$ of the lower bound. Our results reduce to the bounds of Harsha et al. as $\alpha \to 1$. We also provide numerical examples comparing the bounds in the cases of normal and Laplacian distributions, demonstrating that the upper and lower bounds are typically within 5-10 bits of each other.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multi-Modal Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) powered by generative artificial intelligence enables highly efficient and reliable information transmission. However, it still necessitates the transmission of substantial amounts of data when dealing with complex scene information. In contrast, the stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM), leveraging wave-domain computing, provides a cost-effective solution for directly imaging complex scenes. Building on this concept, we propose an innovative SIM-aided multi-modal SemCom system. Specifically, an SIM is positioned in front of the transmit antenna for transmitting visual semantic information of complex scenes via imaging on the uniform planar array at the receiver. Furthermore, the simple scene description that contains textual semantic information is transmitted via amplitude-phase modulation over electromagnetic waves. To simultaneously transmit multi-modal information, we optimize the amplitude and phase of meta-atoms in the SIM using a customized gradient descent algorithm. The optimization aims to gradually minimize the mean squared error between the normalized energy distribution on the receiver array and the desired pattern corresponding to the visual semantic information. By combining the textual and visual semantic information, a conditional generative adversarial network is used to recover the complex scene accurately. Extensive numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed multi-modal SemCom system in reducing bandwidth overhead as well as the capability of the SIM for imaging the complex scene.</description>

      <title>On the cross-correlation properties of large-size families of Costas arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Costas arrays have been an interesting combinatorial object for decades because of their optimal aperiodic auto-correlation properties. Meanwhile, it is interesting to find families of Costas arrays or extended arrays with small maximal cross-correlation values, since for applications in multi-user systems, the cross-interferences between different signals should also be small. The objective of this paper is to study several large-size families of Costas arrays or extended arrays, and their values of maximal cross-correlation are partially bounded for some cases of horizontal shifts $u$ and vertical shifts $v$. Given a prime $p \geq 5$, in particular, a large-size family of Costas arrays over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ is investigated, including both the exponential Welch Costas arrays and logarithmic Welch Costas arrays. An upper bound on the maximal cross-correlation of this family for arbitrary $u$ and $v$ is given. We also show that the maximal cross-correlation of the family of power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for $u = 0$ and $v \neq 0$ is bounded by $\frac{1}{2}+\sqrt{p-1}$. Furthermore, we give the first nontrivial upper bound of $(p-1)/t$ on the maximal cross-correlation of the larger family including both exponential Welch Costas arrays and power permutations over $\{1, \ldots, p-1\}$ for arbitrary $u$ and $v=0$, where $t$ is the smallest prime divisor of $(p-1)/2$.</description>

      <title>Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information, fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using Mutual Information (MI), while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using the Generalized Mutual Information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in Bit-Interleaved Coded Modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput performance of BICM-type systems. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.</description>

      <title>SIC-Free Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Constellation-Constrained Optimization and Application to Large-Scale Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has been recognized as a promising multiple access technique for future wireless communication systems. Recent research demonstrates that RSMA can maintain its superiority without relying on Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) receivers. In practical systems, SIC-free receivers are more attractive than SIC receivers because of their low complexity and latency. This paper evaluates the theoretical limits of RSMA with and without SIC receivers under finite constellations. We first derive the constellation-constrained rate expressions for RSMA. We then design algorithms based on projected subgradient ascent to optimize the precoders and maximize the weighted sum-rate or max-min fairness (MMF) among users. To apply the proposed optimization algorithms to large-scale systems, one challenge lies in the exponentially increasing computational complexity brought about by the constellation-constrained rate expressions. In light of this, we propose methods to avoid such computational burden. Numerical results show that, under optimized precoders, SIC-free RSMA leads to minor losses in weighted sum-rate and MMF performance in comparison to RSMA with SIC receivers, making it a viable option for future implementations.</description>

      <title>Lempel-Ziv Complexity, Empirical Entropies, and Chain Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive upper and lower bounds on the overall compression ratio of the 1978 Lempel-Ziv (LZ78) algorithm, applied independently to $k$-blocks of a finite individual sequence. Both bounds are given in terms of normalized empirical entropies of the given sequence. For the bounds to be tight and meaningful, the order of the empirical entropy should be small relative to $k$ in the upper bound, but large relative to $k$ in the lower bound. Several non-trivial conclusions arise from these bounds. One of them is a certain form of a chain rule of the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) complexity, which decomposes the joint LZ complexity of two sequences, say, $\bx$ and $\by$, into the sum of the LZ complexity of $\bx$ and the conditional LZ complexity of $\by$ given $\bx$ (up to small terms). The price of this decomposition, however, is in changing the length of the block. Additional conclusions are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Optimal Reconstruction Codes with Given Reads in Multiple Burst-Substitutions Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study optimal reconstruction codes over the multiple-burst substitution channel. Our main contribution is establishing a trade-off between the error-correction capability of the code, the number of reads used in the reconstruction process, and the decoding list size. We show that over a channel that introduces at most $t$ bursts, we can use a length-$n$ code capable of correcting $\epsilon$ errors, with $\Theta(n^\rho)$ reads, and decoding with a list of size $O(n^\lambda)$, where $t-1=\epsilon+\rho+\lambda$. In the process of proving this, we establish sharp asymptotic bounds on the size of error balls in the burst metric. More precisely, we prove a Johnson-type lower bound via Kahn's Theorem on large matchings in hypergraphs, and an upper bound via a novel variant of Kleitman's Theorem under the burst metric, which might be of independent interest.
  Beyond this main trade-off, we derive several related results using a variety of combinatorial techniques. In particular, along with tools from recent advances in discrete geometry, we improve the classical Gilbert-Varshamov bound in the asymptotic regime for multiple bursts, and determine the minimum redundancy required for reconstruction codes with polynomially many reads. We also propose an efficient list-reconstruction algorithm that achieves the above guarantees, based on a majority-with-threshold decoding scheme.</description>

      <title>On secure UAV-aided ISCC systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated communication and sensing, which can make full use of the limited spectrum resources to perform communication and sensing tasks simultaneously, is an up-and-coming technology in wireless communication networks. In this work, we investigate the secrecy performance of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted secure integrated communication, sensing, and computing system, where the UAV sends radar signals to locate and disrupt potential eavesdroppers while providing offload services to ground users (GUs). Considering the constraints of UAV maximum speed, transmit power, and propulsion energy, as well as secure offloading, data transmission, and computation time, the total energy consumption of GUs is minimized by jointly optimizing user offloading ratio, user scheduling strategy, transmit beamforming, and UAV trajectory. An efficient iterative optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex optimization problem caused by tightly coupled dependent variables. In particular, the original optimization problem is decomposed into four sub-optimization problems, and the non-convex sub-problems are transformed into approximately convex forms via successive convex approximation. Then, all sub-problems are solved successively by using the block coordinate descent technique. Numerical results demonstrate the convergence and validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Scalar Lattices and Probabilistic Shaping for Dithered Wyner-Ziv Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar lattice quantization with a modulo operator, dithering, and probabilistic shaping is applied to the Wyner-Ziv (WZ) problem with a Gaussian source and mean square error distortion. The method achieves the WZ rate-distortion pairs. The analysis is similar to that for dirty paper coding but requires additional steps to bound the distortion because the modulo shift is correlated with the source noise. The results extend to vector sources by reverse waterfilling on the spectrum of the covariance matrix of the source noise. Simulations with short polar codes illustrate the performance and compare with scalar quantizers and polar coded quantization without dithering.</description>

      <title>Spectral Comb Shaping by Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scheme to select information indices in polar codes is proposed to form signals with spectral comb shapes under BPSK modulation, whereby the signal could be separated from periodic interference in spectrum. By selecting proper indices to load information bits in polar coding, a spectral comb shape signal is formed, which has periodic zeros and notch bands uniformly distributed in its frequency spectrum. Furthermore, to mitigate the negative impact of proposed polar code on the AWGN performance, a scheme termed error performance enhancement scheme is proposed, whereby the performance loss under AWGN noise could be alleviated. Numerical results are given under periodic interference and AWGN noise, indicating that a considerable signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) gain is accomplished in comparison with conventional polar codes.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: Fundamentals, Opportunities, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of low-altitude applications, there is an increasing demand for low-altitude wireless networks (LAWNs) to simultaneously achieve high-rate communication, precise sensing, and reliable control in the low-altitude airspace. In this paper, we first present a typical system architecture of LAWNs, which integrates three core functionalities: communication, sensing, and control. Subsequently, we explore the promising prospects of movable antenna (MA)-assisted wireless communications, with emphasis on its potential in flexible beamforming, interference management, and spatial multiplexing gain. Furthermore, we elaborate on the integrated communication, sensing, and control capabilities enabled by MAs in LAWNs, and illustrate their effectiveness through representative examples. A case study demonstrates that MA-enabled LAWNs achieve significant performance improvements over traditional fixed-position antenna-based LAWNs in terms of communication throughput, sensing accuracy, and control stability. Finally, we outline several promising directions for future research, including the MA-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication/sensing, the MA-assisted reliable control, and the MA-enhanced physical layer security.</description>

      <title>A Contemporary Survey on Fluid Antenna Systems: Fundamentals and Networking Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of teletraffic, fueled by the convergence of cyber-physical systems and data-intensive applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), autonomous systems, and immersive communications, demands a multidisciplinary suite of innovative solutions across the physical and network layers. Fluid antenna systems (FAS) represent a transformative advancement in antenna design, offering enhanced spatial degrees of freedom through dynamic reconfigurability. By exploiting spatial flexibility, FAS can adapt to varying channel conditions and optimize wireless performance, making it a highly promising candidate for next-generation communication networks. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of the state of the art in FAS research. We begin by examining key application scenarios in which FAS offers significant advantages. We then present the fundamental principles of FAS, covering channel measurement and modeling, single-user configurations, and the multi-user fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA) framework. Following this, we delve into key network-layer techniques such as quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning, power allocation, and content placement strategies. We conclude by identifying prevailing challenges and outlining future research directions to support the continued development of FAS in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, several governments in developing and developed countries have started their journey toward digital transformation. However, the pace and maturity of digital technologies and strategies are different between public services. Current literature indicates that research on the digital transformation of urban planning is still developing. Therefore, the aim of this study is to understand the influencing factors and key challenges for the digital transformation of urban planning in Australia. The study adopts the inter-organisational theory and Planning Support Science (PSScience) under the Technological, Organisational, and External Environmental (TOE) framework. It involves a multiple case study, administered semi-structured interviews with thirteen IT and urban planning experts across Victoria and New South Wales governments and private industries. The study findings indicate that the main challenges for digital transformation of the Australian urban planning system are related to organisational and external environmental factors. Furthermore, a digital maturity model is absent in the Australian urban planning industry. This study offers important implications to research and practice related to digital transformation in urban planning.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Layered Decoding Scheduling for LDPC Codes Aided by Check Node Error Probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, a new scheduling strategies for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under layered belief propagation (LBP) is designed. Based on the criteria of prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error probabilities, we propose two dynamic scheduling methods: dynamic error belief propagation (Dyn-EBP) and dynamic penalty error belief propagation (Dyn-PEBP). In Dyn-EBP, each check node is restricted from being updated the same number of times, whereas Dyn-PEBP removes this restriction and instead introduces a penalty term to balance the number of updates. Simulation results show that, for 5G new radio (NR) LDPC codes, our proposed scheduling methods can outperform existing dynamic and offline scheduling strategies under various blocklengths and code rates. This demonstrates that prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error probabilities can lead to higher decoding efficiency and validates the effectiveness of our algorithms.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Rotatable Antenna for Integrated Sensing, Communication, and Computation: Challenges and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing, communication, and computation (ISCC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling intelligent services in future sixth-generation (6G) networks. However, existing ISCC systems based on fixed-antenna architectures inherently lack spatial adaptability to cope with the signal degradation and dynamic environmental conditions. Recently, non-fixed flexible antenna architectures, such as fluid antenna system (FAS), movable antenna (MA), and pinching antenna, have garnered significant interest. Among them, intelligent rotatable antenna (IRA) is an emerging technology that offers significant potential to better support the comprehensive services of target sensing, data transmission, and edge computing. This article investigates a novel IRA-enabled ISCC framework to enhance received signal strength, wider coverage, and spatial adaptability to dynamic wireless environments by flexibly adjusting the boresight of directional antennas. Building upon this, we introduce the fundamentals of IRA technology and explore IRA's benefits for improving system performance while providing potential task-oriented applications. Then, we discuss the main design issues and provide solutions for implementing IRA-based ISCC systems. Finally, experimental results are provided to demonstrate the great potential of IRA-enabled ISCC system, thus paving the way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Distributed Simple Binary Hypothesis Testing under Information Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper resolves two open problems from a recent paper, arXiv:2403.16981, concerning the sample complexity of distributed simple binary hypothesis testing under information constraints. The first open problem asks whether interaction reduces the sample complexity of distributed simple binary hypothesis testing. In this paper, we show that sequential interaction does not help. The second problem suggests tightening existing sample complexity bounds for communication-constrained simple binary hypothesis testing. We derive optimally tight bounds for this setting and resolve this problem. Our main technical contributions are: (i) a one-shot lower bound on the Bayes error in simple binary hypothesis testing that satisfies a crucial tensorisation property; (ii) a streamlined proof of the formula for the sample complexity of simple binary hypothesis testing without constraints, first established in arXiv:2403.16981; and (iii) a reverse data-processing inequality for Hellinger-$\lambda$ divergences, generalising the results from arXiv:1812.03031 and arXiv:2206.02765.</description>

      <title>Latency Optimization for Wireless Federated Learning in Multihop Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a novel latency minimization problem in wireless federated learning (FL) across multi-hop networks. The system comprises multiple routes, each integrating leaf and relay nodes for FL model training. We explore a personalized learning and adaptive aggregation-aware FL (PAFL) framework that effectively addresses data heterogeneity across participating nodes by harmonizing individual and collective learning objectives. We formulate an optimization problem aimed at minimizing system latency through the joint optimization of leaf and relay nodes, as well as relay routing indicator. We also incorporate an additional energy harvesting scheme for the relay nodes to help with their relay tasks. This formulation presents a computationally demanding challenge, and thus we develop a simple yet efficient algorithm based on block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results illustrate the efficacy of our proposed joint optimization approach for leaf and relay nodes with relay routing indicator. We observe significant latency savings in the wireless multi-hop PAFL system, with reductions of up to 69.37% compared to schemes optimizing only one node type, traditional greedy algorithm, and scheme without relay routing indicator.</description>

      <title>OSI Stack Redesign for Quantum Networks: Requirements, Technologies, Challenges, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum communication is poised to become a foundational element of next-generation networking, offering transformative capabilities in security, entanglement-based connectivity, and computational offloading. However, the classical OSI model-designed for deterministic and error-tolerant systems-cannot support quantum-specific phenomena such as coherence fragility, probabilistic entanglement, and the no-cloning theorem. This paper provides a comprehensive survey and proposes an architectural redesign of the OSI model for quantum networks in the context of 7G. We introduce a Quantum-Converged OSI stack by extending the classical model with Layer 0 (Quantum Substrate) and Layer 8 (Cognitive Intent), supporting entanglement, teleportation, and semantic orchestration via LLMs and QML. Each layer is redefined to incorporate quantum mechanisms such as enhanced MAC protocols, fidelity-aware routing, and twin-based applications. This survey consolidates over 150 research works from IEEE, ACM, MDPI, arXiv, and Web of Science (2018-2025), classifying them by OSI layer, enabling technologies such as QKD, QEC, PQC, and RIS, and use cases such as satellite QKD, UAV swarms, and quantum IoT. A taxonomy of cross-layer enablers-such as hybrid quantum-classical control, metadata-driven orchestration, and blockchain-integrated quantum trust-is provided, along with simulation tools including NetSquid, QuNetSim, and QuISP. We present several domain-specific applications, including quantum healthcare telemetry, entangled vehicular networks, and satellite mesh overlays. An evaluation framework is proposed based on entropy throughput, coherence latency, and entanglement fidelity. Key future directions include programmable quantum stacks, digital twins, and AI-defined QNet agents, laying the groundwork for a scalable, intelligent, and quantum-compliant OSI framework for 7G and beyond.</description>

Abstract: Alice wishes to reveal the state $X$ to Bob, if he knows some other information $Y$ also known to her. If Bob does not, she wishes to reveal nothing about $X$ at all. When can Alice accomplish this? We provide a simple necessary and sufficient condition on the joint distribution of $X$ and $Y$. Shannon's result on the perfect secrecy of the one-time pad follows as a special case.</description>

      <title>Zero-shot denoising via neural compression: Theoretical and algorithmic framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero-shot denoising aims to denoise observations without access to training samples or clean reference images. This setting is particularly relevant in practical imaging scenarios involving specialized domains such as medical imaging or biology. In this work, we propose the Zero-Shot Neural Compression Denoiser (ZS-NCD), a novel denoising framework based on neural compression. ZS-NCD treats a neural compression network as an untrained model, optimized directly on patches extracted from a single noisy image. The final reconstruction is then obtained by aggregating the outputs of the trained model over overlapping patches. Thanks to the built-in entropy constraints of compression architectures, our method naturally avoids overfitting and does not require manual regularization or early stopping. Through extensive experiments, we show that ZS-NCD achieves state-of-the-art performance among zero-shot denoisers for both Gaussian and Poisson noise, and generalizes well to both natural and non-natural images. Additionally, we provide new finite-sample theoretical results that characterize upper bounds on the achievable reconstruction error of general maximum-likelihood compression-based denoisers. These results further establish the theoretical foundations of compression-based denoising. Our code is available at: github.com/Computational-Imaging-RU/ZS-NCDenoiser.</description>

      <title>DoA Estimation using MUSIC with Range/Doppler Multiplexing for MIMO-OFDM Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sensing emerges as a critical challenge in 6G networks, which require simultaneous communication and target sensing capabilities. State-of-the-art super-resolution techniques for the direction of arrival (DoA) estimation encounter significant performance limitations when the number of targets exceeds antenna array dimensions. This paper introduces a novel sensing parameter estimation algorithm for orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) radar systems. The proposed approach implements a strategic two-stage methodology: first, discriminating targets through delay and Doppler domain filtering to reduce the number of effective targets for super-resolution DoA estimation, and second, introducing a fusion technique to mitigate sidelobe interferences. The algorithm enables robust DoA estimation, particularly in high-density target environments with limited-size antenna arrays. Numerical simulations validate the superior performance of the proposed method compared to conventional DoA estimation approaches.</description>

      <title>Perfect Privacy for Discriminator-Based Byzantine-Resilient Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) shows great promise in large-scale machine learning but introduces new privacy and security challenges. We propose ByITFL and LoByITFL, two novel FL schemes that enhance resilience against Byzantine users while keeping the users' data private from eavesdroppers. To ensure privacy and Byzantine resilience, our schemes build on having a small representative dataset available to the federator and crafting a discriminator function allowing the mitigation of corrupt users' contributions. ByITFL employs Lagrange coded computing and re-randomization, making it the first Byzantine-resilient FL scheme with perfect Information-Theoretic (IT) privacy, though at the cost of a significant communication overhead. LoByITFL, on the other hand, achieves Byzantine resilience and IT privacy at a significantly reduced communication cost, but requires a Trusted Third Party, used only in a one-time initialization phase before training. We provide theoretical guarantees on privacy and Byzantine resilience, along with convergence guarantees and experimental results validating our findings.</description>

      <title>Kelly Bets and Single-Letter Codes: Optimal Information Processing in Natural Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2104.14277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an information-processing investment game, such as the growth of a population of organisms in a changing environment, Kelly betting maximizes the expected log rate of growth. In this paper, we show that Kelly bets are closely related to optimal single-letter codes (i.e., they can achieve the rate-distortion bound with equality). Thus, natural information processing systems with limited computational resources can achieve information-theoretically optimal performance. We show that the rate-distortion tradeoff for an investment game has a simple linear bound, and that the bound is achievable at the point where the corresponding single-letter code is optimal. This interpretation has two interesting consequences. First, we show that increasing the organism's portfolio of potential strategies can lead to optimal performance over a continuous range of channels, even if the strategy portfolio is fixed. Second, we show that increasing an organism's number of phenotypes (i.e., its number of possible behaviours in response to the environment) can lead to higher growth rate, and we give conditions under which this occurs. Examples illustrating the results in simplified biological scenarios are presented.</description>

      <title>Cache-Aided Variable-Length Coding with Perfect Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A cache-aided compression problem with perfect privacy is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits. The server is connected to $K$ users through a shared link, where each user has access to a local cache of size $MF$ bits. In the placement phase, the server fills the users$'$ caches without prior knowledge of their future demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared link. The users and the server have access to a shared secret key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not disclose any information about $X$, i.e., $X$ and $\cal C$ are statistically independent yielding $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$, which corresponds to the perfect privacy constraint; ii. User $i$ is able to decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using its local cache $Z_i$, delivered message $\cal C$, and the shared secret key $W$. Due to the correlation of database with the private attribute, existing codes for cache-aided delivery do not fulfill the perfect privacy constraint. Indeed, in this work, we propose a lossless variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In particular, we use two-part code construction and Functional Representation Lemma. Furthermore, we propose an alternative coding scheme based on the minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results obtained by Functional Representation Lemma.</description>

      <title>On the Degrees of Freedom and Eigenfunctions of Line-of-Sight Holographic MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a line-of-sight communication link between two holographic surfaces (HoloSs), and provide a closed-form expression for the effective degrees of freedom (eDoF), i.e., the number of orthogonal communication modes that can be established between them. The proposed framework can be applied to network deployments beyond the widely studied paraxial setting. This is obtained by partitioning the largest HoloS into sub-HoloSs, and proving that the supports of the Fourier transforms of the kernels of the obtained integral operators are limited and are almost disjoint in the wavenumber domain, provided that the sub-HoloSs are sufficiently small. Using the proposed approach, it is proved that (i) the eDoF correspond to an instance of Landau's second eigenvalue problem; (ii) the eigenvalues polarize asymptotically to multiple values; and (iii) the eDoF depend explicitly on the approximation accuracy according to Kolmogorov's n-width criterion. This result generalizes the analysis in the paraxial setting, in which it is known that the eigenvalues polarize asymptotically to two values. In addition, it is proved that the typical method of analysis utilized in the paraxial setting, which is based on a parabolic approximation of the wavefront in a local coordinates system, is equivalent to a quartic approximation of the wavefront in a general coordinates system. This facilitates the derivation of an explicit formula for the eDoF in terms of key system parameters, including the relative offset between the center-points of the HoloSs, and their relative rotation and tilt. We specialize the framework to canonical network deployments, and provide analytical expressions for the optimal, according to Kolmogorov's n-width criterion, basis functions (communication waveforms) for data encoding and decoding.</description>

      <title>Two-Phase Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted THz Systems with Beam Split</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03015v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication is emerging as a key technology to support ultra-high data rates in future sixth-generation networks. However, the acquisition of accurate channel state information (CSI) in such systems is challenging due to the passive nature of RIS and the hybrid beamforming architecture typically employed in THz systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel low-complexity two-phase channel estimation scheme for RIS-assisted THz systems with beam split effect. In the proposed scheme, we first estimate the full CSI over a small subset of subcarriers, then extract angular information at both the base station and RIS. Subsequently, we recover the full CSI across remaining subcarriers by determining the corresponding spatial directions and angle-excluded coefficients. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance in terms of normalized mean-square error while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to existing algorithms.</description>

Abstract: The deployment of extremely large antenna arrays (ELAAs) and operation at higher frequency bands in wideband extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems introduce significant near-field effects, such as spherical wavefront propagation and spatially non-stationary (SnS) properties. Combined with dual-wideband impacts, these effects fundamentally reshape the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, making existing sparsity-based channel estimation methods inadequate. To address these challenges, this paper revisits the channel estimation problem for wideband XL-MIMO systems, considering dual-wideband effects, spherical wavefront, and SnS properties. By leveraging the spatial-chirp property of near-field array responses, we quantitatively characterize the sparsity patterns of wideband XL-MIMO channels in the angular-delay domain, revealing global block sparsity and local common-delay sparsity. Building on this structured sparsity, we formulate the wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation problem as a multiple measurement vector (MMV)-based Bayesian inference task and propose a novel column-wise hierarchical prior model to effectively capture the sparsity characteristics. To enable efficient channel reconstruction, we develop an MMV-based variational message passing (MMV-VMP) algorithm, tailored to the complex factor graph induced by the hierarchical prior. Simulation results validate the proposed algorithm, demonstrating its convergence and superior performance compared to existing methods, thus establishing its effectiveness in addressing the challenges of wideband XL-MIMO channel estimation under complex near-field conditions.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Approach for Queueing Analysis on Buffer-Aware Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18812v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-latency communication has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its potential of enabling delay-sensitive services in next-generation industrial cyber-physical systems. To achieve target average or maximum delay given random arrivals and time-varying channels, buffer-aware scheduling is expected to play a vital role. Evaluating and optimizing buffer-aware scheduling relies on its queueing analysis, while existing tools are not sufficiently tractable. Particularly, Markov chain and Monte-Carlo based approaches are computationally intensive, while large deviation theory (LDT) and extreme value theory (EVT) fail in providing satisfactory accuracy in the small-queue-length (SQL) regime. To tackle these challenges, a tractable yet accurate queueing analysis is presented by judiciously bridging Markovian analysis for the computationally manageable SQL regime and LDT/EVT for large-queue-length (LQL) regime where approximation error diminishes asymptotically. Specifically, we leverage censored Markov chain augmentation to approximate the original one in the SQL regime, while a piecewise approach is conceived to apply LDT/EVT across various queue-length intervals with different scheduling parameters. Furthermore, we derive closed-form bounds on approximation errors, validating the rigor and accuracy of our approach. As a case study, the approach is applied to analytically analyze a Lyapunov-drift-based cross-layer scheduling for wireless transmissions. Numerical results demonstrate its potential in balancing accuracy and complexity.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of Statistical Data and Information: A Large Deviation Perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combinatorics, probabilities, and measurements are fundamental to understanding information. This work explores how the application of large deviation theory (LDT) in counting phenomena leads to the emergence of various entropy functions, including Shannon's entropy, mutual information, and relative and conditional entropies. In terms of these functions, we reveal an inherent geometrical structure through operations, including contractions, lift, change of basis, and projections. Legendre-Fenchel (LF) transform which is central to both LDT and Gibbs' method of thermodynamics, offers a novel energetic description of data. The manifold of empirical mean values of statistical data ad infinitum has a parametrization using LF conjugates w.r.t. an entropy function; this gives rise to a family of models as a dual space and the additivity known in statistical thermodynamic energetics. This work clearly introduces data into the current information geometry, and includes information projection defined through conditional expectations in Kolmogorov's probability theory.</description>

Abstract: We present a mathematical framework for quantifying energy efficiency in intelligent systems by linking energy consumption to information-processing capacity. We introduce a watts-per-intelligence metric that integrates algorithmic thermodynamic principles of Landauer with computational models of machine intelligence. By formalising the irreversible energy costs of computation, we derive rigorous lower bounds on energy usage of algorithmic intelligent systems and their adaptability. We introduce theorems that constrain the trade offs between intelligence output and energy expenditure. Our results contribute to design principles for energy-efficient intelligent systems.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence of Gaussian Graphical Models Defined on Complete Bipartite Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02384v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces two Gaussian graphical models defined on complete bipartite graphs. We show that the determinants of the precision matrices associated with the models are equal up to scale, where the scale factor only depends on model parameters. In this context, we will introduce a notion of ``equivalence" between the two Gaussian graphical models. This equivalence has two key applications: first, it can significantly reduce the complexity of computing the exact value of the determinant, and second, it enables the derivation of closed-form expressions for the determinants in certain special cases.</description>

      <title>An invitation to the sample complexity of quantum hypothesis testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17868v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum hypothesis testing (QHT) has been traditionally studied from the information-theoretic perspective, wherein one is interested in the optimal decay rate of error probabilities as a function of the number of samples of an unknown state. In this paper, we study the sample complexity of QHT, wherein the goal is to determine the minimum number of samples needed to reach a desired error probability. By making use of the wealth of knowledge that already exists in the literature on QHT, we characterize the sample complexity of binary QHT in the symmetric and asymmetric settings, and we provide bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT. In more detail, we prove that the sample complexity of symmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse error probability and inversely on the negative logarithm of the fidelity. As a counterpart of the quantum Stein's lemma, we also find that the sample complexity of asymmetric binary QHT depends logarithmically on the inverse type II error probability and inversely on the quantum relative entropy, provided that the type II error probability is sufficiently small. We then provide lower and upper bounds on the sample complexity of multiple QHT, with it remaining an intriguing open question to improve these bounds. The final part of our paper outlines and reviews how sample complexity of QHT is relevant to a broad swathe of research areas and can enhance understanding of many fundamental concepts, including quantum algorithms for simulation and search, quantum learning and classification, and foundations of quantum mechanics. As such, we view our paper as an invitation to researchers coming from different communities to study and contribute to the problem of sample complexity of QHT, and we outline a number of open directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Fidelities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16101v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The main contribution of our paper is to introduce a number of multivariate quantum fidelities and show that they satisfy several desirable properties that are natural extensions of those of the Uhlmann and Holevo fidelities. We propose three variants that reduce to the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states: average pairwise $z$-fidelities, the multivariate semi-definite programming (SDP) fidelity, and a multivariate fidelity inspired by an existing secrecy measure. The second one is obtained by extending the SDP formulation of the Uhlmann fidelity to more than two states. All three of these variants satisfy the following properties: (i) reduction to multivariate classical fidelities for commuting states, (ii) the data-processing inequality, (iii) invariance under permutations of the states, (iv) its values are in the interval $[0,1]$; they are faithful, that is, their values are equal to one if and only if all the states are equal, and they satisfy orthogonality, that is their values are equal to zero if and only if the states are mutually orthogonal to each other, (v) direct-sum property, (vi) joint concavity, and (vii) uniform continuity bounds under certain conditions. Furthermore, we establish inequalities relating these different variants, indeed clarifying that all these definitions coincide with the average pairwise fidelity for commuting states. Lastly, we introduce another multivariate fidelity called multivariate log-Euclidean fidelity, which is a quantum generalization of the Matusita multivariate fidelity. We also show that it satisfies most of the desirable properties listed above, it is a function of a multivariate log-Euclidean divergence, and has an operational interpretation in terms of quantum hypothesis testing with an arbitrarily varying null hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A Versatility Measure for Parametric Risk Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19218v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parametric statistical methods play a central role in analyzing risk through its underlying frequency and severity components. Given the wide availability of numerical algorithms and high-speed computers, researchers and practitioners often model these separate (although possibly statistically dependent) random variables by fitting a large number of parametric probability distributions to historical data and then comparing goodness-of-fit statistics. However, this approach is highly susceptible to problems of overfitting because it gives insufficient weight to fundamental considerations of functional simplicity and adaptability. To address this shortcoming, we propose a formal mathematical measure for assessing the versatility of frequency and severity distributions prior to their application. We then illustrate this approach by computing and comparing values of the versatility measure for a variety of probability distributions commonly used in risk analysis.</description>

      <title>Online Optimization for Learning to Communicate over Time-Correlated Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00575v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning techniques have garnered great interest in designing communication systems owing to their capacity in tackling with channel uncertainty. To provide theoretical guarantees for learning-based communication systems, some recent works analyze generalization bounds for devised methods based on the assumption of Independently and Identically Distributed (I.I.D.) channels, a condition rarely met in practical scenarios. In this paper, we drop the I.I.D. channel assumption and study an online optimization problem of learning to communicate over time-correlated channels. To address this issue, we further focus on two specific tasks: optimizing channel decoders for time-correlated fading channels and selecting optimal codebooks for time-correlated additive noise channels. For utilizing temporal dependence of considered channels to better learn communication systems, we develop two online optimization algorithms based on the optimistic online mirror descent framework. Furthermore, we provide theoretical guarantees for proposed algorithms via deriving sub-linear regret bound on the expected error probability of learned systems. Extensive simulation experiments have been conducted to validate that our presented approaches can leverage the channel correlation to achieve a lower average symbol error rate compared to baseline methods, consistent with our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Refining Ky Fan's majorization relation with linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A separable version of Ky Fan's majorization relation is proven for a sum of two operators that are each a tensor product of two positive semi-definite operators. In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</description>

      <title>Strong XOR Lemma for Information Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For any $\{0,1\}$-valued function $f$, its \emph{$n$-folded XOR} is the function $f^{\oplus n}$ where $f^{\oplus n}(X_1, \ldots, X_n) = f(X_1) \oplus \cdots \oplus f(X_n)$. Given a procedure for computing the function $f$, one can apply a ``naive" approach to compute $f^{\oplus n}$ by computing each $f(X_i)$ independently, followed by XORing the outputs. This approach uses $n$ times the resources required for computing $f$.
  In this paper, we prove a strong XOR lemma for \emph{information complexity} in the two-player randomized communication model: if computing $f$ with an error probability of $O(n^{-1})$ requires revealing $I$ bits of information about the players' inputs, then computing $f^{\oplus n}$ with a constant error requires revealing $\Omega(n) \cdot (I - 1 - o_n(1))$ bits of information about the players' inputs. Our result demonstrates that the naive protocol for computing $f^{\oplus n}$ is both information-theoretically optimal and asymptotically tight in error trade-offs.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03101v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.</description>

      <title>Scalable Precise Computation of Shannon Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01160v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantitative information flow analyses (QIF) are a class of techniques for measuring the amount of confidential information leaked by a program to its public outputs. Shannon entropy is an important method to quantify the amount of leakage in QIF. This paper focuses on the programs modeled in Boolean constraints and optimizes the two stages of the Shannon entropy computation to implement a scalable precise tool PSE. In the first stage, we design a knowledge compilation language called \ADDAND that combines Algebraic Decision Diagrams and conjunctive decomposition. \ADDAND avoids enumerating possible outputs of a program and supports tractable entropy computation. In the second stage, we optimize the model counting queries that are used to compute the probabilities of outputs. We compare PSE with the state-of-the-art probabilistic approximately correct tool EntropyEstimation, which was shown to significantly outperform the previous precise tools. The experimental results demonstrate that PSE solved 56 more benchmarks compared to EntropyEstimation in a total of 459. For 98\% of the benchmarks that both PSE and EntropyEstimation solved, PSE is at least $10\times$ as efficient as EntropyEstimation.</description>

      <title>Speeding up Speculative Decoding via Sequential Approximate Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speculative Decoding (SD) is a recently proposed technique for faster inference using Large Language Models (LLMs). SD operates by using a smaller draft LLM for autoregressively generating a sequence of tokens and a larger target LLM for parallel verification to ensure statistical consistency. However, periodic parallel calls to the target LLM for verification prevent SD from achieving even lower latencies. We propose SPRINTER, which utilizes a low-complexity verifier trained to predict if tokens generated from a draft LLM would be accepted by the target LLM. By performing sequential approximate verification, SPRINTER does not require verification by the target LLM and is only invoked when a token is deemed unacceptable. This reduces the number of calls to the larger LLM, achieving further speedups and lower computation cost. We present a theoretical analysis of SPRINTER, examining the statistical properties of the generated tokens, as well as the expected reduction in latency as a function of the verifier. We evaluate SPRINTER on several datasets and model pairs, demonstrating that approximate verification can still maintain high quality generation while further reducing latency.</description>

Abstract: Quick detection of transmittance changes in optical channel is crucial for secure communication. We demonstrate that pre-shared entanglement using two-mode squeezed vacuum states significantly reduces detection latency compared to classical and entanglement-augmented coherent-state probes. The change detection latency is inversely proportional to the quantum relative entropy (QRE), which goes to infinity in the absence of thermal noise, suggesting idealized instantaneous detection. However, in realistic scenarios, we show that QRE scales logarithmically with the inverse of the thermal noise mean photon number. We propose a receiver that achieves this scaling and quantify its performance gains over existing methods. Additionally, we explore the fundamental trade-off between communication capacity and change detection latency, highlighting how pre-shared entanglement enhances both.</description>

      <title>Distribution free M-estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The basic question of delineating those statistical problems that are solvable without making any assumptions on the underlying data distribution has long animated statistics and learning theory. This paper characterizes when a convex M-estimation or stochastic optimization problem is solvable in such an assumption-free setting, providing a precise dividing line between solvable and unsolvable problems. The conditions we identify show, perhaps surprisingly, that Lipschitz continuity of the loss being minimized is not necessary for distribution free minimization, and they are also distinct from classical characterizations of learnability in machine learning.</description>

      <title>A New Representation of Binary Sequences by means of Boolean Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05374v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Boolean functions and binary sequences are main tools used in cryptography. In this work, we introduce a new bijection between the set of Boolean functions and the set of binary sequences with period a power of two. We establish a connection between them which allows us to study some properties of Boolean functions through binary sequences and vice versa. Then, we define a new representation of sequences, based on Boolean functions and derived from the algebraic normal form, named reverse-ANF. Next, we study the relation between such a representation and other representations of Boolean functions as well as between such a representation and the binary sequences. Finally, we analyse the generalized self-shrinking sequences in terms of Boolean functions and some of their properties using the different representations.</description>

      <title>Variational Inference Optimized Using the Curved Geometry of Coupled Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an optimization framework for variational inference based on the coupled free energy, extending variational inference techniques to account for the curved geometry of the coupled exponential family. This family includes important heavy-tailed distributions such as the generalized Pareto and the Student's t. By leveraging the coupled free energy, which is equal to the coupled evidence lower bound (ELBO) of the inverted probabilities, we improve the accuracy and robustness of the learned model. The coupled generalization of Fisher Information metric and the affine connection. The method is applied to the design of a coupled variational autoencoder (CVAE). By using the coupling for both the distributions and cost functions, the reconstruction metric is derived to still be the mean-square average loss with modified constants. The novelty comes from sampling the heavy-tailed latent distribution with its associated coupled probability, which has faster decaying tails. The result is the ability to train a model robust against severe outliers, while assuring that the training process is stable. The Wasserstein-2 or Fr\'echet Inception Distance of the reconstructed CelebA images shows the CVAE has a 3\% improvement over the VAE after 5 epochs of training.</description>

      <title>Receiving RISs: Enabling Channel Estimation and Autonomous Configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10662v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This chapter focuses on a hardware architecture for semi-passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) and investigates its consideration for boosting the performance of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communication systems. The architecture incorporates a single or multiple radio-frequency chains to receive pilot signals via tunable absorption phase profiles realized by the metasurface front end, as well as a controller encompassing a baseband processing unit to carry out channel estimation, and consequently, the optimization of the RIS reflection coefficients. A novel channel estimation protocol, according to which the RIS receives non-orthogonal training pilot sequences from two multi-antenna terminals via tunable absorption phase profiles, and then, estimates the respective channels via its signal processing unit, is presented. The channel estimates are particularly used by the RIS controller to design the capacity-achieving reflection phase configuration of the metasurface front end. The proposed channel estimation algorithm, which is based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM), profits from the RIS random spatial absorption sampling to capture the entire signal space, and exploits the beamspace sparsity and low-rank properties of extremely large MIMO channels, which is particularly relevant for communication systems at the FR3 band and above. Our extensive numerical investigations showcase the superiority of the proposed channel estimation technique over benchmark schemes for various system and RIS hardware configuration parameters, as well as the effectiveness of using channel estimates at the RIS side to dynamically optimize the possibly phase-quantized reflection coefficients of its unit elements.</description>
