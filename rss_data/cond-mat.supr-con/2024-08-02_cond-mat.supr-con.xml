      <title>Topological superconductivity in superconducting chiral topological semimetals with parallel spin-momentum locking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distinguished from conventional band-inversion-induced Weyl semimetals, chiral topological semimetals host helicoid-arc surface states originating from time-reversal invariant momenta of the Brillouin zone. Motivated by the experimental observation of parallel spin-momentum locking in chiral topological semimetals, we find that parallel spin-momentum locking leads to helicoid-arc surface states. We also investigate the potential intrinsic topological phases in a superconducting chiral topological semimetal with $s_\pm$- wave pairing. We find that a first-order time-reversal invariant topological superconductor can host one Majorana cone for closed Fermi surfaces. Interestingly, there are two Majorana cones when the Fermi surfaces become open. In addition, a second-order topological superconductor with chiral Majorana states can be realized in the presence of a mixture of $s\pm$- and $id$-wave pairing. We show that chiral topological semimetals are fascinating platforms for exploring intrinsic unconventional superconductivity and topological superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Signature of point nodal superconductivity in the Dirac semimetal PdTe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent Angle-Resolved Photo-emission Spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 046402 (2023)] on PdTe, a 3D-Dirac semimetal and a superconductor with the transition temperature Tc ~ 4.3 K, have revealed compelling evidence of the presence of bulk nodes in the superconducting order parameter. To investigate the validity of this proposition, here we present a detailed investigation of the magnetic field dependence of the specific heat of PdTe down to temperatures ~ 58 mK. We observed that the low temperature specific heat of PdTe with an externally applied magnetic field exhibits a power-law field dependence, a characteristic of unconventional superconductivity. Furthermore, the zero-field low-temperature electronic specific heat follows a cubic temperature dependence, which is a signature of the presence of bulk point nodes in PdTe. These intriguing observations suggest that PdTe is a rare and fascinating topological material that exhibits both Dirac semimetallic properties and superconductivity with point nodal gap symmetry.</description>

      <title>Superconductive Sodalite-like Clathrate Hydrides MXH$_{12}$ with Critical Temperatures of near 300 K under Pressures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We designed and investigated a series of ternary hydride compounds MXH$_{12}$ crystallizing in the cubic $Pm\overline{3}m$ structure as potential rare-earth and alkaline-earth superconductors. First-principles calculations were performed on these prospective superconductors across the pressure range of 50-200 GPa, revealing their electronic band structures, phonon dispersions, electron-phonon interactions, and superconducting properties. Several compounds were identified as dynamically stable, with ScYbH$_{12}$ and LuYbH$_{12}$ remaining stable at 70 GPa, and ScLuH$_{12}$ at 100 GPa. Notably, Eliashberg theory and electron-phonon coupling calculations predict CaLuH$_{12}$ to exhibit a remarkable $T_{c}$ of up to 294 K at 180 GPa. These findings unveil ternary hydrides as a promising class of high-temperature superconductors and provide insights for achieving superconductivity at lower or ambient pressures through material design and exploration.</description>

      <title>Significant Contributions of the Higgs Mode and Self-Energy Corrections to Low-Frequency Complex Conductivity in DC-Biased Superconducting Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the complex conductivity of superconductors under a DC bias based on the Keldysh-Eilenberger formalism of nonequilibrium superconductivity. This framework allows us to account for the Higgs mode and impurity scattering self-energy corrections, which are known to significantly impact the complex conductivity under a bias DC, especially near the resonance frequency of the Higgs mode. The purpose of this paper is to explore the effects of these contributions on the low-frequency complex conductivity relevant to superconducting device technologies. Our approach enables us to derive the complex conductivity formula for superconductors ranging from clean to dirty limits, applicable to any bias DC strength. Our calculations reveal that the Higgs mode and impurity scattering self-energy corrections significantly affect the complex conductivity even at low frequencies, relevant to superconducting device technologies. Specifically, we find that the real part of the low-frequency complex conductivity exhibits a bias-dependent reduction up to \(\hbar \omega \sim 0.1\), a much higher frequency than previously considered. This finding allows for the suppression of dissipation in devices by tuning the bias DC. Additionally, through the calculation of the imaginary part of the complex conductivity, we evaluate the bias-dependent kinetic inductance for superconductors ranging from clean to dirty limits. The bias dependence becomes stronger as the mean free path decreases. Our dirty-limit results coincide with previous studies based on the so-called slow experiment scenario. This widely used scenario can be understood as a phenomenological implementation of the Higgs mode into the kinetic inductance calculation, now justified by our calculation based on the robust theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity, which microscopically treats the Higgs mode contribution.</description>

      <title>Persistence of small polarons into the superconducting phase of Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipolaronic superconductivity is an exotic pairing mechanism proposed for materials like Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$BiO$_3$ (BKBO); however, conclusive experimental evidence for a (bi)polaron metallic state in this material remains elusive. Here, we combine resonant inelastic x-ray and neutron total scattering techniques with advanced modelling to study the local lattice distortions, electronic structure, and electron-phonon coupling ($e$-ph) in BKBO as a function of doping. Data for the parent compound ($x = 0$) indicates that the electronic gap opens in predominantly oxygen-derived states strongly coupled to a long-range ordered breathing distortion of the oxygen sublattice. Upon doping, short-range breathing distortions and sizable ($e$-ph) coupling persist into the superconducting regime ($x = 0.4$). Comparisons with exact diagonalization and determinant quantum Monte Carlo calculations further support this conclusion. Our results provide compelling evidence that BKBO's metallic phase hosts a liquid of small (bi)polarons derived from local breathing distortions of the lattice, with implications for understanding the low-temperature superconducting instability</description>

      <title>Evidence of electron interaction with an unidentified bosonic mode in superconductor CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kink structure in band dispersion usually refers to a certain electron-boson interaction, which is crucial in understanding the pairing in unconventional superconductors. Here we report the evidence of the observation of a kink structure in Fe-based superconductor CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The kink shows an orbital selective and momentum dependent behavior, which is located at 15 meV below Fermi level along the Gamma-M direction at the band with dxz orbital character and vanishes when approaching the Gamma-X direction, correlated with a slight decrease of the superconducting gap. Most importantly, this kink structure disappears when the superconducting gap closes, indicating that the corresponding bosonic mode (9 meV) is closely related to superconductivity. However, the origin of this mode remains unidentified, since it cannot be related to phonons or the spin resonance mode (15 meV) observed by inelastic neutron scattering. The behavior of this mode is rather unique and challenges our present understanding of the superconducting paring mechanism of the bilayer FeAs-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Flat-band Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov State from Quantum Geometry Discrepancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state, a finite-momentum superconducting pairing state, has been extensively studied from the perspective of mismatched Fermi surfaces of paired electrons. In this work, we propose a distinctive mechanism to realize FFLO states by creating an imbalance in the quantum geometry of paired electrons on an isolated flat band, which we term "Quantum Geometry Discrepancy (QGD)". Based on a flat-band electronic Hamiltonian with continuously tunable quantum metrics for each spin species, we analytically investigate the QGD-induced FFLO instability near the superconducting critical temperature through the band-projection method. To obtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition driven by QGD, we perform numerical calculations using self-consistent mean-field theory, which aligns well with the analytical results. Additionally, we discuss the stability of the flat-band FFLO state when a finite band dispersion is turned on. We point out that QGD serves as a new protocol for stabilizing the FFLO states in flat-band superconductors.</description>

      <title>Bound states in doped charge transfer insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the physics of doping a charge transfer insulator is the most important problem in high-temperature superconductivity. In this work, we show that an in-gap bound state emerges from the localized hole of the doped charge transfer insulator. We propose an approximate ground state wavefunction based on one localized Zhang-Rice singlet and the Neel state. By calculating the excitation states with one hole added and removed from this ground state, we successfully identify the existence of bound states inside the charge transfer gap. This feature is further proved by the MPS-based Lanczos study of a system of $4\times4$ CuO$_2$ unit cells. How these bound states evolve into metallic states is further discussed. Our findings identify the key component of recent STM results on lightly doped Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ and provide a new understanding of hole-doped charge transfer insulators.</description>

      <title>Numerical modeling of SNSPD absorption utilizing optical conductivity with quantum corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors are widely used in various fields of physics and technology, due to their high efficiency and timing precision. Although, in principle, their detection mechanism offers broadband operation, their wavelength range has to be optimized by the optical cavity parameters for a specific task. We present a study of the optical absorption of a superconducting nanowire single photon detector (SNSPD) with an optical cavity. The optical properties of the niobium nitride films, measured by spectroscopic ellipsometry, were modelled using the Drude-Lorentz model with quantum corrections. The numerical simulations of the optical response of the detectors show that the wavelength range of the detector is not solely determined by its geometry, but the optical conductivity of the disordered thin metallic films contributes considerably. This contribution can be conveniently expressed by the ratio of imaginary and real parts of the optical conductivity. This knowledge can be utilized in detector design.</description>

      <title>BCS Stripe Phase in Coupled Bilayer Superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a signature of competing correlations, stripes occur in a variety of strongly correlated systems, such as high temperature superconductors (SCs) and quantum Hall effect. We study a double layer SC in the presence of a parallel magnetic field $B$ within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes framework. We find that for low $B$ the system remains in the ``Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) phase" with a spatially uniform gap, but with increasing $B$, a transition occurs into a phase which contains stripes of the BCS phase separated by regions where the interlayer phase difference rotates by $2\pi$ due to the presence of inter-layer vortices. This stripe phase is predicted to manifest through oscillations in the amplitude of the SC gap and an alternating pattern of supercurrents. We will comment on the relation to previous works based on the Landau-Ginzburg formalism as well as on the possible experimental realization and signature of this phase.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a metallic room-temperature d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism, altermagnetism is a recently discovered unconventional magnetic phase characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split band structures in materials with zero net magnetization. This distinct magnetic phase not only enriches the understanding of fundamental physical concepts but also has profound impacts on condense-matter physics research and practical device applications. Spin-polarized band structures have been recently observed in semiconductors MnTe and MnTe2 with vanishing net magnetization, confirming the existence of this unconventional magnetic order. Metallic altermagnets have unique advantages for exploring novel physical phenomena related to low-energy quasiparticle excitations and for applications in spintronics as electrical conductivity in metals allows the direct manipulation of spin current through electric field. Here, through comprehensive characterization and analysis of the magnetic and electronic structures of KV2Se2O, we have unambiguously demonstrated a metallic room-temperature altermaget with d-wave spin-momentum locking. The highly anisotropic spin-polarized Fermi surfaces and the spin-density-wave order emerging in the altermagnetic phase make it an extraordinary platform for designing high-performance spintronic devices and studying many-body effects coupled with the unconventional magnetism.</description>

      <title>Only-phase Popov action: thermodynamic derivation and superconducting electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a thermodynamic derivation of the only-phase Popov action functional, which is often adopted to study the low-energy effective hydrodynamics of a generic nonrelativistic superfluid. It is shown that the crucial assumption is the use of the saddle point approximation after neglecting the quantum-pressure term. As an application, we analyze charged superfluid (superconductors) coupled to the electromagnetic field at zero temperature. Our only-phase and minimally-coupled theory predicts the decay of the electrostatic field inside a superconductor with a characteristic length much smaller than the London penetration depth of the static magnetic field. This result is confirmed also by a relativistic only-phase Popov action we obtain from the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From lattice-regularized models, devoid of any non-Hermitian (NH) skin effects, here we compute the electrical ($\sigma_{xy}$), thermal ($\kappa_{xy}$), and spin ($\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$) Hall, and the electrical ($G_{xx}$) and thermal ($G^{th}_{xx}$) longitudinal conductivities for appropriate NH planar topological insulators and superconductors related to all five non-trivial Altland-Zirbauer symmetry classes in the Hermitian limits. These models feature real eigenvalues over an extended NH parameter regime, only where the associated topological invariants remain quantized. In this regime, the NH quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators show quantized $\sigma_{xy}$ and $G_{xx}$, respectively, the NH $p+ip$ ($p \pm ip$) pairing shows half-quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ ($G^{th}_{xx}$), while the NH $d+id$ pairing shows quantized $\kappa_{xy}$ and $\sigma^{sp}_{xy}$ in the clean and weak disorder (due to random pointlike charge impurities) regimes. We compute these quantities in experimentally realizable suitable six-terminal setups using the Kwant software package. But, in the strong disorder regime, all these topological responses vanish and with the increasing non-Hermiticity in the system this generic phenomenon occurs at weaker disorder.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We carry out a systematic study of the electronic and magnetic structure of the ambient-pressure bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Employing the hybrid exchange-correlation functional, we show that the exchange-correlation pushes the antibonding $d_{z^2}$ bands below the Fermi level to be fully occupied. The calculated Fermi surfaces and the correlation normalized band structure match well with the experimental findings at ambient pressure. Moreover, the electronic susceptibility calculated for this new band structure features nesting-induced peaks near the wave vector $Q=(\pi/2, \pi/2)$, suggesting a possible density wave instability in agreement with recent experiments. Through a mean field study and DFT+U calculation, we confirm the spin-charge intertwined double stripe order is the magnetic ground state. Our results provide a faithful description for the low-pressure La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure.</description>

      <title>Eliashberg theory for dynamical screening in bilayer exciton condensation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the effect of dynamical screening of interactions on the transition temperatures ($T_c$) of exciton condensation in a symmetric bilayer of quadratically dispersing electrons and holes by solving the linearized Eliashberg equations for the anomalous interlayer Green's functions. We find that $T_c$ is finite for the range of density and layer separations studied, decaying exponentially with interlayer separation. $T_c$ is suppressed well below that predicted by a Hartree Fock mean field theory with unscreened Coulomb interaction, but is above the estimates from the statically screened Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, using a diagrammatic framework, we show that the system is always an exciton condensate at zero temperature but $T_c$ is exponentially small for large interlayer separation.</description>

Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (2d-YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the 2d-YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon et al. (arXiv:2205.04030). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <title>Mean Field Study of Superconductivity in the Square Lattice $t$-$J$ Model with Three-Site Hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It remains an open question whether the two-dimensional single-band pure Hubbard model and its related pure $t$-$J$ model truly capture the superconducting order in cuprates. Recent numerical studies on this issue have raised a notable disparity in superconducting order between the pure Hubbard model and the pure $t$-$J$ model. Inspired by these, we investigate the role of the three-site hopping term in $d$-wave superconductivity, such a term is usually neglected in the effective Hamiltonian of the Hubbard model, though its amplitude is of the same order as the superexchange coupling $J$ in the $t$-$J$ model. Our slave-boson mean-field solution demonstrates the suppression of $d$-wave superconducting order by incorporating the three-site hopping term, consistent with numerical observations by the density matrix renormalization group. This suppression could be understood as a result of competition between superexchange interaction and three-site hopping, the former favors $d$-wave pairing while the latter favors $s$-wave pairing. We also discussed its role in quasiparticle dispersion and boson-condensation temperature. Our findings may offer an alternative understanding of the recent numerical contrasting findings in the strong coupling regime: the absent or weak superconductivity in the pure Hubbard model, while the robust superconductivity in the $t$-$J$ model without including the three-site hopping term.</description>
