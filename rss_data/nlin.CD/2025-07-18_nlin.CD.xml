      <title>Unsupervised Techniques to Detect Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional spectral probes of quantum chaos require eigenvalues, and sometimes, eigenvectors of the quantum Hamiltonian. This involves computationally expensive diagonalization procedures. We test whether an unsupervised neural network can detect quantum chaos directly from the Hamiltonian matrix. We use a single-body Hamiltonian with an underlying random graph structure and random coupling constants, with a parameter that determines the randomness of the graph. The spectral analysis shows that increasing the amount of randomness in the underlying graph results in a transition from integrable spectral statistics to chaotic ones. We show that the same transition can be detected via unsupervised neural networks, or more specifically, Self-Organizing Maps by feeding the Hamiltonian matrix directly into the neural network, without any diagonalization procedure.</description>

      <title>Equalized Hyperspin Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reliable simulation of spin models is of critical importance to tackle complex optimization problems that are intractable on conventional computing machines. The recently introduced hyperspin machine, which is a network of linearly and nonlinearly coupled parametric oscillators, provides a versatile simulator of general classical vector spin models in arbitrary dimension, finding the minimum of the simulated spin Hamiltonian and implementing novel annealing algorithms. In the hyperspin machine, oscillators evolve in time minimizing a cost function that must resemble the desired spin Hamiltonian in order for the system to reliably simulate the target spin model. This condition is met if the hyperspin amplitudes are equal in the steady state. Currently, no mechanism to enforce equal amplitudes exists. Here, we bridge this gap and introduce a method to simulate the hyperspin machine with equalized amplitudes in the steady state. We employ an additional network of oscillators (named equalizers) that connect to the hyperspin machine via an antisymmetric nonlinear coupling and equalize the hyperspin amplitudes. We demonstrate the performance of such an equalized hyperspin machine by large-scale numerical simulations up to $10000$ hyperspins. Compared to the hyperspin machine without equalization, we find that the equalized hyperspin machine (i) Reaches orders of magnitude lower spin energy, and (ii) Its performance is significantly less sensitive to the system parameters. The equalized hyperspin machine offers a competitive spin Hamiltonian minimizer and opens the possibility to combine amplitude equalization with complex annealing protocols to further boost the performance of spin machines.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of stochastic resonance and stochastic chaos in Mackey-Glass equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the dynamics of the Mackey-Glass equation in the presence of noise. In the weak nonlinearity region, stochastic resonance (SR) is observed as switching dynamics between two quasi-stationary states based on deterministic attractors. In the strong nonlinearity region, we newly discover chaotic SR with multiple positive Lyapunov exponents. Unlike the SR observed in the weak nonlinearity region, the resonance point precedes the zero-crossing point of the largest Lyapunov exponent, resulting in the coexistence of SR and stochastic chaos. A precise theoretical estimation of resonant periods in the weak and strong nonlinearity regions is also provided based on a linear mode analysis of the unstable spiral at the origin.</description>

      <title>Entanglement properties of photon-magnon crystal from nonlinear perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09074v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantifying the entanglement between two continuous bosonic modes, such as magnons and photons, is not trivial. The logarithmic negativity, calculated through the quantum Langevin equations is subjected to thermal noise. However this method requires further approximation. The phase space of a generic nonlinear system contains topologically different regions, and the steady state may correspond to the different types of fixed points, such as Saddle Points, Stable or unstable Spirals, and Nodes. In the present work, we propose a new procedure. Namely, we derived the complete set of nonlinear equations, which includes equations for the magnon and photon number operators and phases. We show that not only number operators but also phases are important for exploring the character of the fixed point, and magnon-photon entanglement. We showed that methods of the qualitative theory of nonlinear differential equations are also relevant for photon-magnon entanglement problems. Our main finding is that entanglement is not defined in the Saddle Point region. On the other hand, the maximum of the entanglement corresponds to the region near the border between the Stable node and Stable spiral regions. Our approach is quite general. However, we did calculations for a particular system: photon-magnon crystal based on the yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film with the periodic air holes drilled in the film. Our interest focuses on magnons with a particular wavelength and frequency corresponding to the magnon condensate. Those magnons couple strongly with the photons of similar frequency. We discuss in detail the interaction between magnons and photons originating from the magneto-electric coupling and the effective Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We show that this interaction is responsible for the robust photon-magnon entanglement in the system.</description>

      <title>Chaos in a Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nos\'e-Hoover Cell Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nos\'e-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners  at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, grows nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy and follows a superquadratic power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, deviating from linear-response theory. The approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension reveals a fractal attractor that concentrates as $|T_x - T_y|$ increases. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.</description>
