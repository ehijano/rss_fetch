      <title>Asymptotic limit of cumulants and higher order free cumulants of complex Wigner matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the fluctuation moments $\alpha_{m_1,\dots,m_r}$ of a Complex Wigner Matrix $X_N$ given by the limit $\lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}N^{r-2}k_r(Tr(X_N^{m_1}),\dots,Tr(X_N^{m_r}))$. We prove the limit exists and characterize the leading order via planar graphs that result to be trees. We prove these graphs can be counted by the set of non-crossing partitioned permutations which permit us to express the moments $\alpha_{m_1,\dots,m_r}$ in terms of simpler quantities $\overline{\kappa}_{m_1,\dots,m_r}$ which we call the pseudo-cumulants. We prove the pseudo-cumulants coincide with the higher order free cumulants up to $r=4$ which permit us to find the higher order free cumulants $\kappa_{m_1,\dots,m_r}$ associated to the moment sequence $\alpha_{m_1,\dots,m_r}$ up to order 4.</description>

      <title>Mixed Poisson families with real-valued mixing distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mixed Poisson distributions provide a flexible approach to the analysis of count data with overdispersion, zero inflation, or heavy tails. Since the Poisson mean must be nonnegative, the mixing distribution is typically assumed to have nonnegative support. We show this assumption is unnecessary and real-valued mixing distributions are also possible. Informally, the mixing distribution merely needs to have a light (subexponential) left tail and a small amount of probability mass on negative values. We provide several concrete examples, including the mixed Poisson-extreme stable family, where the mixing distribution has a power law tail.</description>

      <title>Mean-reflected $G$-BSDEs with multi-variate constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the multi-dimensional reflected backward stochastic differential equation driven by $G$-Brownian motion ($G$-BSDE) with a multi-variate constraint on the $G$-expectation of its solution. The generators are diagonally dependent on $Z$ and on all $Y$-components. We obtain the existence and uniqueness result via a fixed-point argumentation.</description>

      <title>$G$-BSDEs with mean constraints in time-dependent intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a collection of mean-reflected backward stochastic differential equations driven by $G$-Brownian motions ($G$-BSDEs), where $G$-expectations are constrained in some time-dependent intervals. To establish well-posedness results, we firstly construct a backward Skorokhod problem with sublinear expectation, and then apply that in the study of doubly mean-reflected $G$-BSDEs involving Lipschitz and quadratic generators under bounded and unbounded terminal conditions. Also we utilize fixed-point argumentations and $\theta$-methods while solving these equations. Finally, we extend the results to multi-dimensional doubly mean-reflected $G$-BSDEs with diagonal generators.</description>

      <title>Stochastic heat equations driven by space-time $G$-white noise under sublinear expectation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the stochastic heat equation driven by a multiplicative space-time $G$-white noise within the framework of sublinear expectations. The existence and uniqueness of the mild solution are proved. By generalizing the stochastic Fubini theorem under sublinear expectations, we demonstrate that the mild solution also qualifies as a weak solution. Additionally, we derive moment estimates for the solutions.</description>

      <title>Disjoint finite geodesics in first-passage percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate first-passage percolation on the lattice $\Z^d$ for dimensions $d \geq 2$. Each edge $e$ of the graph is assigned an independent copy of a non-negative random variable $\tau$. We only assume $\P[\tau=0]0$ is explicit) for the probability of having two disjoint geodesics between two pairs of neighbouring vertices at distance $n$. Additionally, under more specific assumptions on the distribution of $\tau$, we obtain similar lower bounds for the probability of having two disjoint geodesics (except for their starting and ending points) between the same two vertices.</description>

      <title>Reflected backward stochastic differential equations with rough drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study reflected backward stochastic differential equations driven by rough paths (rough RBSDEs), which can be understood as a probabilistic representation of nonlinear rough partial differential equations (rough PDEs) or stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) with obstacles. The well-posedness in the sense of \cite{DF} is proved via a variant of Doss-Sussman transformation. Moreover, we show that our rough RBSDEs can be approximated by a sequence of penalized BSDEs with rough drivers. As applications, firstly we provide the equivalence between rough RBSDEs and the obstacle problem of rough PDEs. Secondly, we show the solution of rough RBSDE solves the corresponding optimal stopping problem.</description>

      <title>An operator theory approach to the evanescent part of a two-parametric weak-stationary stochastic process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new approach to the evanescent part of a two-dimensional weak-stationary stochastic process with the past given by a half-plane is proceed. The classical result due to Helson and Lowdenslager divides a two-parametric weak-stationary stochastic process into three parts. In this paper we describe the most untouchable one - the evanescent part. Moreover, we point out how this part depends on the shape of the past.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the decay in particle intensities for a translation invariant two species system of diffusing and reacting particles on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for $d \geq 3$. The intensities are shown to approximately solve modified rate equations, from which their polynomial decay can be deduced. The system illustrates that the underlying diffusion and reaction rates can influence the exact polynomial decay rates, despite the system evolving in a supercritical dimension.</description>

      <title>A New Compound Poisson Process and Its Fractional Versions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a weighted sum of a series of independent Poisson random variables and show that it results in a new compound Poisson distribution which includes the Poisson distribution and Poisson distribution of order k. An explicit representation for its distribution is obtained in terms of Bell polynomials. We then extend it to a compound Poisson process and time fractional compound Poisson process (TFCPP). It is shown that the one-dimensional distributions of the TFCPP exhibit over-dispersion property, are not infinitely divisible and possess the long-range dependence property. Also, their moments and factorial moments are derived. Finally, the fractional differential equation associated with the TFCPP is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Bad local minima exist in the stochastic block model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the disassortative stochastic block model with three communities, a well-studied model of graph partitioning and Bayesian inference for which detailed predictions based on the cavity method exist [Decelle et al. (2011)]. We provide strong evidence that for a part of the phase where efficient algorithms exist that approximately reconstruct the communities, inference based on maximum a posteriori (MAP) fails. In other words, we show that there exist modes of the posterior distribution that have a vanishing agreement with the ground truth. The proof is based on the analysis of a graph colouring algorithm from [Achlioptas and Moore (2003)].</description>

      <title>On the Eldan-Gross inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A recent discovery of Eldan and Gross states that there exists a universal $C&gt;0$ such that for all Boolean functions $f:\{-1,1\}^n\to \{-1,1\}$,
  $$
  \int_{\{-1,1\}^n}\sqrt{s_f(x)}d\mu(x) \ge C\text{Var}(f)\sqrt{\log \left(1+\frac{1}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}\text{Inf}_j(f)^2}\right)}
  $$
  where $s_f(x)$ is the sensitivity of $f$ at $x$, $\text{Var}(f)$ is the variance of $f$, $\text{Inf}_j(f)$ is the influence of $f$ along the $j$-th variable, and $\mu$ is the uniform probability measure. In this note, we give an alternative proof that applies to biased discrete hypercube, and spaces having positive Ricci curvature lower bounds in the sense of Bakry and \'Emery.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian structure of the eigenvector overlap for the symplectic Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we consider the Lagrangian properties of a random version of the Arnold-Beltrami-Childress (ABC) in a three-dimensional periodic box. We prove that the associated flow map possesses a positive top Lyapunov exponent and its associated one-point, two-point and projective Markov chains are geometrically ergodic. For a passive scalar, it follows that such a velocity is a space-time smooth exponentially mixing field, uniformly in the diffusivity coefficient. For a passive vector, it provides an example of a universal ideal (i.e. non-diffusive) kinematic dynamo.</description>

      <title>$(P,Q)$ complex hypercontractivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18053v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\xi$ be the standard normal random vector in $\mathbb{R}^{k}$. Under some mild growth and smoothness assumptions on any increasing $P, Q : [0, \infty) \mapsto [0, \infty)$ we show $(P,Q)$ complex hypercontractivity $$ Q^{-1}(\mathbb{E} Q(|T_{z}f(\xi)|))\leq P^{-1}(\mathbb{E}P(|f(\xi)|)) $$ holds for all polynomials $f:\mathbb{R}^{k} \mapsto \mathbb{C}$, where $T_{z}$ is the hermite semigroup at complex parameter $z, |z|\leq 1$, if and only if \begin{align*} \left|\frac{tP''(t)}{P'(t)}-z^{2}\frac{tQ''(t)}{Q'(t)}+z^{2}-1\right|\leq \frac{tP''(t)}{P'(t)}-|z|^{2}\frac{tQ''(t)}{Q'(t)}+1-|z|^{2} \end{align*} holds for all $t&gt;0$ provided that $F''&gt;0$, and $F'/F''$ is concave, where $F = Q\circ P^{-1}$. This extends Hariya's result from real to complex parameter $z$. Several old and new applications are presented for different choices of $P$ and $Q$. The proof uses heat semigroup arguments, where we find a certain map $C(s)$, which interpolates the inequality at the endpoints. The map $C(s)$ itself is composed of four heat flows running together at different times.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.05282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper concerns classical solution of path-dependent partial differential equations (PPDEs) with coefficients depending on both variables of path and path-valued measure, which are crucial to understanding large-scale mean-field interacting systems in a non-Markovian setting. We construct classical solutions of the PPDEs via solution of the forward and backward stochastic differential equations. To accommodate the intricacies introduced by the appearance of the path in the coefficients, we develop a novel technique known as the ``parameter frozen'' approach to the PPDEs.</description>

      <title>Strong solution of stochastic differential equations with discontinuous and unbounded coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study the existence and uniqueness of the strong solution of following d dimensional stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by Brownian motion: dX(t)=b(t,X(t))dt+a(t,X(t))dB(t), X(0)= x, where B is a d-dimensional standard Brownian motion; the diffusion coefficient a is a Holder continuous and uniformly non-degenerate matrix-valued function and the drift coefficient b may be discontinuous and unbounded, not necessarily in Sobolev space, extending the previous works to discontinuous and unbounded drift coefficient situation. The idea is to combine the Zvonkin transformation with the Lyapunov function approach. To this end, we need to establish a local version of the connection between the solutions of the SDE up to the exit time of a bounded connected open set D and the associated partial differential equation on this domain. As an interesting byproduct, we establish a localized version of the Krylov estimates (Theorem 4.1) and a localized version of the stability result of the stochastic differential equations of discontinuous coefficients (Theorem 4.5).</description>

      <title>Mean-field limit of particle systems with absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.10742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider one-dimensional particles interacting in mean-field type through a bounded kernel. In addition, when particles hit some barrier (say zero), they are removed from the system. This absorption of particles is instantaneously felt by the others, as, contrary to the usual mean-field setting, particles interact only with other non-absorbed particles. This makes the interaction singular as it happens through hitting times of the given barrier. In addition, the diffusion coefficient of each particle is non uniformly elliptic. We show that the particle system admits a weak solution. Through Partial Girsanov transforms we are able to relate our particles with independent stopped Brownian motions, and prove tightness and convergence to a mean-fied limit stochastic differential equation when the number of particles tends to infinity. Further, we study the limit and establish the existence and uniqueness of the classical solution to the corresponding nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation under some continuity assumption on the interacting kernel. This yields the strong well-posedness of the mean-field limit SDE and confirms that our convergence result is indeed a propagation of chaos result.</description>

      <title>Optimal parameter estimation for linear SPDEs from multiple measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The coefficients in a second order parabolic linear stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) are estimated from multiple spatially localised measurements. Assuming that the spatial resolution tends to zero and the number of measurements is non-decreasing, the rate of convergence for each coefficient depends on its differential order and is faster for higher order coefficients. Based on an explicit analysis of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space of a general stochastic evolution equation, a Gaussian lower bound scheme is introduced. As a result, minimax optimality of the rates as well as sufficient and necessary conditions for consistent estimation are established.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Filtering of Reaction Networks Partially Observed in Time Snapshots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction network models arise in intracellular chemical reactions, epidemiological models and other population process models, and are a class of continuous time Markov chains which have the nonnegative integer lattice as state space. We consider the problem of estimating the conditional probability distribution of a stochastic reaction network given exact partial state observations in time snapshots. We propose a particle filtering method called the targeting method. Our approach takes into account that the reaction counts in between two observation snapshots satisfy linear constraints and also uses inhomogeneous Poisson processes as proposals for the reaction counts to facilitate exact interpolation. We provide rigorous analysis as well as numerical examples to illustrate our method and compare it with other alternatives.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness of the energy-critical stochastic nonlinear wave equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.14946v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for the defocusing energy-critical stochastic nonlinear wave equations (SNLW) with an additive stochastic forcing on $\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and $\mathbb{T}^{d}$ with $d \geq 3$. By adapting the probabilistic perturbation argument employed in the context of the random data Cauchy theory by B\'enyi-Oh-Pocovnicu (2015) and Pocovnicu (2017) and in the context of stochastic PDEs by Oh-Okamoto (2020), we prove global well-posedness of the defocusing energy-critical SNLW. In particular, on $\mathbb{T}^d$, we prove global well-posedness with the stochastic forcing below the energy space.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the design space of diffusion-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most existing theoretical investigations of the accuracy of diffusion models, albeit significant, assume the score function has been approximated to a certain accuracy, and then use this a priori bound to control the error of generation. This article instead provides a first quantitative understanding of the whole generation process, i.e., both training and sampling. More precisely, it conducts a non-asymptotic convergence analysis of denoising score matching under gradient descent. In addition, a refined sampling error analysis for variance exploding models is also provided. The combination of these two results yields a full error analysis, which elucidates (again, but this time theoretically) how to design the training and sampling processes for effective generation. For instance, our theory implies a preference toward noise distribution and loss weighting in training that qualitatively agree with the ones used in [Karras et al. 2022]. It also provides perspectives on the choices of time and variance schedules in sampling: when the score is well trained, the design in [Song et al. 2020] is more preferable, but when it is less trained, the design in [Karras et al. 2022] becomes more preferable.</description>

      <title>The Analytic Stockwell Transform and its Zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent original line of research in time--frequency analysis has shifted the interest in energy maxima toward zeros. Initially motivated by the intriguing uniform spread of the zeros of the spectrogram of white noise, it has led to fruitful theoretical developments combining probability theory, complex analysis and signal processing. In this vein, the present work proposes a characterization of the zeros of the Stockwell Transform of white noise, which consists in an hybrid time--frequency multiresolution representation. First of all, an analytic version of the Stockwell Transform is designed. Then, analyticity is leveraged to establish a connection with the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function, whose zero set is invariant under the isometries of the Poincar\'e disk. Finally, the theoretical spatial statistics of the zeros of the hyperbolic Gaussian Analytic Function and the empirical statistics of the zeros the Analytic Stockwell Transform of white noise are compared through intensive Monte Carlo simulations, supporting the established connection. A publicly available documented Python toolbox accompanies this work.</description>
