      <title>Ions-electrons-states for the two-component Vlasov-Poisson equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish both local and global bifurcation results for traveling periodic solutions of the one-dimensional two-species Vlasov-Poisson equation. These solutions consist of strip-like regions of ions and electrons in phase space that propagate coherently and emerge from spatially homogeneous, velocity-dependent equilibrium layers. Depending on the geometry of the underlying equilibrium and on the selected Fourier mode, the bifurcation diagram exhibits either two or four solution branches. In all cases, the bifurcation is of pitchfork type; in symmetric configurations, the local structure near the equilibrium has a hyperbolic geometry. We further show that these locally constructed branches extend globally. This work extends the previous study by the same author of the purely electronic case, where the ions were modeled as an immobile neutralizing background. Allowing both species to evolve dynamically leads to a more intricate, higher-dimensional analysis. Finally, by means of an affine change of variables, we reveal a connection with the one-dimensional two-component Euler-Poisson system, which in turn enables the construction of traveling periodic waves of both small and large amplitude for that model as well.</description>

      <title>A strong unique continuation result for the Baouendi operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a strong unique continuation property for the subelliptic Baouendi operator under the presence of zero-order perturbations satisfying an almost Hardy-type growth condition. In particular, the admissible class includes both $L^\infty_{\mathrm{loc}}$ and singular potentials. We prove that any solution vanishing to infinite order at a point of the degeneracy manifold of the operator must be identically zero. The result holds extends to variable-coefficient operators with intrinsic Lipschitz regularity. A notable feature of the proof is that it relies exclusively on $L^2$ Carleman estimates combined with the classical Hardy inequality.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic effects on critical regularity and long-time behavior of viscous compressible fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the compressible Navier-Stokes-Poisson equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d\geq2$), a classical model for barotropic compressible flows coupled with a self-consistent electrostatic potential. We show that the electrostatic coupling has a significant impact on the long-time dynamics of solutions due to its underlying Klein-Gordon structure. As a first result, we prove the global well-posedness of the Cauchy problem with initial data near equilibrium in the full-frequency $L^{p}$-type critical Besov space \emph{without relying on hyperbolic symmetrization}. Compared with the Poisson-free case studied in several milestone works [Charve and Danchin, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 198 (2010), 233-271; Chen, Miao and Zhang, Commun. Pure Appl. Math., 63 (2010), 1173-1224; Haspot, Arch. Rational Mech. Anal., 202 (2011), 427-460], we remove the extra $L^{2}$ assumption in low frequencies and extend the admissible choice of $p$ to the sharp range $1\leq p&lt;2d$. This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first result in compressible fluids that allows the initial velocity field to be highly oscillatory across all frequencies.
  Furthermore, stemming from the Poisson coupling, the density and velocity exhibit distinct low-frequency behaviors. Motivated by this feature, we propose a general $L^p$-type low-frequency assumption and establish the optimal convergence rates of global solutions toward equilibrium. For a broad class of indices, this assumption yields faster decay than those obtained under the classical $L^1$ framework. To this end, we develop a time-weighted energy method, which is of interest and enables us to capture maximal decay estimates without additional smallness of initial data.</description>

      <title>Principal spectral theory and asymptotic analysis for time-periodic cooperative systems with temporally nonlocal dispersal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the principal spectral theory and the asymptotic behavior of the principal spectrum point for a class of time-periodic cooperative systems with nonlocal dispersal operators, incorporating both coupled and uncoupled nonlocal terms. By applying the theory of resolvent positive operators and their perturbations, we first establish criteria for the existence of the principal eigenvalue. We then construct sequences of smooth upper and lower approximating matrix-valued functions, each of whose corresponding operators satisfies the principal eigenvalue existence condition. This approximation framework allows the principal spectrum point to effectively substitute for the principal eigenvalue in characterizing the global dynamics of the nonlinear system. Moreover, it facilitates the study of the asymptotic behavior of the principal spectrum point with respect to parameters under fairly general assumptions. Subsequently, for systems with both coupled and uncoupled nonlocal terms, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the principal spectrum point in terms of the dispersal rate, dispersal range, and frequency. Finally, we illustrate the applicability of our theoretical results through a Zika virus model and a stem cell model.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of nonlocal equations in randomly evolving media. Diffusion approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper deals with homogenization and higher order approximations of solutions to nonlocal evolution equations of convolution type whose coefficients are periodic in the spatial variables and random stationary in time. We assume that the convolution kernel has finite moments up to order three. Under proper mixing assumptions, we study the limit behavior of the normalized difference between solutions of the original and the homogenized problems and show that this difference converges to the solution of a linear stochastic partial differential equation.</description>

      <title>Differential Complexes in Time-Periodic Gelfand-Shilov Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09646v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the global solvability of a class of differential complexes on the product manifold $\mathbb{T}^m \times \mathbb{R}^n$ associated with systems of evolution operators of the form $L_r = \partial_{t_r} + ia_r(t)P(x,D_x), r=1,\ldots,m,$ where the coefficients $a_r$ are real-valued Gevrey functions on the torus and $P(x,D_x)$ is a globally elliptic normal differential operator on $\mathbb{R}^n$. Within the framework of time-periodic Gelfand--Shilov spaces, we introduce a natural differential complex generated by these operators and investigate its solvability in both functional and ultradistributional settings. We provide a complete characterization of global solvability in terms of a Diophantine condition involving the constant part of the associated $1$-form and the spectrum of $P$. We also analyze global hypoellipticity of the complex. These results extend previous works on scalar operators and constant coefficient systems to the setting of differential complexes with time-dependent real coefficients.</description>

      <title>A Lions' type formula for some reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces of fractional harmonic functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In \cite{Lions}, J. L. Lions considered a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) of harmonic functions on a regular domain with Sobolev traces and obtained a formula that expresses the kernel of this space as an integral on the boundary of some derivatives of the Green function associated with the Laplace operator and the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. This result was simplified and extended later by Englis, Lukkassen, Peetre, and Persson in \cite{ELPL} to more general elliptic systems of even orders. In particular, they emphasized that the resemblance between Lions' type formula and the Hadamard variational formula only appears when the operator is of order $2$. In this paper, we investigate some RKHS of $a$-harmonic functions, where $a$ in $(0,1)$ refers to a fractional exponent of the Laplace operator. For such fractional order pseudo-differential operators, the local nonhomogeneous Dirichlet problem can be addressed by means of some $a$-transmission Sobolev spaces, which were introduced by H\"ormander in the sixties and recently developed by Grubb in a series of papers. We deduce from these works a fractional Poisson formula, which is applied to obtain a Lions' type formula. We observe, in particular, that despite the order of the operator not being $2$, this formula resembles the Hadamard variational formula that we prove in the companion paper \cite{sidy-franck_1}. As a complementary remark, we observe that for a family of RKHS associated with the steady Stokes system, a second order system, there is also a Lions' type formula for their two-point kernels, which turn out not to be similar to the corresponding Hadamard variation formula.</description>

      <title>Static class-guided selection of elementary solutions in non-monotone vanishing discount problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a generalized vanishing discount problem for Hamilton--Jacobi equations, removing the standard monotonicity assumption, either in a global sense or when integrated against all Mather measures. Specifically, we consider \[ \lambda a(x)u(x)+H(x,Du(x))-A\lambda=c_0, \] with a suitably chosen constant $A&gt;0$. By appropriately changing the signs of the function $a(x)$ on different static classes associated with $H$, we show that the maximal viscosity solution converges uniformly as $\lambda\to 0^+$ and that all elementary solutions of the stationary equation \[ H(x,Du(x))=c_0 \] can be selected as limits. This provides the first result for selecting multiple viscosity solutions in vanishing discount problems beyond the usual monotonicity and integral assumptions, as long as $a(x)$ is positive on one static class. Our results highlight the crucial role of static classes in controlling the asymptotic behavior of viscosity solutions. Previously, under usual monotonicity assumptions, only a single solution could be selected (as discussed in \cite{GL}), whereas our approach allows controlled selection of multiple solutions via static class-guided discount coefficients.</description>

      <title>One-Sided and Parabolic BLO Spaces with Time Lag and Their Applications to Muckenhoupt $A_1$ Weights and Doubly Nonlinear Parabolic Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we first introduce the one-sided BLO space $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ and characterize it, respectively, in terms of the one-sided Muckenhoupt class $A_1^+(\mathbb{R})$ and the one-sided John--Nirenberg inequality. Using these, we establish the Coifman--Rochberg type decomposition of $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions and show that $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ is independent of the distance between the two intervals, which further induces the characterization of this space in terms of the one-sided BMO space $\mathrm{BMO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ (the Bennett type lemma). As applications, we prove that any $\mathrm{BMO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ function can split into the sum of two $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions and we provide an explicit description of the distance from $\mathrm{BLO}^+(\mathbb{R})$ functions to $L^\infty(\mathbb{R})$. Finally, as a higher-dimensional analogue we introduce the parabolic BLO space $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ with time lag, and we extend all the above one-dimensional results to $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$; furthermore, as applications, we not only establish the relationships between $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ and the solutions of doubly nonlinear parabolic equations, but also provide a necessary condition for the negative logarithm of the parabolic distance function to belong to $\mathrm{PBLO}_\gamma^-(\mathbb{R}^{n+1})$ in terms of the weak porosity of the set.</description>

      <title>Phase Transition With Rapini-Papoular Surface Anchoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the dynamical (in)stability of nematic liquid crystals in the presence of external magnetic fields and Rapini-Papoular surface potential. The P-HAN transition is investigated using a simplified 3D Ericksen-Leslie system. We find the thickness threshold of the P-HAN transition. If the thickness of the nematic layer exceeds this threshold, there is a global-in-time suitable weak solution converging exponentially to a nontrivial equilibrium state as time tends to infinity. If the thickness is no more than the threshold, the global-in-time suitable weak solution has a trivial long-time asymptotic limit. Our results rigorously justify the P-HAN transition discussed in the physics literature.</description>

      <title>The $N$-dimensional gravity driven Muskat problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Muskat problem, which describes the motion of two immiscible, incompressible fluids in a homogeneous porous medium occupying the full space ${\mathbb{R}^{N+1}}$, $N \geq 2$, driven by gravity. The interface between the fluids is given as graph of a function over $\mathbb{R}^N$. The problem is reformulated as a nonlinear, nonlocal evolution problem for this function, involving singular integrals arising from potential representations of the velocity and pressure fields. Using results from harmonic analysis, we demonstrate that the evolution is of parabolic type in the open set identified by the Rayleigh-Taylor condition. We use the abstract theory of such problems to establish that the Muskat problem defines a semiflow on this set in all subcritical Sobolev spaces $H^s(\mathbb{R}^N)$, $s&gt;s_c$, where ${s_c=1+N/2}$ is the critical exponent. We additionally obtain parabolic smoothing up to ${\rm C}^\infty$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the motion of a viscous incompressible fluid filling a 3D exterior domain $\Omega$ subject to the Navier slip-with-friction boundary condition as well as outflow at infinity. For the Oseen system as the linearization, we discuss the resolvent set under a certain relationship among the geometry of the boundary $\partial\Omega$, friction coefficient $\alpha(x)$ and the outflow $u_\infty$. We then study the regularity of the resolvent near the origin in the complex plane to develop $L^q$-$L^r$ decay estimates of the Oseen semigroup provided that $\alpha(x)+u_\infty\cdot\nu(x)/2\geq 0$ for every $x\in\partial\Omega$, where $\nu(x)$ stands for the outward unit normal to the boundary $\partial\Omega$.</description>

      <title>Convergence to pushed fronts and the behavior of level sets in monostable reaction-diffusion equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of solutions of a monostable reaction-diffusion equation $u_t=\Delta_x u +u_{yy} +f(u)$ ($x \in \mathbb{R}^{n-1}$, $y \in \mathbb{R}$, $t&gt;0$), with the unstable equilibrium point $0$ and the stable equilibrium point $1$. Under the condition that the corresponding one-dimensional equation has a pushed front $\Phi_{c^*}(z)$ with $\Phi_{c^*}(-\infty)=1$, $\Phi_{c^*}(\infty)=0$, we show that the solution $u(x,y,t)$ approaches $\Phi_{c^*}(y-\gamma(x,t))$ for some $\gamma(x,t)$ as $t \to \infty$, if initially $u(x,y,0)$ decays sufficiently fast as $y \to \infty$ and is bounded below by some positive constant near $y=-\infty$. It is also shown that $\gamma(x,t)$ is approximated by the mean curvature flow with a drift term.</description>

      <title>A direct method for doubly nonlinear equations via convexification in spaces of measures and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Existence of solutions to doubly nonlinear equations in reflexive Banach spaces is established by resorting to a global-in-time variational approach inspired by De Giorgi's principle, which characterizes the associated flows as null-minimizers of a suitable energy-dissipation functional defined on trajectories. In contrast to the celebrated minimizing movements scheme, the proposed strategy does not rely on any time-discretization or iterative constructions. Instead, it provides a direct method based on the relaxation of the problem in spaces of measures, constrained by the continuity equation: in this procedure, no gap is introduced due to the Ambrosio's superposition principle.
  Within this weak convex framework, the validity of the null-minimization property is recovered through two further steps. First, a careful application of the Von Neumann minimax theorem yields an identification of the dual problem as a supremum over the set of smooth and bounded cylinder functions, solving an Hamilton-Jacobi-type inequality. Secondly, a suitable "backward boundedness" property of solutions to such Hamilton-Jacobi system gives a proper bound of the dual problem, ensuring that the minimum value of the original functional is actually zero.
  The proposed strategy naturally extends to non-autonomous equations, encompassing time- and space-dependent dissipation potentials and time-dependent potential energies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the GENERIC structures of multi-species spatially inhomogeneous Boltzmann and Landau equations with Bose-Einstein, Maxwell-Boltzmann, and Fermi-Dirac statistics. In addition, under suitable assumptions on the collision kernels, we show that the Fisher information for the multi-species spatially homogeneous Boltzmann equation is non-increasing in time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the local H\"older continuity of nonnegative solutions to doubly nonlinear equations by introducing a new technique that allows us to treat the cases where the equation is both singular and degenerate, up to specific Barenblatt numbers. Our argument relies on a new integral $L^1$-$L^1$ Harnack estimate, of independent interest.</description>

      <title>A Viscosity Framework for Dynamic Programming Principles and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we introduce a viscosity-based notion of solution for general approximation schemes associated with partial differential equations, such as dynamic programming principles~(DPPs). A key feature of our approach is that it bypasses any measurability requirement on solutions of the DPP, an assumption that is often difficult to verify and may even fail in relevant examples. We establish a comparison principle between classical strict supersolutions and viscosity subsolutions of the DPP, which yields stability results under minimal and natural hypotheses. As a consequence, we prove existence of viscosity solutions of the DPP and their convergence to viscosity solutions of a PDE that is consistent with the underlying approximation scheme. Moreover, we show that solutions of the limiting PDE admit an asymptotic expansion encoded by the approximation operator. Finally, we demonstrate that a broad class of local, nonlocal, and nonlinear partial differential equations fits into our framework, recovering known examples in the literature and completing gaps in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Quantitative estimates for the forced Navier-Stokes equations and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a localisation of a slightly supercritical (Orlicz) regularity criterion for the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. This is a refinement to the recent partial positive answer to Tao's conjecture [Tao21] as given in [BP21b]. The proof requires new quantitative estimates for critically bounded solutions of the forced Navier-Stokes equations, where the forcing is induced by the localisation. A by-product of these new estimates is an application to the Boussinesq equations, where we prove a quantitative blow-up rate for the critical $L^3$ norm of the velocity. We prove these quantitative estimates using Carleman inequalities as in [Tao21], and subsequently in [BP21a], with an additional forcing term. An obstacle to doing this is that, in the Carleman inequalities, the forcing term is amplified on large scales. Additionally, the low regularity of the forcing requires the addition of Caccioppoli-type estimates to deal with the Carleman inequalities appropriately.</description>

      <title>Stability and bifurcation analysis in a mechanochemical model of pattern formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the stability and bifurcation structure of steady states in a mechanochemical model of pattern formation in regenerating tissue spheroids. The model couples morphogen dynamics with tissue mechanics via a positive feedback loop: mechanical stretching enhances morphogen production, while morphogen concentration modulates tissue elasticity. Global strain conservation implements a nonlocal inhibitory effect, realizing a mechanochemical variant of the local activation--long-range inhibition mechanism. For exponential elasticity-morphogen coupling, the system admits a variational formulation. We prove existence of nonconstant steady states for small diffusion and uniqueness of the homogeneous state for large diffusion. Linear stability analysis shows that only unimodal patterns are stable, while multimodal solutions are unstable. Bifurcation analysis reveals subcritical and supercritical pitchforks, with fold bifurcations generating bistable regimes. Our results demonstrate that mechanochemical feedback provides a robust mechanism for single-peaked pattern formation without requiring a second diffusible inhibitor.</description>

Abstract: We prove convergence to equilibrium for a class of coagulation-fragmentation equations that do not satisfy a detailed balance condition. More precisely, we consider perturbations of constant rate kernels. Our result provides in particular explicit convergence rates. Uniqueness of the stationary states is proven as well for the considered class of kernels.</description>

      <title>Confinement results near point vortices on the rotating sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Euler equation on the rotating sphere in the case where the absolute vorticity is initially sharply concentrated around several points. We follow the literature already concerning vorticity confinement for the planar Euler equations, and obtain similar results on the rotating sphere, with new challenges due to the geometry. More precisely, we show the improbability of collisions for point-vortices, logarithmic in time absolute vorticity confinement for general configurations, the optimality of this last result in general, and the existence of configurations with power-law long confinement. We take this opportunity to write a unified, self-contained, and improved version of all the proofs, previously scattered across multiple papers on the planar case, with detailed exposition for pedagogical clarity.</description>

      <title>An eigenvalue problem for a generalized polyharmonic operator in Orlicz-Sobolev spaces without the $\Delta_2$-condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a generalized polyharmonic eigenvalue problem of the form $A(u)= \lambda h(u)$ in a bounded smooth domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions in the setting of higher-order Orlicz-Sobolev spaces. Here, $A$ is a very general operator depending on $u$ and arbitrary higher-order derivatives of $u$, whose growth is governed by an Orlicz function, and $h$ is a lower order term. Combining the theories of pseudomonotone operators with complementary systems, we prove that this eigenvalue problem has an infinite number of eigenfunctions and that the corresponding sequence of eigenvalues tends to infinity. We point out that the $\Delta_2$-condition is not assumed for the involved Orlicz functions. Finally, we prove a first regularity result for eigenfunctions by following a De Giorgi's iteration scheme.</description>

      <title>From oblique-wave forcing to streak reinforcement: A perturbation-based frequency-response framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a perturbation-based frequency-response framework for analyzing amplification mechanisms that are central to subcritical routes to transition in wall-bounded shear flows. By systematically expanding the input-output dynamics of fluctuations about the laminar base flow with respect to forcing amplitude, we establish a rigorous correspondence between linear resolvent analysis and higher-order nonlinear interactions. At second order, quadratic interactions of unsteady oblique waves generate steady streamwise streaks via the lift-up mechanism. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of these streaks is captured by the second output singular function of the streamwise-constant resolvent operator. At higher orders, nonlinear coupling between oblique waves and induced streaks acts as structured forcing of the laminar linearized dynamics, yielding additional streak components whose relative phase governs reinforcement or attenuation of the leading-order streak response. Our analysis identifies a critical forcing amplitude marking the breakdown of the weakly nonlinear regime, beyond which direct numerical simulations exhibit sustained unsteadiness. We show that this breakdown coincides with the onset of secondary instability, revealing that the nonlinear interactions responsible for streak formation also drive the modal growth central to classical transition theory. The resulting framework provides a mechanistically transparent and computationally efficient description of transition that unifies non-modal amplification, streak formation, and modal instability within a single formulation derived directly from the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>The Unruh state for bosonic Teukolsky fields on subextreme Kerr spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the quantization of Teukolsky scalars of spin $0$, $\pm 1$, and $\pm 2$ within the algebraic approach to quantum field theory. We first discuss the classical phase space, from which we subsequently construct the algebra. This sheds light on which fields are conjugates of each other. Further, we construct the Unruh state for this theory on Kerr and show that it is Hadamard on the black hole exterior and the interior up to the inner horizon. This shows not only that Hadamard states exist for this theory, but also extends the existence and Hadamard property of the Unruh state to (bosonic) Teukolsky fields on Kerr, where such a result was previously missing.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new biharmonic Steklov problem on differential forms with Dirichlet-type boundary conditions and show that it is elliptic. We prove the existence of a discrete spectrum for this problem and give variational characterizations for eigenvalues associated to it. We establish eigenvalue estimates known as Kuttler-Sigillito inequalities, that connect the eigenvalues of different problems on differential forms with curvature quantities on the manifold.</description>

      <title>Generalised Fisher Information in Defective Fokker-Planck Equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14033v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to introduce and investigate a generalised Fisher Information in the setting of linear Fokker-Planck equations. This functional, which depends on two functions instead of one, exhibits the same decay behaviour as the standard Fisher information, and allows us to investigate different parts of the Fokker-Planck solution via an appropriate decomposition. Focusing almost exclusively on Fokker-Planck equations with constant drift and diffusion matrices, we will use a modification of the well established Bakry-Emery method with this newly defined functional to provide an alternative proof to the sharp long time behaviour of relative entropies of solutions to such equations when the diffusion matrix is positive definite and the drift matrix is defective. This novel approach is different to previous techniques and relies on minimal spectral information on the Fokker-Planck operator, unlike the one presented the authors' previous work, where powerful tools from spectral theory were needed.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this work is to find the sharp rate of convergence to equilibrium under the quadratic Fisher information functional for solutions to Fokker-Planck equations governed by a constant drift term and a constant, yet possibly degenerate, diffusion matrix. A key ingredient in our investigation is a recent work of Arnold, Signorello, and Schmeiser, where the $L^2$-propagator norm of such Fokker-Planck equations was shown to be identical to the propagator norm of a finite dimensional ODE which is determined by matrices that are intimately connected to those appearing in the associated Fokker-Planck equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we first establish the quantitative properties for positive solutions to the Moser-Trudinger equations in the two-dimensional Poincar\'e disk $\mathbb{B}^2$: \begin{equation*}\label{mt1}
  \left\{
  \begin{aligned}
  &amp;-\Delta_{\mathbb{B}^2}u=\lambda ue^{u^2},\ x\in\mathbb{B}^2,
  &amp;u\to0,\ \text{when}\ \rho(x)\to\infty,
  &amp;||\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^2} u||_{L^2(\mathbb{B}^2)}^2\leq M_0,
  \end{aligned}
  \right.
  \end{equation*} where $0&lt;\lambda&lt;\frac{1}{4}=\inf\limits_{u\in W^{1,2}(\mathbb{B}^2)\backslash\{0\}}\frac{\|\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^2}u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{B}^2)}^2}{\|u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{B}^2)}^2}$, $\rho(x)$ denotes the geodesic distance between $x$ and the origin and $M_0$ is a fixed large positive constant (see Theorem 1.1). Furthermore, by doing a delicate expansion for Dirichlet energy $\|\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^2}u\|_{L^2(\mathbb{B}^2)}^2$ when $\lambda$ approaches to $0,$ we prove that there exists $\Lambda^\ast&gt;4\pi$ such that the Moser-Trudinger functional $F(u)=\int_{\mathbb{B}^2}\left(e^{u^2}-1\right) dV_{\mathbb{B}^2}$ under the constraint $\int_{\mathbb{B}^2}|\nabla_{\mathbb{B}^2}u|^2 dV_{\mathbb{B}^2}=\Lambda$ has at least one positive critical point for $\Lambda\in(4\pi,\Lambda^{\ast})$ up to some M\"{o}bius transformation. Finally, when $\lambda\rightarrow 0$, by doing a more accurate expansion for $u$ near the origin and away from the origin, applying a local Pohozaev identity around the origin and the uniqueness of the Cauchy initial value problem for ODE,Cauchy-initial uniqueness for ODE, we prove that the Moser-Trudinger equation only has one positive solution when $\lambda$ is close to $0.$ During the process of the proofs, we overcome some new difficulties which involves the decay properties of the positive solutions, as well as some precise expansions for the solutions both near the origin and away from the origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.17886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the following Hardy-type mean field equation \[ \left\{ {\begin{array}{*{20}{c}} { - \Delta u-\frac{1}{(1-|x|^2)^2} u = \lambda e^u}, &amp; {\rm in} \ \ B_1,\\ {\ \ \ \ u = 0,} &amp;\ {\rm on}\ \partial B_1, \end{array}} \right. \] \[\] where $\lambda&gt;0$ is small and $B_1$ is the standard unit disc of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Applying the moving plane method of hyperbolic space and the accurate expansion of heat kernel on hyperbolic space, we establish the radial symmetry and Brezis-Merle lemma for solutions of Hardy-type mean field equation. Meanwhile, we also derive the quantitative results for solutions of Hardy-type mean field equation, which improves significantly the compactness results for classical mean-field equation obtained by Brezis-Merle and Li-Shafrir. Furthermore, applying the local Pohozaev identity from scaling, blow-up analysis and a contradiction argument, we prove that the solutions are unique when $\lambda$ is sufficiently close to 0.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear time-asymptotic stability of the composite wave consisting of two viscous shocks and a viscous contact discontinuity for the one-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations. Specifically, we establish that if the composite wave strength and the perturbations are sufficiently small, the NSF system admits a unique global-in-time strong solution, which converges uniformly in space as time tends to infinity, towards the corresponding composite wave, up to dynamical shifts in the positions of the two viscous shocks. Notably, the strengths of the two viscous shocks can be chosen independently. Our proof relies upon the $a$-contraction method with time-dependent shifts and suitable weight functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $L^{p_1}(G) \times L^{p_2}(G)$ to $L^{p}(G)$ boundedness of the bilinear Bochner-Riesz means associated with the sub-Laplacian on M\'etivier group $G$ under the H\"older's relation $1/p = 1/p_1 + 1/p_2$, $1\leq p_1, p_2 \leq \infty$. Our objective is to obtain boundedness results, analogous to the Euclidean setting, where the Euclidean dimension in the smoothness threshold is possibly replaced by the topological dimension of the underlying M\'etivier group $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Our main goal is to explicitly compute the best constant for the Sobolev-type inequality involving the polyharmonic operator obtained in (Analysis and Applications 22, pp. 1417-1446, 2024). To achieve this goal, we also establish both regularity and classification results for a generalized critical polyharmonic equation in the radial setting.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic estimates for solutions of inhomogeneous non-divergence diffusion equations with drifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of the nonlinear processes modeled by diffusion-transport partial differential equations in non-divergence form with drifts. The solutions are subject to some inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Starting with the reduced linear problem, we obtain the asymptotic estimates for the solutions, as time $t\to\infty$, depending on the asymptotic behavior of the forcing term and boundary data. These are established in both cases when the drifts are uniformly bounded, and unbounded as $t\to\infty$. For the nonlinear problem, we prove the convergence of the solutions under suitable conditions that balance the growth of the nonlinear term with the decay of the data. To take advantage of the diffusion in the non-divergence form, we prove an inhomogeneous version of the Landis-typed Growth Lemma and apply it to successive time-intervals. At each time step, the center for the barrier function is selected carefully to optimize the contracting factor. Our rigorous results show the robustness of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07559v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish new Euclidean Sobolev logarithmic inequalities in the framework of fractional Sobolev spaces and their weighted version. Our approach relies on a interpolation inequality, which can be viewed as a fractional Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type inequality. We further relate the optimal constant in this interpolation inequality to a corresponding variational problem. These results extend classical Sobolev logarithmic inequalities to the nonlocal Euclidean framework and provide new tools for analysis in fractional Sobolev spaces.</description>

      <title>Regularity for fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations with strong absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate dead-core problems for fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic equations with strong absorption, \begin{equation*}
  |Du|^{p} F(D^{2}u) - u_{t} = \lambda_{0}(x,t)\, u^{\mu}\, \chi_{\{u&gt;0\}}(x,t)
  \qquad \text{in } \quad Q_{T} := Q \times (0,T), \end{equation*} where $0 \leq p &lt; \infty$ and $0 &lt; \mu &lt; 1$. We establish a sharp and improved parabolic $C^{\alpha}$-regularity estimate along the free boundary $\partial \{ u &gt; 0 \}$, where \[ \alpha := \frac{2+p}{1+p-\mu} &gt; 1 + \frac{1}{1+p}. \] Moreover, we establish weak geometric properties of solutions, such as non-degeneracy and uniform positive density. As an application, we obtain a Liouville-type theorem for entire solutions and gradient bounds. Finally, as a byproduct of our approach, we derive a novel $L^{\delta}$-average estimate for fully nonlinear singular elliptic equations and present a new formulation of the gradient decay property. It is worth noting that the results presented here extend those in da Silva {\it et al.} ({\it Pacific J. Math}., \textbf{300} (2019), 179--213) and ({\it J. Differential Equations}., \textbf{264} (2018), 7270--7293) to the degenerate setting, and can be viewed as a parabolic analogue of da Silva {\it et al.} ({\it Math. Nachr}., \textbf{294} (2021), 38--55) and Teixeira ({\it Math. Ann}., \textbf{364} (2016), 1121--1134). Additionally, of independent mathematical interest, we emphasize that our manuscript establishes a comparison principle result and the compactness of viscosity solutions to fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic models with continuous and bounded forcing terms. These compactness and comparison properties serve as key ingredients in deriving enhanced regularity estimates along free boundary points for our model problem with strong absorption.</description>

      <title>The Fractional-Logarithmic Laplacian:Fundamental Properties and Eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06581v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, the fractional--logarithmic Laplacian \( (-\Delta)^{s+\log} \), defined as the derivative of the fractional Laplacian \( (-\Delta)^t \) at \( t=s \). It is a singular integral operator with Fourier symbol \( |\xi|^{2s}(2\ln|\xi|) \), and we prove the pointwise integral representation \[ (-\Delta)^{s+\log}u(x) = c_{n,s}\,\mathrm{PV}\!\int_{\mathbb{R}^n} \frac{u(x)-u(y)}{|x-y|^{n+2s}}\bigl(-2\ln|x-y|\bigr)\,dy + b_{n,s}(-\Delta)^s u(x), \] where \( c_{n,s} \) is the normalization constant of the fractional Laplacian and \( b_{n,s}:=\frac{d}{ds}c_{n,s}.\) We also establish several equivalent formulations of \( (-\Delta)^{s+\log} \), including the singular-integral representation, the Fourier-multiplier representation, the spectral-calculus definition, and an extension characterization.
  We develop the associated functional framework on both \( \mathbb{R}^n \) and bounded Lipschitz domains, introducing the natural energy spaces and proving embedding results. In particular, we obtain a compact embedding at the critical exponent \( 2_s^*=\frac{2n}{n-2s},\) a phenomenon that differs from the classical Sobolev and fractional Sobolev settings. We further study the Poisson problem, proving existence and \( L^\infty \)-regularity results. We then investigate the Dirichlet eigenvalue problem and establish qualitative spectral properties. Finally, we derive a Weyl-type asymptotic law for the eigenvalue counting function and for the \( k \)-th Dirichlet eigenvalue, showing that the high-frequency behavior combines the fractional Weyl scaling with a logarithmic growth factor, thereby interpolating between the fractional Laplacian and the logarithmic Laplacian.</description>

      <title>A bifurcation theory approach to the nonlocal Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the nonlocal Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation on the one-dimensional torus,
  \[
  u_t+u u_x=\Lambda^{r}u-\varepsilon \Lambda^{s}u,\qquad x\in\mathbb T,
  \] where $\varepsilon&gt;0$, $s&gt;1$, $r\in[-1,s)$. We first prove local and global well-posedness for initial data in $H^{3}(\mathbb T)$. We then investigate the steady-state problem and show that the trivial branch undergoes bifurcation at the critical values $\varepsilon_k=k^{\,r-s}$, $k\in\mathbb N$. Using the Crandall-Rabinowitz theorem we obtain smooth local curves of nontrivial equilibria emanating from each $(\varepsilon_k,0)$ and compute the bifurcation direction. To address the global continuation of these branches we derive global a priori bounds and apply a global alternative based on the Fitzpatrick-Pejsachowicz-Rabier degree for Fredholm maps of index zero. In particular, for the component bifurcating from the first critical point we prove that its $\varepsilon$-projection contains the interval $(2^{r-s},1)$, yielding the existence of nontrivial steady states for that parameter range. We complement the theory with numerical continuation results illustrating the bifurcation diagram and solution profiles.</description>

      <title>Finite Difference Approximation with ADI Scheme for Two-dimensional Keller-Segel Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Keller-Segel systems are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations used to model chemotaxis in biology. In this paper, we propose two alternating direction implicit (ADI) schemes to solve the 2D Keller-Segel systems directly with minimal computational cost, while preserving positivity, energy dissipation law and mass conservation. One scheme unconditionally preserves positivity, while the other does so conditionally. Both schemes achieve second-order accuracy in space, with the former being first-order accuracy in time and the latter second-order accuracy in time. Besides, the former scheme preserves the energy dissipation law asymptotically. We validate these results through numerical experiments, and also compare the efficiency of our schemes with the standard five-point scheme, demonstrating that our approaches effectively reduce computational costs.</description>

      <title>Young functions on varifolds. Part I. Functional analytic foundations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.05639v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The series of papers is devoted to the study of convergence for pairs of surfaces and smooth functions thereon. We model such pairs with varifolds and multiple-valued functions to capture their limits. In the present paper, we study Young functions, a measure-theoretic approach to multiple-valued functions, and the graph measures associated with pairs of measures (in particular, varifolds) and Young functions. This setting allows us to model the convergence of pairs of surfaces and functions thereon via the weak convergence of their associated graph measures, and a compactness theorem follows immediately. As a prerequisite for the concepts of differentiability for Young functions in the upcoming papers, we introduce and investigate several test function spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12636v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The default Gaussian latent in flow-based generative models poses challenges when learning certain distributions such as heavy-tailed ones. We introduce a general framework for learning data-adaptive latent distributions using one-dimensional quantile functions, optimized via the Wasserstein distance between noise and data. The quantile-based parameterization naturally adapts to both heavy-tailed and compactly supported distributions and shortens transport paths. Numerical results confirm the method's flexibility and effectiveness achieved with negligible computational overhead.</description>
