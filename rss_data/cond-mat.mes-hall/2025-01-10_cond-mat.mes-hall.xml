      <title>Topological quantized edge-pumping-spin flip in Rice-Mele model with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantized Thouless pumping charge in a spinless Rice-Mele (RM) model originates from a degeneracy point in the parameter space and cannot be detected when open boundary conditions are applied. In this work, we investigate the topological features of a spinful Rice-Mele (RM) model. We demonstrate that spin-orbit coupling facilitates the transition of a single degenerate point into a degenerate loop, which is anticipated to be the source of the topological characteristics. When periodic boundary conditions are considered, we find that the pumping spin is zero for an adiabatic loop within the nodal loop and is 2 (in units of $\hbar /2$) for an adiabatic passage enclosing the nodal loop. When open boundary conditions are considered, the boundary-bulk correspondence is demonstrated by quantized pumping-spin flips at the edges, which can be obtained by completing double periods of a closed passage, rather than a single cycle. Our findings reveal an alternative dynamic manifestation of the boundary-bulk correspondence.</description>

      <title>Probing the collective excitations of excitonic insulators in an optical cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The light--matter interaction in optical cavities offers a promising ground to create hybrid states and manipulate material properties. In this work, we examine the effect of light-matter coupling in the excitonic insulator phase using a quasi one-dimensional lattice model with two opposite parity orbitals at each site. We show that the model allows for a coupling between the collective phase mode and cavity photons. Our findings reveal that the collective mode of the excitonic state significantly impacts the dispersion of the cavity mode, giving rise to an avoiding band crossing in the photon dispersion. This phenomenon is absent in trivial and topological insulator phases and also in phonon-mediated excitonic insulators, underscoring the unique characteristics of collective excitations in excitonic insulators. Our results demonstrate the significant impact of light-matter interaction on photon propagation in the presence of excitonic collective excitations.</description>

      <title>Role of asymmetry in thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric properties of a double quantum dot system coupled to two metallic reservoirs, focusing on two main effects: (i) the influence of coupling asymmetry between the quantum dot and the reservoirs on the Seebeck coefficient, and (ii) the impact of asymmetry in the energy levels of the dots on current rectification. In the first case, we find that introducing moderate asymmetry significantly enhances the Seebeck coefficient. In the second case, while rectification vanishes when the energy levels are degenerate, substantial rectification is achieved when one energy level lies below and the other above the Fermi level. We further interpret the dependence of rectification magnitude and shape on system parameters using analytical results from a spinless model.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of the Fractal Hofstadter Energy Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hofstadter's butterfly, the predicted energy spectrum for non-interacting electrons confined to a two-dimensional lattice in a magnetic field, is one of the most remarkable fractal structures in nature. At rational ratios of magnetic flux quanta per lattice unit cell, this spectrum shows self-similar distributions of energy levels that reflect its recursive construction. For most materials, Hofstadter's butterfly is predicted under experimental conditions that are unachievable using laboratory-scale magnetic fields. More recently, electrical transport studies have provided evidence for Hofstadter's butterfly in materials engineered to have artificially large lattice constants, such as those with moir\'e superlattices. Yet to-date, direct spectroscopy of the fractal energy spectrum predicted by Hofstadter nearly 50 years ago has remained out of reach. Here we use high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy / spectroscopy (STM / STS) to probe the flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene near the predicted second magic angle, an ideal setting for spectroscopic studies of Hofstadter's spectrum. Our study shows the fractionalization of flat moir\'e bands into discrete Hofstadter subbands and discerns experimental signatures of self-similarity of this spectrum. Moreover, our measurements uncover a spectrum that evolves dynamically with electron density, displaying phenomena beyond that of Hofstadter's original model due to the combined effects of strong correlations, Coulomb interactions, and the quantum degeneracy of electrons in twisted bilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Charge sensing of few-electron ZnO double quantum dots probed by radio-frequency reflectometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Zinc oxide (ZnO) has garnered much attention as a promising material for quantum devices due to its unique characteristics. To utilize the potential of ZnO for quantum devices, the development of fundamental technological elements such as high-speed readout and charge sensing capabilities has become essential. In this study, we address these challenges by demonstrating radio-frequency (rf) reflectometry and charge sensing in ZnO quantum dots, thus advancing the potential for qubit applications. A device is fabricated on a high-quality ZnO heterostructure, featuring gate-defined target and sensor quantum dots. The sensor dot, integrated into an rf resonator circuit, enables the detection of single-electron charges in the target dots. Using this setup, the formation of few-electron double quantum dots is observed by obtaining their charge stability diagram. Also, a charge stability diagram with a gate pulse sequence is measured. We discuss the strong electron correlation in ZnO, which leads to nearly degenerate spin-singlet and -triplet two-electron states in the (0, 2) charge state, and the perspectives on spin-state readout.</description>

      <title>Control of magnon frequency combs in magnetic rings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Brillouin light scattering microscopy, we study the rich dynamics in magnetic disks and rings governed by non-linear interactions, focusing on the role of vortex core dynamics on the spin-wave eigenmode spectrum. By strongly exciting quantized magnon modes in magnetic vortices, self-induced magnon Floquet states are populated by the intrinsic nonlinear coupling of magnon modes to the vortex core gyration. In magnetic rings, however, this generation is suppressed even when exciting the system over a large power range. To retrieve the rich nonlinear dynamics in rings, we apply external in-plane magnetic fields by which the vortex core is restored. Our findings demonstrate how to take active control of the nonlinear processes in magnetic structures of different topology.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional motion of topological defects mediating continuous rotation processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological defects play a critical role across many fields, mediating phase transitions and macroscopic behaviors as they move through space. Their role as robust information carriers has also generated much attention. However, controlling their motion remains challenging, especially towards achieving motion along well-defined paths which typically require predefined structural patterning. Here we demonstrate the tunable, unidirectional motion of topological defects, specifically magnetic dislocations in a weak magnetic stripe pattern, induced by external magnetic field in a laterally unconfined thin film. This motion is shown to mediate the overall continuous rotation of the stripe pattern. We determine the connection between the unidirectional motion of dislocations and the underlying three-dimensional (3D) magnetic structure by performing 3D magnetic vectorial imaging with in situ magnetic fields. A minimal model for dislocations in stripe patterns that encodes the symmetry breaking induced by the external magnetic field reproduces the motion of dislocations that facilitate the 2D rotation of the stripes, highlighting the universality of the phenomenon. This work establishes a framework for studying the field-driven behavior of topological textures and designing materials that enable well defined, controlled motion of defects in unconfined systems, paving the way to manipulate information carriers in higher-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Photon-assisted stochastic resonance in nanojunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stochastic resonance in molecular junctions driven by a periodically-varying external field. This is done using the time-dependent Landauer-B{\"u}ttiker formalism, which follows from exact analytical solutions to the Kadanoff-Baym equations describing the molecular junction subject to an arbitrary time-dependent bias. We focus on a double quantum dot nanojunction and compare the effects of the temperature with the fluctuating bias in the statically-driven case. We then consider the combined effect of AC-driving and white noise fluctuations on the rectified current through the nanojunction, and find a stochastic resonance effect, where at certain driving conditions the bias fluctuations enhance the current signal. The study is then extended to include the color noise in the applied bias, so that the combined effect of the color noise correlation time and driving frequency on stochastic resonance is investigated. We thereby demonstrate that photon-assisted transport can be optimized by a suitably tuned environment.</description>

      <title>Elliptical stability of hopfions in bulk helimagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are three-dimensional topological solitons with non-zero Hopf index ${\cal H}$ in the vector field of material's local magnetization. In this Letter elliptical stability of hopfions with ${\cal H}=1$ in a classical helimagnet is studied on the basis of a variational model. It is shown that, depending on their internal structure (vortex and antivortex tubes ordering), the hopfions can either be stable in a bulk magnet or unstable with respect to elongation along their central axis. It is found that the energy of stable hopfions is always below the energy of the $2\pi$-skyrmion lattice in the same material, suggesting the possibility to use $2\pi$-skyrmions as a precursor for hopfion nucleation. Stability diagram for hopfions on the magnetic anisotropy-field phase diagram is computed numerically. Explicit analytical expressions for some of its critical lines are derived.</description>

      <title>Quantifying superlubricity of bilayer graphene from the mobility of interface dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures subjected to interlayer twists or heterostrains demonstrate structural superlubricity, leading to their potential use as superlubricants in micro- and nano-electro-mechanical devices. However, quantifying superlubricity across the vast four-dimensional heterodeformation space using experiments or atomic-scale simulations is a challenging task. In this work, we develop an atomically informed dynamic Frenkel--Kontorova (DFK) model for predicting the interface friction drag coefficient of an arbitrarily heterodeformed bilayer graphene (BG) system. The model is motivated by MD simulations of friction in heterodeformed BG. In particular, we note that interface dislocations formed during structural relaxation translate in unison when a heterodeformed BG is subjected to shear traction, leading us to the hypothesis that the kinetic properties of interface dislocations determine the friction drag coefficient of the interface. The constitutive law of the DFK model comprises the generalized stacking fault energy of the AB stacking, a scalar displacement drag coefficient, and the elastic properties of graphene, which are all obtained from atomistic simulations. Simulations of the DFK model confirm our hypothesis since a single choice of the displacement drag coefficient, fit to the kinetic property of an individual dislocation in an atomistic simulation, predicts interface friction in any heterodeformed BG. By bridging the gap between dislocation kinetics at the microscale to interface friction at the macroscale, the DFK model enables a high-throughput investigation of strain-engineered vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon Analogs in Full-Shell Hybrid Nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report tunneling spectroscopy of Andreev subgap states in hybrid nanowires with a thin superconducting full-shell surrounding a semiconducting core. The combination of the quantized fluxoid of the shell and the Andreev reflection at the superconductor-semiconductor interface gives rise to analogs of Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) states found in Abrikosov vortices in type-II superconductors. Unlike in metallic superconductors, CdGM analogs in full-shell hybrid nanowires manifest as one-dimensional van Hove singularities with energy spacings comparable to the superconducting gap and independent of the Fermi energy, making them readily observable. Evolution of these analogs with axial magnetic field, skewed within the Little-Parks lobe structure, is consistent with theory and yields information about the radial distribution and angular momenta of the corresponding subbands.</description>

      <title>Extraordinary manifestation of near electrostatic field caused by macroscopic quantum shell effects in submicron hemispherical clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The existence of macroscopic shell structure of submicron metal clusters is known for several decades. Since the most studies provide theoretical analysis for clusters of spherical shape, the electron density inhomogeneities caused by shell effects are spherically symmetric and do not provide long range electrostatic fields. However, similar shell structure should exist in a hemispherical cluster which conserves the closed periodic orbits of electrons, but not the spherical symmetry of electron distribution. As a result, we demonstrate that a strong electrostatic field ($E \sim 10^8$~V/m) exists in the vicinity of the flat surface of an isolated, uncharged metal nanocluster of hemispherical shape using modern approaches for electronic structure evaluation. This physical phenomenon is a consequence of the large-scale spatial inhomogeneity in distribution of electrons related to quantum shell effects in submicron metal clusters, which may find numerous applications in various fields of science and technology.</description>

      <title>Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schr\"odinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is $25\%$, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of $84\%$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Pumping of Orbital Magnetization by Spin Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose adiabatic pumping of orbital magnetization driven by coherent spin precession, facilitating the rectification of this precession. The orbital magnetization originates from the adiabatic evolution of valence electrons with a topological bulk contribution expressed as a Chern-Simons form. When the precession cone angle of spin $\bm{S}$ is small, the resulting magnetization is proportional to $\bm{S}\times \dot{\bm{S}}$, contributing to the magnon Zeeman effect. With a large cone angle, the magnetization can reach its natural unit, $e/T$, in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator with $e$ as the elementary charge and $T$ as the precession period. This significant magnetization is related to the global properties of the electronic geometric phases in the parameter space spanned by $\bm{S}$ and momentum $\bm{k}$. When the pumped magnetization is inhomogeneous, induced by spin textures or electronic topological phase domains, a dissipationless charge current is also pumped. At last, we discuss the boundary contributions from the spin-driving edge states, which are intricately linked to the gauge-dependent quantum uncertainty of the Chern-Simons form.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermiticity enhanced topological immunity of one-dimensional $p$-wave superconducting chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying the immunity of topological superconductors against non-local disorder is one of the key issues in both fundamental researches and potential applications. Here, we demonstrate that the non-Hermiticity can enhance the robustness of topological edge states against non-local disorder. To illustrate that, we consider a one-dimensional (1D) generalized Kitaev model with the asymmetric hopping in the presence of disorder. It is shown that the region supporting Majorana zero modes (MZMs) against non-local disorder will be enlarged by the non-Hermiticity. Through both the numerical and analytical analyses, we show that non-Hermiticity can stabilize the topological superconducting (SC) phase against higher disorder strength.

      <title>Time-domain study of coupled collective excitations in quantum materials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that are often traced to a complex interplay among different microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulating the dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Magnetization reversal of finite-length Co and Fe atomic chains on Pt(332) surface: numerical calculations and a new theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05047v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Different mechanisms of magnetization reversal in finite-length Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface have been investigated, taking into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It has been found that the magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through the simultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, the magnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by the formation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co and Fe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors have been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of these prefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significant and non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitatively describes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers and the frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from our theoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results of numerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimation of the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths, temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters. The proposed theoretical framework is applicable not only to the Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface but also to a broad class of one-dimensional magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. I. Hierarchical equations of motion approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05054v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying charge transport in models with nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction is difficult because it requires finite-temperature real-time correlation functions of mixed carrier-phonon operators. Focusing on models with discrete undamped phonon modes, we show that such correlation functions can be retrieved from the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM), although phonons have been integrated out. Our procedure relies on the explicit expression of HEOM auxiliaries in terms of phonon creation and annihilation operators. It reveals that the auxiliaries describe multiphonon-assisted carrier transitions induced by genuine many-phonon correlations, from which lower-order correlations are subtracted according to the finite-temperature Wick's theorem. Applying the procedure to our recently developed momentum-space HEOM method featuring a specific hierarchy closing, we compute the numerically exact dynamical mobility of a carrier within the one-dimensional Peierls model. The carrier mobility at moderate temperatures decreases with increasing interaction, whereas high temperatures see the opposite trend, reflecting the prevalence of the phonon-assisted current over the purely electronic band current. The pronounced finite-size effects and HEOM instabilities delimit the range of applicability of our approach to moderate interactions, moderate to high temperatures, and not too fast phonons. Importantly, this range comprises the values relevant for charge transport in crystalline organic semiconductors, and we present and discuss the corresponding numerically exact results in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Charge transport limited by nonlocal electron-phonon interaction. II. Numerically exact quantum dynamics in the slow-phonon regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport of charge carriers in mechanically soft semiconductors is mainly limited by their interaction with slow intermolecular phonons. Carrier motion exhibits a crossover from superdiffusive to subdiffusive, producing a distinct low-frequency peak in the dynamical-mobility profile. These features can be understood within approaches relying on the timescale separation between carrier and phonon dynamics, such as the transient localization scenario (TLS). However, recovering them from fully quantum dynamics has proved elusive. Using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM)-based approach exposed in a companion paper, we study carrier transport in the one-dimensional Peierls model near the adiabatic limit. We find that the TLS approximates HEOM dynamics very well at higher temperatures and for stronger interactions. Then, the transport is predominantly phonon-assisted, and turns diffusive from the subdiffusive side well before one phonon period. In contrast, the band current dominates at moderate temperatures and interactions, relevant for transport in realistic materials. We then conclude that the super-to-subdiffusive crossover is transient, so that the diffusive motion sets in from the superdiffusive side after a couple of phonon periods. The low-frequency dynamical mobility then additionally exhibits a dip at approximately one phonon frequency, and the zero-frequency peak. Our findings in this moderate regime show limitations of the TLS, and support the results of the most advanced quantum-classical simulations. We expect that the qualitative differences between HEOM and TLS dynamics would diminish for a more realistic phonon density of states.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Tomographic identification of all molecular orbitals in a wide binding energy range</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the past decade, photoemission orbital tomography (POT) has evolved into a powerful tool to investigate the electronic structure of organic molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Here we show that POT allows for the comprehensive experimental identification of all molecular orbitals in a substantial binding energy range, in the present case more than 10 eV. Making use of the angular distribution of photoelectrons as a function of binding energy, we exemplify this by extracting orbital-resolved partial densities of states (pDOS) for 15 $\pi$ and 23 $\sigma$ orbitals from the experimental photoemission intensities of the prototypical organic molecule bisanthene (C$_{28}$H$_{14}$) on a Cu(110) surface. In their entirety, these experimentally measured orbital-resolved pDOS for an essentially complete set of orbitals serve as a stringent benchmark for electronic structure methods, which we illustrate by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing four frequently-used exchange-correlation functionals. By computing the respective molecular-orbital-projected densities of states of the bisanthene/Cu(110) interface, a one-to-one comparison with experimental data for an unprecedented number of 38 orbital energies becomes possible. The quantitative analysis of our data reveals that the range-separated hybrid functional HSE performs best for the investigated organic/metal interface. At a more fundamental level, the remarkable agreement between the experimental and the Kohn-Sham orbital energies over a binding energy range larger than 10\,eV suggests that -- perhaps unexpectedly -- Kohn-Sham orbitals approximate Dyson orbitals, which would rigorously account for the electron extraction process in photoemission spectroscopy but are notoriously difficult to compute, in a much better way than previously thought.</description>

      <title>First-Principles and Machine Learning Insights into the Design of DOTT-Carbon and its Lithium-Ion Storage Capacity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials are promising candidates for developing more efficient green energy conversion and storage technologies. This study presents a new 2D carbon allotrope, DOTT-Carbon, characterized by its distinctive and multi-ring structure featuring 12-, 8-, 4-, and 3-membered rings of carbon atoms. We explore its structural, mechanical, and lithium-ion storage properties by employing density functional theory and machine learning simulations. Phonon calculations confirm its structural stability and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate its thermal resilience at elevated temperatures. The material exhibits anisotropic mechanical properties, with Young's modulus values varying between 280-330 GPa. DOTT-Carbon displays a lithium-ion storage capacity of 446.28 mAh/g, complemented by a low diffusion barrier (0.2-0.9 eV) and a high diffusion coefficient ($ &gt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{2}$/s), possibly facilitating efficient lithium-ion transport. The stable open circuit voltage of 0.28 V also indicates its suitability as an anode material.</description>

      <title>Double Majorana Vortex Flat Bands in the Topological Dirac Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex lines, known as topological defects, are cable of trapping Majorana modes in superconducting topological materials. Previous studies have primarily focused on topological bands with conventional s-wave pairing. However, topological Dirac semimetals exhibiting a unique orbital texture can favor unconventional pairing when electronic correlations are significant. The topology of vortices in these systems has yet to be explored. In this work, we investigate the vortex bound states in superconducting Dirac semimetals, with a particular focus on the orbital-singlet unconventional pairing, which generates higher-order Majorana hinge modes. Remarkably, we identify robust double Majorana vortex flat bands at zero energy. In type-I Dirac semimetals, these Majorana flat bands are located between the projections of two superconduting Dirac points. In contrast, in type-II Dirac semimetals, they extend across the entire 1D Brillouin zone. These double flat bands arise from a nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology defined by an effective particle-hole symmetry and are protected by the four-fold rotational symmetry. Additionally, we observe that moving the vortex line close to a hinge can trivialize the higher-order Majorana arc on the hinge, leaving a single Majorana mode at the vortex core due to the hybridization of Majorana modes. Finally, we discuss the potential experimental implications for correlated Dirac semimetals, such as electron-doped iron-based superconductors.</description>

Abstract: Hopf insulators represent an exceptional class of topological matter unanticipated by the periodic table of topological invariants. These systems point to the existence of previously unexplored states of matter with unconventional topology. In this work, we take a step toward exploring this direction by investigating correlation-driven instabilities of Hopf insulators. Organizing our analysis around the topological quantum critical point that separates the Hopf insulating phase from a trivial insulator, we demonstrate the emergence of unconventional Weyl semimetallic and topological insulating states. Notably, the Weyl semimetal supports non-reciprocal superconductivity and a Bogoliubov-Fermi surface, potentially providing a novel framework for realizing the superconducting diode effect. Finally, we highlight the interconnectedness of the effective descriptions of correlated Hopf insulators, two-dimensional quadratic band-touching semimetals, and Luttinger semimetals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time method for calibrating the frequency of a resonantly driven qubit. The real-time processing capabilities of a controller dynamically compute adaptive probing sequences for qubit-frequency estimation. Each probing time and drive frequency are calculated to divide the prior probability distribution into two branches, following a locally optimal strategy that mimics a conventional binary search. We show the algorithm's efficacy by stabilizing a flux-tunable transmon qubit, leading to improved coherence and gate fidelity. By feeding forward the updated qubit frequency, the FPGA-powered control electronics also mitigates non-Markovian noise in the system, which is detrimental to quantum error correction. Our protocol highlights the importance of feedback in improving the calibration and stability of qubits subject to drift and can be readily applied to other qubit platforms.</description>

      <title>Interplay between altermagnetism and topological superconductivity in an unconventional superconducting platform</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretical model to investigate the interplay between altermagnetism and $p$-wave superconductivity, with a particular focus on topological phase transitions in a two-dimensional (2D) $p$-wave superconductor, considering both chiral and helical phases. Our study reveals that the emergence of helical and chiral Majorana states can be tuned by the amplitude of a $d-$wave altermagnetic order parameter, with the outcome depending on the nature of the superconducting state. In the helical superconductor, such an altermagnet can induce a topological phase transition into a gapless topological superconductor hosting Majorana flat edge modes (MFEMs). On the other hand, in the chiral superconductor, the topological transition takes place between a topologically nontrivial gapped phase and a gapless nodal-line superconductor, where the Bogoliubov quasiparticle bands intersect at an isolated line in momentum space. Remarkably, we show that when such an altermagnet is coupled to a mixed-pairing superconductor, with both chiral and helical components, a hybrid topological phase emerges, featuring dispersive Majorana edge that modes coexist with nearly flat Majorana edge states. Our findings therefore establish a novel platform for controlling and manipulating Majorana modes in unconventional superconductors with vanishing total magnetization.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optics of a charge-tunable quantum dot -- Observation of a negative diamagnetic shift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04583v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present magneto-optical studies of a self-assembled semiconductor quantum dot in neutral and positively charged states. The diamagnetic shifts and Zeeman splitting of many well-identified optical transitions are precisely measured. Remarkably, a pronounced negative diamagnetic shift is observed for spectral lines resulting from a doubly positively charged excitonic complex. We use the Hartree - Fock approximation for describing the direct Coulomb and exchange interactions between the quantum dot confined carriers in various configurations. A simple harmonic potential model, which we extend to capture the influence of an externally applied magnetic field in Faraday configuration, is then used to quantitatively account for all the measured diamagnetic shifts. We show that the negative shift is due to the change in the hole-hole exchange interaction energy induced by the magnetic field. Using this model and the measured shifts we extract the dielectric constant of the quantum dot material and get a decent estimate of the quantum dot dimensions. Further, the measured Zeeman splitting of the various spectral lines are also explained by a simple model using algebraic sums and differences of the $g$-factors of the confined charge carriers in their respective first and second discrete energy levels. Finally, the obtained values of the electronic $g$-factor and that of the dielectric constant are independently used to determine the effective composition (x) of the ternary In$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$As quantum dot. Both agree to within the experimental uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Practical realization of chiral nonlinearity for strong topological protection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear topology has been much less inquired compared to its linear counterpart. Existing advances have focused on nonlinearities of limited magnitudes and fairly homogeneous types. As such, the realizations have rarely been concerned with the requirements for nonlinearity. Here we explore nonlinear topological protection by determining nonlinear rules and demonstrate their relevance in real-world experiments. We take advantage of chiral symmetry and identify the condition for its continuation in general nonlinear environments. Applying it to one-dimensional topological lattices, we show possible evolution paths for zero-energy edge states that preserve topologically nontrivial phases regardless of the specifics of the chiral nonlinearities. Based on an acoustic prototype design with non-local nonlinearities, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally implement the nonlinear topological edge states that persist in all nonlinear degrees and directions without any frequency shift. Our findings unveil a broad family of nonlinearities compatible with topological non-triviality, establishing a solid ground for future drilling in the emergent field of nonlinear topology.</description>

Abstract: The topological states of the two-leg and three-leg ladders formed by two trivial quantum wires with different lattice constants are theoretically investigated. Firstly, we take two trivial quantum wires with a lattice constant ratio of 1:2 as an example. For the symmetric nearest-neighbor intra-chain hopping two-leg ladder, the inversion symmetry protected topological insulator phase with two degenerate topological edge states appears. When the inversion symmetry is broken, the topological insulators with one or two topological edge states of different energies and topological metals with edge states embedded in the bulk states could emerge depending on the filling factor. The topological origin of these topological states in the two-leg ladders is the topological properties of the Chern insulators and Chern metals. According to the arrangement of two trivial quantum wires, we construct two types of three-leg ladders. Each type of the three-leg ladder could be divided into one trivial subspace and one topological nontrivial subspace by unitary transformation. The topological nontrivial subspace corresponds to the effective two-leg ladder model. As the filling factor changes, the system could be in topological insulators or topological metals phases. When the two-leg ladder is constructed by two trivial quantum wires with a lattice constant ratio of 1:3 and 2:3, the system could also realize rich topological states such as the topological insulators and topological metals with the topological edge states. These rich topological states in the two-leg and three-leg ladders could be confirmed by current experimental techniques.</description>

      <title>Quantification of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in two-dimensional hole gases</title>

Abstract: We theoretically investigate heavy-hole--light-hole mixing in two-dimensional hole gases (2DHG). We restrict our analysis to the zone center, appropriate for the low-density regime, which leads to a simple description, analytical results, and physical insights. We identify two different types of hole-Hamiltonian terms concerning mixing. The first type changes the direction of the pure spinors, without admixing light-hole components. It is efficient for Rabi driving the heavy-hole spin. The second type induces mixing and changes the eigenvalues of the $g$-tensor. We analyze several measures that characterize the mixing quantitatively in Ge, Si, and GaAs, namely the $g$-factor, the light-hole weight in the wave function, the off-diagonal matrix elements in the Hamiltonian, and the strength of the induced spin-orbit interaction. We identify the canonical coordinate frame associated with a generic spin-3/2 Hamiltonian with time-reversal symmetry (TRS). In this coordinate frame, the mixing is quantified by a single parameter, the mixing angle $\vartheta$. We interpret it as the canonical (coordinate-frame and Hamiltonian-basis independent) measure of the heavy-hole--light-hole mixing. All the investigated mixing measures are simple functions of $\vartheta$. As an illustration, we use our model to analyze heavy-hole spin qubit $g$-tensor, dephasing, relaxation, and Rabi frequencies, interpreting the arising effects as due to rotations of the canonical frame and changes of the mixing angle $\vartheta$.</description>

      <title>Influence of surface relaxations on scanning probe microscopy images of the charge density wave material 2H-NbSe$_2$</title>

Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy is the method of choice for characterizing charge density waves by imaging the variation in atomic-scale contrast of the surface. Due to the measurement principle of scanning tunneling microscopy, the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom are convoluted, making it difficult to disentangle a structural displacement from spatial variations in the electronic structure. In this work, we characterize the influence of the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms on the 3 x 3 charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images of 2H-NbSe$_2$. In scanning tunneling microscopy images, we observe the 3 x 3 charge density wave superstructure and atomic lattice at all probed tip-sample distances. In contrast, non-contact atomic force microscopy images show both periodicities only at small tip-sample distances while, unexpectedly, a 3 x 3 superstructure is present at larger tip-sample distances. Using density functional theory calculations, we qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings and indicate that the 3 x 3 superstructure at different tip-sample distances in non-contact atomic force microscopy images is a result from different underlying interactions. In addition, we show that the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms has a negligible influence to the contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy images. Our combined experimental and theoretic work presents a method on how to discriminate the influence of the surface corrugation from the variation of the charge density to the charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images, which can provide insights into the influence of structural disorder to a charge density wave ground state.</description>

      <title>Family of third-order topological insulators from Su-Schrieffer-Heeger stacking</title>

Abstract: We construct a family of chiral symmetry-protected third-order topological insulators by stacking Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains and provide a unified topological characterization by a series of Bott indices. Our approach is informed by the analytical solution of corner states for the model Hamiltonians written as a summation of the extended SSH model along three orthogonal directions. By utilizing the generalized Pauli matrices, an enumeration of the constructed model Hamiltonians generates ten distinct models, including the well-studied three-dimensional Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model. By performing a boundary projection analysis for the ten models, we find that certain surfaces and hinges of the systems can exhibit, respectively, nontrivial second-order and first-order topology in the phase of the third-order topological insulators. Furthermore, we analyze the phase diagram for one of the predicted models and reveal a rich set of topological phases, including the third-order topological insulators, second-order weak topological insulators, and second-order nodal semimetals.</description>

      <title>Impact of Josephson junction array modes on fluxonium readout</title>

Abstract: Dispersive readout of superconducting qubits is often limited by readout-drive-induced transitions between qubit levels. While there is a growing understanding of such effects in transmon qubits, the case of highly nonlinear fluxonium qubits is more complex. We theoretically analyze measurement-induced state transitions (MIST) during the dispersive readout of a fluxonium qubit. We focus on a new mechanism: a simultaneous transition/excitation involving the qubit and an internal mode of the Josephson junction array in the fluxonium circuit. Using an adiabatic Floquet approach, we show that these new kinds of MIST processes can be relevant when using realistic circuit parameters and relatively low readout drive powers. They also contribute to excess qubit dephasing even after a measurement is complete. In addition to outlining basic mechanisms, we also investigate the dependence of such transitions on the circuit parameters. We find that with a judicious choice of frequency allocations or coupling strengths, these parasitic processes can most likely be avoided.</description>

      <title>Time-reversal symmetry breaking fractional quantum spin Hall insulator in moir\'e MoTe2</title>

Abstract: Twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, which support flat Chern bands with enhanced interaction effects, realize a platform for fractional Chern insulators and fractional quantum spin Hall (FQSH) insulators. A recent experiment has reported the emergence of a FQSH insulator protected by spin-Sz conservation at a moir\'e lattice filling factor {\nu}=3 in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2. Theoretical studies have proposed both time-reversal symmetric and asymmetric ground states as possible candidates for the observed FQSH insulator, but the nature of the state remains unexplored. Here we report the observation of spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking at generic fillings in 2.1-degree twisted bilayer MoTe2 from {\nu}&lt;1 all the way to {\nu}&gt;6 except at {\nu}=2, 4, and 6. Although zero Hall response is observed at {\nu}=3 for magnetic fields higher than 20 mT, a finite anomalous Hall response accompanied by a magnetic hysteresis is observed at lower magnetic fields, demonstrating spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Our work shows the tendency towards ferromagnetism by doping the first three pairs of conjugate Chern bands in the material; it also sheds light on the nature of the FQSH insulator at {\nu}=3.</description>

      <title>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</description>
