      <title>SF-R You Sure? The Conflicting Role of Star Formation Rates in Constraining the Evolution of Milky Way Analogues in Cosmological Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Milky Way analogues (MWAs) have long been studied by astronomers to place our Galaxy within an extragalactic context. With the power of cosmological simulations, we are now able to not only characterize MWAs today, but also watch as they evolve through cosmic time. We use the EAGLE and IllustrisTNG simulations to study a group of MWAs defined by their stellar mass (SM) and star formation rate (SFR). We trace these galaxies back along their evolution to investigate the star forming and mass assembly tracks taken by a galaxy to become a MWA today in light of these chosen parameters. We also take mock-observations of "MWAs" at $z&gt;0$ and trace them forwards in time to determine if galaxies that looked similar to the Milky Way earlier in their evolution still look like the Milky Way today, thus quantifying a selection efficiency which could inform future observational studies of MWAs. We find that most galaxies with Milky Way-SM follow a similar evolution regardless of present-day SFR, although MWAs in IllustrisTNG generally have not quenched, leading to star formation histories that produce "too-blue" galaxies today. Additionally, we find contamination by MWA-"imposters" in our mock-observations, with low selection efficiency at high redshift due to the tight constraint requiring convergence to the Milky Way's present-day SFR. Our work suggests present-day SM may suffice as a stand-alone selection parameter and helps to clarify how MWAs should be selected, and thus will be an important reference for future studies of both simulated and observed MWAs.</description>

      <title>The initial mass function of stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The initial mass function (IMF) is one of the most important functions in astrophysics because it is key to reconstructing the cosmological matter cycle, understanding the formation of super-massive black holes, and deciphering the light from high-redshift observations. The IMF's dependency on the physical conditions of the gas and its connection to the galaxy-wide IMF connects the molecular clumps to the cosmological scale. The extraction of the IMF from observational data requires a thorough understanding of stellar evolution, the time-dependent stellar multiplicity, the stellar-dynamical evolution of dense stellar populations, and the structures, star formation histories, and chemical enrichment histories of galaxies. The IMF in galaxies, referred to as the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF), and the IMF in individual star-forming regions (the stellar IMF) need not be the same, although the former must be related to the latter. Observational surveys inform on whether star-forming regions provide evidence for the stellar IMF being a probability density distribution function. They may also indicate star formation to optimally follow an IMF shaped by the physical conditions of the star-forming gas. Both theoretical and observational evidence suggest a relationship between the initial mass function of brown dwarfs and that of stars. Late-type stars may arise from feedback-regulated fragmentation of molecular cloud filaments, which build up embedded clusters. In contrast, early-type stars form under more violent accretion and feedback-regulated conditions near the centers of these clusters. The integration over all star-forming molecular cloud clumps and their stellar IMFs in a galaxy via the IGIMF theory yields its gwIMF which sensitively depends on the physical properties of the molecular cloud clumps and the range of their masses that depends on the SFR of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>On the impact of AGN feedback modes onto the turbulent properties of the multiphase ICM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) plays a crucial role in regulating the thermodynamics and the dynamics of the intracluster medium (ICM). Studying the turbulent patterns of the hot and warm ionized phases may allow us to determine how these phases are involved in the AGN cycle and the amount of turbulent pressure generated by the latter. In this work, we use new simulations to study the turbulent motions created by different types of AGN feedback in a cool core cluster and predict the observable signatures with the latest X-ray telescopes (e.g. XRISM). We run several hydrodynamic simulations with ENZO, simulating the self-regulated cycles of AGN feedback, starting from a static ICM in a cluster that represents the Perseus cluster. We study in detail different feedback modes: from pure kinetic precessing jets up to almost pure thermal feedback. Our analysis reveals that the gas velocity dispersion in the center of the cluster correlates in time with the peaks of the AGN activity and that more than 50% of the time, different feedback modalities produce the velocity dispersion observed in the Perseus cluster while leading to distinct geometrical distributions and velocity dispersion profiles. Moreover, we do not find a significant kinematic coupling between the hot and the cold phase kinematics. We find a correlation between the AGN activity and the steepening of the velocity function structure (VSF) and that the projected 2D VSF slopes are never trivially correlated with the 3D VSF ones. This line of research will allow us to use incoming detections of gas turbulent motions detectable by XRISM (or future instruments) to better constrain the duty cycle, energetics and energy dissipation modalities of AGN feedback in massive clusters of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic thermal conduction on a moving mesh for cosmological simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In weakly collisional, strongly magnetised plasmas such as the intracluster medium (ICM), hot accretion flows and the solar corona, the transport of heat and momentum occurs primarily along magnetic field lines. In this paper we present a new scheme for modelling anisotropic thermal conduction which we have implemented in the moving mesh code AREPO. Our implementation uses a semi-implicit time integration scheme which works accurately and efficiently with individual timestepping, making the scheme highly suitable for use in cosmological simulations. We apply the scheme to a number of test-problems including the diffusion of a hot patch of gas in a circular magnetic field, the progression of a point explosion in the presence of thermal conduction, and the evolution and saturation of buoyancy instabilities in anisotropically conducting plasmas. We use these idealised tests to demonstrate the accuracy and stability of the solver and highlight the ways in which anisotropic conduction can fundamentally change the behaviour of the system. Finally, we demonstrate the solver's capability when applied to highly non-linear problems with deep timestep hierarchies by performing high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations of a galaxy cluster with conduction. We show that anisotropic thermal conduction can have a significant impact on the temperature distribution of the ICM and that whistler suppression may be relevant on cluster scales. The new scheme is, therefore, well suited for future work which will explore the role of anisotropic thermal conduction in a range of astrophysical contexts including the ICM of clusters and the circumgalactic medium of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Systematic Study of the Inner Structure of Molecular Tori in Nearby U/LIRGs using Velocity Decomposition of CO Rovibrational Absorption Lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the inner structure of the molecular torus around an active galactic nucleus is essential for understanding its formation mechanism. However, spatially resolving the torus is difficult because of its small size. To probe the clump conditions in the torus, we therefore perform the systematic velocity-decomposition analyses of the gaseous CO rovibrational absorption lines ($v=0\to 1,\Delta J=\pm 1$) at $\lambda\sim 4.67 \mathrm{\mu{m}}$ observed toward four (ultra)luminous infrared galaxies using the high-resolution ($R\sim 5000\text{--}10000$) spectroscopy from the Subaru Telescope. We find that each transition has two to five distinct velocity components with different line-of-sight (LOS) velocities ($V_\mathrm{LOS}\sim -240\text{--}+100\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$) and dispersions ($\sigma_V\sim 15\text{--}190\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$); i.e., the components (a), (b), ..., beginning with the broadest one in each target, indicating that the tori have clumpy structures. By assuming a hydrostatic disk ($\sigma_V\propto R_\mathrm{rot}^{-0.5}$), we find that the tori have dynamic inner structures, with the innermost component (a) outflowing with velocity $|V_\mathrm{LOS}|\sim 160\text{--}240\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, and the outer components (b) and (c) outflowing more slowly or infalling with $|V_\mathrm{LOS}|\lesssim 100\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$. In addition, we find that the innermost component (a) can be attributed to collisionally excited hot ($\gtrsim 530$K) and dense ($n_\mathrm{H_2}\gtrsim 10^6\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$) clumps, based on the level populations. Conversely, the outer component (b) can be attributed to cold ($\sim 30\text{--}140$K) clumps radiatively excited by a far-infrared-to-submillimeter background with a brightness temperature higher than $\sim 20\text{--}400$K. These observational results demonstrate the clumpy and dynamic structure of tori in the presence of background radiation.</description>

      <title>The NuSTAR Local AGN $N_{\rm H}$ Distribution Survey (NuLANDS) I: Towards a Truly Representative Column Density Distribution in the Local Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07339v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard X-ray-selected samples of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) provide one of the cleanest views of supermassive black hole accretion, but are biased against objects obscured by Compton-thick gas column densities of $N_{\rm H}$ $&gt;$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$. To tackle this issue, we present the NuSTAR Local AGN $N_{\rm H}$ Distribution Survey (NuLANDS)$-$a legacy sample of 122 nearby ($z$ $&lt;$ 0.044) AGN primarily selected to have warm infrared colors from IRAS between 25$-$60 $\mu$m. We show that optically classified type 1 and 2 AGN in NuLANDS are indistinguishable in terms of optical [OIII] line flux and mid-to-far infrared AGN continuum bolometric indicators, as expected from an isotropically selected AGN sample, while type 2 AGN are deficient in terms of their observed hard X-ray flux. By testing many X-ray spectroscopic models, we show the measured line-of-sight column density varies on average by $\sim$ 1.4 orders of magnitude depending on the obscurer geometry. To circumvent such issues we propagate the uncertainties per source into the parent column density distribution, finding a directly measured Compton-thick fraction of 35 $\pm$ 9%. By construction, our sample will miss sources affected by severe narrow-line reddening, and thus segregates sources dominated by small-scale nuclear obscuration from large-scale host-galaxy obscuration. This bias implies an even higher intrinsic obscured AGN fraction may be possible, although tests for additional biases arising from our infrared selection find no strong effects on the measured column-density distribution. NuLANDS thus holds potential as an optimized sample for future follow-up with current and next-generation instruments aiming to study the local AGN population in an isotropic manner.</description>

      <title>Here There Be (Dusty) Monsters: High Redshift AGN are Dustier Than Their Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST spectroscopy has discovered a population of $z \gtrsim 3.5$ galaxies with broad Balmer emission lines, and narrow forbidden lines, that are consistent with hosting active galactic nuclei (AGN). Many of these systems, now known as ``little red dots" (LRDs), are compact and have unique colors that are very red in the optical/near-infrared and blue in the ultraviolet. The relative contribution of galaxy starlight and AGN to these systems remains uncertain, especially for the galaxies with unusual blue+red spectral energy distributions. In this work, we use Balmer decrements to measure the independent dust attenuation of the broad and narrow emission-line components of a sample of 29 broad-line AGN identified from three public JWST spectroscopy surveys: CEERS, JADES, and RUBIES. Stacking the narrow components from the spectra of 25 sources with broad H$\rm{\alpha}$ and no broad H$\rm{\beta}$ results in a median narrow H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ = $2.47^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$ (consistent with $A_{v} = 0$) and broad H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ $&gt; 8.85$ ($A_{v} &gt; 3.63$). The narrow and broad Balmer decrements imply little-to-no attenuation of the narrow emission lines, which are consistent with being powered by star formation and located on larger physical scales. Meanwhile, the lower limit in broad H$\rm{\alpha}$/H$\rm{\beta}$ decrement, with broad H$\rm{\beta}$ undetected in the stacked spectrum of 25 broad-H$\rm{\alpha}$ AGN, implies significant dust attenuation of the broad-line emitting region that is presumably associated with the central AGN. Our results indicate that these systems, on average, are consistent with heavily dust-attenuated AGN powering the red parts of their SED while their blue UV emission is powered by unattenuated star formation in the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Application of Manifold Learning to Selection of Different Galaxy Populations and Scaling Relation Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing volume of data produced by large astronomical surveys necessitates the development of efficient analysis techniques capable of effectively managing high-dimensional datasets. This study addresses this need by demonstrating some applications of manifold learning and dimensionality reduction techniques, specifically the Self-Organizing Map (SOM), on the optical+NIR SED space of galaxies, with a focus on sample comparison, selection biases, and predictive power using a small subset. To this end, we utilize a large photometric sample from the five CANDELS fields and a subset with spectroscopic measurements from the KECK MOSDEF survey in two redshift bins at $z\sim1.5$ and $z\sim2.2$. We trained SOM with the photometric data and mapped the spectroscopic data onto it as our study case. We found that MOSDEF targets do not cover all SED shapes existing in the SOM. Our findings reveal that Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) within the MOSDEF sample are mapped onto the more massive regions of the SOM, confirming previous studies and known selection biases towards higher-mass, less dusty galaxies. Furthermore, SOM were utilized to map measured spectroscopic features, examining the relationship between metallicity variations and galaxy mass. Our analysis confirmed that more massive galaxies exhibit lower [OIII]/H$\beta$ and [OIII]/[OII] ratios and higher H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ ratios, consistent with the known mass-metallicity relation. These findings highlight the effectiveness of SOM in analyzing and visualizing complex, multi-dimensional datasets, emphasizing their potential in data-driven astronomical studies.</description>

      <title>Intense star cluster formation: stellar masses, the mass function, and the fundamental mass scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the birth environment of a massive globular cluster, the combination of a luminous young stellar population and a high column density induces a state in which the thermal optical depth and radiation pressure are both appreciable. In this state, the sonic mass scale, which influences the peak of the stellar mass function, is tied to a fundamental scale composed of the Planck mass and the mass per particle. Thermal feedback also affects the opacity-limited minimum mass and affects how protostellar outflows and binary fragmentation modify stellar masses. Considering the regions that collapse to form massive stars, we argue that thermal stabilization is likely to flatten the high-mass slope of the initial mass function. Among regions that are optically thick to thermal radiation, we expect the stellar population to become increasingly top-heavy at higher column densities, although this effect can be offset by lowering the metallicity. A toy model is presented that demonstrates these effects, and in which radiation pressure leads to gas dispersal before all of the mass is converted into stars.</description>

      <title>Massive Star Cluster Formation with Binaries. I. Evolution of Binary Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the evolution of populations of binary stars within massive cluster-forming regions. We simulate the formation of young massive star clusters within giant molecular clouds with masses ranging from 2 x 10$^{4}$ to 3.2 x 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We use Torch, which couples stellar dynamics, magnetohydrodynamics, star and binary formation, stellar evolution, and stellar feedback through the AMUSE framework. We find that the binary fraction decreases during cluster formation at all molecular cloud masses. The binaries' orbital properties also change, with stronger and quicker changes in denser, more massive clouds. Most of the changes we see can be attributed to the disruption of binaries wider than 100 au, although the close binary fraction also decreases in the densest cluster-forming region. The binary fraction for O stars remains above 90%, but exchanges and dynamical hardening are ubiquitous, indicating that O stars undergo frequent few-body interactions early during the cluster formation process. Changes to the populations of binaries are a by-product of hierarchical cluster assembly: most changes to the binary population take place when the star formation rate is high and there are frequent mergers between sub-clusters in the cluster-forming region. A universal primordial binary distribution based on observed inner companions in the Galactic field is consistent with the binary populations of young clusters with resolved stellar populations, and the scatter between clusters of similar masses could be explained by differences in their formation history.</description>

      <title>Comparing E-MOSAICS predictions of high-redshift proto-globular clusters with JWST observations in lensed galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging and strong gravitational lensing of high-redshift galaxies have enabled the detection of compact sources with properties similar to nearby massive star clusters. Often found to be very young, these sources may be globular clusters detected in their earliest stages. In this work, we compare predictions of high-redshift ($z \sim 1$--$10$) star cluster properties from the E-MOSAICS simulation of galaxy and star cluster formation with those of the star cluster candidates in strongly lensed galaxies from James Webb (JWST) and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging. We select galaxies in the simulation that match the luminosities of the majority of lensed galaxies with star cluster candidates observed with JWST. We find that the luminosities, ages and masses of the brightest star cluster candidates in the high-redshift galaxies are consistent with the E-MOSAICS model. In particular, the brightest cluster ages are in excellent agreement. The results suggest that star clusters in both low- and high-redshift galaxies may form via common mechanisms. However, the brightest clusters in the lensed galaxies tend to be $\approx 1$--$1.5$ mag brighter and $\approx 0.5$ dex more massive than the median E-MOSAICS predictions. We discuss the large number of effects that could explain the discrepancy, including simulation and observational limitations, stellar population models, cluster detection biases and nuclear star clusters. Understanding these limitations would enable stronger tests of globular cluster formation models.</description>

      <title>DESI Emission Line Galaxies: Unveiling the Diversity of [OII] Profiles and its Links to Star Formation and Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the [OII] profiles of emission line galaxies (ELGs) from the Early Data Release of the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). To this end, we decompose and classify the shape of [OII] profiles with the first two eigenspectra derived from Principal Component Analysis. Our results show that DESI ELGs have diverse line profiles which can be categorized into three main types: (1) narrow lines with a median width of ~50 km/s, (2) broad lines with a median width of ~80 km/s, and (3) two-redshift systems with a median velocity separation of ~150 km/s, i.e., double-peak galaxies. To investigate the connections between the line profiles and galaxy properties, we utilize the information from the COSMOS dataset and compare the properties of ELGs, including star-formation rate (SFR) and galaxy morphology, with the average properties of reference star-forming galaxies with similar stellar mass, sizes, and redshifts. Our findings show that on average, DESI ELGs have higher SFR and more asymmetrical/disturbed morphology than the reference galaxies. Moreover, we uncover a relationship between the line profiles, the excess SFR and the excess asymmetry parameter, showing that DESI ELGs with broader [OII] line profiles have more disturbed morphology and higher SFR than the reference star-forming galaxies. Finally, we discuss possible physical mechanisms giving rise to the observed relationship and the implications of our findings on the galaxy clustering measurements, including the halo occupation distribution modeling of DESI ELGs and the observed excess velocity dispersion of the satellite ELGs.</description>

      <title>A New Statistical Analysis of the Morphology of Spiral Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphology is the starting point for understanding galaxies. Elmegreen et al. classified spiral galaxies into flocculent, multiple-arm, and grand-design galaxies based on the regularity of their spiral arm structure. With the release of a vast number of clear spiral galaxy images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we conducted a morphological classification of 5093 blue spiral galaxies. A statistical analysis of this sample shows that the fractions of flocculent, multiple-arm, and grand-design galaxies are 38 $\pm$ 1%, 59 $\pm$ 1%, and 3 $\pm$ 1%, respectively. Redshift has no obvious influence on this classification. However, as the bulge size becomes larger, the fraction of multiple-arm galaxies increases, while that of flocculent galaxies decreases. In addition, we performed a statistical analysis of 3958 galaxies with a clear spiral arm structure, finding 82% of these galaxies have two arms in their inner regions. We also found that the majority (74%) of the barred spiral galaxies exhibit the characteristics of two inner spiral arms and multiple outer spiral arms, and there is no barred spiral galaxy in this work with four continuous spiral arms from the inner to the outer regions. These results highlight that the spiral arm structure of the Milky Way, according to the current mainstream view of a four-arm galaxy with continuous arms extending from the inner to outer regions, is quite unique. However, our findings align with the spiral morphology of the Milky Way proposed by Xu et al., in which case our Galaxy can be considered typical.</description>

      <title>Ice origins of OCS and chemistry of CS2-bearing ice mantles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the formation of carbonyl sulfide (OCS) in interstellar ices is key to constrain the sulfur chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM), since it is the only ice S-bearing molecule securely detected thus far. Two general pathways for OCS formation have been proposed: sulfurization of CO (CO+S) and oxidation of CS (CS+O), but their relative contribution in interstellar ices remains unconstrained. We have evaluated the contribution of both pathways to OCS formation upon energetic processing in isotopically-labeled CO2:CS2 and CO:CS2 ice samples at 7-50 K. Our results indicated that formation of OCS through the CS+O pathway was more favorable than through the CO+S pathway, as previously suggested by theoretical calculations. In addition, its relative contribution increased at higher temperatures. Therefore, this pathway could play a role in the ice formation of OCS, especially in warm regions where CO is expected to be preferentially in the gas phase. At the same time, we have explored the chemistry of CS2-bearing, CO2-, CO-, and also H2O-rich ices, that could be relevant to the sulfur interstellar chemistry. We observed formation of a variety of S-bearing products in addition to OCS, including SO2, C3S2, and S2. However, a significant fraction of sulfur was not detected at the end of the experiments, and could be locked in long, undetectable sulfur allotropes, one of the potential carriers of the missing sulfur in the dense ISM.</description>

      <title>Observations of pre- and proto-brown dwarfs in nearby clouds: paving the way to further constraining theories of brown dwarf formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brown Dwarfs (BDs) are crucial objects in our understanding of both star and planet formation. However, there is still an unconcluded debate about which is the dominant formation mechanism of these objects. For this, it is mandatory to study BDs in their earliest evolutionary stages (what we call pre- and proto-BDs), comparable to the `pre-stellar' and `Class 0/I' stages well characterized for the formation of low-mass stars. In this review, the recent efforts aimed at searching, identifying and characterising pre- and proto-BD candidates in nearby star-forming regions are presented, and revised requirements for an object to be a promising proto-BD or pre-BD candidate are provided, based on a new, unexplored so far, relation between the internal luminosity and the accreted mass. By applying these requirements, a list of 67 promising proto-BD candidates is presented, along with a compilation of possible pre-BDs from the literature. Updated correlations of protostellar properties such as mass infall rate or outflow momentum rate with bolometric luminosity are provided down to the low-mass BD regime, where no significant deviations are apparent. Furthermore, the number of proto-BD candidates in different clouds of the Solar Neighborhood seem to follow the known relations of number of protostars with cloud properties. In addition, proto(star-to-BD) ratios for the different clouds are also explored, unveiling a particular underproduction of low-mass proto-BD candidates in Ophiuchus compared to Lupus and Taurus. Possible explanations for this behavior are discussed, including heating of the Ophiuchus cloud by the nearby OB stars. The overall results of this work tend to favor a star-like process for BD formation down to the planetary boundary, of about 10 Mjup, below which other mechanisms might be at work.</description>

      <title>Barions and $\Lambda$CDM Model Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the inner profiles of the rotation curves of galaxies in the velocity range from dwarf galaxies to Milky-way like galaxies, having maximum of rotation, $V_{\rm max}$, in the range [30-250] km/s, whose diversity is much larger than that predicted by the $\Lambda$CDM model. After showing that the scatter in the observed rotation curves is much larger that that predicted by dark matter-only cosmologies, we show how taking into account baryons, through a semi-analytical code, allows to create a a variety of rotation curves in agreement with observation. Simultaneoulsy, we show that the the quoted discrepancy does not need for different form of dark matter as advocated by [1], and [2]. We finally show how our model can reobtain the rotation curve of remarkable outliers like IC 2574, a 8 kpc cored profile having a challenging, and extremely low rising rotation curve, and UGC 5721 a cusp-like rotation curve galaxy. We suggest treating baryonic physics properly before introducing new exotic features, albeit legitimate, in the standard cosmological model</description>

      <title>Tracking on-the-fly massive black hole binary evolution and coalescence in galaxy simulations: RAMCOAL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from massive black hole binary (MBHB) coalescence motivates the development of a sub-grid model. We present RAMCOAL, integrated into the RAMSES code, which simulates the orbital evolution of MBHBs, accounting for stellar and gaseous dynamical friction (DF), stellar scattering, circumbinary disk interactions, and GW emission at scales below the simulation resolution. Unlike post-processing approaches, RAMCOAL tracks the real-time evolution of MBHBs within hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies using local quantities to model dynamics and accretion. This enables more accurate predictions of both GW signals and the properties of merging black holes. We validate RAMCOAL across isolated and merging galaxy setups at resolutions of 10, 50, and 100 pc, with and without black hole accretion and feedback. In addition, we test the model in seven galaxy merger scenarios at 100 pc resolution. These tests demonstrate that RAMCOAL is largely resolution-independent and successfully captures the effects of DF from stars, dark matter, and gas, loss-cone scattering, viscous drag from circumbinary disks, and GW emission -- all within a realistic galactic environment, even at low resolutions. With RAMCOAL, we can better estimate MBHB coalescence rates and the GW background, while providing insights into the electromagnetic counterparts of GW sources. This approach bridges the gap between electromagnetic observations and GW detection, offering a more comprehensive understanding of MBHB evolution in cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>A dichotomy in the 1-24 GHz parsec-scale radio spectra of radio-quiet quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the pc-scale radio spectra of a representative sample of 13 Palomar-Green (PG) radio-quiet quasars (RQQ), based on our new Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA) observations at 8.4 and 23.6 GHz and our earlier VLBA studies at 1.5 and 5.0 GHz. The radio core emission generally exhibits a flat spectrum at 1.5-5.0 GHz, which indicates a compact optically thick synchrotron source with a size extending down to at least the broad-line region (BLR) radius R_BLR ~0.01-0.1 pc. In comparison, the 8.4-23.6 GHz spectral slope remains flat in four objects indicating the inner radius of the radio source R_in &lt; 0.1 R_BLR, and becomes steep in another four objects indicating R_in ~0.5 R_BLR. The flat 8.4-23.6 GHz slope sources may be associated with a continuous flow, starting at the accretion disk corona and expanding outwards. The steep 8.4-23.6 GHz slope sources may be produced by an interaction of an AGN-driven wind with the BLR gas or a low-power jet extending to the BLR scale. The Eddington ratio L/L_Edd in seven of the eight objects with a flat or steep 8.4-23.6 GHz slope is low (&lt; 0.3). In contrast, the L/L_Edd in four of the remaining five objects, which the 8.4-23.6 GHz slope can not be significantly constrained, is high (&gt; 0.3), suggesting a radiation pressure driven wind. Future sub-millimeter observations can further constrain the inward radial extent of the radio emission down to the coronal scale.</description>

      <title>Forgotten treasures in the HST/FOC UV imaging polarimetric archives of active galactic nuclei III. Five years monitoring of M87</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active galactic nucleus (AGN) within M87, a giant elliptical galaxy, is responsible for one of the closest kiloparsec-scale relativistic jet to Earth. We unearthed unpublished M87 polarization maps taken with the Faint Object Camera (FOC) aboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST), obtained between 1995 and 1999. At a rate of one observation per year, we can follow the evolution of the polarized flux knots in the jet. We can thus constrain the time scale of variation of the magnetic field up to a spatial resolution of one tenth of an arcsecond (11.5 pc). After coherently reducing the five observations using the same methodology presented in the first paper of this series, the analysis of polarized maps from POS 1 (base of the jet) and POS 3 (end of the jet) reveals significant temporal and spatial dynamics in the jet's magnetic fields morphology. Despite minimal changes in overall intensity structure, notable fluctuations in polarization degrees and angles are detected across various knots and inter-knot regions. In addition, the emission and polarization characteristics of M87's jet differ significantly between POS1 and POS3. POS1 shows a more collimated jet with strong variability in polarization, while POS3 reveals a thicker structure, a quasi-absence of variability and complex magnetic field interactions. This suggests that the jet may have co-axial structures with distinct kinetic properties. Theoretical models like the jet-in-jet scenario, featuring double helical magnetic flux ropes, help explain these observations, indicating a strong density contrast and higher speeds in the inner jet.</description>

      <title>Determining the Magnetic Field in the Galactic Plane from New Arecibo Pulsar Faraday Rotation Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07967v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new method for studying the Galactic magnetic field along the spiral arms using pulsar Faraday rotation measures (RMs). Our new technique accounts for the dot-product nature of Faraday rotation and also splits the associated path integral into segments corresponding to particular zones along the LOS. We apply this geometrically-corrected, arm-by-arm technique to the low-latitude portion of a recently published set of Arecibo Faraday RMs for 313 pulsars along with previously obtained RMs in the same regions. We find disparities $&gt;1\sigma$ between the magnitude of the field above and below the plane in the Local Arm, Sagittarius Arm, Sagittarius-to-Scutum Interarm, the Scutum Arm, and Perseus Arm. We find evidence for a single field reversal near the Local/Sagittarius arm boundary. Interestingly, our results suggest that this field reversal is dependent on latitude, occurring inside the Sagittarius arm at negative Galactic latitudes and at the Local-to-Sagittarius Arm boundary at positive Galactic latitudes. We discuss all of our results in the context of different models and other observational Galactic magnetic field analyses.</description>

      <title>Star formation rate density as a function of galaxy mass at z &lt; 0.2 with MUSE and GAMA surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The star formation rate density (SFRD) is an important tool in galaxy evolution that allows us to identify at which cosmic time galaxies are more efficient at forming stars. For low-mass star-forming galaxies, the SFRD as a function of stellar mass can be straightforwardly related to the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF). Given the uncertainty of the GSMF at the low-mass end, due to the challenges in observing dwarf galaxies, deriving the SFRD with respect to mass may be crucial to understand galaxy formation. Measurement of SFRD is more complete than number density in a cosmological volume because galaxies with higher SFR are easier to detect and characterize. In this work, the SFRD is derived using two different samples, one using the MUSE WIDE and MUSE Hubble Ultra Deep Field IFU spectroscopic surveys, and another using the GAMA spectroscopic survey. The first sample comprised a total of 27 star-forming galaxies at z $&lt;$ 0.2 (H$\alpha$ selected), whereas the second contained 7579 galaxies at z $&lt;$ 0.06 ($r$-band selected). The star formation rates are derived from measurements of the H$\alpha$ emission line fluxes for the first sample, and using MagPhys SED fitting for the second one. The results show the behaviour of the SFRD to the lowest stellar masses of 10$^{5.5}$ $M_{\odot}$, consistent with a constant slope (in log SFRD versus log stellar mass) and thus no turn-over in the GSMF. The results also suggest that the volume considered for the MUSE WIDE and HUDF sample is underdense.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Velocity Fluctuations in Galaxy Mergers: A Probe of the Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields and turbulence are fundamental to the evolution of galaxies, yet their precise measurement and analysis present significant challenges. The recently developed Velocity Gradient Technique (VGT), which capitalizes on the anisotropy inherent in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, represents a new method for mapping magnetic fields in galaxies using spectroscopic observations. Most validations of VGT thus far, however, have relied upon idealized MHD turbulence simulations, which lack the more complex dynamics found in galaxies and galaxy mergers. In this study, we scrutinize VGT using an AREPO-based cosmological galaxy merger simulation, testing its effectiveness across pre-merger, merging, and post-merger stages. We examine the underlying assumptions of VGT and probe the statistics of gas density, velocity, and magnetic fields over time. We find that velocity fluctuations are indeed anisotropic at each stage, being larger in the direction perpendicular to the local magnetic field, as required by VGT. We find, additionally, that galaxy mergers substantially intensify velocity and density fluctuations and amplify magnetic fields at all scales. The observed scaling behavior of the velocity fluctuations corresponds to $r^{1/2}$ up to 0.4~kpc, shifting to a steeper trend between 0.6 and 3~kpc, and to a shallower trend thereafter. The scaling of the magnetic field and density fluctuations at scales $\lesssim$ 1.0 kpc also predominantly aligns with $r^{1/2}$. Finally, we compare results from VGT to those derived from polarization-based magnetic field measurements, finding consistent and statistically significant global agreement in all cases. This opens the way to applying VGT to external galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spectral classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral classification is the division of stars into classes based on their spectral characteristics. Different classification systems have existed since the 19th century but the term is used nowadays mostly to refer to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system, which was established in the 1940s and has been developed since then. The MK classification has three components: a spectral type, a luminosity class, and (possibly) suffixes or qualifiers. The first two components represent temperature and luminosity sequences (a 2-D grid), respectively, and the third one includes additional information. The MK system is an Aristotelian morphological classification system that uses the MK process, an inductive approach based on specimens (standard stars) that define the system. In that respect, it is different from and a required preliminary step for quantitative spectroscopy, whose goal is to extract the physical properties and chemical composition of the stars. In this entry we provide a brief history of spectral classification, describe the general properties of the classification criteria of the MK system, analyze the specific spectral type and luminosity class criteria used for each spectral class, and introduce the different peculiar types that can be found within the 2-D classification grid and at its edges.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Long-Ranged Interactions Between Dark Matter and the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter's existence is known thanks to its gravitational interaction with Standard Model particles, but it remains unknown whether this is the only force present between them. While many searches for such new interactions with dark matter focus on short-range, contact-like interactions, it is also possible that there exist weak, long-ranged forces between dark matter and the Standard Model. In this work, we present two types of constraints on such new interactions. First, we consider constraints arising from the fact that such a force would also induce long range interactions between Standard Model particles themselves, as well as between dark matter particles themselves. Combining the constraints on these individual forces generally sets the strongest constraints available on new Standard Model-dark matter interactions. Second, we consider the possibility of constraining new long-ranged interactions between dark matter and the Standard Model using the effects of dynamical friction in ultrafaint dwarf galaxies, especially Segue I. Such new interactions would accelerate the transfer of kinetic energy from stars to their surrounding dark matter, slowly reducing their orbits; the present-day stellar half-light radius of Segue I therefore allows us to exclude new forces which would have reduced stars' orbital radii below this scale by now.</description>

      <title>The effect of mass loss in models of red supergiants in the Small Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rate and mechanism of mass loss of red supergiants (RSGs) remain poorly understood, especially at low metallicities. Motivated by the new empirical prescription by Yang et al. 2023, based on the largest and most complete sample in the Small Magellanic Cloud, we investigate the impact of different popular and recent RSG mass-loss prescriptions that span a range of RSG mass-loss rates on the evolution and observable properties of single massive stars. Our results show that higher mass-loss rates result in earlier envelope stripping and shorter RSG lifetimes, particularly for the more luminous stars, leading to a steeper luminosity function and predicting hotter final positions for the SN progenitors. None of the considered mass-loss prescriptions is fully consistent with all observational constraints, highlighting ongoing uncertainties in deriving and modeling RSGs mass loss. The mass-loss rates suggested by Kee et al. predict rapid envelope stripping, inconsistent with the observed population of luminous RSGs and SN progenitor detections, while the models implementing the commonly used de Jager et al. and the recent Beasor et al. prescriptions overestimate the number of luminous RSGs. While the increased mass-loss rates for luminous RSGs predicted by Yang et al. lead to better agreement with the observed RSG luminosity function, naturally reproducing the updated Humphreys-Davidson limit, they also produce luminous yellow supergiant progenitors not detected in nearby supernovae. We also estimate that binary interactions tend to slightly increase the formation of luminous RSGs due to mass accretion or merging. Our study examines the impact of RSG mass loss during the late stages of massive stars, highlighting the significance of using comprehensive observational data, exploring the uncertainties involved, and considering the effects of binary-induced or episodic mass loss.</description>

      <title>An Intermediate Mass Black Hole Hidden Behind Thick Obscuration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent models suggest approximately half of all accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs; $M_{\rm BH}$ $\gtrsim$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$) are expected to undergo intense growth phases behind Compton-thick ($N_{\rm H}$ $&gt;$ 1.5 $\times$ 10$^{24}$ cm$^{-2}$) veils of obscuring gas. However, despite being a viable source for the seeding of SMBHs, there are currently no examples known of a Compton-thick accreting intermediate mass black hole (IMBH; $M_{\rm BH}$ $\sim$ 10$^{2}$ $-$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$). We present a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of IC 750 $-$ the only AGN to-date with a precise megamaser-based intermediate mass $&lt;$ 10$^{5}$ M$_{\odot}$. We find the equivalent width of neutral 6.4 keV Fe K$\alpha$ to be 1.9$^{+2.2}_{-1.0}$ keV via phenomenological modelling of the co-added 177 ks Chandra spectrum. Such large equivalent widths are seldom produced by processes other than fluorescence from dense obscuration. We fit three physically-motivated X-ray spectral models to infer a range of possible intrinsic 2$-$10 keV luminosity posteriors that encompass the systematic uncertainties associated with a choice of model. Despite a wide range of predicted intrinsic 2$-$10 keV luminosities between $\sim$ 10$^{41}$ and 10$^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, all three models agree that IC 750 has a Compton-thick line-of-sight column density to $&gt;$ 99\% confidence. Compton-thick obscuration is well-documented to impinge substantial bias on the pursuit of SMBH AGN. Our results thus provide the first indication that Compton-thick obscuration should also be properly considered to uncover and understand the IMBH population in an unbiased manner.</description>

      <title>Multi-messenger Probes of Supermassive Black Hole Spin Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the semi-analytic model Serotina, we investigate the cosmic spin evolution of supermassive black holes incorporating recent results from general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of spin-down from relativistic jets. We compare several variations of our model with compiled black hole spin measurements derived from X-ray reflection spectroscopy, correcting for a bias arising from the spin-dependent radiative efficiency of accretion flows. We show that the observed spin distribution is in agreement with a model that includes jet-driven spin-down, a key mechanism that acts to modulate spins across cosmic time at both high and very low specific accretion rates. The data also clearly prefer models with coherent accretion over models in which accretion disks rapidly switch from prograde to retrograde. We further predict spin distributions accessible via spatially resolved event horizons by the next-generation Event Horizon Telescope (ngEHT) and Black Hole Explorer (BHEX), as well as gravitational waves by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA), each of which offer unique and distinct windows into the population of spinning black holes. Jet-driven spin-down is most strongly imprinted on the abundance of very highly spinning objects in our model. In addition, we show that the spin distribution sampled by LISA events may contain a signature of the natal spin distribution of heavy seeds, but not of light seeds, offering additional discrimination between these seeding pathways. Spin distributions from these future observed samples can be used to constrain the detailed physical properties of the accretion flow on horizon scales around supermassive black holes.</description>

      <title>$\texttt{21cmLSTM}$: A Fast Memory-based Emulator of the Global 21 cm Signal with Unprecedented Accuracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural network (NN) emulators of the global 21 cm signal need emulation error much less than the observational noise in order to be used to perform unbiased Bayesian parameter inference. To this end, we introduce $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ -- a long short-term memory (LSTM) NN emulator of the global 21 cm signal that leverages the intrinsic correlation between frequency channels to achieve exceptional accuracy compared to previous emulators, which are all feedforward, fully connected NNs. LSTM NNs are a type of recurrent NN designed to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. When trained and tested on the same simulated set of global 21 cm signals as the best previous emulators, $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ has average relative rms error of 0.22% -- equivalently 0.39 mK -- and comparably fast evaluation time. We perform seven-dimensional Bayesian parameter estimation analyses using $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ to fit global 21 cm signal mock data with different adopted observational noise levels, $\sigma_{21}$. The posterior $1\sigma$ rms error is $\approx3\times$ less than $\sigma_{21}$ for each fit and consistently decreases for tighter noise levels, showing that $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ can sufficiently exploit even very optimistic measurements of the global 21 cm signal. We made the emulator, code, and data sets publicly available so that $\texttt{21cmLSTM}$ can be independently tested and used to retrain and constrain other 21 cm models.</description>

      <title>Simulating images of radio galaxies with diffusion models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With increasing amounts of data in astronomy, automated analysis methods have become crucial. Synthetic data is required for developing and testing such methods. Current simulations often suffer from insufficient detail or inaccurate representation of source type occurrences. To overcome those deficiencies, we implement a deep generative model trained on observations to generate realistic radio galaxy images with control over flux and source morphology. We use a Diffusion Model, trained with continuous time steps to reduce sampling time without quality impairments. Two models are trained on two different datasets, respectively. One is a selection of images from the second data release of the LOFAR Two-Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). The respective model is conditioned on peak flux values to preserve signal intensity information after re-scaling image pixel values. The other is a smaller set with images from the VLA survey of Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters (FIRST), where every image is provided with a morphological class label that the corresponding model is conditioned on. Conditioned sampling is realized with classifier-free diffusion guidance. We evaluate the quality of generated images by comparing distributions of different quantities over the real and generated data, including results from the standard source-finding algorithms. Class-conditioning is evaluated by training a classifier and comparing its performance on the real and generated data. We are able to generate realistic images of high quality using 25 sampling steps, which is unprecedented in the field of radio astronomy. Generated images are visually indistinguishable from the training data. Distributions of different image metrics are replicated. The classifier performs equally well for real and generated images, indicating accurate sampling control over morphological source properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The theoretical model suggests that relativistic jets of AGN rely on the black hole spin and/or accretion. We study the relationship between jet, accretion, and spin using supermassive black hole samples with reliable spin of black holes. Our results are as follows: (1) There is a weak correlation between radio luminosity and the spin of black hole for our sample, which may imply that the jet of the supermassive black hole in our sample depends on the other physical parameters besides black hole spins, such as accretion disk luminosity. (2) The jet power of a supermassive black hole can be explained by the hybrid model with magnetic field of corona. (3) There is a significant correlation between radio-loudness and black hole spin for our sample. These sources with high radio-loudness tend to have high black hole spins. These results provide observational evidence that the black hole spin may explain the bimodal phenomena of radio-loud and radio-quiet AGN.</description>

      <title>Neutron star mass in dark matter clumps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates a hypothesis proposed in previous research relating neutron star (NS) mass and its dark matter (DM) accumulation. As DM accumulates, NS mass decreases, predicting lower NS masses toward the Galactic center. Due to limited NSs data near the galactic center, we examine NSs located within DM clumps. Using the CLUMPY code simulations, we determine the DM clumps distribution, with masses from 10 to $10^{8}$ $M_{\odot}$ and scales from $10^{-3}$ to 10 kpc. These clumps' DM exhibit a peak at the center, tapering toward the outskirts, resembling our Galaxy's DM distribution.
  We analyse these DM clumps' NS mass variations, considering diverse DM particle masses and galaxy types. We find relatively stable NS mass within 0.01 to 5 kpc from the clump center. This stability supports the initial hypothesis, particularly for NSs located beyond 0.01 kpc from the clump center, where NS mass reaches a plateau around 0.1 kpc. Nevertheless, NS mass near the clump's periphery reveals spatial dependence: NS position within DM clumps influences its mass in Milky Way-type galaxies. Moreover, this dependence varies with the DM model considered.
  In summary, our study investigates the proposed link between NS mass and DM accumulation by examining NSs within DM clumps. While NS mass remains stable at certain distances from the clump center, spatial dependencies arise near the clump's outer regions, contingent on the specific DM model.</description>

      <title>Velocity Distribution of Dark Matter Spike around Schwarzschild Black Holes and Effects on Gravitational Waves from EMRIs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) constitutes the predominant portion of matter in our universe. Despite compelling evidence, the precise characteristics of DM remain elusive. Among the leading DM candidates are weakly-interacting massive particles, which may clump into steep concentrations around the central black holes of galaxies. However, DM profiles of the resulting dense spikes remain uncertain. Here we employ the relativistic dynamics in Schwarzschild geometry and first evaluate the velocity distributions of DM within such spikes. Through variations in black hole masses and dark halo parameters, we identify universal features in DM profiles and fit them with Gaussian distributions. Additionally, we illustrate with the impact of dynamical friction on gravitational waves generated by extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) within DM spikes, taking into account the velocity distribution of DM in the relativistic regime. Our findings demonstrate the phase shifts in the time-domain waveform, potentially providing useful insights for probing DM in galactic centers by gravitational-wave experiments.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the Kinematic Substructure of Local Dark Matter with LAMOST K Giants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Numerical simulations indicate that correlations exist between the velocity distributions of stars and dark matter (DM). We study the local DM velocity distribution based on these correlations. We select K giants from LAMOST DR8 cross-matched with {\gaia} DR3, which have robust measurements of velocity and metallicity, and separate them into the disk, halo substructure and isotropic halo components in the chemodynamical space utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model. The substructure component is highly radially anisotropic, and possibly related to the \gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GES) merger event, while the isotropic halo component is accreted from the earliest mergers following the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution (Standard Halo Model, SHM). We find that the GES-like substructure contributes $\sim85\%$ of the local nondisk stars in the Solar neighbourhood, which is nearly invariant when applying different volume cuts or additional angular momentum constraints. Utilizing the metallicity-stellar mass relation and the stellar mass-halo mass relation, we find that $\sim25_{-15}^{+24}\%$ of local DM is in the kinematic substructure. Combined with the stellar distributions of nondisk components, we modify the heliocentric velocity distribution of local DM. It shifts to a lower speed with a sharper peak compared to the SHM, and updates the detection limits of DM direct detection experiments. We discuss extensively the degeneracies present in the GMM fitting and propose that more kinematic and chemical information such as $\alpha$ abundance could help to break the degeneracy in the future. Our work confirms that the local DM velocity distribution deviates significantly from the SHM, and needs to be properly accounted for in the DM detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Kinematic study of the Orion Complex: Analysing the young stellar clusters from big and small structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09206v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we analysed young stellar clusters with spatial and kinematic coherence in the Orion star-forming complex. For this study, we selected a sample of pre-main sequence candidates using parallaxes, proper motions and positions on the colour-magnitude diagram. After applying a hierarchical clustering algorithm in the 5D parameter space provided by Gaia DR3, we divided the recovered clusters into two regimes: Big Structures and Small Structures, defined by the number of detected stars per cluster. In the first regime, we found 13 stellar groups distributed along the declination axis in the regions where there is a high density of stars. In the second regime, we recovered 34 clusters classified into two types: 14 as small groups completely independent from the larger structures, including four candidates of new clusters, and 12 classified as sub-structures embedded within five larger clusters. Additionally, radial velocity data from APOGEE-2 and GALAH DR3 was included to study the phase space in some regions of the Orion complex. From the Big Structure regime, we found evidence of a general expansion in the Orion OB1 association over a common centre, giving a clue about the dynamical effects the region is undergoing. Likewise, in the Small Structure regime, the projected kinematics shows the ballistic expansion in the $\lambda$ Orionis association and the detection of likely events of clusters' close encounters in the OB1 association.</description>

      <title>The warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) in inter-cluster filaments -- A forecast for HUBS observations based on eRASS1 superclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06836v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations indicate that nearly half of the baryons in the nearby Universe are in the warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) phase, with about half of which residing in cosmic filaments. Recent observational studies using stacked survey data and deep exposures of galaxy cluster outskirts have detected soft X-ray excess associated with optically identified filaments. However, the physical characteristics of WHIM in filaments remain largely undetermined due to the lack of direct spectral diagnostics. In this work, we aim to select appropriate targets for WHIM characterization through pointing observations with the future Hot Universe Baryon Surveyor (HUBS) mission, which is designed with eV level energy resolution in the 0.1-2.0 keV band and a 1 square degree field-of-view. We built a sample of 1577 inter-cluster filaments based on the first eROSITA All-Sky Survey (eRASS1) supercluster catalog and estimated their soft X-ray emission, and used their modeled geometrical properties and oxygen line intensities to select four most appropriate candidate targets for HUBS observations. By simulating and analyzing their mock observations, we demonstrated that with 200 ks HUBS exposure for each candidate, the gas properties of individual filaments can be accurately determined, with the temperature constrained to +-0.01 keV, metallicity constrained to &lt; +-0.03 solar, and density constrained to &lt; +-10%. Elemental abundance of O, Ne, Mg, and Fe can be measured separately, providing unprecedented insights into the chemical history of the filament gas. We also showed that direct mapping of the WHIM distribution is promising with narrow-band imaging of the O viii line. Our work forecasts that next-generation X-ray missions such as HUBS will provide substantial improvement in our understanding of the physical status and evolution history of the diffuse WHIM gas in cosmic large-scale structure.</description>

Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays (PTA) hunt for gravitational waves (GW) by searching for the correlations that GWs induce in the time-of-arrival residuals from different pulsars. If the GW sources are of astrophysical origin, then they are located at discrete points on the sky. However, PTA data are often modeled, and subsequently analyzed, via a "standard Gaussian ensemble". That ensemble is obtained in the limit of an infinite density of vanishingly weak, Poisson-distributed sources. In this paper, we move away from that ensemble, to study the effects of two types of "source anisotropy". The first (a), which is often called "shot noise", arises because there are $N$ discrete GW sources at specific sky locations. The second (b) arises because the GW source positions are not a Poisson process, for example, because galaxy locations are clustered. Here, we quantify the impact of (a) and (b) on the mean and variance of the pulsar-averaged Hellings and Downs correlation. For conventional PTA sources, we show that the effects of shot noise (a) are much larger than the effects of clustering (b).</description>
