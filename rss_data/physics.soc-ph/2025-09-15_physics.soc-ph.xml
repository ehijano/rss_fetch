      <title>Implications of regional variations in climate change vulnerability and mitigation behaviour for social-climate dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: How regional heterogeneity in social and cultural processes drive--and respond to--climate dynamics is little studied. Here we present a coupled social-climate model stratified across five world regions and parameterized with geophysical, economic and social survey data. We find that support for mitigation evolves in a highly variable fashion across regions, according to socio-economics, climate vulnerability, and feedback from changing temperatures. Social learning and social norms can amplify existing sentiment about mitigation, leading to better or worse global warming outcomes depending on the region. Moreover, mitigation in one region, as mediated by temperature dynamics, can influence other regions to act, or just sit back, thus driving cross-regional heterogeneity in mitigation opinions. The peak temperature anomaly varies by several degrees Celsius depending on how these interactions unfold. Our model exemplifies a framework for studying how global geophysical processes interact with population-scale concerns to determine future sustainability outcomes.</description>

      <title>Exploring Braess' paradox in pedestrian evacuation traffic: experiment and modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of the Braess' paradox in road traffic systems demonstrates the positive effect of transportation planning in improving efficiency. By contrast, the phenomenon has rarely been examined in pedestrian evacuation traffic. Yet the possibility that Braess' paradox could lengthen evacuation times under hazardous conditions has received little systematic attention. In this paper, we investigate Braess' paradox in pedestrian evacuation traffic through a series of supervised experiments and corresponding traffic assignment models to examine its potential occurrence. Our empirical and modeling results indicate that Braess' paradox is unlikely to be a prevalent phenomenon in pedestrian traffic systems. Specifically, under autonomous evacuation and the assumption of complete network knowledge, the paradox does not arise in high-demand evacuation contexts in our case studies. Under a more realistic assumption of limited network knowledge, however, the paradox can occur. These findings highlight the importance of information conditions for evacuation performance and provide guidance for the design and management of large public venues.</description>

      <title>The dimensions of accessibility: proximity, opportunities, values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accessibility is essential for designing inclusive urban systems. However, the attempt to capture the complexity of accessibility in a single universal metric has often limited its effective use in design, measurement, and governance across various fields. Building on the work of Levinson and Wu, we emphasise that accessibility consists of several key dimensions. Specifically, we introduce a conceptual framework that defines accessibility through three main dimensions: Proximity (which pertains to active, short-range accessibility to local services and amenities), Opportunity (which refers to quick access to relevant non-local resources, such as jobs or major cultural venues), and Value (which encompasses the overall quality and personal significance assigned to specific points of interest). While it is generally beneficial to improve accessibility, different users and contexts present unique trade-offs that make a one-size-fits-all solution neither practical nor desirable. Our framework establishes a foundation for a quantitative and integrative approach to modelling accessibility. It considers the complex interactions among its various dimensions and facilitates more systematic analysis, comparison, and decision-making across diverse contexts.</description>

      <title>Multi-sectoral Impacts of H2 and Synthetic Fuels Adoption for Heavy-duty Transportation Decarbonization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Policies focused on deep decarbonization of regional economies emphasize electricity sector decarbonization alongside electrification of end-uses. There is growing interest in utilizing hydrogen (H2) produced via electricity to displace fossil fuels in difficult-to-electrify sectors. One such case is heavy-duty vehicles (HDV), which represent a substantial and growing share of transport emissions as light-duty vehicles electrify. Here, we assess the bulk energy system impact of decarbonizing the HDV segment via either H2, or drop-in synthetic liquid fuels produced from H2 and CO2. Our analysis soft-links two modeling approaches: (a) a bottom-up transport demand model producing a variety of final energy demand scenarios for the same service demand and (b) a multi-sectoral capacity expansion model that co-optimizes power, H2 and CO2 supply chains under technological and policy constraints to meet exogenous final energy demands. Through a case study of Western Europe in 2040 under deep decarbonization constraints, we quantify the energy system implications of different levels of H2 and synthetic fuels adoption in the HDV sector under scenarios with and without CO2 sequestration. In the absence of CO2 storage, substitution of liquid fossil fuels in HDVs is essential to meet the deep decarbonization constraint across the modeled power, H2 and transport sectors. Additionally, utilizing H2 HDVs reduces decarbonization costs and fossil liquids demand, but could increase natural gas consumption. While H2 HDV adoption reduces the need for direct air capture (DAC), synthetic fuel adoption increases DAC investments and total system costs. The study highlights the trade-offs across transport decarbonization pathways, and underscores the importance of multi-sectoral consideration in decarbonization studies.</description>

      <title>The threshold and quasi-stationary distribution for the SIS model on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11706v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS) model on arbitrary networks. The well-established pair approximation treats neighboring pairs of nodes exactly while making a mean field approximation for the rest of the network. We improve the method by expanding the state space dynamically, giving nodes a memory of when they last became susceptible. The resulting approximation is simple to implement and appears to be highly accurate, both in locating the epidemic threshold and in computing the quasi-stationary fraction of infected individuals above the threshold, for both finite graphs and infinite random graphs.</description>

      <title>Fundamental limits on taming infectious disease epidemics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic control frequently relies on adjusting interventions based on prevalence. But designing such policies is a highly non-trivial problem due to uncertain intervention effects, costs and the difficulty of quantifying key transmission mechanisms and parameters. Here, using exact mathematical and computational methods, we reveal a fundamental limit in epidemic control in that prevalence feedback policies are outperformed by a single optimally chosen constant control level. Specifically, we find no incentive to use prevalence based control under a wide class of cost functions that depend arbitrarily on interventions and scale with infections. We also identify regimes where prevalence feedback is beneficial. Our results challenge the current understanding that prevalence based interventions are required for epidemic control and suggest that, for many classes of epidemics, interventions should not be varied unless the epidemic is near the herd immunity threshold.</description>

      <title>Understanding the importance of SHAPE to the UK research ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16701v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The UK has a long-established reputation for excellence in research across a broad range of fields, but in recent years, there has been greater emphasis on STEM investment and greater recognition of the UK's success in STEM. This paper examines the relative strengths of SHAPE disciplines and demonstrates that the UK's SHAPE research portfolio outperforms the UK's STEM research, for each international benchmark considered in this work. It is argued that SHAPE research is becoming increasingly important as a partner to STEM as the widespread use of technology creates societal challenges. It is also argued that the strength of UK SHAPE is the basis of a strategic advantage for UK research.</description>

      <title>Optimal Weights in a Two-Tier Voting System with Mean-Field Voters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.08636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse two-tier voting systems with voters described by a multi-group mean-field model that allows for correlated voters both within groups as well as across group boundaries. In this model voters are influenced by voters within their group (constituency, member state, etc.) in a positive way. Across group boundaries positive or negative influence is considered. The objective is to determine the optimal weights each group receives in the council, the upper level of the voting system, to minimise the expected quadratic deviation of the council vote from a hypothetical referendum of the overall population in the large population limit. The mean-field model exhibits different behaviour depending on the intensity of interactions between voters. When interaction is weak, we obtain optimal weights given by the sum of a constant term and a term proportional to the square root of the group's population. When interaction is strong, the optimal weights are in general not uniquely determined. Indeed, when all groups are positively coupled, any assignation of weights is optimal. For two competing clusters of groups, the difference in total weights must be a specific number, but the assignation of weights within each cluster is arbitrary. We also obtain conditions for both interaction regimes under which it is impossible to reach the minimal democracy deficit as some of the weights may be negative.</description>

      <title>Growth Regime Shifts in Empirical Networks: Evidence and Challenges from the Software Heritage and APS Citation Case Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10145v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution rules and degree distribution properties of the Software Heritage dataset, a large-scale growing network linking software releases and revisions from open-source communities. The network spans over 40 years and includes about 6 billion nodes and edges. Our analysis relies on natural temporal and topological partitions of nodes and edges.
  A derived temporalized graph reveals a bow-tie-like structure and enables study of edge dynamics -- creation, inheritance, and aging -- together with comparisons to minimal models. In- and out-degree distributions and edge timestamp histograms expose regime shifts linked to changes in developer practices, notably in the average number of edges per new node.
  Without presupposing its validity, we estimate the scaling exponent under the scale-free hypothesis. Results highlight the sensitivity of a widely used estimation method to regime changes and outliers, while showing that partitioning improves regularity and helps disentangle these effects.
  We extend the analysis to the APS citation network, which also exhibits a major regime shift around 1985, though driven by distinct factors. Both cases illustrate how structural and dynamical transitions complicate conclusions about the existence and observability of a scale-free regime. These findings underscore the need for refined tools to study transient growth phases and to enable robust comparisons between empirical growing networks and minimal models.</description>

      <title>Adversarial control of synchronization in complex oscillator networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02403v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates perturbation strategies inspired by adversarial attack principles from deep learning, designed to control synchronization dynamics through strategically crafted weak perturbations. We propose a gradient-based optimization method that identifies small phase perturbations to dramatically enhance or suppress collective synchronization in Kuramoto oscillator networks. Our approach formulates synchronization control as an optimization problem, computing gradients of the order parameter with respect to oscillator phases to determine optimal perturbation directions. Results demonstrate that extremely small phase perturbations applied to network oscillators can achieve significant synchronization control across diverse network architectures. Our analysis reveals that synchronization enhancement is achievable across various network sizes, while synchronization suppression becomes particularly effective in larger networks, with effectiveness scaling favorably with network size. The method is systematically validated on canonical model networks including scale-free and small-world topologies, and real-world networks representing power grids and brain connectivity patterns. This adversarial framework represents a novel paradigm for synchronization management by introducing deep learning concepts to networked dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Opinion formation in Wikipedia Ising networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22254v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study properties of opinion formation on Wikipedia Ising Networks. Each Wikipedia article is represented as a node and links are formed by citations of one article to another generating a directed network of a given language edition with millions of nodes. Ising spins are placed at each node and their orientation up or down is determined by a majority vote of connected neighbors. At the initial stage there are only a few nodes from two groups with fixed competing opinions up and down while other nodes are assumed to have no initial opinion with no effect on the vote. The competition of two opinions is modeled by an asynchronous Monte Carlo process converging to a spin polarized steady-state phase. This phase remains stable with respect to small fluctuations induced by an effective temperature of the Monte Carlo process. The opinion polarization at the steady-state provides opinion (spin) preferences for each node. In the framework of this Ising Network Opinion Formation model we analyze the influence and competition between political leaders, world countries and social concepts. This approach is also generalized to the competition between three groups of different opinions described by three colors, for example Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, Xi Jinping or USA, Russia, China within English, Russian and Chinese editions of Wikipedia of March 2025. We argue that this approach provides a generic description of opinion formation in various complex networks.</description>
