      <title>Supercompliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.14105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.14105v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a binary-treatment instrumental variable framework, we define supercompliers as the subpopulation whose treatment take-up positively responds to eligibility and whose outcome positively responds to take-up. Supercompliers are the only subpopulation to benefit from treatment eligibility and, hence, are important for policy. We provide tools to characterize supercompliers under a set of jointly testable assumptions. Specifically, we require standard assumptions from the local average treatment effect literature plus an outcome monotonicity assumption. Estimation and inference can be conducted with instrumental variable regression. In two job-training experiments, we demonstrate our machinery's utility, particularly in incorporating social welfare weights into marginal-value-of-public-funds analysis.</description>

      <title>EnsembleIV: Creating Instrumental Variables from Ensemble Learners for Robust Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02820v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite increasing popularity in empirical studies, the integration of machine learning generated variables into regression models for statistical inference suffers from the measurement error problem, which can bias estimation and threaten the validity of inferences. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to alleviate associated estimation biases. Our proposed approach, EnsembleIV, creates valid and strong instrumental variables from weak learners in an ensemble model, and uses them to obtain consistent estimates that are robust against the measurement error problem. Our empirical evaluations, using both synthetic and real-world datasets, show that EnsembleIV can effectively reduce estimation biases across several common regression specifications, and can be combined with modern deep learning techniques when dealing with unstructured data.</description>

      <title>Locally Regular and Efficient Tests in Non-Regular Semiparametric Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers hypothesis testing in semiparametric models which may be non-regular. I show that C($\alpha$) style tests are locally regular under mild conditions, including in cases where locally regular estimators do not exist, such as models which are (semiparametrically) weakly identified. I characterise the appropriate limit experiment in which to study local (asymptotic) optimality of tests in the non-regular case and generalise classical power bounds to this case. I give conditions under which these power bounds are attained by the proposed C($\alpha$) style tests. The application of the theory to a single index model and an instrumental variables model is worked out in detail.</description>

      <title>Randomly Assigned First Differences?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03208v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I consider treatment-effect estimation with a two-periods panel, using a first-difference regression of the outcome evolution $\Delta Y_g$ on the treatment evolution $\Delta D_g$. To justify this regression, one may assume that $\Delta D_g$ is as good as randomly assigned, namely uncorrelated to the residual of the first-differenced model and to the treatment's effect. This paper shows that if one posits a causal model in levels between the treatment and the outcome, then the residual of the first-differenced model is a function of the period-one treatment $D_{g,1}$, so the first-difference regression may suffer from an omitted variable bias whenever $\Delta D_g$ is correlated to $D_{g,1}$. To solve this problem, one can control for $E(\Delta D_g|D_{g,1})$ in the regression. I apply these results to a first-difference regression of the 1999 to 2007 employment evolutions of US industries on the evolution of their Chinese imports penetration ratio, estimated on the data of Acemoglu et al (2016). The first-difference regression indicates a large negative effect of Chinese imports on US employment, but $\Delta D_g$ and $D_{g,1}$ are very strongly correlated, so this regression may suffer from an omitted variable bias. If one controls for $E(\Delta D_g|D_{g,1})$, the effect of Chinese imports penetration on US employment is 33\% to 41\% smaller than in the first-difference regression, and less significant.</description>
