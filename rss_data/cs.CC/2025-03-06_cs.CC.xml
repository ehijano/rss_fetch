      <title>Towards a complexity-theoretic dichotomy for TQFT invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that for any fixed $(2+1)$-dimensional TQFT over $\mathbb{C}$ of either Turaev-Viro-Barrett-Westbury or Reshetikhin-Turaev type, the problem of (exactly) computing its invariants on closed 3-manifolds is either solvable in polynomial time, or else it is $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard to (exactly) contract certain tensors that are built from the TQFT's fusion category. Our proof is an application of a dichotomy result of Cai and Chen [J. ACM, 2017] concerning weighted constraint satisfaction problems over $\mathbb{C}$. We leave for future work the issue of reinterpreting the conditions of Cai and Chen that distinguish between the two cases (i.e. $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard tensor contractions vs. polynomial time invariants) in terms of fusion categories. We expect that with more effort, our reduction can be improved so that one gets a dichotomy directly for TQFTs' invariants of 3-manifolds rather than more general tensors built from the TQFT's fusion category.</description>

      <title>A Graph Width Perspective on Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding a Hamiltonian path with precedence constraints in the form of a partial order on the vertex set. This problem is known as Partially Ordered Hamiltonian Path Problem (POHPP). Here, we study the complexity for graph width parameters for which the ordinary Hamiltonian Path problem is in $\mathsf{FPT}$. We show that POHPP is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete for graphs of pathwidth 4. We complement this result by giving polynomial-time algorithms for graphs of pathwidth 3 and treewidth 2. Furthermore, we show that POHPP is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard for graphs of clique cover number 2 and $\mathsf{W[1]}$-hard for some distance-to-$\mathcal{G}$ parameters, including distance to path and distance to clique. In addition, we present $\mathsf{XP}$ and $\mathsf{FPT}$ algorithms for parameters such as distance to block and feedback edge set number.</description>

      <title>Novel Complexity Results for Temporal Separators with Deadlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider two variants, (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator and (s,z,l)-Temporal Cut, respectively, of the vertex separator and the edge cut problem in temporal graphs. The goal is to remove the minimum number of vertices (temporal edges, respectively) in order to delete all the temporal paths that have time travel at most l between a source vertex s and target vertex z. First, we solve an open problem in the literature showing that (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator is NP-complete even when the underlying graph has pathwidth bounded by four. We complement this result showing that (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator can be solved in polynomial time for graphs of pathwidth bounded by three. Then we consider the approximability of (s,z,l)-Temporal Separator and we show that it cannot be approximated within factor$2^{\Omega(\log^{1-\varepsilon}|V|)}$ for any constant $\varepsilon&gt; 0$, unless $NP \subseteq ZPP$ (V is the vertex set of the input temporal graph) and that the strict version is approximable within factor l - 1 (we show also that it is unliklely that this factor can be improved). Then we consider the (s,z,l)-Temporal Cut problem, we show that it is APX-hard and we present a $2 \log_2(2\ell)$ approximation algorithm.</description>

      <title>Bounding the computational power of bosonic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03600v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic quantum systems operate in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, unlike discrete-variable quantum systems. This distinct mathematical structure leads to fundamental differences in quantum information processing, such as an exponentially greater complexity of state tomography [MMB+24] or a factoring algorithm in constant space [BCCRK24]. Yet, it remains unclear whether this structural difference of bosonic systems may also translate to a practical computational advantage over finite-dimensional quantum computers. Here we take a step towards answering this question by showing that universal bosonic quantum computations can be simulated in exponential time on a classical computer, significantly improving the best previous upper bound requiring exponential memory [CJMM24]. In complexity-theoretic terms, we improve the best upper bound on $\textsf{CVBQP}$ from $\textsf{EXPSPACE}$ to $\textsf{EXP}$. This result is achieved using a simulation strategy based on finite energy cutoffs and approximate coherent state decompositions. While we propose ways to potentially refine this bound, we also present arguments supporting the plausibility of an exponential computational advantage of bosonic quantum computers over their discrete-variable counterparts. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of circuit energy as a resource and discuss why it may act as the fundamental bottleneck in realizing this advantage in practical implementations.</description>

      <title>Tractability results for integration in subspaces of the Wiener algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present some new (in-)tractability results related to the integration problem in subspaces of the Wiener algebra over the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We show that intractability holds for multivariate integration in the standard Wiener algebra in the deterministic setting, in contrast to polynomial tractability in an unweighted subspace of the Wiener algebra recently shown by Goda (2023). Moreover, we prove that multivariate integration in the subspace of the Wiener algebra introduced by Goda is strongly polynomially tractable if we switch to the randomized setting, where we obtain a better $\varepsilon$-exponent than the one implied by the standard Monte Carlo method. We also identify subspaces in which multivariate integration in the deterministic setting are (strongly) polynomially tractable and we compare these results with the bound which can be obtained via Hoeffding's inequality.</description>

      <title>Kolmogorov-Loveland betting strategies lose the Betting game on open sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19817v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether Kolmogorov-Loveland randomness (KLR) is the same as Martin-L\"of randomness (MLR) is a major open problem in the study of algorithmic randomness. More general classes of betting strategies than Kolmogorov-Loveland ones have been studied in \cite{MMS, Rute, TP}. In each case it was proven that the class induces a notion of randomness equivalent to MLR. In all of those proofs, it was shown that the class contains a finite set of betting strategies such that for any given bound, when betting on a binary sequence contained in an effective open set of small enough measure, at least one of the betting strategies in the set earns capital larger than the bound. We show that the class of Kolmogorov-Loveland betting strategies does not have this property.</description>
