      <title>Bifurcations of magnetic geodesic flows on surfaces of revolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study magnetic geodesic flows invariant under rotations on the 2-sphere. The dynamical system is given by a generic pair of functions $(f,\Lambda)$ in one variable. Topology of the Liouville fibration of the given integrable system near its singular orbits and singular fibers is described. Types of these singularities are computed. Topology of the Liouville fibration on regular 3-dimensional isoenergy manifolds is described by computing the Fomenko--Zieschang invariant. All possible bifurcation diagrams of the momentum maps of such integrable systems are described. It is shown that the bifurcation diagram consists of two curves in the $(h,k)$-plane. One of these curves is a line segment $h=0$, and the other lies in the half-plane $h\ge0$ and can be obtained from the curve $(a:-1:k) = (f:\Lambda:1)^*$ projectively dual to the curve $(f:\Lambda:1)$ by the transformation $(a:-1:k)\mapsto(a^2/2,k)=(h,k)$.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the maps with variable fractional order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fractional order differential and difference equations are used to model systems with memory. Variable order fractional equations are proposed to model systems where the memory changes in time. We investigate stability conditions for linear variable order difference equations where the order is periodic function with period $T$. We give a general procedure for arbitrary $T$ and for $T=2$ and $T=3$, we give exact results. For $T=2$, we find that the lower order determines the stability of the equations. For odd $T$, numerical simulations indicate that we can approximately determine the stability of equations from the mean value of the variables.</description>

      <title>A note on odometers and shadowing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a continuous self-map of a compact metric space, we provide a sufficient condition for the orbit of a point to converge to a periodic orbit or an odometer. We show that if a continuous self-map of a compact metric space has the shadowing property, then the set of points whose orbits converge to periodic orbits or odometers is dense.</description>

      <title>Global linearization without hyperbolicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a proof of an extension of the Hartman-Grobman theorem to nonhyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria of vector fields. Moreover, the linearizing topological conjugacy is (i) defined on the entire basin of attraction if the vector field is complete, and (ii) a $C^{k\geq 1}$ diffeomorphism on the complement of the equilibrium if the vector field is $C^k$ and the underlying space is not $5$-dimensional. We also show that the $C^k$ statement in the $5$-dimensional case is equivalent to the $4$-dimensional smooth Poincar\'{e} conjecture.</description>

      <title>A Sm\"org\aa sbord of (bi)contact structures, Reeb flows and pseudo-Anosov flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note was written for the proceedings of the conference "Symplectic Geometry and Anosov Flows" held in Heideleberg in July 2024. It is meant as an invitation to the study of certain families of contact structures, centering around the following question: ``How much can one relate the dynamics of two distinct Reeb flows of the same contact structure?'' We gather some results as well as state many more questions and conjectures around that theme.</description>

      <title>SIGGRAPH: G: Improved Projective Dynamics Global Using Snapshots-based Reduced Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a snapshots-based method to compute reduction subspaces for physics-based simulations. Our method is applicable to any mesh with some artistic prior knowledge of the solution and only requires a record of existing solutions during, for instance, the range-of-motion test that is required before approving a mesh character for an application. Our subspaces span a wider range of motion, especially large deformations, and rotations by default. Compared to the state-of-the-art, we achieve improved numerical stability, computational efficiency, and more realistic simulations with a smaller sub-space.</description>

      <title>Homeomorphism groups of basilica, rabbit and airplane Julia sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The airplane, the basilica and the Douady rabbit (and, more generally, rabbits with more than two ears) are well-known Julia sets of complex quadratic polynomials.
  In this paper we study the groups of all homeomorphisms of such fractals and of all automorphisms of their laminations.
  In particular, we identify them with some kaleidoscopic group or universal groups and thus realize them as Polish permutation groups.
  From these identifications, we deduce algebraic, topological and geometric properties of these groups.</description>

      <title>Central Limit Theorem for Sequential Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general approach to establish the Central Limit Theorem with error bounds for sequential dynamical systems. The main tool we develop is the application to this setting of a projective metric on complex cones, following the ideas introduced by Rugh and Dubois. To demonstrate the power of the proposed setting, we apply it to both sequential expanding maps, where similar results are known, and to sequential dispersing billiards, for which no such results are currently known.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note, we survey recent advances in the study of dynamical properties of the space of surfaces with constant curvature in three-dimensional manifolds of negative sectional curvature. We interpret this space as a two-dimensional analogue of the geodesic flow and explore the extent to which the thermodynamic properties of the latter can be generalized to the surface setting. Additionally, we apply this theory to derive geometric rigidity results, including the rigidity of the hyperbolic marked area spectrum.</description>

      <title>Bifurcations for Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.10726v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the dual variational principle and the saddle point reduction we use the abstract bifurcation theory recently developed by author in previous work to prove many new bifurcation results for solutions of four types of Hamiltonian boundary value problems nonlinearly depending on parameters. The most interesting and important among them are those alternative results which can only be proved with our generalized versions of the famous Rabinowitz's alternative bifurcation theorem.</description>

      <title>Estimating neural connection strengths from firing intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose and analyse a procedure for using a standard activity-based neuron network model and firing data to compute the effective connection strengths between neurons in a network. We assume a Heaviside response function, that the external inputs are given and that the initial state of the neural activity is known. The associated forward operator for this problem, which maps given connection strengths to the time intervals of firing, is highly nonlinear. Nevertheless, it turns out that the inverse problem of determining the connection strengths can be solved in a rather transparent manner, only employing standard mathematical tools. In fact, it is sufficient to solve a system of decoupled ODEs, which yields a linear system of algebraic equations for determining the connection strengths. The nature of the inverse problem is investigated by studying some mathematical properties of the aforementioned linear system and by a series of numerical experiments. Finally, under an assumption preventing the effective contribution of the network to each neuron from staying at zero, we prove that the involved forward operator is continuous. Sufficient criteria on the external input ensuring that the needed assumption holds are also provided.</description>
