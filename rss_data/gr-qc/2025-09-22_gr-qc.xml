      <title>Static AdS Black Holes Surrounded by Strings and Quintessence-like Field within Rastall Gravity Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we tested the physical properties of Rastall black holes in the presence of string clouds and quintessence. The modified spacetime geometry arising from the Rastall framework is first established, providing the basis for analyzing the geodesic structure. We study null geodesics in detail, testing photon trajectories, the conditions for photon spheres, BH shadows, the associated effective radial force, and the topological features of photon rings. Also, the analysis is further tested to timelike geodesics, where we investigate the motion of massive particles and determine the innermost stable circular orbits. In this case, we discuss the thermodynamic behavior of the system, show the effects of Rastall gravity, strings, and quintessence on the BHs stability and thermal characteristics. In this context, our results improve and show of how modifications to general relativity and surrounding matter distributions influence both the dynamical and thermodynamical aspects of BHs.</description>

      <title>General form of $f(R)$ and $(2+1)$-dimensional charge/non-charge black hole solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce novel black hole (BH) solutions, charge/non-charge, within the framework of $f(R)$ gravity, a theory that does not inherently include a cosmological constant, using equal/diffirent metric ansatzs. Remarkably, these solutions exhibit asymptotically Anti-de Sitter (AdS) or de Sitter (dS) behavior, depending on their parameter values. Unlike the BTZ solutions of General Relativity, which feature a causal singularity and constant scalar invariants, our solutions display strong spacetime singularities, as shown by their scalar invariants. We construct $f(R)$ functions that behave as polynomial functions, emphasizing the unique nature of these solutions. We demonstrate the stability of these solutions in two ways: first, by showing that their heat capacity is positive, which ensures thermodynamic stability; and second, by proving that the second derivative of $f(R)$ is positive, meeting the Ostrogradski criterion for dynamical stability. Furthermore, the solutions satisfy the first law of thermodynamics, confirming their consistency with fundamental thermodynamic principles.</description>

      <title>On the formation of gravastars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes and horizonless black-hole mimickers offer mathematically consistent alternatives to address the challenges posed by standard black holes. However, the formation mechanism of these alternative objects is still largely unclear and constitutes a significant open problem since understanding their dynamical formation represents a first step to assess their existence. We here investigate, for the first time and without invoking deviations from general relativity, the dynamical formation of a well-known horizonless black-hole mimicker, namely, a gravastar. More specifically, starting from the collapse of a uniform dust sphere as in the case of the Oppenheimer-Snyder collapse, we demonstrate that, under suitable conditions, a gravastar can form from the nucleation and expansion of a de-Sitter region with initial zero size at the center of the collapsing sphere. Furthermore, the de-Sitter expansion naturally slows down near the Schwarzschild radius, where it meets the collapsing dust surface and gives rise to a static equilibrium. Interestingly, we also find a maximum initial compactness of the collapsing star of $\mathcal{C}= 3/8$, above which the collapse to a black hole is inevitable.</description>

      <title>Neutron star evolution with BDNK viscous hydrodynamics framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recently proposed first-order viscous relativistic hydrodynamics formulation by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (commonly known as the BDNK formulation) has been shown to be causal, stable, strongly hyperbolic, and thus locally well-posed. It is now a viable new option for modelling out-of-equilibrium effects in fluids, and has attracted wide attention in its potential applications to astrophysical systems. In this work, we present the first non-linear numerical simulation of spherically symmetric neutron stars using the BDNK formulation under the Cowling approximation. Using a simplified equation of state, we show that stable evolutions can be constructed within a restricted parameter space up to the simulation time we explored. From these simulations, we analyse the frequency content of the quasi-normal modes and the decay rate of the fundamental mode. This analysis serves as a first step towards constructing a fully consistent model of neutron stars using the BDNK formulation.</description>

      <title>On Scalar Cosmological Perturbations in Non-Minimally Coupled Weyl Connection Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a theory with non-minimal matter-curvature coupling, considering non-metricity properties with a Weyl connection. This model has the advantage of an extra force term which can mimic dark matter and dark energy, and simultaneously follow Weyl's idea to unify gravity and electromagnetism. Indeed, Schwarzschild-like and Reissner-Nordstrom-like black hole solutions exist in this model, leading to new features, such as an additional horizon, due to the non-metricity vector. We derive the cosmological field equations, considering a minimal coupling, and discuss preliminary results on the scalar cosmological perturbations in this model.</description>

      <title>Singularity and differentiability at the origin of regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The divergence of curvature invariants at a given point signals the incompleteness of the spacetime, and the derivative order of these diverging invariants determines the differentiability class of the considered spacetime. We hereby focus on a general static and spherically symmetric geometry and determine, in the full non-linear regime and in a model independent way, the conditions that the metric functions must satisfy in order to achieve regularity at the origin. This work is structured around a central theorem, which relates the regularity of the spacetime at the origin to the parity of the metric functions. The detailed proof of this theorem constitutes the main result of the paper.</description>

      <title>Constraining the rotating Simpson-Visser spacetime from the observed quasi-periodic oscillations in black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes (BHs) which are singularity-free alternatives to the standard black hole paradigm in General Relativity (GR), offer effective models for probing the interface between classical and quantum gravity. They serve as promising candidates for exploring the nature of strong gravity and potential extensions of GR by providing testing grounds to understand how quantum corrections might manifest in astrophysical black holes. In the present work, we investigate the regular BH scenario described by the Simpson-Visser (SV) spacetime and explore its imprints on the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (HFQPOs) observed in the black hole power spectrum. The Simpson-Visser spacetime represent the simplest, globally regular extensions of the Schwarzschild scenario, through the presence of a regularizing parameter. We explore the imprints of the regularizing parameter on the orbital and epicyclic frequencies associated with the motion of test particles in the rotating SV spacetime. Models aimed to explain the observed HFQPOs often invoke these fundamental frequencies and hence can potentially constrain the regularizing parameter from the available HFQPO data. We test eleven well-established HFQPO models against available observations from six black hole sources, obtaining spin constraints that, when compared with previous independent estimates, help identify the observationally favored models for each source. Based on the present data, we report that the observationally favored models cannot discriminate between the Kerr and the Simpson-Visser scenario. This when coupled with the large discrepancy in previous spin estimates of these sources, may plausibly indicate some deviation from GR in the strong gravity regime near BHs which requires further investigation.</description>

      <title>Theory space and stability analysis of General Relativistic cosmological solutions in modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Some aspects of two General Relativistic cosmological solutions, an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ ($j$ is cosmographic jerk parameter), and a specifically designed toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ ($q$ is cosmographic deceleration parameter, $0&lt;|\varepsilon|&lt;1$) that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario as suggested by DESI DR2, are studied within the context of $f(R)$ gravity, by portraying them as a \emph{flow} in the 2-dimensional \emph{theory space} spanned by the quantities $r=\frac{R f'}{f}, m=\frac{R f''}{f'}$. For the $f(R)$ theories exactly reproducing a background $\Lambda$CDM-like expansion history $j=1$, it is shown by means of a \emph{cosmographic} reconstruction approach that the curvature degree of freedom need not necessarily behave like an effective cosmological constant, and that cosmologies under different possible such theories lead to different possible values of $\Omega_{m0}$. With the theory space analysis, it is also shown that $\Lambda$CDM-mimicking $f(R)$ cosmologies that asymptote to General Relativistic $\Lambda$CDM in the limit $q\to1/2$, are prone to instability under small homogeneous and isotropic perturbation, casting a doubt on achieving an exact $\Lambda$CDM-like cosmological solution $j=1$ within $f(R)$ gravity. Regarding the toy cosmological solution $j=1+3\varepsilon(q-1/2)$ that is capable of accommodating a phantom crossing scenario, it is shown that possible underlying $f(R)$ theories that admit it as a solution are inevitably plagued by tachyonic instability ($f''(R)&lt;0$). All the above physically interesting conclusions are derived without explicitly reconstructing, even numerically, the functional form of the underlying $f(R)$, which demonstrates the edge of the $r$-$m$ theory space analysis over the traditional explicit reconstruction approach.</description>

      <title>The Weyl Geometric Gravity black hole in light of the Solar System tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate, respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general relativity (gravitational redshift, the E\"{o}tv\"{o}s parameter and the universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.</description>

      <title>Charged Rotating Casimir Wormholes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the conditions necessary for the existence of a rotating traversable wormhole by introducing a Casimir source and an external electric field. A viable wormhole solution emerges when the rotation is constant, corresponding to that of an observer in a zero angular momentum frame. Furthermore, a radially dependent rotation is also a feasible solution, provided the angular velocity decreases exponentially as one moves away from the throat.</description>

      <title>Proper-Time Approach in Asymptotic Safety via Black Hole Quasinormal Modes and Grey-body Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal mode spectrum and grey-body factors of black holes in an effectively quantum-corrected spacetime, focusing on the influence of near-horizon modifications on observable quantities. Employing scalar, electromagnetic, and Dirac test fields, we analyze the perturbation equations and extract the fundamental quasinormal frequencies using both the 6th-order WKB method with Pad\'e resummation and time-domain integration. Our results show that quantum corrections near the horizon significantly affect the real and imaginary parts of the quasinormal modes, particularly for low multipole numbers and in the near-extremal regime. We also verify the robustness of the correspondence between quasinormal modes and grey-body factors by comparing WKB results with those reconstructed from the dominant quasinormal modes. Across all field types and parameter ranges considered, the WKB method proves accurate within a few percent, confirming its reliability in probing the impact of near-horizon physics. These findings support the use of quasinormal ringing and Hawking radiation spectra as sensitive tools for testing quantum modifications of black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Grey-Body Factors for Scalar and Dirac Fields in the Euler-Heisenberg Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study grey-body factors of neutral scalar and Dirac fields in the background of charged black holes arising in the Einstein--Euler--Heisenberg (EEH) theory. The Euler--Heisenberg corrections, which represent nonlinear electrodynamical effects due to vacuum polarization, modify the effective potential barrier surrounding the black hole and thereby affect the transmission probabilities for Hawking quanta. Using the sixth-order WKB method, and verifying our results against the recently proposed correspondence between grey-body factors and quasinormal modes, we compute the frequency-dependent grey-body spectra for various values of the black hole charge and EEH coupling. We find that the nonlinear coupling systematically lowers the effective potential barrier, enhancing the transmission probability. This work represents the first step toward incorporating nonlinear QED effects into the study of Hawking evaporation, focusing here on neutral test fields.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Speedmeter and Position-Meter Response in a Single Tabletop Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum radiation-pressure noise (QRPN) limits the low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. The established method for suppressing QRPN is the injection of frequency-dependent squeezed light. It requires long-baseline filter cavities introducing substantial experimental complexity. A completely different interferometer concept is the speedmeter. It avoids QRPN at the source by measuring test mass speed instead of position. While extensively researched theoretically, speedmeters are yet to be demonstrated with a moving test mass in an optomechanical setting. In this work, we present the first experimental observation of speedmeter behavior in a system with a movable test mass. We realize a novel hybrid readout cavity configuration that enables simultaneous extraction of position and speed signals from two distinct output ports. We compare the optical transfer functions associated with each channel and observe the expected scaling behavior that distinguishes a speedmeter from a position-meter. We support our observations with a detailed theoretical model, showing how the hybrid readout cavity implements key speedmeter features. Our results underscore the relevance of the speedmeter concept as an alternative for mitigating QRPN in future detectors and lay the groundwork for further experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Living on the edge: a non-perturbative resolution to the negativity of bulk entropies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lin, Maldacena, Rozenberg, and Shan (LMRS) presented a new information paradox in black hole physics by noticing that the entanglement and R\'enyi entropies in a two-sided black hole can become negative when the geometry contains a very large number of matter excitations behind the black hole horizon. While originally this puzzle was presented in the context of BPS two-sided black holes in two-dimensional supergravity, the negativity in fact persists for more general two-sided black holes in the presence of a large number of matter excitations. Since the entanglement and R\'enyi entropies in ordinary quantum systems cannot be negative, resolving this puzzle is a necessary step towards understanding the quantum mechanical description of black holes. In this paper, we explain how to address the entanglement negativity puzzle, both in the original setting discussed by LMRS and in more general non-supersymmetric settings, by summing over all non-perturbative contributions to the gravitational path integral. We then interpret this result from the point of view of a dual matrix integral, which we use to extend our analysis beyond the regime of validity of the genus re-summation performed in the gravitational path integral. In this regime, positivity is rescued by new saddles of the matrix integral, a one-eigenvalue instanton and a two-eigenvalue instanton. Finally, we formulate a similar puzzle and its resolution using random tensor network techniques.</description>

Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), a concept for measuring sub-Hz gravitational waves on the Moon, would use laser strainmeters to obtain extremely sensitive strain measurements from 1 mHz to 1 Hz. With proposed strain sensitivities, LILA would also be able to measure the normal modes of the Moon from 1-10 mHz at high signal-to-noise ratio. Such measurements would enable significant advances in our understanding of both the spherically symmetric and even 3D deep internal structure of the Moon. Strainmeter measurements may even be able to detect the translational mode of the solid inner core of the Moon at frequencies below 0.1 mHz. Inertial seismometers, on the other hand, are unlikely to reach the performance of $\sim10^{-16}$ m/s$^2$/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ required to reliably detect normal modes below 5-10 mHz, even with optimistic assumptions on future projected performance.</description>

      <title>Collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores leading to a black hole and a massive disk as a source of gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive models of rotating very massive stellar cores with mass $\approx 10^2$--$10^4M_\odot$ which are marginally stable to the pair-unstable collapse, assuming that the core is isentropic and composed primarily of oxygen. It is shown that the cores with mass $\lesssim 10^3M_\odot$ can form a massive disk with the mass more than 10% of the core mass around the formed black hole if the core is rotating with more than 30% of the Keplerian limit. We also indicate that the formation of rapidly spinning massive black holes such as the black holes of GW231123 naturally accompanies the massive disk formation. By using the result of our previous study which showed that the massive disk is unstable to the non-axisymmetric deformation, we predict the amplitude and frequency of gravitational waves and show that the collapse of rotating very massive stellar cores can be a promising source of gravitational waves for Einstein Telescope. The detection of such gravitational waves will provide us with important information about a formation process of intermediate mass black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Metric Corrections to Liouville's Theorem and Chiral Kinetic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quasiparticles may possess not only Berry curvature but also a quantum metric in momentum space. We develop a canonical formalism for such quasiparticles based on the Dirac brackets, and demonstrate that quantum metric modifies the phase-space density of states at $\mathcal{O}(\hbar^2)$, leading to corrections to Liouville's theorem, kinetic theory, and related physical quantities. In particular, we show that, in the presence of an inhomogeneous electric field, quantum metric induces corrections to the energy density and energy current. Applied to chiral fermions, this framework provides a nonlinear extension of chiral kinetic theory consistent with quantum field theory. Our work paves the way to potential applications of the quantum metric in high-energy physics and astrophysics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.</description>

      <title>Dualities in Physics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For more than half a century, dualities have been at the heart of modern physics. From quantum mechanics to statistical mechanics, condensed matter physics, quantum field theory and quantum gravity, dualities have proven useful in solving problems that are otherwise quite intractable. Being surprising and unexpected, dualities have been taken to raise philosophical questions about the nature and formulation of scientific theories, scientific realism, emergence, symmetries, explanation, understanding, and theory construction. This book discusses what dualities are, gives a selection of examples, explores the themes and roles that make dualities interesting, and highlights their most salient types. It aims to be an entry point into discussions of dualities in both physics and philosophy. The philosophical discussion emphasises three main topics: whether duals are theoretically equivalent, the view of scientific theories that is suggested by dualities (namely, a geometric view of theories), and the compatibility between duality and emergence.</description>

      <title>$\eta_{\rm w}$-meson from topological properties of the electroweak vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16043v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We further scrutinize the evidence for a recently suggested pseudo-scalar particle, the electroweak $\eta_{\rm w}$-meson. Its existence is demanded by matching the removal of the weak vacuum angle $\theta_{\rm w}$ by the anomalous $B+L$ - symmetry with a massive pole in the topological susceptibility of the vacuum. We specifically focus on the possibility of the emergence of $\eta_{\rm w}$ as a collective excitation of the phase of the condensate of the 't Hooft fermion determinant, generated by the electroweak instantons, which breaks the $B+L$ - symmetry spontaneously. We argue that the generation of the 't Hooft vertex is in one-to-one correspondence with its non-zero vacuum expectation value which is cutoff insensitive. We outline certain puzzles about the nature of the emergent $\eta_{\rm w}$ which require further investigations.</description>

      <title>Analytic derivation of GW spectrum from bubble collisions in FLRW Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the analytic formula for the gravitational-wave spectrum from bubble collisions during a cosmological first-order phase transition, under the thin-wall and envelope approximations, by incorporating the effect of cosmic expansion in the FLRW metric. Along with presenting the complete analytic expression and corresponding numerical results, we also derive simplified formulas valid in the large- and small-$k$ limits, as well as in the flat-spacetime limit. The latter expansion reveals that the flat-spacetime approximation breaks down for $\beta / H_* \lesssim 10$, where $\beta$ denotes the inverse duration of the phase transition and $H_*$ the Hubble parameter at its completion. Furthermore, the next-to-leading-order term contributes about a $10\%$ correction for $\beta / H_* \sim 140$, a typical value for the electroweak phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry under a particular class of non-strictly canonical transformations may be used to identify, and subsequently excise degrees of freedom which do not contribute to the closure of the algebra of dynamical observables. In this article, we present a mathematical framework which extends this symmetry reduction procedure to classical field theories described within the covariant De-Donder Weyl formalism. Both the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms are discussed; in the former case, the Lagrangian is introduced as a bundle morphism $\mathcal{L}:J^1E\rightarrow\wedge^mM$, whilst the Hamiltonian description takes as its multiphase space the restricted multimomentum bundle $J^1E^*$. The contact reduction process is implemented in a number of particular cases, and it is found that the geometry of the reduced space admits an elegant physical interpretation.</description>

      <title>Frequency shifts due to relativistic effects and retardation in continuous variable quantum key distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-based quantum communication naturally involves satellites and ground stations exchanging optical signals at high altitudes and large relative velocities. Starting from general relativistic considerations, we systematically separate the frequency shift into longitudinal Doppler contributions, relativistic corrections, and corrections from the propagation delay (retardation). We find the relativistic corrections to the Keplerian satellite orbits to be negligible on the considered timescale, compared to the gravitational and special relativistic time dilation contributions to the frequency shift. Somewhat surprisingly, we find the contribution from the retardation effect to be on the same order of magnitude as the relativistic contributions. To analyze the significance of these effects, we investigate secret key rates for a continuous variable quantum key distribution protocol for various configurations of satellite orbits and ground stations. We find that the corrections from relativistic effects and retardation significantly impact the communication performance and should be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Quantum Properties of Non-Dirichlet Boundary Conditions in Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Euclidean path integral for gravity is enriched by the addition of boundaries, which provide useful probes of thermodynamic properties. Common boundary conditions include Dirichlet conditions on the boundary induced metric; microcanonical conditions, which refers to fixing some components of the Brown-York boundary stress tensor; and conformal conditions, in which the conformal structure of the induced metric and the trace of the extrinsic curvature are fixed. Boundaries also present interesting problems of consistency. The Dirichlet problem is known, under various (and generally different) conditions, to be inconsistent with perturbative quantization of graviton fluctuations; to exhibit thermodynamic instability; or to require infinite fine-tuning in the presence of matter fluctuations. We extend some of these results to other boundary conditions. We find that similarly to the Dirichlet problem, the graviton fluctuation operator is not elliptic with microcanonical boundaries, and the non-elliptic modes correspond to ``boundary-moving diffeomorphisms." However, we argue that microcanonical factorization of path integrals -- essentially, the insertion of microcanonical constraints on two-sided surfaces in the bulk -- is not affected by the same issues of ellipticity. We also show that for a variety of matter field boundary conditions, matter fluctuations renormalize the gravitational bulk and boundary terms differently, so that the classical microcanonical or conformal variational problems are not preserved unless an infinite fine-tuning is performed.</description>

Abstract: We investigate second-order gravitational perturbations in asymptotically AdS black branes, developing a gauge-invariant framework to compute the amplitude ratio between quadratic and linear quasi-normal modes. Our analysis reveals resonant divergences of this ratio when the summed frequencies of two source modes coincide with the frequency of a third mode. These divergences are shown to manifest as poles in three-point fully retarded correlators of the energy-momentum tensor in the holographically dual quantum field theory, establishing a concrete connection between bulk gravitational nonlinearities and observables in the dual boundary theory. Our findings contribute to the understanding of nonlinearity in quantum many-body systems while deepening the holographic dictionary between spacetime dynamics and quantum correlations.</description>

Abstract: We explore the gravitational baryogenesis paradigm in the homogeneous and isotropic cosmology of generalized coupling gravity and, in particular, of the so-called Minimal Exponential Measure Model (MEMe). We show that, also in this theory, the time derivative of the Ricci scalar couples with matter currents and can preserve an unbalance in the baryon-antibaryon number beyond thermal equilibrium. Using the current bounds on the ratio of baryon number to entropy density, we can considerably improve the known constraints on the parameter q that characterizes the MEMe model. This estimate also allows us to draw stringent constraints on the spatial curvature of the cosmological model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03608v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a modification of the Starobinsky model in the form of an additional cubic Ricci scalar curvature term $\sim \alpha R^3$, scaled by a dimensionless parameter $\alpha$, with the resulting inflaton potential being the standard Starobinsky potential modified to first parametric order by an additive term. The resulting potential is identical to the potential obtained by a modification of the superpotential employed in the construction of the Starobinsky model in the framework of no-scale supergravity, thus, extending the correspondence between a class of no-scale supergravity models and modifications of the Starobinsky model. We analyze the inflationary predictions of the model and find that for $-4.2 \times 10^{-5} \lesssim \alpha \lesssim -1.9 \times 10^{-5}$, the modified Starobinsky model is in full agreement with the recent observational data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, for a range of $e$-folds, $N_\star = 50-60$.</description>

Abstract: Exterior geometries of physical black holes are believed to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter spacetime at late times. A characteristic feature of that vacuum Einstein solution is the presence of a hidden symmetry generated by a closed conformal Killing--Yano tensor. Using this symmetry and modern conformal geometry technology, we find necessary conditions for generic solutions to asymptotically approach the Kerr--de Sitter metric. Further, we constrain the admissible form of the geometric free data on the conformal infinity giving rise to this family of spacetimes and constrain it in terms of the stress-energy tensor.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit Coincident General Relativity (CGR) in the gauge approach to gravity based on Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the {\it internal-space formulation}, which one of the authors recently proposed in Ref.~[J. Math. Phys. 66 (2025) 5, 052505]. First, we review the standard formulation of STEGR theories in the Palatini approach to gravity, in which formulation we impose the teleparallel and torsion-free conditions by using Lagrange multipliers. Second, we introduce the STEGR theories in the gauge approach to gravity, which is formulated in the internal space, and derive its field equations. We briefly discuss whether the Ostrogradski ghost instability exists and find that the theory may require a degenerate condition to be imposed. Finally, assuming the coincident gauge, we derive CGR in both terms of the action integral and the field equation. Discussing the possible kinematics of the STEGR theory, we formulate a motion of a test scalar particle in the spacetime with non-metricity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11792v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze strong gravitational lensing by a spherically symmetric mass distribution within the Einstein-Straus-de Sitter framework in a spatially open Universe with negative curvature ($k = -1$). Applying the theory to the lensed quasar SDSS J1004+4112, we identify a critical threshold for the current scale factor $a_0$ of approximately $2.6 \times 10^{27}$ m, below which the effects of negative spatial curvature on lensing observables become significant, corresponding to a current curvature density of $|\Omega_{k0}| \gtrsim 0.0025$. In particular, for $\Omega_{k0} = -0.15$, the light bending increases slightly by about 1%, while the time delay exhibits a more substantial increase of about 10%. Beyond this threshold, however, the lensing observables are found to be insensitive to the current scale factor and converge to those characteristic of a spatially flat Universe. Importantly, our results indicate that, even where spatial curvature would otherwise enhance lensing observables, the effect of the cosmological constant remains present and acts to reduce light bending, corroborating the claim of Rindler and Ishak.</description>

      <title>Smooth binary evolution from wide resonances in boson clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight scalars can form superradiant clouds around rotating black holes. These may alter the dynamics of compact binaries and the ensuing waveform through orbital resonances and cloud ionization. We re-examine resonances involving states with nonzero decay width, deriving an effective treatment for resonances that are wider than the binary's frequency chirp. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by calculating an upper bound for the cloud's mass surviving up to the latest stages of the inspiral. Next, we study the accumulation of resonances with high-energy bound states. When these infinitely many, increasingly weak resonances are properly taken into account, they smooth out the "sharp features" in the binary's evolution that had been attributed to the ionization of the cloud. We compare our Newtonian results with recent relativistic calculations, highlighting common features as well as discrepancies. Our conclusions emphasize the need to carefully incorporate resonances in boson cloud waveform modeling.</description>

      <title>Near-horizon Instabilities and Anomalous Decay Rate of Quasinormal Modes in Weyl Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.05164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the stability of the Weyl geometry considering an exact black hole solution. By calculating the geodesics of massless and massive scalar fields orbiting outside the Weyl black hole background and using the Lyapunov exponent, we show that chaotic instabilities appear in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Calculating the photon sphere's quasinormal modes (QNMs) of a scalar field perturbing the Weyl black hole, we find a relation connecting the QNMs with the Lyapunov exponent in the asymptotically de Siter-like spacetime. Furthermore, we study the anomalous decay rate of the QNMs connecting their behavior with the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <title>Non-Gaussian tail of the curvature perturbation in stochastic ultra-slow-roll inflation: implications for primordial black hole production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.06551v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum diffusion in ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflation. Using the $\Delta N$ formalism, we present the first stochastic calculation of the probability distribution $P(\mathcal{R})$ of the curvature perturbation during USR. We capture the non-linearity of the system, solving the coupled evolution of the coarse-grained background with random kicks from the short wavelength modes, simultaneously with the mode evolution around the stochastic background. This leads to a non-Markovian process from which we determine the highly non-Gaussian tail of $P(\mathcal{R})$. Studying the production of primordial black holes in a viable model, we find that stochastic effects during USR increase their abundance by a factor $\sim 10^5$ compared to the Gaussian approximation.</description>

      <title>Implications of stochastic effects for primordial black hole production in ultra-slow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.07437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.07437v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of stochastic noise on the generation of primordial black hole (PBH) seeds in ultra-slow-roll (USR) inflation with numerical simulations. We consider the non-linearity of the system by consistently taking into account the noise dependence on the inflaton perturbations, while evolving the perturbations on the coarse-grained background affected by the noise. We capture in this way the non-Markovian nature of the dynamics, and demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are subleading. Using the $\Delta N$ formalism, we find the probability distribution $P(\mathcal{R})$ of the comoving curvature perturbation $\mathcal{R}$. We consider inflationary potentials that fit the CMB and lead to PBH dark matter with $i)$ asteroid, $ii)$ solar, or $iii)$ Planck mass, as well as $iv)$ PBHs that form the seeds of supermassive black holes. We find that stochastic effects enhance the PBH abundance by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(10)-\mathcal{O}(10^8)$, depending on the PBH mass. We also show that the usual approximation, where stochastic kicks depend only on the Hubble rate, either underestimates or overestimates the abundance by orders of magnitude, depending on the potential. We evaluate the gauge dependence of the results, discuss the quantum-to-classical transition, and highlight open issues of the application of the stochastic formalism to USR inflation.</description>

      <title>Signatures of a gravitational quantum vacuum on dynamics of massive particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the interaction of two massive particles with a quantised gravitational field in its vacuum state using two different position observables: (i) a frame-dependent coordinate separation and (ii) a frame-independent geodesic separation. For free particles, (i) leads to purely unitary dynamics but (ii) leads to dissipation. For two particles coupled through a linear spring, (i) and (ii) lead to different cut-off dependences in the frequency shift harmonic ladder of the differential motional mode. Our findings highlight the subtle consequences of different position observables at the interface of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>

      <title>Cosmological implications of tracker scalar fields: Testing the evidence for dynamical dark energy with recent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19274v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate non phantom tracker scalar field models as dynamical dark energy scenario. These models can alleviate the cosmic coincidence problem and transition to a cosmological constant-like behaviour at late times. Focusing on the inverse axionlike and inverse steep exponential potentials, we study their background evolution and perturbations, finding a mild suppression in the matter power spectrum compared to $\Lambda$CDM but no distinguishing features in the bispectrum. Using combined datasets of ${\rm CMB}+{\rm BAO\; (DESI~DR1\; \&amp;\; DR2)}+{\rm Pantheon~Plus}+{\rm Hubble\; parameter}+{\rm RSD}$, we perform a statistical comparison based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Our results indicate that, within the framework of non-phantom tracker models, the data show no evidence for dynamical dark energy. The $\Lambda$CDM model continues to provide a better fit to current observations in the non phantom regime. We emphasise, however, that our analysis does not rule out the possibility of phantom-crossing dark energy models, which have been found in other studies to provide a better fit to some datasets.</description>

      <title>Wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03527v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a consistent description of the quantum measurement process, whether the wave or particle-like aspect of a system is revealed depends on the details of the measurement chain, and cannot be interpreted as an objective fact about the system independent of the measurement. We show precisely how this comes to be in the measurement of gravitational radiation. Whether a wave or particle-like aspect is revealed is a property of the detector employed at the end of the quantum measurement chain, rather than of the meter, such as a gravitational-wave (GW) antenna or resonant bar, used to couple the radiation to the detector. A linear detector yields no signal for radiation in a Fock state and a signal proportional to the amplitude in a coherent state -- supporting a wave-like interpretation. By contrast, the signal from a detector coupled to the meter's energy is non-zero only when the incident radiation contains at least a single graviton. Thus, conceptually simple modifications of contemporary GW antennae can reveal wave-particle duality in the measurement of gravitational radiation.</description>

      <title>Probability density function for dispersion measure of fast radio burst from extragalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06845v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as powerful probes in cosmology. An optimized method was recently proposed to extract the cosmic baryon density from localized FRBs by maximizing the joint likelihood function of the extragalactic dispersion measure ($\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$). In this paper, we identify a crucial factor that was omitted in the probability density function (PDF) for $\mathrm{DM}_{\mathrm{ext}}$ in that method. Using simulated FRB data, we demonstrate that neglecting this factor leads to a systematic bias in the inferred cosmic baryon density, with deviations exceeding the $1\sigma$ confidence level. This highlights the necessity of including the missing factor for reliable cosmological applications of FRBs. Furthermore, applying our corrected PDF to a sample of 88 real localized FRBs, we find that the baryon density inferred with the original PDF is inconsistent with the Planck 2018 CMB results, whereas our corrected PDF yields excellent agreement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07461v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a novel and systematic approach to computing the $(2n-1)$-form Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density, i.e. the $n^{\text{th}}$ Chern character, in arbitrary even dimensions $D=2 n \geq 2$. Throughout we work with a generic affine connection, that results in a non-vanishing torsion in general, and allows for non-metricity, which accommodates the existence of non-trivial Chern characters and hence Pontryagin densities. We outline an algorithm, with its implementation as a code, which lets one to determine the Chern-Simons potential given the Pontryagin density in an arbitrary even dimension.</description>

      <title>A field-level reaction for screened modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18876v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a field-level reaction framework to emulate the nonlinear effects of screened modified gravity on the cosmic web. This approach is designed to enable field-level inference with data from Stage IV cosmological surveys. Building on the reaction method, which models the nonlinear matter power spectrum in modified gravity as corrections to a "pseudo" $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, we extend the method to full field-level predictions by applying it to the output of $N$-body simulations, including both positions and velocities. We focus on modifications to gravity that are scale-independent at the linear level, allowing us to isolate and emulate nonlinear deviations, particularly screening effects. Our neural network predicts the field-level correction ("reaction") to a pseudo$\Lambda$CDM simulation whose linear clustering matches that of the target. The emulator achieves sub-percent accuracy across a broad range of summary statistics, including 0.4\% agreement in the matter power spectrum at scales $k &lt; 1$ Mpc$/h$, and 2\% accuracy in redshift-space distortion multipoles at $k &lt; 0.3$ Mpc$/h$. We also validate the emulator against $N$-body simulations with increased force resolution and time steps, confirming the robustness of its performance. These results demonstrate that our framework is a practical and reliable tool for incorporating screened modified gravity models into field-level cosmological inference, enabling stringent tests of extra fundamental forces at cosmological scales.</description>

      <title>A Black Hole is Born: 3D GRMHD Simulation of Black Hole Formation from Core-Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first three-dimensional, fully general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (3D GRMHD) simulation of a black hole (BH) formed from the collapsed core of a massive star. The ability to self-consistently capture the birth of a compact remnant in 3D is crucial for modeling natal BH properties (including masses, spins, and kicks), which are of particular interest in the era of gravitational wave astronomy. However, such simulations have remained elusive due to extreme computational challenges and demands. We employ the GPU-accelerated dynamical-spacetime GRMHD code GRaM-X to follow the collapse, core-bounce, shock propagation, and eventual BH formation of a massive stellar progenitor in full 3D. We initialize our simulation by mapping a one-dimensional (1D) model of a star with a zero-age-main-sequence mass of $45 M_\odot$ to 3D. We use moderate rotation (consistent with expectations from stellar evolution modeling) and a relatively weak dipolar magnetic field. The collapsing core drives a shock that reaches a maximum radius of roughly 170 km before stalling and does not lead to a successful explosion. The proto-neutron star accretes matter before collapsing to form a BH $t_{BH} \approx 325$ ms after core-bounce. The time of BH formation and initial BH mass are remarkably similar to those obtained with GR1D, a 1D general-relativistic neutrino-hydrodynamics code, to which we compare our results. We track the horizon of the newborn BH after formation and calculate a steady kick velocity of $v_{kick} \approx 72$ km/s and a mass of $M_{BH} \approx 2.62 M_\odot$, which is still rising at the end of the simulation.</description>

      <title>Lorentzian Cheeger-Gromov convergence and temporal functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15441v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Uniqueness (up to isometries) and existence of limits are analyzed in the context of Cheeger-Gromov convergence of spacetimes. To face the non-compactness of the vector isometry group in the semi-Riemannian setting, standard pointed convergence is strengthened to anchored convergence (which requires the convergence of a timelike direction in the Lorentzian case). Then, a local isometry between the neighborhoods of the basepoints is found, and extended globally under geodesic completeness of just inextensibility. In spacetimes, by using Cauchy temporal functions as both strengthenings of the anchor and tools to ''Wick rotate'' metrics, a new notion of convergence for globally hyperbolic spacetimes (including the case of timelike boundaries) is introduced. The machinery of Riemannian Cheeger-Gromov theory becomes applicable after revisiting the tools related to time functions and studying their connections with Sormani--Vega null distance. In particular, several results with interest on their own right are obtained such as: time functions are locally Lipschitz up to rescaling, global and local characterizations of $h$-steep functions, independence of steepness and $h$-steepness for temporal functions, compatibility of both conditions for Cauchy temporal functions, and the stability of the latter.</description>

      <title>Feynman-like parameterizations of (anti-)de Sitter Witten diagrams for all masses at any loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing correlation functions in curved spacetime is central to both theoretical and experimental efforts, from precision cosmology to quantum simulations of strongly coupled systems. In anti-de Sitter (AdS) and de Sitter (dS) space, the key observables, boundary correlators in AdS and late-time correlators in dS, are obtained via Witten diagram calculations. While formally analogous to flat-space Feynman diagrams, even tree-level Witten diagrams are significantly more complicated due to the structure of bulk propagators. Existing computational approaches often focus on scalars with a specific "conformal" mass, for which propagators simplify enough to permit the use of standard flat-space techniques. This restriction, however, omits the generic internal-line masses that arise in many cosmological and holographic settings. We present the Witten-Feynman (WF) parameterization, a general representation of scalar Witten diagrams in (A)dS as generalized Euler integrals. The WF framework applies in both position and momentum space, accommodates arbitrary internal and external masses, and holds at any loop order. It directly generalizes the familiar Feynman parameterization form of Feynman integrals, making it possible to import a broad range of amplitude techniques into the curved-space setting. We illustrate the method through two applications: a generalization of Weinberg's theorem on ultraviolet convergence and a series expansion technique that can yield explicit evaluations. Our results provide a unified computational tool for (A)dS boundary correlators, opening the door to more systematic calculations relevant for upcoming experiments and simulations.</description>
