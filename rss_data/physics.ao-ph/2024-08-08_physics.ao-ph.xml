      <title>MITgcm-AD v2: Open source tangent linear and adjoint modeling framework for the oceans and atmosphere enabled by the Automatic Differentiation tool Tapenade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) is widely used by the climate science community to simulate planetary atmosphere and ocean circulations. A defining feature of the MITgcm is that it has been developed to be compatible with an algorithmic differentiation (AD) tool, TAF, enabling the generation of tangent-linear and adjoint models. These provide gradient information which enables dynamics-based sensitivity and attribution studies, state and parameter estimation, and rigorous uncertainty quantification. Importantly, gradient information is essential for computing comprehensive sensitivities and performing efficient large-scale data assimilation, ensuring that observations collected from satellites and in-situ measuring instruments can be effectively used to optimize a large uncertain control space. As a result, the MITgcm forms the dynamical core of a key data assimilation product employed by the physical oceanography research community: Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean (ECCO) state estimate. Although MITgcm and ECCO are used extensively within the research community, the AD tool TAF is proprietary and hence inaccessible to a large proportion of these users. The new version 2 (MITgcm-AD v2) framework introduced here is based on the source-to-source AD tool Tapenade, which has recently been open-sourced. Another feature of Tapenade is that it stores required variables by default (instead of recomputing them) which simplifies the implementation of efficient, AD-compatible code. The framework has been integrated with the MITgcm model main branch and is now freely available.</description>

      <title>ORBIT: Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14712v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earth system predictability is challenged by the complexity of environmental dynamics and the multitude of variables involved. Current AI foundation models, although advanced by leveraging large and heterogeneous data, are often constrained by their size and data integration, limiting their effectiveness in addressing the full range of Earth system prediction challenges. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Oak Ridge Base Foundation Model for Earth System Predictability (ORBIT), an advanced vision transformer model that scales up to 113 billion parameters using a novel hybrid tensor-data orthogonal parallelism technique. As the largest model of its kind, ORBIT surpasses the current climate AI foundation model size by a thousandfold. Performance scaling tests conducted on the Frontier supercomputer have demonstrated that ORBIT achieves 684 petaFLOPS to 1.6 exaFLOPS sustained throughput, with scaling efficiency maintained at 41% to 85% across 49,152 AMD GPUs. These breakthroughs establish new advances in AI-driven climate modeling and demonstrate promise to significantly improve the Earth system predictability.</description>

      <title>AIFS -- ECMWF's data-driven forecasting system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01465v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning-based weather forecasting models have quickly emerged as a promising methodology for accurate medium-range global weather forecasting. Here, we introduce the Artificial Intelligence Forecasting System (AIFS), a data driven forecast model developed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). AIFS is based on a graph neural network (GNN) encoder and decoder, and a sliding window transformer processor, and is trained on ECMWF's ERA5 re-analysis and ECMWF's operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) analyses. It has a flexible and modular design and supports several levels of parallelism to enable training on high-resolution input data. AIFS forecast skill is assessed by comparing its forecasts to NWP analyses and direct observational data. We show that AIFS produces highly skilled forecasts for upper-air variables, surface weather parameters and tropical cyclone tracks. AIFS is run four times daily alongside ECMWF's physics-based NWP model and forecasts are available to the public under ECMWF's open data policy.</description>

      <title>Stable Machine-Learning Parameterization of Subgrid Processes with Real Geography and Full-physics Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern climate projections often suffer from inadequate spatial and temporal resolution due to computational limitations, resulting in inaccurate representations of sub-grid processes. A promising technique to address this is the Multiscale Modeling Framework (MMF), which embeds a kilometer-resolution cloud-resolving model within each atmospheric column of a host climate model to replace traditional convection and cloud parameterizations. Machine learning (ML) offers a unique opportunity to make MMF more accessible by emulating the embedded cloud-resolving model and reducing its substantial computational cost. Although many studies have demonstrated proof-of-concept success of achieving stable hybrid simulations, it remains a challenge to achieve near operational-level success with real geography and comprehensive variable emulation that includes, for example, explicit cloud condensate coupling. In this study, we present a stable hybrid model capable of integrating for at least 5 years with near operational-level complexity, including real geography, seasonality, explicit cloud condensate predictions, and land coupling. Our model demonstrates skillful online performance in metrics such as 5-year zonal mean biases compared to previous MMF emulation studies. The monthly error against reference MMF simulations with the same initial condition approaches the fundamental predictability limit. Key factors contributing to our online performance include an expressive U-Net architecture, additional input features that include large-scale forcings and convection memory, and physical thermodynamic constraints for microphysics. With microphysical constraints mitigating unrealistic cloud formation, our work is the first to demonstrate realistic multi-year cloud condensate climatology under the MMF framework. Our work showcases ML parameterization's potential for operational-level climate simulations.</description>

      <title>Generative Adversarial Models for Extreme Geospatial Downscaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14049v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Addressing the challenges of climate change requires accurate and high-resolution mapping of geospatial data, especially climate and weather variables. However, many existing geospatial datasets, such as the gridded outputs of the state-of-the-art numerical climate models (e.g., general circulation models), are only available at very coarse spatial resolutions due to the model complexity and extremely high computational demand. Deep-learning-based methods, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs) and their variants, have proved effective for refining natural images and have shown great promise in improving geospatial datasets. This paper describes a conditional GAN-based stochastic geospatial downscaling method that can accommodates very high scaling factors. Compared to most existing methods, the method can generate high-resolution accurate climate datasets from very low-resolution inputs. More importantly, the method explicitly considers the uncertainty inherent to the downscaling process that tends to be ignored in existing methods. Given an input, the method can produce a multitude of plausible high-resolution samples instead of one single deterministic result. These samples allow for an empirical exploration and inferences of model uncertainty and robustness. With a case study of gridded climate datasets (wind velocity and solar irradiance), we demonstrate the performances of the framework in downscaling tasks with large scaling factors (up to $64\times$) and highlight the advantages of the framework with a comprehensive comparison with commonly used and most recent downscaling methods, including area-to-point (ATP) kriging, deep image prior (DIP), enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN), physics-informed resolution-enhancing GAN (PhIRE GAN), and an efficient diffusion model for remote sensing image super-resolution (EDiffSR).</description>
