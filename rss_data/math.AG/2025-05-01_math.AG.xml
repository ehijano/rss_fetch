      <title>On linear sections of the spinor tenfold II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following previous work by A. Kuznetsov, we study the Fano manifolds obtained as linear sections of the spinor tenfold in $\mathbb{P}^{15}$. Up to codimension three there are finitely many such sections, up to projective equivalence. In codimension four there are three moduli, and this family is particularly interesting because of its relationship with Kummer surfaces on the one hand, and a grading of the exceptional Lie algebra $\mathfrak{e}_8$ on the other hand. We show how the two approaches are intertwined, and we prove that codimension four sections of the spinor tenfolds and Kummer surfaces have the very same GIT moduli space. The Lie theoretic viewpoint provides a wealth of additional information. In particular we locate and study the unique section admitting an action of $SL_2\times SL_2$; similarly to the Mukai-Umemura variety in the family of prime Fano threefold of genus 12, it is a compactification of a quotient by a finite group.</description>

      <title>Compact approximation and descent for algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on approximation and generation for the derived category of complexes with quasi-coherent cohomology on algebraic stacks. Our methods establish that approximation by compact objects descends along covers that are quasi-finite and flat. This generalizes a result of Lipman--Neeman for schemes and extends a related result known for algebraic spaces. We also study the behavior of generation under the derived pushforward and pullback of a morphism between algebraic stacks.</description>

      <title>A picture of the irreducible components of $W^r_d(C)$ for a general $k$-gonal curve $C$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on results on Hurwitz-Brill-Noether theory obtained by H. Larson we give a picture of the irreducible components of $W^r_d(C)$ for a general $k$-gonal curve of genus $g$. This picture starts from irreducible components of $W^r_d(C)$ restricted to an open subset of $Pic (C)$ satisfying Brill-Noether theory as in the case of a general curve of genus $g$. We obtain some degeneracy loci associated to a morphism of locally-free sheaves on them of the expected dimension. All the irreducible components of the schemes $W^r_d(C)$ are translates of their closures in $Pic (C)$. We complete the proof that the schemes $W^r_d(C)$ are generically smooth in case $C$ is a general $k$-gonal curve (claimed but not completely proved before). We obtain some results on the tangent spaces to the splitting degeneracy loci for an arbitrary $k$-gonal curve and we obtain some new smoothness results in case $C$ is a general $k$-gonal curve.</description>

      <title>Classification of indecomposable reflexive modules on quotient singularities through Atiyah--Patodi--Singer theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In [20] Esnault asked whether on a general quotient surface singularity the rank and the first Chern class distinguish isomorphism classes of indecomposable reflexive modules. Wunram gave a contraexample in [46] showing two different full shaves on a quotient singularity, with the same rank and the same first Chern class. In this article, we prove that irreducible reflexive modules over quotient surface singularities are determined by the rank, first Chern class and the Atiyah-Patodi-Singer $\tilde{\xi}$-invariant [5], except for the case of rank $2$ indecomposable reflexive modules over dihedral quotient surface singularities $\mathbb{D}_{n,q}$ with $\gcd(m,2)=2$, which we conjecture to follow the same pattern. To prove the classification theorem, first we prove that every spherical $3$-manifold with non-trivial fundamental group appears as the link of a quotient surface singularity, and that indecomposable flat vector bundles over spherical $3$-manifolds are classified by their rank, first and second Cheeger-Chern-Simons classes, with the exception of the aforementioned case.</description>

      <title>Poncelet porism in singular cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated Poncelet porism is usually studied for a pair of smooth conics that are in a general position. Here we discuss Poncelet porism in the real plane - affine or projective, when that is not the case, i.e. the conics have at least one point of tangency or at least one of the conics is not smooth. In all such cases, we find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of an n-gon inscribed in one of the conics and circumscribed about the other.</description>

      <title>K-moduli of quasimaps and quasi-projectivity of moduli of K-stable Calabi-Yau fibrations over curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a projective K-moduli space of quasimaps with a certain log Fano condition.
  Moreover, we investigate relationships between the K-moduli of quasimaps and the K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations over curves of negative Kodaira dimension constructed by the authors [HaHa23] when general fibers are Abelian varieties or irreducible holomorphic symplectic manifolds.
  We show that there is a quasi-finite morphism from the K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations to the K-moduli of quasimaps and the CM line bundle of the K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations converges to the CM line bundle of the K-moduli of quasimaps.
  As a corollary, we obtain the entire quasi-projectivity of K-moduli of Calabi-Yau fibrations in this case.</description>

      <title>Quadratic counts of highly tangent lines to hypersurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give two geometric interpretations for the local type of a line that is highly tangent to a hypersurface in a single point. One interpretation is phrased in terms of the Wronski map, while the other interpretation relates to the fundamental forms of the hypersurface. These local types are the local contributions of an quadratic form-valued Euler number that depends on a choice of orientation.</description>

      <title>Presentations, embeddings and automorphisms of homogeneous spaces for SL(2,C)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteristic zero and a linear algebraic $k$-group $G$, it is well known that every affine $G$-variety admits a $G$-equivariant closed embedding into a finite-dimensional $G$-module. Such an embedding is a presentation of the $G$-variety, and a minimal presentation is one for which the dimension the $G$-module is minimal. The problem of finding a minimal presentation generalizes the problem of determining whether a group action on affine space is linearizable. We give a minimal presentation for each homogeneous space for $SL_2(k)$. This constitutes the paper's main work. Of particular interest are the surfaces $Y=SL_2(k)/T$ and $X=SL_2(k)/N$ where $T$ is the one-dimensional torus and $N$ is its normalizer. We show that the minimal presentation of $X$ has dimension 5, the embedding dimension of $X$ is 4, and there does not exist a closed $SL_2$-equivariant embedding of $X$ in $A_k^4$. Thus, the $SL_2$-action on $X$ is absolutely nonextendable to $A_k^4$. We give two other examples of surfaces with absolutely nonextendable group actions. In addition, $X$ is noncancelative, that is, there exists a surface $Z$ such that $X\times A_k^1\cong_k Z\times A_k^1$ and $X\not\cong_kZ$. Finally, we settle the long-standing open question of whether there exist inequivalent closed embeddings of $Y$ in $A_k^3$ by constructing inequivalent embeddings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a smooth projective variety X over an arbitrary field k, we discuss the surjectivity of the Albanese map from the Chow group of zero-cycles of degree zero on X to the group of rational points of the Albanese variety of X. Over arithmetic fields, we use Severi-Brauer fibrations to produce examples where the map is not surjective. For varieties X over the complex field, we discuss the question after extension of the complex field to function fields of varieties. This is related to C. Voisin's notion of universal zero-cycle and to rationality questions for rationally connected threefolds.</description>

      <title>The monodromy of compact Lagrangian fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the monodromy representations underlying compact Lagrangian fibrations. In the case where the associated period map is generically immersive, we prove that the mondromy representation is irreducible over \(\mathbb{C}\). In the alternative case where the fibration is isotrivial, we recover a result of \cite{kim-laza-martin23}, proving that its fibers are isogeneous to a power of an elliptic curve. We show that over \(\mathbb{C}\), the monodromy representation underlying an isotrivial Lagrangian fibration is a direct sum of two irreducible \(\mathbb{C}\)-local systems.</description>

      <title>On strong Euler-homogeneity and Saito-holonomicity for complex hypersurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21829v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on previous work on linear free divisors by Granger et al., we develop necessary and sufficient conditions for a general divisor to be strongly Euler-homogeneous in terms of some Fitting ideals.
  We also define the notions of weak and strong Saito-holonomicity for a general divisor in such a way that they extend the definitions of Saito-holonomicity and weak and strong Koszul-freeness. Then, we characterize these properties using the Fitting ideals previously defined. Finally, we generalize some results regarding Koszul-freeness and strong Euler-homogeneity to the non-free case.</description>

      <title>Advances on a conjecture about free divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21834v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2002, it was conjectured that a free divisor satisfying the so-called Logarithmic Comparison Theorem (LCT) must be strongly Euler-homogeneous. Today, it is known to be true only in ambient dimension less or equal than three or assuming Koszul-freeness. Thanks to our advances in the comprehension of strong Euler-homogeneity, we are able to prove the conjecture in the following new cases: assuming strong Euler-homogeneity on a punctured neighbourhood of a point; assuming the divisor is weakly Koszul-free; for ambient dimension $n=4$; for linear free divisors in ambient dimension $n=5$. We also refute a conjecture that states that all linear free divisors satisfy LCT and are strongly Euler-homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Birational Transformations on Dimer Integrable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21081v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that when two toric Calabi-Yau 3-folds and their corresponding toric varieties are related by a birational transformation, they are associated with a pair of dimer models on the 2-torus that define dimer integrable systems, which themselves become birationally equivalent. These integrable systems defined by dimer models were first introduced by Goncharov and Kenyon. We illustrate this equivalence explicitly using a pair of dimer integrable systems corresponding to the abelian orbifolds of the form C^3/Z_4 x Z_2 with orbifold action (1,0,3)(0,1,1) and C/Z_2 x Z_2 with action (1,0,0,1)(0,1,1,0), whose spectral curves and Hamiltonians are shown to be related by a birational transformation.</description>

      <title>A decomposition lemma in convex integration via classical algebraic geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21300v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decomposition lemma that allows error terms to be expressed using fewer rank-one symmetric matrices than $\frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ within the convex integration scheme of constructing flexible $C^{1,\alpha}$ solutions to a system of nonlinear PDEs in dimension $n\geq 2$, which can be viewed as a kind of truncation of the codimension one local isometric embedding equation in Nash-Kuiper Theorem. This leads to flexible solutions with higher H\"older regularity, and consequently, improved very weak solutions to certain induced equations for any $n$, including Monge-Amp\`ere systems and $2$-Hessian systems. The H\"older exponent of the solutions can be taken as any $\alpha &lt;(n^2+1)^{-1}$ for $n=2,4,8,16$, and any $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n-2\rho(\frac{n}{2})-1)^{-1}$ for other $n$, thereby improving the previously known bound $\alpha&lt;(n^2+n+1)^{-1}$ for $n\geq 3$. Here, $\rho(n)$ is the Radon-Hurwitz number, which exhibits an $8$-fold periodicity on $n$ that is related to Bott periodicity.
  Our arguments involve novel applications of several results from algebraic geometry and topology, including Adams' theorem on maximum linearly independent vector fields on spheres, the intersection of projective varieties, and projective duality. We also use an elliptic method ingeniously that avoids loss of differentiability.</description>

Abstract: A morphism from a diagonalizable group $G$ to a torus of a toric variety $X$ induces an action of $G$ on $X$. We prove the category of ind-coherent sheaves on the quotient stack is equivalent to the category of constructible sheaves on a cover of a real torus with singular support contained in the FLTZ skeleton, extending Kuwagaki's nonequivariant coherent-constructible correspondence arXiv:1610.03214. We also and investigate the functoriality of such correspondence.</description>

      <title>Computing Polynomial Representation in Subrings of Multivariate Polynomial Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{R} = \mathbb{K}[x_1, \dots, x_n]$ be a multivariate polynomial ring over a field $\mathbb{K}$ of characteristic 0. Consider $n$ algebraically independent elements $g_1, \dots, g_n$ in $\mathcal{R}$. Let $\mathcal{S}$ denote the subring of $\mathcal{R}$ generated by $g_1, \dots, g_n$, and let $h$ be an element of $\mathcal{S}$. Then, there exists a unique element ${f} \in \mathbb{K}[u_1, \dots, u_n]$ such that $h = f(g_1, \dots, g_n)$.
  In this paper, we provide an algorithm for computing ${f}$, given $h$ and $g_1, \dots, g_n$. The complexity of our algorithm is linear in the size of the input, $h$ and $g_1, \dots, g_n$, and polynomial in $n$ when the degree of $f$ is fixed. Previous works are mostly known when $f$ is a symmetric polynomial and $g_1, \dots, g_n$ are elementary symmetric, homogeneous symmetric, or power symmetric polynomials.</description>

      <title>Ends of the strata of differentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We enumerate the ends of each stratum of meromorphic 1-forms on Riemann surfaces with prescribed multiplicities of zeroes and poles. Our proof uses degeneration techniques based on the construction by Bainbridge-Chen-Gendron-Grushevsky-Moeller of the moduli space of multi-scale differentials, together with recent classification of connected components of generalized strata by Lee-Wong. In particular, from these results we quickly deduce the theorem for holomorphic 1-forms, originally proved by Boissy.</description>

Abstract: If X is a groupoid equipped with an action of a 2-group G then one has a 2-groupoid X/G. We describe the fibers of the functor from X/G to the 1-groupoid $\pi_0(X)/\pi_0(G)$. We also give an explicit model for X/G in a certain situation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a lower bound for the delta invariant of the fundamental divisor of a quasi-smooth weighted hypersurface. As a consequence, we prove K-stability of a large class of quasi-smooth Fano hypersurfaces of index 1 and of all smooth Fano weighted hypersurfaces of index 1 and 2. The proofs are based on the Abban--Zhuang method and on the study of linear systems on flags of weighted hypersurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11215v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define the hypergeometric exponential sum associated to a finite family of representations of a reductive group over a finite field. We introduce the hypergeometric $\ell$-adic sheaf to describe the behavior of the hypergeometric exponential sum. It is a perverse sheaf, and it is the counterpart in characteristic $p$ of the $A$-hypergeometric $\mathcal D$-module introduced by Kapranov. Using the theory of the Fourier transform for vector bundles over a general base developed by Wang, we are able to study the hypergeometric $\ell$-adic sheaf via the hypergeometric $\mathcal D$-module. We apply our results to the estimation of the hypergeometric exponential sum.</description>

Abstract: We construct a triangulated equivalence between the derived categories of quasi-coherent and contraherent $\mathcal A$-modules for a quasi-coherent quasi-algebra $\mathcal A$ over a quasi-compact semi-separated scheme $X$. The sheaf of rings of differential operators $\mathcal D$ (or fiberwise differential operators for a smooth morphism of schemes) is the thematic example of a quasi-coherent quasi-algebra.</description>

      <title>Hecke Actions on Loops and Periods of Iterated Shimura Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.00143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.00143v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the classical Hecke correspondences T_N, N&gt;0, act on the free abelian groups generated by the conjugacy classes of the modular group SL_2(Z) and the conjugacy classes of its profinite completion. We show that this action induces a dual action on the ring of class functions of a certain relative unipotent completion of the modular group. This ring contains all iterated integrals of modular forms that are constant on conjugacy classes. It possesses a natural mixed Hodge structure and, after tensoring with Q_ell$, a natural action of the absolute Galois group. Each Hecke operator preserves this mixed Hodge structure and commutes with the action of the absolute Galois group. Unlike in the classical case, the algebra generated by these Hecke operators is not commutative. The appendix by Pham Tiep is not included. It can be found at arXiv:2303.02807.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of anisotropic stiffness tensors from partial data around one polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.03312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study inverse problems in anisotropic elasticity using tools from algebraic geometry. The singularities of solutions to the elastic wave equation in dimension $n$ with an anisotropic stiffness tensor have propagation kinematics captured by so-called slowness surfaces, which are hypersurfaces in the cotangent bundle of $\mathbb{R}^n$ that turn out to be algebraic varieties. Leveraging the algebraic geometry of families of slowness surfaces we show that, for tensors in a dense open subset in a space of anisotropic two-dimensional stiffness tensors, a small amount of data around one polarization in an individual slowness surface uniquely determines the entire slowness surface and its stiffness tensor. In three dimensions, for generic orthorhombic and monoclinic stiffness tensors, a small number of anomalous companions give rise to the same slowness surface; nevertheless, we conjecture that in the most anisotropic setting (triclinic) the tensor is unique, as in two dimensions. The partial data needed to determine a tensor arises naturally from seismological measurements or geometrized versions of seismic inverse problems. Additionally, we explain how the reconstruction of the stiffness tensor can be carried out effectively, using Gr\"obner bases. Our uniqueness or finiteness results fail for symmetric materials (e.g., fully isotropic), evidencing the counterintuitive claim that inverse problems in elasticity can become more tractable with increasing asymmetry.</description>

      <title>A study of H. Martens' Theorem on chains of cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10804v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a chain of cycles of genus $g$. Let $d$,$r$ be integers with $1 \leq r \leq g-2$ and $2r\leq d \leq g-3+r$. Then $w^r_d(\Gamma)=d-2r$ implies $\Gamma$ is hyperelliptic. For each $g \geq 2r+3$ there exist non-hyperelliptic chains of cycles satisfying $w^r_{g-2+r}(\Gamma)=g-2-r$. In the case of algebraic curves such equality implies the curve is hyperelliptic. In particular we obtain the existence of chains of cycles $\Gamma$ such that $w^r_{g-2+r}(\Gamma) \neq w^1_{g-r}(\Gamma)$ in case $r \geq 2$. In the case of algebraic curves such numbers are equal because of the Riemann-Roch Theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17178v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper contains two results of independent interest, the first being more mathematical in nature whereas the second more physical. We first show that the hierarchy of Higgs branch RG flows between the 6d $(1,0)$ SCFTs known as A-type orbi-instantons is given by the Hasse diagram of certain strata and transverse slices in the double affine Grassmannian of $E_8$. Secondly, we leverage the partial order naturally defined on this Hasse diagram to prove the $a$-theorem for orbi-instanton Higgs branch RG flows, thereby exhausting the list of $c$-theorems in the even-dimensional (supersymmetric) setting.</description>

Abstract: We determine that $\gamma$-vectors of partitioned permutohedra, thereby generalizing a result of Foata and Sch\"utzenberger. Our result is closely related to a result of Athanasiadis on the representation of the symmetric group on the cohomology of the permutohedral variety. We explain how to derive Athanasiadis' result from ours and vice versa.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing and some applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05932v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a streamlined procedure for constructing small symplectic $4$-manifolds via contact gluing, based on a technique invented by David Gay around 2000. We also give a few applications, ranging from embeddings of singular Lagrangian $RP^2$s to realizing an infinite family of lens spaces as a hypersurface of contact type in a symplectic Hirzebruch surface. Furthermore, our investigations on $S^1$-invariant contact structures also suggest an interesting and fairly strong upper bound for the self-intersection of a rational unicuspidal curve with one Puiseux pair $(p,q)$ in any algebraic surface (the bound depends only on the values of $(p,q)$).</description>

      <title>Polarization algebras and the geometry of commuting varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a reduced version of the Chevalley restriction conjecture on the commuting scheme posed by T.H. Chen and B.C. Ng\^o, extending the results of Hunziker for classical groups. In particular, we prove that for any connected reductive group, the ring of $G$-invariant functions on the commuting variety restricts to an isomorphism with the invariants of the d-fold product of a Cartan subalgebra under the Weyl group $k[\mathfrak{t}^d]^W$. The full conjecture implies that this isomorphism extends to the ring of $G$-invariants on the non-reduced commuting scheme, $k[\mathfrak{C}_{\mathfrak{g}}^d]^G$ (hence the invariant ring is nilpotent free). We then prove an analogous restriction theorem for general polar representations which we apply to resolve an important case of a conjecture posed by Bulois, C Lehn, M Lehn and Terpereau about symplectic reductions of $\theta$-representations. Throughout this work, we focus on the connection between the invariant subring generated by polarizations and commutativity.</description>
