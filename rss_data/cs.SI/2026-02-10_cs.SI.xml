      <title>SocialPulse: An Open-Source Subreddit Sensemaking Toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how online communities discuss and make sense of complex social issues is a central challenge in social media research, yet existing tools for large-scale discourse analysis are often closed-source, difficult to adapt, or limited to single analytical views. We present SocialPulse, an open-source subreddit sensemaking toolkit that unifies multiple complementary analyses -- topic modeling, sentiment analysis, user activity characterization, and bot detection -- within a single interactive system. SocialPulse enables users to fluidly move between aggregate trends and fine-grained content, compare highly active and long-tail contributors, and examine temporal shifts in discourse across subreddits. The demo showcases end-to-end exploratory workflows that allow researchers and practitioners to rapidly surface themes, participation patterns, and emerging dynamics in large Reddit datasets. By offering an extensible and openly available platform, SocialPulse provides a practical and reusable foundation for transparent, reproducible sensemaking of online community discourse.</description>

      <title>Graph Domain Adaptation via Homophily-Agnostic Reconstructing Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph Domain Adaptation (GDA) transfers knowledge from labeled source graphs to unlabeled target graphs, addressing the challenge of label scarcity. However, existing GDA methods typically assume that both source and target graphs exhibit homophily, leading existing methods to perform poorly when heterophily is present. Furthermore, the lack of labels in the target graph makes it impossible to assess its homophily level beforehand. To address this challenge, we propose a novel homophily-agnostic approach that effectively transfers knowledge between graphs with varying degrees of homophily. Specifically, we adopt a divide-and-conquer strategy that first separately reconstructs highly homophilic and heterophilic variants of both the source and target graphs, and then performs knowledge alignment separately between corresponding graph variants. Extensive experiments conducted on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our approach, particularly highlighting its substantial advantages on heterophilic graphs.</description>

      <title>"He gets to be the fun parent": Understanding and Supporting Burnt-Out Mothers in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Maternal burnout is a psychological phenomena with documented harms to both mother and child, requiring prompt attention. Mothers experiencing burnout might choose to turn to online anonymous platforms, such as Reddit, to share their experience, due to feelings of shame and stigmatization of mental health issues. In this work, we study how mothers use Reddit to discuss their experiences of burnout. We first identify posts written by burnt out mothers by manually annotating Reddit posts and training machine learning models on them. Focusing on posts made by this population (N = 3,244), we then investigate the issues brought up by mothers, such as the need for help, career advice, and co-parenting issues. Additionally, we investigate how the Reddit community responds to these posts through the analysis of comments. We find that commenters frequently share personal lived experiences with the poster, and provide emotional support. Finally, considering co-parenting could be a mitigating factor for parental burnout, we explore co-pareting patterns experienced by burnt out mothers, finding evidence of lack of support for and unequal expectations from mothers.</description>

      <title>Towards Reliable Social A/B Testing: Spillover-Contained Clustering with Robust Post-Experiment Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A/B testing is the foundation of decision-making in online platforms, yet social products often suffer from network interference: user interactions cause treatment effects to spill over into the control group. Such spillovers bias causal estimates and undermine experimental conclusions. Existing approaches face key limitations: user-level randomization ignores network structure, while cluster-based methods often rely on general-purpose clustering that is not tailored for spillover containment and has difficulty balancing unbiasedness and statistical power at scale. We propose a spillover-contained experimentation framework with two stages. In the pre-experiment stage, we build social interaction graphs and introduce a Balanced Louvain algorithm that produces stable, size-balanced clusters while minimizing cross-cluster edges, enabling reliable cluster-based randomization. In the post-experiment stage, we develop a tailored CUPAC estimator that leverages pre-experiment behavioral covariates to reduce the variance induced by cluster-level assignment, thereby improving statistical power. Together, these components provide both structural spillover containment and robust statistical inference. We validate our approach through large-scale social sharing experiments on Kuaishou, a platform serving hundreds of millions of users. Results show that our method substantially reduces spillover and yields more accurate assessments of social strategies than traditional user-level designs, establishing a reliable and scalable framework for networked A/B testing.</description>

      <title>Friedkin-Johnsen Social Influence Dynamics on Networks: A Boundary-Value Formulation and Influenceability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a rigorous mathematical analysis of the Friedkin--Johnsen model of social influence on networks. We frame the opinion dynamics as a discrete boundary-value problem on a network, emphasizing the role of stubborn (boundary) and susceptible (interior) agents in shaping opinion evolution. This perspective allows for a precise analysis of how network structure, stubborn agents (boundary), and susceptible agents (interior) collectively determine the evolution of opinions. We derive the transient and steady-state solutions using two distinct but related approaches: a general resolvent-based method applicable to agents with heterogeneous susceptibilities, and a spectral method valid for the special case of homogeneous susceptibility. We further establish quantitative convergence rates to the steady state, derive explicit sensitivity formulas with respect to susceptibility parameters, and prove perturbation bounds under changes in the influence matrix. Moreover, we formally define a set of influenceability measures and prove some of their basic properties. Finally, we provide a Monte Carlo illustration on the Zachary karate club graph, showing how the proposed opinion broadcasting centralities and centralizations behave under random susceptibility profiles and how they relate to classical network centralities.</description>

      <title>Robust Sequential Learning in Random Order Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the sequential learning problem, agents in a network attempt to predict a binary ground truth, informed by both a noisy private signal and the predictions of neighboring agents before them. It is well known that social learning in this setting can be highly fragile: small changes to the action ordering, network topology, or even the strength of the agents' private signals can prevent a network from converging to the truth. We study networks that achieve random-order asymptotic truth learning, in which almost all agents learn the ground truth when the decision ordering is selected uniformly at random. We analyze the robustness of these networks, showing that those achieving random-order asymptotic truth learning are resilient to a bounded number of adversarial modifications. We characterize necessary conditions for such networks to succeed in this setting and introduce several graph constructions that learn through different mechanisms. Finally, we present a randomized polynomial-time algorithm that transforms an arbitrary network into one achieving random-order learning using minimal edge or vertex modifications, with provable approximation guarantees. Our results reveal structural properties of networks that achieve random-order learning and provide algorithmic tools for designing robust social networks.</description>

      <title>Hyperactive Minority Alter the Stability of Community Notes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As platforms increasingly scale down professional fact-checking, community-based alternatives are promoted as more transparent and democratic. The main substitute being proposed is community-based contextualization, most notably Community Notes on X, where users write annotations and collectively rate their helpfulness under a consensus-oriented algorithm. This shift raises a basic empirical question: to what extent do users' social dynamics affect the emergence of Community Notes? We address this question by characterizing participation and political behavior, using the full public release of notes and ratings (between 2021 and 2025). We show that contribution activity is highly concentrated: a small minority of users accounts for a disproportionate share of ratings. Crucially, these high-activity contributors are not neutral volunteers: they are selective in the content they engage with and substantially more politically polarized than the overall contributor population. We replicate the notes' emergence process by integrating the open-source implementation of the Community Notes consensus algorithm used in production. This enables us to conduct counterfactual simulations that modify the display status of notes by varying the pool of raters. Our results reveal that the system is structurally unstable: the emergence and visibility of notes often depend on the behavior of a few dozen highly active users, and even minor perturbations in their participation can lead to markedly different outcomes. In sum, rather than decentralizing epistemic authority, community-based fact-checking on X reconfigures it, concentrating substantial power in the hands of a small, polarized group of highly active contributors.</description>

      <title>Stickers on Facebook: Multifunctionality and face-enhancing politeness in everyday social interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stickers are multimodal resources widely used in everyday digital conversations. Despite their popularity, most studies have focused on emojis and emoticons. Therefore, this study analyzes, from a sociopragmatic perspective, the use of stickers in the comments from a corpus of Facebook posts containing acts of face-enhancing politeness, created during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The main objective is to identify their communicative functions and determine the extent to which they act as strategies of face-enhancing politeness also considering the gender variable. The results show a predominance of naked stickers and those representing human emotions and gestures, and festive situations. Six main functions were identified: affective, illocutionary, interactional, gestural, aesthetic, and representative or substitutive. It was found that stickers can intensify polite messages and express face-enhancing politeness autonomously. Furthermore, gender differences were observed: women use more stickers, especially cute and affectionate ones, whereas men prefer masculine human figures. These findings highlight the key and multifunctional role of stickers in affective digital communication.</description>

      <title>Clarifying Core Dimensions in Digital Maturity Models: An Integrative Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital Transformation (DT) initiatives frequently face high failure rates, and while Digital Maturity Models (DMMs) offer potential solutions, they have notable shortcomings. Specifically, there is significant disparity in the dimensions considered relevant, a lack of clarity in their definitions, and uncertainty regarding their components. This study aims to provide a clearer understanding of DMMs by proposing integrative definitions of the most frequently used dimensions. Using a Systematic Mapping approach, including automatic search and snowballing techniques, we analyzed 76 DMMs to answer two Research Questions: (RQ1) What are the most frequent dimensions in DMMs? and (RQ2) How are these dimensions described, including their components? We reconcile varying interpretations of the ten most frequent dimensions -- Organization, Strategy, Technology, Culture, Process, Operations, People, Management, Customer, and Data -- and propose integrative definitions for each. Compared to previous analyses, this study provides a broader and more recent perspective on Digital Maturity Models.</description>

      <title>Agent Skills: A Data-Driven Analysis of Claude Skills for Extending Large Language Model Functionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Agent skills extend large language model (LLM) agents with reusable, program-like modules that define triggering conditions, procedural logic, and tool interactions. As these skills proliferate in public marketplaces, it is unclear what types are available, how users adopt them, and what risks they pose. To answer these questions, we conduct a large-scale, data-driven analysis of 40,285 publicly listed skills from a major marketplace. Our results show that skill publication tends to occur in short bursts that track shifts in community attention. We also find that skill content is highly concentrated in software engineering workflows, while information retrieval and content creation account for a substantial share of adoption. Beyond content trends, we uncover a pronounced supply-demand imbalance across categories, and we show that most skills remain within typical prompt budgets despite a heavy-tailed length distribution. Finally, we observe strong ecosystem homogeneity, with widespread intent-level redundancy, and we identify non-trivial safety risks, including skills that enable state-changing or system-level actions. Overall, our findings provide a quantitative snapshot of agent skills as an emerging infrastructure layer for agents and inform future work on skill reuse, standardization, and safety-aware design.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.08407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exploring missing data in attributed graphs introduces unique challenges beyond those found in tabular datasets. In this work, we extend the taxonomy for missing data mechanisms to attributed graphs by proposing GAMM (Graph Attributes Missing Mechanisms), a framework that systematically links missingness probability to both node attributes and the underlying graph structure. Our taxonomy enriches the conventional definitions of masking mechanisms by introducing graph-specific dependencies. We empirically demonstrate that state-of-the-art imputation methods, while effective on traditional masks, significantly struggle when confronted with these more realistic graph-aware missingness scenarios.</description>

      <title>FairRARI: A Plug and Play Framework for Fairness-Aware PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: PageRank (PR) is a fundamental algorithm in graph machine learning tasks. Owing to the increasing importance of algorithmic fairness, we consider the problem of computing PR vectors subject to various group-fairness criteria based on sensitive attributes of the vertices. At present, principled algorithms for this problem are lacking - some cannot guarantee that a target fairness level is achieved, while others do not feature optimality guarantees. In order to overcome these shortcomings, we put forth a unified in-processing convex optimization framework, termed FairRARI, for tackling different group-fairness criteria in a ``plug and play'' fashion. Leveraging a variational formulation of PR, the framework computes fair PR vectors by solving a strongly convex optimization problem with fairness constraints, thereby ensuring that a target fairness level is achieved. We further introduce three different fairness criteria which can be efficiently tackled using FairRARI to compute fair PR vectors with the same asymptotic time-complexity as the original PR algorithm. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets showcase that FairRARI outperforms existing methods in terms of utility, while achieving the desired fairness levels across multiple vertex groups; thereby highlighting its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Whose Name Comes Up? Benchmarking and Intervention-Based Auditing of LLM-Based Scholar Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08873v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for academic expert recommendation. Existing audits typically evaluate model outputs in isolation, largely ignoring end-user inference-time interventions. As a result, it remains unclear whether failures such as refusals, hallucinations, and uneven coverage stem from model choice or deployment decisions. We introduce LLMScholarBench, a benchmark for auditing LLM-based scholar recommendation that jointly evaluates model infrastructure and end-user interventions across multiple tasks. LLMScholarBench measures both technical quality and social representation using nine metrics. We instantiate the benchmark in physics expert recommendation and audit 22 LLMs under temperature variation, representation-constrained prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) via web search. Our results show that end-user interventions do not yield uniform improvements but instead redistribute error across dimensions. Higher temperature degrades validity, consistency, and factuality. Representation-constrained prompting improves diversity at the expense of factuality, while RAG primarily improves technical quality while reducing diversity and parity. Overall, end-user interventions reshape trade-offs rather than providing a general fix. We release code and data that can be adapted to other disciplines by replacing domain-specific ground truth and metrics.</description>

      <title>When do neural ordinary differential equations generalize on complex networks?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) can effectively learn dynamical systems from time series data, but their behavior on graph-structured data remains poorly understood, especially when applied to graphs with different size or structure than encountered during training. We study neural ODEs ($\mathtt{nODE}$s) with vector fields following the Barab\'asi-Barzel form, trained on synthetic data from five common dynamical systems on graphs. Using the $\mathbb{S}^1$-model to generate graphs with realistic and tunable structure, we find that degree heterogeneity and the type of dynamical system are the primary factors in determining $\mathtt{nODE}$s' ability to generalize across graph sizes and properties. This extends to $\mathtt{nODE}$s' ability to capture fixed points and maintain performance amid missing data. Average clustering plays a secondary role in determining $\mathtt{nODE}$ performance. Our findings highlight $\mathtt{nODE}$s as a powerful approach to understanding complex systems but underscore challenges emerging from degree heterogeneity and clustering in realistic graphs.</description>

Abstract: Short video streaming systems such as TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, etc., have reached billions of active users worldwide. At the core of such systems are (proprietary) recommendation algorithms which recommend a sequence of videos to each user, in a personalized way. We aim to understand the temporal evolution of recommendations made by such algorithms, as well as the interplay between the recommendations and user experience. While past work has studied recommendation algorithms using textual data (e.g., titles, hashtags, etc.) as well as user studies and interviews, we add a third modality of analysis - we perform automated analysis of the videos themselves. To perform such multimodal analysis, we develop a new HCI measurement approach that starts with our new tool called VCA (Video Content Analysis) that leverages recent advances in Vision Language Models (VLMs). We apply VCA on a trifecta of HCI methodologies - real user studies, interviews, and data donation. This allows us to understand temporal aspects of how well TikTok's recommendation algorithm is perceived by users, is affected by user interactions, and aligns with user history; how users are sensitive to the order of videos recommended; and how the algorithm's effectiveness itself may be predictable in the future. While it is not our goal to reverse-engineer TikTok's recommendation algorithm, our new findings indicate behavioral aspects that the TikTok user community can benefit from.</description>

      <title>Why We Experience Society Differently: Intrinsic Dispositions as Drivers of Ideological Complexity in Adaptive Social Networks</title>

Abstract: Understanding the emergence of inequality in complex systems requires attention to both structural dynamics and intrinsic heterogeneity. In the context of opinion dynamics, traditional models relied on static snapshots or assumed homogeneous agent behavior, overlooking how diverse cognitive dispositions shape belief evolution. While some recent models introduce behavioral heterogeneity, they typically focus on macro-level patterns, neglecting the unequal and individualized dynamics that unfold at the agent level. In this study, we analyze an adaptive social network model where each agent exhibits one of three behavioral tendencies-homophily, neophily (attention to novelty), or social conformity-and measure the complexity of individual opinion trajectories using normalized Lempel-Ziv complexity. We find that the dynamics are often counterintuitive-homophilic agents, despite seeking similarity, become increasingly unpredictable; neophilic agents, despite pursuing novelty, exhibit constrained exploration; and conformic agents display a two-phase trajectory, transitioning from early stability to later unpredictability. Moreover, these patterns remain similar across diverse network settings, suggesting that internal behavioral dispositions - rather than external environment alone - play a central role in shaping long-term opinion unpredictability. The broader implication is that individuals' experiences of ideological volatility, uncertainty, or stability are not merely environmental, but may be endogenously self-structured through their own cognitive tendencies. These results establish a novel individual-level lens on opinion dynamics, where the behavioral identity of agents serves as a dynamical fingerprint in the evolution of belief systems, and gives rise to persistent disparities in dynamical experience within self-organizing social systems, even in structurally similar environments.</description>

      <title>Structural shifts in institutional participation and collaboration within the AI arXiv preprint research ecosystem</title>

Abstract: The emergence of large language models (LLMs) represents a significant technological shift within the scientific ecosystem, particularly within the field of artificial intelligence (AI). This paper examines structural changes in the AI research landscape using a dataset of arXiv preprints (cs.AI) from 2021 through 2025. Given the rapid pace of AI development, the preprint ecosystem has become a critical barometer for real-time scientific shifts, often preceding formal peer-reviewed publication by months or years. By employing a multi-stage data collection and enrichment pipeline in conjunction with LLM-based institution classification, we analyze the evolution of publication volumes, author team sizes, and academic--industry collaboration patterns. Our results reveal an unprecedented surge in publication output following the introduction of ChatGPT, with academic institutions continuing to provide the largest volume of research. However, we observe that academic--industry collaboration is still suppressed, as measured by a Normalized Collaboration Index (NCI) that remains significantly below the random-mixing baseline across all major subfields. These findings highlight a continuing institutional divide and suggest that the capital-intensive nature of generative AI research may be reshaping the boundaries of scientific collaboration.</description>

      <title>Reproducing the first and second moments of empirical degree distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10373v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The study of probabilistic models for the analysis of complex networks represents a flourishing research field. Among the former, Exponential Random Graphs (ERGs) have gained increasing attention over the years. So far, only linear ERGs have been extensively employed to gain insight into the structural organisation of real-world complex networks. None, however, is capable of accounting for the variance of the empirical degree distribution. To this aim, non-linear ERGs must be considered. After showing that the usual mean-field approximation forces the degree-corrected version of the two-star model to degenerate, we define a fitness-induced variant of it. Such a `softened' model is capable of reproducing the sample variance, while retaining the explanatory power of its linear counterpart, within a purely canonical framework.</description>

      <title>Deep Generative Model for Human Mobility Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling human mobility is central to challenges in transport planning, sustainable urban design, and public health. Despite decades of effort, simulating individual mobility remains challenging because of its complex, context-dependent, and exploratory nature. Here, we advance a unified event-level formulation of daily mobility and propose MobilityGen to generate multi-attribute event sequences over days to weeks at large spatial scales. By linking behavioral attributes with environmental context, MobilityGen reproduces key patterns such as scaling laws for location visits, activity time allocation, and the coupled evolution of travel mode and destination choices. It reflects spatio-temporal variability and generates diverse and plausible mobility patterns consistent with the built environment. Beyond standard validation, MobilityGen enables analyses that have been difficult with earlier models, including how access to urban space varies across travel modes and how co-presence dynamics shape social exposure and segregation. Together, these results support an integrated, data-driven basis for fine-grained studies of human mobility behavior and its societal implications.</description>

      <title>Community detection in network using Szegedy quantum walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21152v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a network, the vertices with similar characteristics construct communities. The vertices in a community are well-connected. Detecting the communities in a network is a challenging and important problem in the theory of complex networks. One approach to solving this problem uses the classical random walks on graphs. In quantum computing, quantum walks are the quantum mechanical counterparts of classical random walks. In this article, we employ a variant of Szegedy's quantum walk to develop a procedure for discovering the communities in networks. The limiting probability distribution of quantum walks assists us in determining the inclusion of a vertex in a community. We apply our community detection procedure to a variety of graphs and social networks, including the relaxed caveman graph, $l$-partition graph, Karate club graph, and the dolphin's social network, among others.</description>
