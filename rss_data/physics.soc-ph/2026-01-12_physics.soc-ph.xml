      <title>Adaptive behaviors neutralize bistable explosive transitions in higher-order contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During contagion phenomena, individuals perceiving a risk of infection commonly adapt their behavior and reduce their exposure. The effects of such adaptive mechanisms have been studied for processes in which pairwise interactions drive contagion. However, contagion and the perception of infection risk can also involve ("higher-order") group interactions, leading potentially to new phenomenology. How adaptive behavior resulting from risk perception affects higher-order processes remains an open question. Here, we consider the impact of several risk-based adaptive behaviors on pairwise and higher-order contagion processes, using numerical simulations and an analytical mean-field approach. For pairwise contagion, adaptive mechanisms based on local (pairwise or group-based) risk perception impact only the endemic state, without affecting the epidemic phase transition. For higher-order contagion processes, instead, the adaptivity defuses the impact of non-linear group interactions: this reduces or even completely suppresses the parameter range in which bistability is possible, effectively transforming a higher-order contagion process into a pairwise one.</description>

      <title>When legs and bodies synchronize: Two-level collective dynamics in dense crowds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-dense crowds, in which physical contact between people cannot be avoided, pose major safety concerns. Nevertheless, the underlying dynamics driving their collective behaviours remain poorly understood. Existing dense crowd models, mostly two-dimensional and contact-based, overlook biomechanical mechanisms that govern individual balance motion. In this study, we introduce a minimal two-level pedestrian model that couples upper body and legs dynamics, allowing us to capture transitions between balanced and unbalanced states at the individual scale. Whereas previous models fail to achieve it, this coupling gives rise to emergent collective behaviours observed empirically, such as self-organized waves and large-scale rotational motion within the crowd. The model bridges basic individual biomechanical concepts and macroscopic flow dynamics, offering a new framework for modelling and understanding collective motions in ultra-dense crowds.</description>

      <title>How Exploration Breaks Cooperation in Shared-Policy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning in dynamic social dilemmas commonly relies on parameter sharing to enable scalability. We show that in shared-policy Deep Q-Network learning, standard exploration can induce a robust and systematic collapse of cooperation even in environments where fully cooperative equilibria are stable and payoff dominant. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that shared DQN converges to stable but persistently low-cooperation regimes. This collapse is not caused by reward misalignment, noise, or insufficient training, but by a representational failure arising from partial observability combined with parameter coupling across heterogeneous agent states. Exploration-driven updates bias the shared representation toward locally dominant defection responses, which then propagate across agents and suppress cooperative learning. We confirm that the failure persists across network sizes, exploration schedules, and payoff structures, and disappears when parameter sharing is removed or when agents maintain independent representations. These results identify a fundamental failure mode of shared-policy MARL and establish structural conditions under which scalable learning architectures can systematically undermine cooperation. Our findings provide concrete guidance for the design of multi-agent learning systems in social and economic environments where collective behavior is critical.</description>

      <title>Explainable AI: Learning from the Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence now outperforms humans in several scientific and engineering tasks, yet its internal representations often remain opaque. In this Perspective, we argue that explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), combined with causal reasoning, enables {\it learning from the learners}. Focusing on discovery, optimization and certification, we show how the combination of foundation models and explainability methods allows the extraction of causal mechanisms, guides robust design and control, and supports trust and accountability in high-stakes applications. We discuss challenges in faithfulness, generalization and usability of explanations, and propose XAI as a unifying framework for human-AI collaboration in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Mapping bipartite networks into multidimensional hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04316v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bipartite networks appear in many real-world contexts, linking entities across two distinct sets. They are often analyzed via one-mode projections, but such projections can introduce artificial correlations and inflated clustering, obscuring the true underlying structure. In this paper, we propose a geometric model for bipartite networks that leverages the high levels of bipartite four-cycles as a measure of clustering to place both node types in the same similarity space, where link probabilities decrease with distance. Additionally, we introduce B-Mercator, an algorithm that infers node positions from the bipartite structure. We evaluate its performance on diverse datasets, illustrating how the resulting embeddings improve downstream tasks such as node classification and distance-based link prediction in machine learning. These hyperbolic embeddings also enable the generation of synthetic networks with node features closely resembling real-world ones, thereby safeguarding sensitive information while allowing secure data sharing. In addition, we show how preserving bipartite structure avoids the pitfalls of projection-based techniques, yielding more accurate descriptions and better performance. Our method provides a robust framework for uncovering hidden geometry in complex bipartite systems.</description>

      <title>Insights on structure and influence from the adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra of intersecting ring networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A network's community structure commonly impacts its functions. For instance, networks seeking synchronisation will see this process follow the topology's hierarchical and community structuring. Herein, the interplay of network adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra is shown to uncover hierarchical influence and community structure. Ring networks embedded with hubs of high connectivity are first analysed to characterise the differing insights of the adjacency and Laplacian eigenspectra. This understanding is then transferred to the case study of satellite networks composed of intersecting rings. From these scenarios, it is found that where the adjacency reflects a network's structure, the Laplacian detects nodes' influence profiles. The adjacency identifies the number and relative sizes of salient network structures, for example hubs of high connectivity. In contrast, the Laplacian decomposes these structures in sets of nodes with equivalent influence profiles, where influences emerges due to variations in nodes' connectivity.</description>

      <title>What is emergence, after all?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04951v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable and physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By refining the concept of emergence, we gain a clearer and more grounded understanding of complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.</description>

      <title>Multilayer networks characterize human-mobility patterns by industry sector for the 2021 Texas winter storm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding human mobility during disastrous events is crucial for emergency planning and disaster management. We develop a methodology to construct time-varying, multilayer networks where edges encode observed movements between spatial regions (census tracts) and network layers encode movement categories by industry sectors (e.g., schools, hospitals). Using the 2021 Texas winter storm as a case study, we find that people markedly reduced movements to ambulatory healthcare services, restaurants, and schools, but prioritized movements to grocery stores and gas stations. Additionally, we study the predictability of nodes' in- and out-degrees in the multilayer networks, which encode movements into and out of census tracts. Inward movements prove harder to predict than outward movements, especially during the storm. Our findings on the reduction, prioritization, and predictability of sector-specific movements aim to support mobility-related decisions during future extreme weather events.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Opinion Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and investigate a multi-dimensional opinion dynamics model where people are characterised by both opinions and importance weights across these opinions. Opinion changes occur through binary interactions, with a novel coupling mechanism: the change in one topic depends on the weighted similarity across the full opinion vector. We state the kinetic equation for this process and derive its mean-field partial differential equation to describe the overall dynamics. Analytical computations and numerical simulations confirm that this model generates complex stationary states, and we demonstrate that the final opinion structures are critically determined by the peoples' opinion weights.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Linear-Quadratic Gap: A Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach to Robust Supply Chain Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design of supply chain networks in densely populated urban logistics systems faces a timely dilemma: the traditional optimisation approaches are effective to maximise the level of demand perfusion, but they are limited to embracing large expenses in overlapping the facilities and cannibalisation in the market. When tested on a high-fidelity digital twin of the Delhi NCR road network of thirty candidate sites, we establish that Classical Greedy algorithms using the theoretical maximum demand of (473 units) lack any theoretical overlap penalty, but incur a prohibitive overlap penalty (5.08). Here, in comparison, the Quantum-Inspired solution only losses 3.2% of demand (450 compared to 465 units relative to the optimal solution), but the solution preserves 21.8% less operational overlap risk (3.26 compared to 4.17), which can be viewed as a 35.8% improvement compared to the Greedy solution. Geospatial analysis shows that it can be attributed to a shift in strategies: This, in contrast to Classical approaches, which focus on locating facilities in the high-density central areas (North/Central Delhi), the quantum-inspired solver autonomously chooses the diversified topology of the North-south network, penetrating into the underserved periphery growth markets. This is a spatially balanced arrangement which is congruent to the polycentric structure of modern time megacities, and displays better stability to volatility in demand. We have shown that quantum-inspired optimisation methods can close the so-called Linear-Quadratic Gap phenomenon, i.e. the systematic inability of greedy methods to capture the actual quadratic interactions between facilities, and offer a way of computing the pathway to operationally robust and risk-optimised supply chain networks in dense urban conditions.</description>
