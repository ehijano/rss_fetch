      <title>Measures to mitigate the coherent beam-beam instability at CEPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both horizontal and vertical coherent beam-beam instability are important issues at CEPC. The horizontal instability (X-Z instability) could be induced by beam-beam itself. In this paper we try to study the effect of chromaticity and resistive feedback by analysis and simulation. The vertical instability may be induced due to the combined effect of beam-beam interaction and vacuum impedance. Finite chromaticity and asymmetrical tunes have been proposed to suppress the vertical instability. Due to the further increase of impedance budget, we need to find more measures to mitigate the instability. The effect of resistive feedback and hourglass effect are evaluated by simulation.</description>

      <title>Bent Crystal Design and Characterization for High-Energy Physics Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bent crystal are widely used as optics for X-rays, but via the phenomenon of planar channeling they may act as waveguide for relativistic charged particles beam as well, outperforming some of the traditional technologies currently employed. A physical description of the phenomenon and the resulting potential for applications in a particle accelerator is reported. The elastic properties of the anisotropic crystal lattice medium are discussed, introducing different types of curvature which can enable a wide array of bending schemes optimized for each different case features. The technological development of machining strategy and bending solutions useful for the fabrication of crystals suitable in high energy particle manipulations are described. As well as the high precision characterization processes developed in order to satisfy the strict requirements for installation in an accelerator. Finally, the characterization of channeling phenomenon in bent crystal is described, pointing out several experimental setups suitable to comply each specific case constrains.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing classical accelerometers and gyroscopes with a quantum inertial sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate measurement of inertial quantities is essential in geophysics, geodesy, fundamental physics and navigation. For instance, inertial navigation systems require stable inertial sensors to compute the position and attitude of the carrier. Here, we present the first hybridized cold-atom inertial sensor based on matter wave interferometry where the atomic measurements are used to correct the drift and bias of both an accelerometer and a gyroscope at the same time. We achieve respective bias stabilities of $7 \times 10^{-7}$ m/s$^2$ and $4 \times 10^{-7}$ rad/s after two days of integration, corresponding to a 100-fold and 3-fold increase on the stability of the hybridized sensor compared to the force-balanced accelerometer and Coriolis vibrating gyroscope operated alone. The instrument has been operated under up to 100-times the Earth rotation rate. Compared to state-of-the-art atomic gyroscope, the simplicity and scalability of our architecture make it easily extendable to a compact full six-axis inertial measurement unit, providing a pathway towards autonomous positioning and orientation using cold-atom sensors.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Synchrotron Beam Characterisation from a Single Interferogram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Double-aperture Young interferometry is widely used in accelerators to provide a one-dimensional beam measurement. We improve this technique by combining and further developing techniques of non-redundant aperture masking and self-calibration from astronomy. Using visible synchrotron radiation, tests at the ALBA synchrotron show that this method provides an accurate two-dimensional beam transverse characterisation, even from a single 1ms interferogram. The technique is resistant to phase fluctuations that might be introduced by vibration of optical components, or in the laboratory atmosphere.</description>
