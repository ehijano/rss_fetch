      <title>Short-Term Effects of COVID-19 on Wages: Empirical Evidence and Underlying Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the causal relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and wage levels, aiming to provide a quantified assessment of the impact. While no significant evidence is found for long-term effects, the analysis reveals a statistically significant positive influence on wages in the short term, particularly within a one-year horizon. Contrary to common expectations, the results suggest that COVID-19 may have led to short-run wage increases. Several potential mechanisms are proposed to explain this counterintuitive outcome. The findings remain robust when controlling for other macroeconomic indicators such as GDP, considered here as a proxy for aggregate demand. The paper also addresses issues of external validity in the concluding section.</description>

      <title>Can Large Language Models Trade? Testing Financial Theories with LLM Agents in Market Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a realistic simulated stock market where large language models (LLMs) act as heterogeneous competing trading agents. The open-source framework incorporates a persistent order book with market and limit orders, partial fills, dividends, and equilibrium clearing alongside agents with varied strategies, information sets, and endowments. Agents submit standardized decisions using structured outputs and function calls while expressing their reasoning in natural language. Three findings emerge: First, LLMs demonstrate consistent strategy adherence and can function as value investors, momentum traders, or market makers per their instructions. Second, market dynamics exhibit features of real financial markets, including price discovery, bubbles, underreaction, and strategic liquidity provision. Third, the framework enables analysis of LLMs' responses to varying market conditions, similar to partial dependence plots in machine-learning interpretability. The framework allows simulating financial theories without closed-form solutions, creating experimental designs that would be costly with human participants, and establishing how prompts can generate correlated behaviors affecting market stability.</description>

      <title>Intergenerational cross-subsidies in UK Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) funds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We evaluate the performance and level of intergenerational cross-subsidy in flat-accrual and dynamic-accrual collective defined contribution (CDC) schemes which have been designed to be compatible with UK legislation. In the flat-accrual scheme, all members accrue the benefits at the same rate irrespective of age. This captures the most significant feature of the Royal Mail Collective Pension Plan, which is currently the only UK CDC scheme. The dynamic-accrual schemes seeks to reduce intergenerational cross-subsidies by varying the rate of benefit-accrual in accordance to the age of members and the current funding level.
  We find that these CDC schemes can often be successful in smoothing pension outcomes post-retirement while outperforming a defined contribution scheme followed by annuity purchase at the point of retirement. However, this out-performance is not guaranteed in a flat-accrual scheme and there is little smoothing of projected pension outcomes before retirement.
  There are significant intergenerational cross-subsidies in the flat-accrual scheme. These qualitatively mirror the cross-subsidies seen in existing defined benefit schemes, but we find the magnitude of the cross-subsidies is much larger in flat accrual CDC schemes.
  The dynamic-accrual scheme design is intended to reduce such cross-subsidies, but we find they still arise due to the approximate pricing methodology used to determine the benefits accrued by each contribution. Although the cross-subsidies tend to cancel out over time, in any given year they can be large. Thus, the benefits accrued by contributions should be calculated rigorously to reduce cross-subsidies.</description>
