      <title>Geometric, topological and dynamical properties of conformally symplectic systems, normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds, and scattering maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformally symplectic diffeomorphisms $f:M \rightarrow M$ transform a symplectic form $\omega$ on a manifold $M$ into a multiple of itself, $f^* \omega = \eta \omega$. We assume $\omega$ is bounded, as some of the results may fail otherwise.
  We show that there are deep interactions between the topological properties of the manifold, the dynamical properties of the map, and the geometry of invariant manifolds.
  We show that, when the symplectic form is not exact, the possible conformal factors $\eta$ are related to topological properties of the manifold. For some manifolds the conformal factors are restricted to be algebraic numbers.
  We also find relations between dynamical properties (relations between growth rate of vectors and $\eta$) and symplectic properties.
  Normally hyperbolic invariant manifolds (NHIM) and their (un)stable manifolds are important landmarks that organize long-term dynamical behaviour. We prove that a NHIM is symplectic if and only if the rates satisfy certain pairing rules and if and only if the rates and the conformal factor satisfy certain (natural) inequalities.
  Homoclinic excursions to NHIMs are quantitatively described by scattering maps. These maps give the trajectory asymptotic in the future as a function of the trajectory asymptotic in the past. We prove that the scattering maps are symplectic even if the dynamics is dissipative. We also show that if the symplectic form is exact, then the scattering maps are exact, even if the dynamics is not exact. We give a variational interpretation of scattering maps in the conformally symplectic setting.
  We also show that similar properties of NHIMs and scattering maps hold in the case when $\omega$ is presymplectic. In dynamical systems with many rates (e.g., quasi-integrable systems near multiple resonances), pre-symplectic geometries appear naturally.</description>

      <title>The special concave toric domain for the rotating Kepler problem</title>

Abstract: The Rotating Kepler Problem (RKP) arises as a fundamental model in celestial mechanics, appearing as a limiting case of the circular restricted three-body problem. It offers a tractable yet rich framework for studying periodic orbits, energy levels, and symplectic structures. In this work, we investigate the RKP for energy values less than or equal to the critical threshold -3/2. Using the Ligon-Schaaf and Levi-Civita symplectic regularizations, we identify a bounded component of the RKP phase space. Within this setting, we construct a special concave toric domain (SCTD) tailored to the RKP, which provides a concrete geometric framework for computing embedded contact homology (ECH) capacities below the critical energy. The SCTD enables a rigorous analysis of symplectic embedding problems and energy constraints in dynamical systems. Furthermore, we introduce a combinatorial tree structure, inspired by the Stern-Brocot tree, that encodes energy data and facilitates the computation of ECH capacities on the bounded component. These results advance the understanding of symplectic embeddings in celestial mechanics and provide new tools for the study of Hamiltonian dynamics in rotating systems.</description>

      <title>Small symplectic caps and embeddings of homology balls in the complex projective plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a handlebody construction of small symplectic caps, and hence of small closed symplectic 4-manifolds. We use this to construct handlebody descriptions of symplectic embeddings of rational homology balls in $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$, and thereby provide the first examples of (infinitely many) symplectic handlebody decompositions of a closed symplectic 4-manifold. Our constructions provide a new topological interpretation of almost toric fibrations of $\mathbb{C}\mathrm{P}^2$ in terms of symplectic handlebody decompositions.</description>

      <title>Contact surgery numbers of projective spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We classify all contact projective spaces with contact surgery number one. In particular, this implies that there exist infinitely many non-isotopic contact structures on the real projective 3-space which cannot be obtained by a single rational contact surgery from the standard tight contact 3-sphere.
  Large parts of our proofs deal with a detailed analysis of Gompf's $\Gamma$-invariant of tangential 2-plane fields on 3-manifolds. From our main result we also deduce that the $\Gamma$-invariant of a tangential 2-plane field on the real projective 3-space only depends on its $d_3$-invariant.</description>
