      <title>The NASA Exoplanet Archive and Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program: Data, Tools, and Usage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NASA Exoplanet Archive and the Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program service are two widely used resources for the exoplanet community. The NASA Exoplanet Archive provides a complete and accurate accounting of exoplanetary systems published by NASA missions and by the community in the refereed literature. In anticipation of continued exponential growth in the number of exoplanetary systems, and the increasing complexity in our characterization of these systems, the NASA Exoplanet Archive has restructured its primary tables and interfaces, as well as extending and standardizing their modes of access. The Exoplanet Follow-up Observing Program service provides the exoplanet community with a venue for coordinating and sharing follow-up and precursor data for exoplanets, their host stars, and stars that might eventually be targets for future planet searches, and recently reached one million files uploaded by the community. In this paper we describe the updates to our data holdings, functionality, accessibility, and tools, as well as future priorities for these two services.</description>

      <title>A limit on the mass of the Taurid Resonant Swarm at sub-100 meter sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a pencil-beam survey of the Taurid Swarm, a possible concentration of bodies in the Taurid meteoroid stream associated with the 7:2 mean-motion resonance with Jupiter. Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope MegaCam observations reaching apparent magnitudes of 24.5 in the gri filter were taken over three nights. Rates of motion on the sky allowed for the quick elimination of main-belt objects from the over 1000 moving sources seen. Eight candidates with on-sky rates of motion consistent with Taurids were detected, but seven were subsequently shown to be non-Taurids (Hungarias, Mars-crossers, etc). One object might be a 60 m class Taurid but not enough data was collected and its orbit remains ambiguous. Our results are consistent with no Taurid Swarm members observed, and an upper limit of fewer than 3e3 - 3e4 objects down to H=25.6 +/- 0.3 (diameter of 34-76 m assuming a 2P/Encke-like albedo) at the 95% confidence level. While meteor observations have confirmed the Taurid Swarm's existence at meter and smaller sizes, our results indicate that the current mass budget of the swarm at 100 m sizes does not require an outsize parent to explain it.</description>

      <title>Late gas released in the young Kuiper belt could have significantly contributed to the carbon enrichment of the atmospheres of Neptune and Uranus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exo-Kuiper belts have been observed for decades, but the recent detection of gas in some of them may change our view of the Solar System's youth. Late gas produced by the sublimation of CO (or CO$_2$) ices after the dissipation of the primordial gas could be the norm in young planetesimal belts. Hence, a gas-rich Kuiper belt could have been present in the Solar System. The high C/H ratios observed on Uranus and Neptune could be a clue to the existence of such late gas that could have been accreted onto young icy giants. The aim of this paper is to estimate the carbon enrichment of the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune caused by the accretion of the gas released from a putative gas-rich Kuiper belt. We find that assuming a primordial Kuiper belt with a mass of tens of earth masses leads to significant CO gas accretion onto the giants, which can lead to high C/H ratios, especially for Uranus and Neptune. Our model shows that a relatively massive gas-rich Kuiper belt could have existed in the Solar System's youth, significantly enriching the atmospheres of Uranus and Neptune with carbon. Late gas accretion and its effect on outer giant planets metallicities could be a universal scenario, also occurring in extrasolar systems. Observations of sub-Jupiter exoplanets could provide very useful information to better constrain this scenario, with an enrichment in carbon and oxygen (for warm-enough planets) compared to other elements that should be inversely proportional to their envelope mass.</description>

      <title>POLARIS: A High-contrast Polarimetric Imaging Benchmark Dataset for Exoplanetary Disk Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With over 1,000,000 images from more than 10,000 exposures using state-of-the-art high-contrast imagers (e.g., Gemini Planet Imager, VLT/SPHERE) in the search for exoplanets, can artificial intelligence (AI) serve as a transformative tool in imaging Earth-like exoplanets in the coming decade? In this paper, we introduce a benchmark and explore this question from a polarimetric image representation learning perspective. Despite extensive investments over the past decade, only a few new exoplanets have been directly imaged. Existing imaging approaches rely heavily on labor-intensive labeling of reference stars, which serve as background to extract circumstellar objects (disks or exoplanets) around target stars. With our POLARIS (POlarized Light dAta for total intensity Representation learning of direct Imaging of exoplanetary Systems) dataset, we classify reference star and circumstellar disk images using the full public SPHERE/IRDIS polarized-light archive since 2014, requiring less than 10 percent manual labeling. We evaluate a range of models including statistical, generative, and large vision-language models and provide baseline performance. We also propose an unsupervised generative representation learning framework that integrates these models, achieving superior performance and enhanced representational power. To our knowledge, this is the first uniformly reduced, high-quality exoplanet imaging dataset, rare in astrophysics and machine learning. By releasing this dataset and baselines, we aim to equip astrophysicists with new tools and engage data scientists in advancing direct exoplanet imaging, catalyzing major interdisciplinary breakthroughs.</description>

      <title>Peering through the veil: Investigating protoplanetary disk outer edges using backside visibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoplanetary disks observed in scattered light reveal essential insights into the disk's three-dimensional architecture and dust properties. These disks, which play a crucial role in planet formation, have complex structures where the visibility of the disk's backside can vary significantly based on several parameters. This study aims to explore the factors impacting backside visibility in protoplanetary disks, particularly under variations in inclination, dust distribution, grain characteristics, and outer disk morphology. Using RADMC-3D radiative transfer simulations, we investigate how these variables influence the appearance of the backside in scattered light images. Tapered disk models with exponential tapers, frequently obscure the backside, which supports the rarity of observed backside features. In cases where backside features are visible at lower inclinations, they likely indicate cut-off disks, as backside detection is challenging in standard tapered models at these inclinations. Additionally, factors like dust mass, grain distribution, and disk material stratification play crucial roles in backside observability, affecting its potential detection in real observations. This study contributes to understanding the detectability of the backside in protoplanetary disks, with implications for refining observational strategies and interpreting backside features in scattered light images. These findings help frame backside visibility as a critical aspect of assessing disk structure and evolution.</description>

      <title>The Near-Centaur Environment: Satellites, Rings, and Debris</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unexpected finding of a ring system around the Centaur (10199) Chariklo opened a new window for dynamical studies and posed many questions about the formation and evolutionary mechanisms of Centaurs as well as the relationship to satellites and outbursting activity. As minor planets that cross the orbits of the giant planets, Centaurs have short dynamical lifetimes: Centaurs are supplied from the trans-Neptunian region and some fraction migrates inward to become Jupiter-family comets. Given these dynamical pathways, a comparison of attributes across these classifications provides information to understand the source population(s) and the processes that have affected these minor planets throughout their lifetimes. In this chapter we review the current knowledge of satellites, rings, and debris around Centaur-like bodies, discuss the observational techniques involved, place the information into context with the trans-Neptunian Objects, and consider what the results tell us about the outer solar system. We also examine open questions and future prospects.</description>

      <title>A Resonant Beginning for the Solar System Terrestrial Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past two decades, transit surveys have revealed a class of planets with thick atmospheres -- sub-Neptunes -- that must have completed their accretion in protoplanet disks. When planets form in the gaseous disk, the gravitational interaction with the disk gas drives their migration and results in the trapping of neighboring planets in mean motion resonances, though these resonances can later be broken when the damping effects of disk gas or planetesimals wane. It is widely accepted that the outer Solar System gas giant planets originally formed in a resonant chain, which was later disrupted by dynamical instabilities. Here, we explore whether the early formation of the terrestrial planets in a resonance chain (including Theia) can evolve to the present configuration. Using N-body simulations, we demonstrate that the giant planet instability would also have destabilized the terrestrial resonance chain, triggering moon-forming giant impacts in 20--50\% of our simulated systems, dependent on the initial resonance architecture. After the instability, the eccentricity and inclination of the simulated planets match their present-day values. Under the proposed scenario, the current period ratio of 3.05 between Mars and Venus -- devoid of any special significance in traditional late formation models -- naturally arises as a relic of the former resonance chain.</description>

      <title>Abundance Effects from Protoplanetary Disk Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Systematic abundance differences that depend on the condensation temperatures of elements have been observed, in particular for stars similar to the Sun; solar twins and solar analogs. Similar differences have also recently been shown to exist between solar abundances and abundances of refractory elements in primitive chondrites. Numerous mechanisms have been proposed to account for these effects, including also differences observed in binary systems. Rather than relying on specific mechanisms, this paper aims to show that the observed effects are a natural and unavoidable outcome of the star formation process itself, in which the associated outflows (winds and jets) carry away material, with efficiency varying with condensation temperature. By using analysis based on modeling results and scaling laws, the trends and magnitudes of the effects are investigated, in three contexts: 1) with respect to differences between the Sun and solar twins, 2) with respect to differences between the Sun and CI-chondrites, and 3) with respect to differences between members of binaries. It is shown that protoplanetary disk outflows indeed are expected to have differential abundance effects, with trends and magnitudes consistent with observed abundance effects. The qualitative as well as semi-quantitative character of the effects are reproduced, in all three contexts. The results demonstrate that the observed systematic differences are likely results of the disk outflows associated with the accretion process. In contrast to mechanisms relying on the tiny mass of planets leaving an observable signature, outflows carry away masses similar to the entire mass of the star, thus much more easily resulting in differential effects with the magnitudes observed, without for example having to assume that the abundance differences are limited to the convection zones of the stars.</description>

      <title>New Rotation Periods from the Kepler Bonus Background Light Curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Kepler field hosts the best studied sample of field star rotation periods. However, due to Kepler's large 4" pixels, many of its light curves are at high risk of contamination from background sources. The new Kepler Bonus Background light curves are de-blended using a PSF algorithm, providing light curves of over 400,000 new background sources in addition to over 200,000 re-analyzed Kepler prime targets. These light curves provide the opportunity to search for new rotation periods. Here we apply a convolutional neural network trained on synthetic spot-modulated light curves to regress rotation periods from the Kepler Bonus light curves. We obtained periods for 32,159 total sources, 19,650 of which had previously been measured and 9,811 of which are new periods for both Kepler prime and background sources. Our method also detected 608 pulsation frequencies from asteroseismic oscillations in red giants. We validate our Kepler prime periods against literature values and present the full period sample. We find excellent agreement with previously-known literature periods, validating deep learning as a viable class of period determination methods. Comparing the periods and light curves of foreground-background pairs, we find that as many as 63% of periodic background light curves are still blended with the foreground, highlighting limitations of the de-blending technique.</description>

      <title>Geomagnetic Storms and Satellite Orbital Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03305v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energetic events on the Sun, particularly coronal mass ejections and high speed streams, regulate the near Earth space environment and give rise to space weather. A major terrestrial manifestation of such events are geomagnetic storms. A geomagnetic storm results in dissipation of energy from the solar wind into the atmosphere, leading to Joule heating and thermospheric expansion. This has serious consequences on Low Earth Orbit satellite lifetimes. Our work demonstrates the impact of different kinds of geomagnetic storms on satellite orbits. We also briefly discuss about some physical attributes of satellites that can make them prone to higher orbital decay. Our work highlights the importance of monitoring and predicting space weather, and assessing their impacts on space-based human technologies.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Shocks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, . . . - for the thermal/suprathermal particle populations in the vicinity of two traveling interplanetary shocks observed by Solar Orbiter on 2023-11-29 07:51:17 UTC and 2023-11-30 10:47:26 UTC at $\sim 0.83$ astronomical units from the Sun.
  We investigate these two very dissimilar shocks and elucidate their non-equilibrium features. We do not provide explanations of all observed features, our aim is to report them here for future reference.
  We use high-resolution data obtained with Solar Orbiter's Energetic Particle Detector (EPD), magnetometer (MAG), and Solar Wind Analyzer (SWA) to exhibit the very different natures of these two shocks and describe the detailed properties of suprathermal and energetic particles in their vicinity.
  We observe very different behavior of the energetic particle population because the two shocks are quite different. Solar wind protons and $\alpha$-particles are highly dynamic at the first, their beams appear to align well with rapid oscillations of the interplanetary magnetic field. Suprathermal particles associated with the second shock exhibit clear non-equilibrium and anisotropic features in their differential intensities at time scales comparable to the proton gyroperiod.
  The different geometries of the two shocks resulted in highly dissimilar populations of suprathermal and energetic particles in their vicinity. The first shock was associated with very interesting microphysics of the bulk plasma velocity distribution, the second resulted in similarly interesting microphysics of the accelerated particles. Both showed strong temporal variability of the particle populations at scales comparable to the proton gyroperiod.</description>

      <title>Retention of surface water on tidally locked rocky planets in the Venus zone around M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Terrestrial planets within the Venus zone surrounding M dwarf stars can retain surface ice caps on the perpetual dark side if atmospheric heat transport is inefficient, {as suggested by previous global climate simulations \citep[e.g.,][]{leconte2013}.} This condition is {proposed} to play a role in the potential regional habitability of these planets. However, the amount of surface ice may be limited by considering the water condensed from the steam atmosphere in a runaway greenhouse state, and the physical mechanism for triggering the condensation process is not clear. Here, we use a two-column moist radiative-convective-subsiding model to investigate the water condensation process on tidally locked planets from the runaway greenhouse state. We find that the water condensation process is characterized by two distinct equilibrium states under the same {incoming stellar flux}. The initiation of condensation corresponds to a warm, unstable state exhibiting positive Planck feedback, whereas the termination phase corresponds to a cold, stable state exhibiting negative Planck feedback. We further show that the surface water mass in the collapsed state {decreases with the} incoming stellar flux, background surface pressure, and optical thickness of non-condensible greenhouse gases, with a global equivalent depth of less than $\sim 20$ cm. Our two-column approach provides a straightforward way to understand the water evolution on Venus zone planets around M dwarfs.</description>
