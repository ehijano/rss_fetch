      <title>A Geometric Perspective on Kinetic Matter-Radiation Interaction and Moment Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a geometric perspective on the kinetic interaction of matter and radiation, based on a metriplectic approach. We discuss the interaction of kinetic theories via dissipative brackets, with our fundamental example being the coupling of matter, described by the Boltzmann equation, and radiation, described by the radiation transport equation. We explore the transition from kinetic systems to their corresponding moment systems, provide a Hamiltonian description of such moment systems, and give a geometric interpretation of the moment closure problem for kinetic theories. As applications, we discuss in detail diffusion radiation hydrodynamics as an example of a geometric moment closure of kinetic matter-radiation interaction and additionally, we apply the variable moment closure framework of Burby (2023) to derive novel Hamiltonian moment closures for pure radiation transport and discuss an interesting connection to the Hamiltonian fluid closures derived by Burby (2023).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study employs the Riesz-Feller fractional derivative to determine Fisher and Shannon parameters for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator. By deriving the Riesz fractional derivative of the probability density function, we quantify both Fisher information and Shannon entropy, thus providing valuable insights into the system's probabilistic nature.</description>

      <title>The geometry of dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dissipative phenomena manifest in multiple mechanical systems. In this dissertation, different geometric frameworks for modelling non-conservative dynamics are considered. The objective is to generalize several results from conservative systems to dissipative systems, specially those concerning the symmetries and integrability of these systems. More specifically, three classes of geometric frameworks modelling dissipative systems are considered: systems with external forces, contact systems and systems with impacts. The first two allow modelling a continuous dissipation of energy over time, while the latter also permits considering abrupt changes of energy in the instants of the impacts.</description>

      <title>Analysis of a Mathematical Model for Fluid Transport in Poroelastic Materials in 2D Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mathematical model for the poroelastic materials (PEM) with the variable volume is developed in multidimensional case. Governing equations of the model are constructed using the continuity equations, which reflect the well-known physical laws. The deformation vector is specified using the Terzaghi effective stress tensor. In the two-dimensional space case, the model is studied by analytical methods. Using the classical Lie method, it is proved that the relevant nonlinear system of the (1+2)-dimensional governing equations admits highly nontrivial Lie symmetries leading to an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. The radially-symmetric case is studied in details. It is shown how correct boundary conditions in the case of PEM in the form of a ring and an annulus are constructed. As a result, boundary-value problems with a moving boundary describing the ring (annulus) deformation are constructed.
  The relevant nonlinear boundary-value problems are analytically solved in the stationary case. In particular, the analytical formulae for unknown deformations and an unknown radius of the annulus are presented.</description>

      <title>Hyperboloidal Approach to Quasinormal Modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.11478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillations of black hole spacetimes exhibit divergent behavior toward the bifurcation sphere and spatial infinity. This divergence can be understood as a consequence of the geometry in these spacetime regions. In contrast, black-hole oscillations are regular when evaluated toward the event horizon and null infinity. Hyperboloidal surfaces naturally connect these regions, providing a geometric regularization of time-harmonic oscillations called quasinormal modes (QNMs). This review traces the historical development of the hyperboloidal approach to QNMs. We discuss the physical motivation for the hyperboloidal approach and highlight current developments in the field.</description>

      <title>Off-shell color-kinematics duality from codifferentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the color-kinematics duality within the BV formalism, highlighting its emergence as a feature of specific gauge-fixed actions. Our goal is to establish a general framework for studying the duality while investigating straightforward examples of off-shell color-kinematics duality. In this context, we revisit Chern-Simons theory as well as introduce new examples, including BF theory and 2D Yang-Mills theory, which are shown to exhibit the duality off-shell. We emphasize that the geometric structures responsible for flat-space color-kinematics duality appear for general curved spaces as well.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of Gaussian unitary transformations for bosonic and fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian unitary transformations are generated by quadratic Hamiltonians, i.e., Hamiltonians containing quadratic terms in creations and annihilation operators, and are heavily used in many areas of quantum physics, ranging from quantum optics and condensed matter theory to quantum information and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. They are known to form a representation of the metaplectic and spin group for bosons and fermions, respectively. These groups are the double covers of the symplectic and special orthogonal group, respectively, and our goal is to analyze the behavior of the sign ambiguity that one needs to deal with when moving between these groups and their double cover. We relate this sign ambiguity to expectation values of the form $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$, where $|0\rangle$ is a Gaussian state and $\hat{H}$ an arbitrary quadratic Hamiltonian. We provide closed formulas for $\langle 0|\exp{(-i\hat{H})}|0\rangle$ and show how we can efficiently describe group multiplications in the double cover without the need of going to a faithful representation on an exponentially large or even infinite-dimensional space. Our construction relies on an explicit parametrization of these two groups (metaplectic, spin) in terms of symplectic and orthogonal group elements together with a twisted U(1) group.</description>

      <title>New canonical analysis for consistent extension of $\lambda R$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The canonical analysis of the $\lambda R$ model extended with the term due to Blas, Pujolas, and Sibiryakov $[BPS]$ is performed. The analysis is developed for any value of $\lambda$, but particular attention is paid to the point $\lambda=\frac{1}{3}$ because of the closeness with linearized General Relativity [GR]. Then, we add the higher-order conformal term, the so-called Cotton-square term, to study the constraint structure of what constitutes an example of kinetic-conformal Horava's gravity. At the conformal point, an extra second-class constraint appears; this does not arise at other values of $\lambda$. Then, the Dirac brackets are constructed, and we will observe that the $\lambda R$-Cotton-square model shares the same number of degrees of freedom with linearized $GR$.</description>

      <title>Steady compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system with slip boundary conditions arising from kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11809v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the boundary value problem on the steady compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system in a channel domain $(0,1)\times\mathbb{T}^2$ with a class of generalized slip boundary conditions that were systematically derived from the Boltzmann equation by Coron \cite{Coron-JSP-1989} and later by Aoki et al \cite{Aoki-Baranger-Hattori-Kosuge-Martalo-Mathiaud-Mieussens-JSP-2017}. We establish the existence and uniqueness of strong solutions in $(L_{0}^{2}\cap H^{2}(\Omega))\times V^{3}(\Omega)\times H^{3}(\Omega)$ provided that the wall temperature is near a positive constant. The proof relies on the construction of a new variational formulation for the corresponding linearized problem and employs a fixed point argument. The main difficulty arises from the interplay of velocity and temperature derivatives together with the effect of density dependence on the boundary.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Origin of Spacetime Non-Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic interpretation of spacetime non-commutativity starting from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanical commutation relations. We discuss how the (non-)commutativity of spacetime is inherently related to the continuity or discontinuity of paths in the path integral formulation. Utilizing Wiener processes, we demonstrate that continuous paths lead to commutative spacetime, whereas discontinuous paths correspond to non-commutative spacetime structures. As an example we introduce discontinuous paths from which the $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutators can be obtained. Moreover we focus on modifications of the Leibniz rule for differentials acting on discontinuous trajectories. We show how these can be related to the deformed action of translation generators focusing, as a working example, on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Our findings suggest that spacetime non-commutativity can be understood as a result of fundamental discreteness of spacetime.</description>

Abstract: The light rays trajectories in Kerr metric, resulting from Fermat's principle, are considered from the point of view of integrable systems. It is shown how the counterpart of Carter constant emerges as a result of coupling-constant metamorphosis.

      <title>Drinfel'd Doubles, Twists and All That... in Stringy Geometry and M Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Drinfel'd double of Lie bialgebroids plays an important role in T-duality of string theories. In the presence of $H$ and $R$ fluxes, Lie bialgebroids should be extended to proto Lie bialgebroids. For both cases, the pair is given by two dual vector bundles, and the Drinfel'd double yields a Courant algebroid. However for U-duality, more complicated direct sum decompositions that are not described by dual vector bundles appear. In a previous work, we extended the notion of a Lie bialgebroid for vector bundles that are not necessarily dual. We achieved this by introducing a framework of calculus on algebroids and examining compatibility conditions for various algebroid properties in this framework. Here our aim is two-fold: extending our work on bialgebroids to include both $H$- and $R$-twists, and generalizing proto Lie bialgebroids to pairs of arbitrary vector bundles. To this end, we analyze various algebroid axioms and derive twisted compatibility conditions in the presence of twists. We introduce the notion of proto bialgebroids and their Drinfel'd doubles, where the former generalizes both bialgebroids and proto Lie bialgebroids. We also examine the most general form of vector bundle automorphisms of the double, related to twist matrices, that generate a new bracket from a given one. We analyze various examples from both physics and mathematics literatures in our framework.</description>

      <title>A comparison between classical and Bohmian quantum chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the emergence of chaos in a 2d system corresponding to a classical Hamiltonian system $V= \frac{1}{2}(\omega_x^2x^2+\omega_y^2y^2)+\epsilon xy^2$ consisting of two interacting harmonic oscillators and compare the classical and the Bohmian quantum trajectories for increasing values of $\epsilon$. In particular we present an initial quantum state composed of two coherent states in $x$ and $y$, which in the absence of interaction produces ordered trajectories (Lissajous figures) and an initial state which contains {both chaotic and ordered} trajectories for $\epsilon=0$. In both cases we find that, in general, Bohmian trajectories become chaotic in the long run, but chaos emerges at times which depend on the strength of the interaction between the oscillators.</description>

      <title>Proof of Zamolodchikov conjecture for semi-classical conformal blocks on the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1986, Zamolodchikov conjectured an exponential structure for the semi-classical limit of conformal blocks on a sphere. This paper provides a rigorous proof of the analog of Zamolodchikov conjecture for Liouville conformal blocks on a one-punctured torus, using their probabilistic construction and show the existence of a positive radius of convergence of the semi-classical limit. As a consequence, we obtain a closed form expression for the solution of the Lam\'e equation, and show a relation between its accessory parameter and the classical action of the non-autonomous elliptic Calogero-Moser model evaluated at specific values of the solution.</description>

      <title>Parity-deformed $su(2)$ and $so(3)$ Algebras: a Basis for Quantum Optics and Quantum Communications Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Having in mind the significance of parity (reflection) in various areas of physics, the single-mode and two-mode Wigner algebras are considered adding to them a reflection operator. The associated deformed $su(2)$ algebra, $su_{\nu}(2)$, and the deformed $so(3)$ algebra, $so_{\nu}(3)$, are constructed for the widely used Jordan-Schwinger and Holstein-Primakoff realizations, commenting on various aspects and ingredients of the formalism for both single-mode and two-mode cases. Finally, in this framework the parity-deformed $so_{\nu}(3)$ representation is analyzed, due to its potential application in the study of qubit and qutrit systems.</description>

      <title>Admissible transformations and Lie symmetries of linear systems of second-order ordinary differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.05139v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit the results on admissible transformations between normal linear systems of second-order ordinary differential equations with an arbitrary number of dependent variables under several appropriate gauges of the arbitrary elements parameterizing these systems. For each class from the constructed chain of nested gauged classes of such systems, we single out its singular subclass, which appears to consist of systems being similar to the elementary (free particle) system whereas the regular subclass is the complement of the singular one. This allows us to exhaustively describe the equivalence groupoids of the above classes as well as of their singular and regular subclasses. Applying various algebraic techniques, we establish principal properties of Lie symmetries of the systems under consideration and outline ways for completely classifying these symmetries. In particular, we compute the sharp lower and upper bounds for the dimensions of the maximal Lie invariance algebras possessed by systems from each of the above classes and subclasses. We also show how equivalence transformations and Lie symmetries can be used for reduction of order of such systems and their integration. As an illustrative example of using the theory developed, we solve the complete group classification problems for all these classes in the case of two dependent variables.</description>

      <title>Point and generalized symmetries of the heat equation revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.11073v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a nice representation for point symmetry transformations of the (1+1)-dimensional linear heat equation and properly interpret them. This allows us to prove that the pseudogroup of these transformations has exactly two connected components. That is, the heat equation admits a single independent discrete symmetry, which can be chosen to be alternating the sign of the dependent variable. We introduce the notion of pseudo-discrete elements of a Lie group and show that alternating the sign of the space variable, which was for a long time misinterpreted as a discrete symmetry of the heat equation, is in fact a pseudo-discrete element of its essential point symmetry group. The classification of subalgebras of the essential Lie invariance algebra of the heat equation is enhanced and the description of generalized symmetries of this equation is refined as well. We also consider the Burgers equation because of its relation to the heat equation and prove that it admits no discrete point symmetries. The developed approach to point-symmetry groups whose elements have components that are linear fractional in some variables can directly be extended to many other linear and nonlinear differential equations.</description>

Abstract: Our work proves rigidity theorems for initial data sets associated with compact smooth spin manifolds with boundary and with compact convex polytopes, subject to the dominant energy condition. For manifolds with smooth boundary, this is based on the solution of a boundary value problem for Dirac operators. For convex polytopes we use approximations by manifolds with smooth boundary.</description>

      <title>Optimal light cone for macroscopic particle transport in long-range systems: A quantum speed limit approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.01059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.01059v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the ultimate rate at which information propagates is a pivotal issue in nonequilibrium physics. Nevertheless, the task of elucidating the propagation speed inherent in quantum bosonic systems presents challenges due to the unbounded nature of their interactions. In this study, we tackle the problem of macroscopic particle transport in a long-range generalization of the lattice Bose-Hubbard model through the lens of the quantum speed limit. By developing a unified approach based on optimal transport theory, we rigorously prove that the minimum time required for macroscopic particle transport is always bounded by the distance between the source and target regions, while retaining its significance even in the thermodynamic limit. Furthermore, we derive an upper bound for the probability of observing a specific number of bosons inside the target region, thereby providing additional insights into the dynamics of particle transport. Our results hold true for arbitrary initial states under both long-range hopping and long-range interactions, thus resolving an open problem of particle transport in generic bosonic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that on the product of two Riemannian manifolds one of which is compact, any Killing tensor is reducible, that is, is the sum of products of Killing tensors on the factors. The same is true for the lifts to the universal cover of Killing tensors on a compact manifold with reducible holonomy. We give a local description of Killing tensors on product manifolds and present an example of a complete product manifold whose factors are locally irreducible which admits an irreducible Killing tensor field.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted classical capacities of some channels acting as radial multipliers on fermion algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15440v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a new class of unital quantum channels on $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$, acting as radial multipliers when we identify the matrix algebra $\mathrm{M}_{2^k}$ with a finite-dimensional fermion algebra. Our primary contribution lies in the precise computation of the (optimal) rate at which classical information can be transmitted through these channels from a sender to a receiver when they share an unlimited amount of entanglement. Our approach relies on new connections between fermion algebras with the $n$-dimensional discrete hypercube $\{-1,1\}^n$. Significantly, our calculations yield exact values applicable to the operators of the fermionic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck semigroup. This advancement not only provides deeper insights into the structure and behaviour of these channels but also enhances our understanding of Quantum Information Theory in a dimension-independent context.</description>

      <title>Superdiffusive central limit theorem for a Brownian particle in a critically-correlated incompressible random drift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the long-time behavior of a diffusion process on $\mathbb{R}^d$ advected by a stationary random vector field which is assumed to be divergence-free, dihedrally symmetric in law and have a log-correlated potential. A special case includes $\nabla^\perp$ of the Gaussian free field in two dimensions. We show the variance of the diffusion process at a large time $t$ behaves like $2 c_* t (\log t)^{1/2}$, in a quenched sense and with a precisely determined, universal prefactor constant $c_*&gt;0$. We also prove a quenched invariance principle under this superdiffusive scaling. The proof is based on a rigorous renormalization group argument in which we inductively analyze coarse-grained diffusivities, scale-by-scale. Our analysis leads to sharp homogenization and large-scale regularity estimates on the infinitesimal generator, which are subsequently transferred into quantitative information on the process.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group and elliptic homogenization in high contrast</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a quantitative estimate on the homogenization length scale in terms of the ellipticity ratio~$\Lambda/\lambda$ of the coefficient field. This upper bound applies to high-contrast elliptic equations demonstrating near-critical behavior. Specifically, we show that, given a suitable decay of correlation, the length scale at which homogenization is observed is at most $\exp(C \log^3(1+\Lambda/\lambda))$. The proof introduces the new concept of coarse-grained ellipticity, which measures the effective ellipticity ratio of the equation -- and thus the strength of the disorder -- after integrating out smaller scales. By a direct analytic argument, we obtain an approximate differential inequality for this coarse-grained ellipticity as a function of the length scale. This approach can be interpreted as a rigorous renormalization group argument and provides a quantitative framework for homogenization that can be iteratively applied across an arbitrary number of length scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02372v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate scalar field theories in a curved braided $L_\infty$-algebra formalism and analyse their correlation functions using Batalin-Vilkovisky quantization. We perform detailed calculations in cubic braided scalar field theory up to two-loop order and three-point multiplicity. The divergent tadpole contributions are eliminated by a suitable choice of central curvature for the $L_\infty$-structure, and we confirm the absence of UV/IR mixing. The calculations of higher loop and higher multiplicity correlators in homological perturbation theory are facilitated by the introduction of a novel diagrammatic calculus. We derive an algebraic version of the Schwinger-Dyson equations based on the homological perturbation lemma, and use them to prove the braided Wick theorem.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mixed-dimensional beam-shell-solid couplings in linear Cosserat continua via tangential differential calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12515v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to the coupling of mixed-dimensional continua by employing the mathematically enriched linear Cosserat micropolar model. The kinematical reduction of the model to lower dimensional domains leaves its fundamental degrees of freedom intact. Consequently, the degrees of freedom intrinsically agree even at the interface with a domain of a different dimensionality. Thus, this approach circumvents the need for intermediate finite elements or mortar methods. We introduce the derivations of all models of various dimensions using tangential differential calculus. The coupling itself is then achieved by defining a mixed-dimensional action functional with consistent Sobolev trace operators. Finally, we present numerical examples involving a three-dimensional silicone-rubber block reinforced with a curved graphite shell on its lower surface, a three-dimensional silver block reinforced with a graphite plate and beams, and lastly, intersecting silver shells reinforced with graphite beams.</description>

      <title>Infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models from non-invertible symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21353v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the study of non-invertible symmetries, we propose there exist infinitely many new renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models $\mathcal{M}(kq + I, q) \to\mathcal{M}(kq-I, q)$ induced by $\phi_{(1,2k+1)}$. They vastly generalize the previously proposed ones $k=I=1$ by Zamolodchikov, $k=1, I&gt;1$ by Ahn and L\"assig, and $k=2$ by Dorey et al. All the other $\mathbb{Z}_2$ preserving renormalization group flows sporadically known in the literature (e.g. $\mathcal{M}(10,3) \to \mathcal{M}(8,3)$ studied by Klebanov et al) fall into our proposal (e.g. $k=3, I=1$). We claim our new flows give a complete understanding of the renormalization group flows between Virasoro minimal models that preserve a modular tensor category with the $SU(2)_{q-2}$ fusion ring.</description>

      <title>Character Complexity: A Novel Measure for Quantum Circuit Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces Character Complexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article shows that the approach to generalised curvature and torsion pioneered by Polacek and Siegel [1] is a generalisation of Cartan Geometry -- rendering latter natural from the point of view of O(d,d)-generalised geometry. We present this approach in the generalised metric formalism and show that almost all parts of the additional higher generalised tensors appearing in this approach correspond to covariant derivatives of the generalised Riemann tensor. As an application, we use this framework to phrase sigma model dynamics in an explicitly covariant way -- both under generalised diffeomorphisms and local gauge transformations.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Field Deformations of (Semi-)Symmetric Space Sigma Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the auxiliary field deformations of the principal chiral model (PCM) introduced in arXiv:2405.05899 and arXiv:2407.16338 to sigma models whose target manifolds are symmetric or semi-symmetric spaces, including a Wess-Zumino term in the latter case. This gives rise to a new infinite family of classically integrable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ coset models of the form which are of interest in applications of integrability to worldsheet string theory and holography. We demonstrate that every theory in this infinite class admits a zero-curvature representation for its equations of motion by exhibiting a Lax connection.</description>
