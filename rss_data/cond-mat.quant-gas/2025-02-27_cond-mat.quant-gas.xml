      <title>Formation of Complex Discrete Time Crystals with Ultracold Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete time crystal formation in a system driven periodically by an oscillating atomic mirror, consisting of two distinct ultracold atomic clouds in the presence of a gravitational field. The intra-species interactions are weak and attractive, while the inter-species interactions are infinitely strong and repulsive. The clouds are arranged in a one-dimensional stack, where the bottom cloud bounces on an oscillating atomic mirror, which effectively acts as a driving force for the upper cloud due to the infinite inter-species repulsion. Using a Jastrow-like variational ansatz for the many-body wavefunction, we show that sufficiently strong attractive intra-species interactions drive each subsystem to spontaneously break discrete time translation symmetry, resulting in the formation of a complex discrete time crystal evolving with a period different than the driving period. Since the bottom cloud serves as the effective periodic driving for the upper cloud, this leads to a cascade of spontaneous symmetry breaking. With increasing intra-species interactions, we first observe a pronounced effect of spontaneous time translation symmetry breaking in the upper cloud, followed by a similar effect in the lower atomic cloud.</description>

      <title>Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Renormalization Group Flow at a Quantum Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a controlled numerical study of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition in the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model at unit filling, providing evidence of the characteristic logarithmic finite-size scaling of the BKT transition. Employing density matrix renormalization group and quantum Monte Carlo simulations under periodic boundary conditions, together with a systematic finite-size scaling analysis of bipartite particle number fluctuations, we resolve boundary-induced complications that previously obscured critical scaling. We demonstrate that a suitably chosen central region under open boundaries reproduces universal RG signatures, reconciling earlier discrepancies. Finally, leveraging a non-parametric Bayesian analysis, we determine the critical interaction strength with high precision, establishing a benchmark for BKT physics in one-dimensional quantum models.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gross-Pitaevskii theory for a spin-1 Bose gas: Application to superfluidity in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops and implements the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation for spin-1 Bose gases, addressing key considerations for numerical simulations. As an application of the theory we explore equilibrium phases in a two-dimensional spin-1 gas, where quasi-long-range order emerges via a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. Our analysis includes definition of superfluid densities for both mass and spin degrees of freedom, in a manner suitable for implementation within a stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation simulation. We present a finite-temperature phase diagram for the ferromagnetic spin-1 Bose gas and identify three distinct superfluid phases: two exhibiting conventional Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like behavior and a novel phase that simultaneously supports independent mass and spin superflows. As temperature increases, the stability region of this novel phase shrinks. This work provides a foundation for further studies of nonequilibrium and finite-temperature phenomena in spinor Bose gases.</description>

      <title>Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.</description>

      <title>Chiral vortical conductivities and the moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the chiral vortical conductivities, as well as the orbital and spin moment of inertia of a charged, chiral, and rigidly rotating free Fermi gas. To this purpose, we begin by calculating the vacuum expectation values of a vector and axial vector current using the free fermion propagator in this medium. This propagator is derived by employing the Fock-Schwinger method based on the solutions of the Dirac equation in the presence of rotation and finite axial chemical potential. We present a complete derivation of these solutions. We demonstrate that in the first approximation, the chiral vortical conductivity associated with the vector current is proportional to the product of the vector and axial chemical potentials. In contrast, the chiral vortical conductivity related to the axial vector current depends on the temperature, the vector, and the axial vector chemical potential squares. We use the relation between the axial vector current and the angular momentum density associated with spin to determine the spin and the orbital moment of inertia of a rigidly rotating Fermi gas in a charged and chirally imbalanced medium separately. In addition, we compute the total moment of inertia by utilizing the methods presented in the first part of the paper and show that the orbital moment of inertia of a free fermion gas vanishes.</description>

      <title>Measurement resolution enhanced coherence for lattice fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Weak measurement enables the extraction of targeted information from a quantum system while minimizing decoherence due to measurement backaction. However, in many-body quantum systems backaction can have unexpected effects on wavefunction collapse. We theoretically study a minimal many-particle model consisting of weakly measured non-interacting fermions in a one dimensional lattice. Repeated measurement of on-site occupation number with single-site resolution stochastically drives the system toward a Fock state, regardless of the initial state. This need not be the case for measurements that do not, even in principle, have single-site spatial resolution. We numerically show for systems with up to 16 sites that decreasing the spatial resolution strongly affects both the rate of stochastic evolution for each quantum trajectory and the allowed final states. The full Hilbert space can be partitioned into backaction-free subspaces (BFSs) the elements of which are indistinguishable to these measurements. Repeated measurements will drive any initial state into a single BFS, leading to a steady state that is a fixed point of the measurement process. We exactly calculate the properties of these BFSs for systems up to 32 sites and find that even for moderate reductions in measurement resolution they yield non-trivial steady state entanglement and coherence.</description>

      <title>Electrodynamics of Vortices in Quasi-2D Scalar Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14302v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In two spatial dimensions, vortex-vortex interactions approximately vary with the logarithm of the inter-vortex distance, making it possible to describe an ensemble of vortices as a Coulomb gas. We introduce a duality between vortices in a quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) scalar Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) and effective Maxwell's electrodynamics. Specifically, we address the general scenario of inhomogeneous, time-dependent BEC number density with dissipation or rotation. Starting from the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which describes the mean-field dynamics of a quasi-2D scalar BEC without dissipation, we show how to map vortices in a quasi-2D scalar BEC to 2D electrodynamics beyond the point-vortex approximation, even when dissipation is present or in a rotating system. The physical meaning of this duality is discussed.</description>

      <title>Kinetics of Quantum Reaction-Diffusion systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss many-body fermionic and bosonic systems subject to dissipative particle losses in arbitrary spatial dimensions $d$, within the Keldysh path-integral formulation of the quantum master equation. This open quantum dynamics represents a generalisation of classical reaction-diffusion dynamics to the quantum realm. We first show how initial conditions can be introduced in the Keldysh path integral via boundary terms. We then study binary annihilation reactions $A+A\to\emptyset$, for which we derive a Boltzmann-like kinetic equation. The ensuing algebraic decay in time for the particle density depends on the particle statistics. In order to model possible experimental implementations with cold atoms, for fermions in $d=1$ we further discuss inhomogeneous cases involving the presence of a trapping potential. In this context, we quantify the irreversibility of the dynamics studying the time evolution of the system entropy for different quenches of the trapping potential. We find that the system entropy features algebraic decay for confining quenches, while it saturates in deconfined scenarios.</description>

      <title>Perturbative Framework for Engineering Arbitrary Floquet Hamiltonian</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10467v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a systematic perturbative framework to engineer an arbitrary target Hamiltonian in the Floquet phase space of a periodically driven oscillator based on Floquet-Magnus expansion. The high-order errors in the engineered Floquet Hamiltonian are mitigated by adding high-order driving potentials perturbatively. We introduce a transformation method that allows us to obtain an analytical expression of the leading-order correction drive for engineering a target Hamiltonian with discrete rotational and chiral symmetries in phase space. We also provide a numerically efficient procedure to calculate high-order correction drives and apply it to engineer the target Hamiltonian with degenerate eigenstates of multi-component cat states that are important for fault-tolerant hardware-efficiency bosonic quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05267v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.</description>
