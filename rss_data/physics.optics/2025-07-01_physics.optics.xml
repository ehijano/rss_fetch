      <title>Fully stabilized Er fiber comb at 1 GHz by harmonic modelocking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modelocked frequency comb lasers have always operated with a single pulse circulating in the laser cavity. This meant that each laser technology had an associated limit on pulse repetition rate. Achieving higher rates required different technology, for example exchanging optical fiber for solid state gain media. However, this is a perceived, rather than a fundamental limit. We demonstrate a new fiber laser design with multiple pulses circulating in the fiber gain cavity with the same high precision as a conventional fiber frequency comb. This has the immediate benefit of bringing mature fiber technology to higher repetition rate frequency combs. More generally, it adds great design freedom to laser engineering, where the laser can be separated into an optical cavity and a gain medium that are combined using standard frequency comb techniques. Fundamental frequency comb performance improvements may even be possible from the filtering intrinsic to our design, or by incorporating high stability cavities directly into the laser itself.</description>

      <title>Equilibrium positions of optically-trapped single-crystal uniaxial calcite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precision in optical micromanipulation is critical for non-invasive, non-contact control of objects with light and for using light to measure forces and torques. We demonstrate the control of birefringent objects over three translational directions and three rotational degrees of freedom. Our work trapping and rotating calcite, a unique crystal with no axis of symmetry, extends the positioning abilities of optical tweezers. We trap and levitate a single crystal in linearly polarized light and position it in three rotational directions relative to the polarization. Our model of the torque on the crystals is based on determining the induced polarization and its interaction with the incident electric field. Crystals are shown to rest in equilibrium with their optic axis along the beam axis and one extraordinary axis along the direction of polarization. The calculated equilibrium positions align with our observations of stable trapped calcite.</description>

      <title>Photonics in Flatland: Challenges and Opportunities for Nanophotonics with 2D Semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are emerging as a versatile platform for nanophotonics, offering unprecedented tunability in optical properties through exciton resonance engineering, van der Waals heterostructuring, and external field control. These materials enable active optical modulation, single-photon emission, quantum photonics, and valleytronic functionalities, paving the way for next-generation optoelectronic and quantum photonic devices. However, key challenges remain in achieving large-area integration, maintaining excitonic coherence, and optimizing amplitude-phase modulation for efficient light manipulation. Advances in fabrication, strain engineering, and computational modelling will be crucial to overcoming these limitations. This perspective highlights recent progress in 2D semiconductor-based nanophotonics, emphasizing opportunities for scalable integration into photonics.</description>

      <title>Design of meta-surface lens integrated with pupil filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metasurface lenses are miniature flat lenses that can precisely control the phase, amplitude, and polarization of incident light by modulating the parameters of each unit on the substrate. Compared with conventional optical lenses, they have the advantages of small size, light weight, and high integration, and are the core components of photonic chips. Currently, the hot topics for metasurface lens are broadband and achromatic devices, and there is still less attention paid to the resolution improvement. To break through the diffraction limit and further improve the focusing performance and imaging resolution of metasurface lenses, we use unit cells to perform multi-dimensional modulation of the incident light field. Specifically, in this paper, we combine phase modulation of metasurface lens with a pupil filtering, which has been widely applied to traditional microscopy imaging and adaptive optics and has demonstrated powerful resolution enhancement effects. The integrating of these two technologies will continue to improve the imaging performance of metasurface lenses and thus expanding their application fields. This result preliminarily demonstrates the super-resolution performance of the integrated meta-surface lens. With the comprehensive regulation of multi-dimensional information, such as amplitude, polarization, and vortex, the integrated meta-surface optical lens will achieve more excellent super-resolution focusing and imaging performance, and will also be widely used in the fields of super-resolution imaging, virtual reality, and three-dimensional optical display, due to its characteristics of high resolution, high integration, and high miniaturization.</description>

      <title>20-GHz bandwidth optical activation function based on a semiconductor laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical neural networks usually execute the linear multiply-accumulate operation in the optical domain, whereas the nonlinear activation function is mostly implemented in the digital or electrical domain. Here we demonstrate a broadband activation function operated in the optical domain. The optical activation function (OAF) is achieved by a semiconductor laser with optical injection, which is operated in the unstable-locked regime above the Hopf bifurcation. The operation bandwidth of the OAF reaches as high as 20 GHz, which is limited by the relaxation oscillation resonance frequency of the semiconductor laser. The OAF mimics a ReLU function for modulation frequencies below 5 GHz, while resembling an ELU function for frequencies above 5 GHz.</description>

      <title>Physics-Aware Style Transfer for Adaptive Holographic Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inline holographic imaging presents an ill-posed inverse problem of reconstructing objects' complex amplitude from recorded diffraction patterns. Although recent deep learning approaches have shown promise over classical phase retrieval algorithms, they often require high-quality ground truth datasets of complex amplitude maps to achieve a statistical inverse mapping operation between the two domains. Here, we present a physics-aware style transfer approach that interprets the object-to-sensor distance as an implicit style within diffraction patterns. Using the style domain as the intermediate domain to construct cyclic image translation, we show that the inverse mapping operation can be learned in an adaptive manner only with datasets composed of intensity measurements. We further demonstrate its biomedical applicability by reconstructing the morphology of dynamically flowing red blood cells, highlighting its potential for real-time, label-free imaging. As a framework that leverages physical cues inherently embedded in measurements, the presented method offers a practical learning strategy for imaging applications where ground truth is difficult or impossible to obtain.</description>

      <title>Shaping Ultrafast Pulses for Enhanced Resonant Nonlinear Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherent control with shaped ultrafast pulses is a powerful approach for steering nonlinear light-matter interactions. Previous studies in quantum control have shown that, beyond transform-limited pulses, those with antisymmetric spectral phases can drive nonresonant multiphoton transitions with comparable efficiency. However, in resonant multiphoton transitions, the material's spectral-phase response introduces dispersion that degrades nonlinear efficiency. Pre-shaping the pulse to compensate for the material's impulse response can restore and enhance nonlinear interactions beyond the transform-limited case. Yet, is this the only spectral phase that can yield such enhancement? Here, we study sub-10 fs single-pulse four-wave mixing in resonant plasmonic nanostructures using arctangent spectral-phase-shaped pulses. We uncover two distinct enhancement regimes: one compensating for material dispersion, and a counterintuitive regime where the arctangent phase induces an antisymmetric polarization response, driving constructive multiphoton pathway interference. Our theoretical analysis provides clear physical explanation for both phenomena. Notably, it predicts that both enhancement mechanisms scale exponentially with harmonic order, offering a powerful strategy for dramatically enhancing high-order harmonic generation in resonant systems.</description>

      <title>Optimising Photothermal Silver Nanoparticles for Efficient Light-Activated Shape Memory Response in AgNP-Polymer Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study presents the synthesis and integration of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) into a polyurethane (PU) matrix to create a light-activated shape memory polymer (SMP). AgNPs were synthesized using a microwave-assisted solvothermal method with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as a stabilizer, where varying the molecular weight of PVP and the AgNO3/PVP ratio influenced nanoparticle size and distribution. Characterisation via scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS) confirmed the irregular morphology and size consistency of AgNPs, with smaller particles exhibiting narrow size distributions and enhanced photothermal response. Among the samples, PVP with an average molecular weight (Mn) of 10,000 and an AgNO3/PVP mole ratio of 14.7 demonstrated optimal UV-blue light absorption, which facilitated efficient local heating under irradiation. The AgNP-PU composite exhibited a reliable shape memory effect when exposed to UV-blue light.</description>

      <title>Windowing in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy: resolving resonances in thin-film samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing is widely employed to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Techniques like speckle holography and shearography are rarely applied due to the complexity of instrument setup and lack of automated result analysis, despite their potential. By simulating speckle interferometric outcomes, we seek to address these challenges, enabling more efficient measurement processes and paving the way for automated defect recognition. This research focuses on developing a simulation code for speckle interferometric results derived from finite element analyses. The aim is to improve the parameter settings of speckle interferometry measurements and create specific datasets, which will be used to develop machine learning-based methods for automation in series production.</description>

      <title>Photo-Thermal Actuation of Hybrid Microgels with Dual Laser Optical Tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft actuators that respond to external stimuli play a fundamental role in microscale robotics, active matter, and bio-inspired systems. Among these actuators, photo-thermal hybrid microgels (HMGs) containing plasmonic nanoparticles enable rapid, spatially controlled actuation via localized heating. Understanding their dynamic behavior at the single-particle level is crucial for optimizing performance. However, traditional bulk characterization methods such as dynamic light scattering (DLS), provide only ensemble-averaged data, thereby limiting analytical insights. Here, we introduce a dual-laser optical tweezers approach for real-time, single-particle analysis of HMGs under controlled light exposure. Combining direct imaging and mean-square displacement (MSD) analysis, our method quantifies the precise laser power required for actuation and accurately tracks the particle size. We benchmark our results against an existing dual-laser DLS, demonstrating comparable precision while offering the unique advantage of single-actuator resolution. Thus, our method provides as a robust platform for precise optimization of programmable actuators with applications in soft robotics, microswimmers, and biomedical applications.</description>

      <title>Vortex solitons in quasi-phase-matched photonic crystals with the third harmonic generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report stable composite vortex solitons in the model of a three-dimensional photonic crystal with the third-harmonic (TH) generation provided by the quasi-phase-matched quadratic nonlinearity. The photonic crystal is designed with a checkerboard structure in the $\left( x\text{,}% y\right) $ plane, while the second-order nonlinear susceptibility, $d(z)$, is modulated along the propagation direction as a chains of rectangles with two different periods. This structure can be fabricated by means of available technologies. The composite vortex solitons are built of fundamental-frequency (FF), second-harmonic (SH), and TH components, exhibiting spatial patterns which correspond to vortex with topological charges $s=1$, a quadrupole with $s=2$, and an anti-vortex structure with $s = -1$, respectively. The soliton profiles feature rhombic or square patterns, corresponding to phase-matching conditions $\varphi =0$ or $\pi $, respectively, the rhombic solitons possessing a broader stability region. From the perspective of the experimental feasibility, we show that both the rhombic and square-shaped composite vortex solitons may readily propagate in the photonic crystals over distances up to $\sim 1$ m. The TH component of the soliton with $s=\mp 1$ is produced by the cascaded nonlinear interactions, starting from the FF vortex component with $s=\pm 1$ and proceeding through the quadrupole SH one with $s=2$. These findings offer a novel approach for the creation and control of stable vortex solitons in nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Orbital-resolved imaging of coherent femtosecond exciton dynamics in coupled molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical excitation and control of excitonic wavepackets in organic molecules is the basis to energy conversion processes. To gain insights into such processes, it is essential to establish the relationship between the coherence timescales of excitons with the electronic inhomogeneity in the molecules, as well as the influence of intermolecular interactions on exciton dynamics. Here, we demonstrate orbital-resolved imaging of optically induced coherent exciton dynamics in single copper napthalocyanine (CuNc) molecules, and selective coherent excitation of dark and bright triplet excitons in coupled molecular dimers. Ultrafast photon-induced tunneling current enabled atomic-scale imaging and control of the excitons in resonantly excited molecules by employing excitonic wavepacket interferometry. Our results reveal an ultrafast exciton coherence time of ~ 70 fs in a single molecule, which decreases for the triplet excitons in interacting molecules.</description>

      <title>Light-induced Pairing Instability of Ultrafast Electron Beams with Space Charge Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast electron beams are essential for many applications, yet space-charge interactions in high-intensity beams lead to energy dissipation, coherence loss, and pulse broadening. Existing techniques mitigate these effects by using low-flux beams, preserving beam coherence into the quantum regime. Here, we propose a novel approach by treating the electrons as a strongly correlated Fermi gas rather than merely as an ensemble of charged point-like particles. We introduce a photon-induced pairing mechanism that generates a net attractive force between two electrons, thereby forming "flying bound states" analogous to Cooper pairs of conduction electrons in superconductors. Employing the setting of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), we demonstrate that the effective interaction via single-photon exchange among PINEM electrons can suppress the inherent repulsive Coulomb interaction, enabling a pairing instability mediated by structured electromagnetic fields at near-resonant velocity matching regimes. Finally, we analyze the dynamics of the free-electron pairs in a bunched beam, underscoring the potential to facilitate a phase-coherent condensate of electrons, which can further enhance beam coherence and multi-particle correlation for high-intensity electrons.</description>

      <title>Holographic hyperbranched polymer nanocomposite grating with exceptionally large neutron scattering length density modulation amplitudes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanoparticle-polymer composite gratings incorporating ultrahigh-refractive-index hyperbranched polymers as organic nanoparticles have demonstrated exceptional light optical properties, yet their potential for neutron diffraction applications remains unexplored. We report on the neutron optical properties of a holographically structured hyperbranched-polymer-dispersed nanocomposite grating at a quasi-monochromatic neutron wavelength of 2 nm. We show that neutron diffraction measurements performed at the SANS-I instrument of the Paul Scherrer Institute (Switzerland) reveal exceptionally high neutron scattering length density modulation amplitudes. These scattering length density modulation amplitudes are the highest reported to date. Very high neutron diffraction efficiency is expected with the use of thicker uniform gratings and longer neutron wavelengths, with low angular and wavelength selectivity constraints.</description>

      <title>Test mass charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space based on UV micro-LED</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an alternative to the ultraviolet light emitting diode(UV LED), the feasibility of utilizing UV micro-LED in the charge management in the detection of gravitational waves in space is experimentally studied. Compared with UV LED, micro-LED is more compact in size, has better current spreading, faster response time and longer operating life. Performance characteristics of micro-LEDs were measured, with peak wavelength of 254 nm, 262 nm, 274 nm, and 282 nm for each respective micro-LED, and the photoelectric effect was demonstrated. The effectiveness of micro-LED based charge management experiments were demonstrated using above micro-LEDs mounted on a cubical test mass, and different discharge rates were achieved by varying the drive current and duty cycle using pulse width modulation(PWM). Laboratory data was also shown to demonstrate the space qualification of the micro-LED device, the key electrical and optical characteristics of the micro-LEDs showed less than 5% variation. The results of the qualification bring the micro-LED device Technology Readiness Level(TRL) to TRL-5. TRL-6 will be reached provided additional radiation and thermal tests are conducted and in a position ready to be flown and further tested in space.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method for security analysis against the Trojan-horse attacks (THA) launched to a practical fiber-based quantum key distribution (QKD) system across a wide spectral range. To achieve this, we utilize optical time-domain reflectometry (OTDR) for the spectral reflectance analysis in the near-infrared range 1100 - 1800 nm with centimeter-level resolution and with a noise floor down to -80 dB. Finally, the total theoretical-security analysis against the THA side channel considering the spectral reflectance and transmittance data over this spectral range is conducted. To the best of our knowledge, our OTDR setup and the corresponding results are the first of their kind in a wide spectral range.</description>

      <title>Confocal Raman microscopy inside sessile multicomponent droplets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evaporating multicomponent droplets are ubiquitous and appear in a variety of everyday situations and technological applications, including coating, 3D printing, and energy conversion processes. During evaporation, concentration gradients are typically induced, resulting in flows within the droplets. Many of the mechanisms underlying multicomponent droplet evaporation are not fully understood. However, most methods utilize markers that can be surface active and thus affect droplet dynamics. Thus, high-resolution marker-free measurements of concentration gradients in evaporating multicomponent droplets are needed. Raman microscopy can provide such a method. However, as the Raman laser has to undergo a phase transition, it is refracted, leading to a distorted drop contour. In this study, we model refraction in the droplet to better understand the shift in focus leading to geometric distortion. The horizontal and vertical shifts in focus are analyzed, and a modified configuration that enables Raman measurements with a horizontal laser is introduced. For both configurations, the simulated drop shape in the Raman image fits well with the measured shape. While Raman measurements with a vertically incident laser allow the study of the upper part of the droplet, for droplets with large contact angles, horizontal Raman measurements allow for the analysis of the region around the 3-phase contact line. As an example, a concentration map of an evaporating 4.2 $\mu$L glycerol/water droplet is presented. The results of this study can be used as a guide for Raman microscopy measurements of droplets. These findings contribute to understanding droplet dynamics during evaporation and provide a basis for developing novel printing, cleaning, and energy conversion technology applications.</description>

      <title>Earth's field diamond vector magnetometry with isotropic magnetic flux concentrators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector magnetometers based on the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) of nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond are being developed for applications such as navigation and geomagnetism. However, at low magnetic fields, such as that on Earth (~50 {\mu}T), diamond magnetometers suffer from spectral congestion whereby ODMR peaks are not easily resolved. Here, we experimentally investigate a potential solution of using an isotropic, three-dimensional magnetic flux concentrator to amplify Earth's field without altering its direction. The concentrator consists of six ferrite cones, in a face-centered cubic arrangement, centered about a diamond. We vary the direction of a 50 {\mu}T applied field and record and fit the resulting ODMR spectra. By comparing the fitted fields to those of a reference fluxgate magnetometer, we characterize the angular response of the diamond magnetometer and quantify absolute errors in the field magnitude and angle. We find that the enhancement factor is nearly isotropic, with a mean of 19.05 and a standard deviation of 0.16, when weighted by solid angle coverage. Gradient broadening of the ODMR lines is sufficiently small that the spectra are well resolved for nearly all field directions, alleviating spectral congestion. For ~98% of the total 4{\pi} solid angle, Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds for magnetic field estimation uncertainty are within a factor of 2 of those of the fully-resolved case, indicating minimal deadzones. We track the stability of the magnetometer over six hours and observe variations less than or approximately 40 nT/hour, limited by temperature drift. Our study presents a new route for diamond vector magnetometry at Earth's field, with potential applications in geomagnetic surveys, anomaly detection, and navigation.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond photocurrents by the Dresselhaus bulk spin-galvanic effect in an inversion-asymmetric ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study ultrafast photocurrents in thin films of a model ferromagnetic metal with broken bulk inversion symmetry, the half-metallic Heusler compound NiMnSb, following excitation with an optical pump pulse with photon energy 1.55 eV. Remarkably, in terms of the direction of the sample magnetization M, all photocurrents are found to be a superposition of a component with Rashba- and Dresselhaus-type symmetry. We explain the Dresselhaus bulk photocurrent as follows: Pump-induced electron heating induces an excess of spin {\mu}_s||M, which transfers spin angular momentum into states with Dresselhaus-type spin-momentum locking. The resulting charge current relaxes on a time scale of 10 fs by momentum relaxation and, thus, follows {\mu}_s quasi-instantaneously. The relaxation of {\mu}_s is governed by the cooling of the electrons and not by the significantly slower spin-lattice relaxation of half-metals. Our findings add the Dresselhaus spin-galvanic effect (SGE) to the set of ultrafast spin-charge-conversion phenomena. They indicate a route to more efficient spintronic terahertz emitters and detectors based on the volume scaling of the bulk SGE.</description>

Abstract: We present a scheme to phase-lock a 240 mW, 852 nm distributed Bragg reflector (DBR) laser to a fixed-frequency narrow-linewidth laser with a rapidly tunable frequency offset near 9 GHz. The phase-lock is accomplished by electronic feedback on the beatnote between the two lasers. The frequency offset can be swept 200 MHz in 300 us, limited by the feedback loop bandwidth, allowing for its use in complex cooling and state preparation schemes needed in atomic physics experiments. Additionally, we find that the phase-lock reduces the linewidth of the DBR laser below its natural linewidth of ~400 kHz to ~100 kHz.</description>

      <title>Influence of oxygen-defects on intraband terahertz conductivity of carbon nanotubes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The exceptional charge transport properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) enable numerous ultrafast optoelectronic applications. Modifying SWCNTs by introducing defects significantly impacts the performance of nanotube-based devices, making defect characterization crucial. This research tracked these effects in oxygen plasma-treated SWCNT thin films. Sub-picosecond electric fields of varying strengths and additional photoexcitation were used to assess how defects influence charge carrier transport. Changes in effective conductivity within the terahertz (THz) range were found to be strongly dependent on impurity levels. The plasmon resonance shift to higher THz frequencies aligns with the defect-induced reduction in conductivity and slowed carrier migration within the network. An increase in THz field strength resulted in diminished conductivity due to intraband absorption bleaching. To address the emergence of hot charge carriers, a modified Drude model, which considers non-equilibrium charge carrier distribution via fielddependent scattering rates, was applied. The dominant charge-impurity scattering rate in plasma-treated samples corresponded with an increase in defects. Additionally, the impact of defects on charge carrier dynamics on a picosecond timescale was examined. The modeled plasma-treated SWCNTs wire-grid polarizer for the THz range reveals the potential for multi-level engineering of THz devices to customize properties through controlled defect populations.</description>

      <title>Inverse Design in Nanophotonics via Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inverse design in nanophotonics, the computational discovery of structures achieving targeted electromagnetic (EM) responses, has become a key tool for recent optical advances. Traditional intuition-driven or iterative optimization methods struggle with the inherently high-dimensional, non-convex design spaces and the substantial computational demands of EM simulations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged to address these bottlenecks effectively. This review frames ML-enhanced inverse design methodologies through the lens of representation learning, classifying them into two categories: output-side and input-side approaches. Output-side methods use ML to learn a representation in the solution space to create a differentiable solver that accelerates optimization. Conversely, input-side techniques employ ML to learn compact, latent-space representations of feasible device geometries, enabling efficient global exploration through generative models. Each strategy presents unique trade-offs in data requirements, generalization capacity, and novel design discovery potentials. Hybrid frameworks that combine physics-based optimization with data-driven representations help escape poor local optima, improve scalability, and facilitate knowledge transfer. We conclude by highlighting open challenges and opportunities, emphasizing complexity management, geometry-independent representations, integration of fabrication constraints, and advancements in multiphysics co-designs.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically propose a new method in cavity- and surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) with improved temporal resolution in the measurement of stochastic Raman spectral fluctuations. Our approach combines Fourier spectroscopy and photon correlation to decouple the integration time from the temporal resolution. Using statistical optics simulations, we establish the relationship between time resolution and Raman signal strength, revealing that typical Raman spectral fluctuations, commensurate with molecular conformational dynamics, can theoretically be resolved on micro- to millisecond timescales. The method can further extract average single-molecule dynamics from small sub-ensembles, thereby potentially mitigating challenges in achieving strictly single-molecule isolation on SERS substrates.</description>

      <title>A refinement of the Lorentz local field expression with impact on the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 19th century Mossotti and Clausius developed an expression linking the electrical permittivity of a dielectric to the product of molecular polarizability and number density. Lorenz and Lorentz later extended this framework to encompass the refractive index of the dielectric. These classical expressions have proven remarkably successful in describing how permittivity and refractive index vary with number density, under the assumption that molecular polarizability remains relatively constant. While these models have stood the test of time and continue to offer valuable insights, their derivation relies on an approximation of the local electric field within a spherical cavity that represents the environment of a single molecule with its own field excluded. For regimes of higher number densities, such as those encountered in densified dielectrics, employing an exact solution for the local field becomes increasingly important. This refinement not only extends the applicability of the Clausius-Mossotti and Lorentz-Lorenz equations but also leads to more accurate estimates of molecular polarizability in general.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1401.5402v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the integration of quantum emitters into a negative permeability metamaterial design in order to introduce tunability as well as nonlinear behavior. The unit cell of our metamaterial is a ring of metamolecules, each consisting of a metal nanoparticle and a two-level semiconductor quantum dot (QD). Without the QDs, the ring of the unit cell is known to act as an artificial optical magnetic resonator. By adding the QDs we show that a Fano interference profile is introduced into the magnetic field scattered from the ring. This induced interference is shown to cause an appreciable effect in the collective magnetic resonance of the unit cell. We find that the interference provides a means to tune the response of the negative permeability metamaterial. The exploitation of the QD's inherent nonlinearity is proposed to modulate the metamaterial's magnetic response with a separate control field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction between the electric dipole moments of a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle gives rise to unique optical properties, such as interference-induced photon correlations, that could be useful for enhanced intensity-based sensing. Using the quantum theory of photodetection, we propose a nanosensor system comprising a quantum emitter and a metal nanoparticle that explores the possibility of utilizing higher-order photon correlations for refractive index sensing. Both the refractive index sensitivity and resolution of the nanosensor, whose scattering spectrum lies within the visible region, are predicted. The sensor is supported by a substrate and driven weakly by a coherent field. By calculating the mean photocount and its second factorial moment resulting from the scattered field of the system, the sensing performance of the intensity and intensity-intensity correlation, are compared at optimal driving wavelengths. The mean photocount was found to be inherently low, inhibiting the role of interference-induced photon antibunching in minimizing the sensor's intensity shot noise. However, a regime in which the noise could be reduced below the shot noise limit is identified, leading to a quantum enhancement in the sensing performance.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for realizing various zero-energy localized states on disorder-free hypercube graphs. Previous works have already indicated that disorder is not essential for observing localization phenomena in noninteracting systems, with some prominent examples including the 1D Aubry-Andr\'e model, characterized solely by incommensurate potentials, or 2D incommensurate Moir\'e lattices, which exhibit localization due to the flat band spectrum. Moreover, flat band systems with translational invariance can also possess so-called compact localized states, characterized by exactly zero amplitude outside a finite region of the lattice. Here, we demonstrate that both compact and non-compact (i.e., Anderson-like) localized states naturally emerge in disorder-free hypercubes, which can be systematically constructed using Cartan products. This construction ensures the robustness of these localized states against perturbations. Furthermore, we show that the hypercubes can be associated with the Fock space of interacting spin systems exhibiting localization. Viewing localization from the hypercube perspective, with its inherently simple eigenspace structure, offers a clearer and more intuitive understanding of the underlying Fock-space many-body localization phenomena. Our findings can be readily tested on existing experimental platforms, where hypercube graphs can be emulated, e.g., by photonic networks of coupled optical cavities or waveguides. The results can pave the way for the development of novel quantum information protocols and enable effective simulation of quantum many-body localization phenomena.</description>
