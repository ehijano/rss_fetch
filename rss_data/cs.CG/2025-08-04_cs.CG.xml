      <title>Robust Model Reconstruction Based on the Topological Understanding of Point Clouds Using Persistent Homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconstructing models from unorganized point clouds presents a significant challenge, especially when the models consist of multiple components represented by their surface point clouds. Such models often involve point clouds with noise that represent multiple closed surfaces with shared regions, making their automatic identification and separation inherently complex. In this paper, we propose an automatic method that uses the topological understanding provided by persistent homology, along with representative 2-cycles of persistent homology groups, to effectively distinguish and separate each closed surface. Furthermore, we employ Loop subdivision and least squares progressive iterative approximation (LSPIA) techniques to generate high-quality final surfaces and achieve complete model reconstruction. Our method is robust to noise in the point cloud, making it suitable for reconstructing models from such data. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and highlight its potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Riemannian Optimization for Distance Geometry: A Study of Convergence, Robustness, and Incoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of recovering a configuration of points from partial pairwise distances, referred to as the Euclidean Distance Geometry (EDG) problem, arises in a broad range of applications, including sensor network localization, molecular conformation, and manifold learning. In this paper, we propose a Riemannian optimization framework for solving the EDG problem by formulating it as a low-rank matrix completion task over the space of positive semi-definite Gram matrices. The available distance measurements are encoded as expansion coefficients in a non-orthogonal basis, and optimization over the Gram matrix implicitly enforces geometric consistency through the triangle inequality, a structure inherited from classical multidimensional scaling. Under a Bernoulli sampling model for observed distances, we prove that Riemannian gradient descent on the manifold of rank-$r$ matrices locally converges linearly with high probability when the sampling probability satisfies $p \geq \mathcal{O}(\nu^2 r^2 \log(n)/n)$, where $\nu$ is an EDG-specific incoherence parameter. Furthermore, we provide an initialization candidate using a one-step hard thresholding procedure that yields convergence, provided the sampling probability satisfies $p \geq \mathcal{O}(\nu r^{3/2} \log^{3/4}(n)/n^{1/4})$. A key technical contribution of this work is the analysis of a symmetric linear operator arising from a dual basis expansion in the non-orthogonal basis, which requires a novel application of the Hanson--Wright inequality to establish an optimal restricted isometry property in the presence of coupled terms. Empirical evaluations on synthetic data demonstrate that our algorithm achieves competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we propose a novel notion of matrix incoherence tailored to the EDG setting and provide robustness guarantees for our method.</description>

      <title>On the Undecidability of Tiling the $3$-dimensional Space with a Set of $3$ Polycubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Translational tiling problems are among the most fundamental and representative undecidable problems in all fields of mathematics. Greenfeld and Tao obtained two remarkable results on the undecidability of translational tiling in recent years. One is the existence of an aperiodic monotile in a space of sufficiently large dimension. The other is the undecidability of translational tiling of periodic subsets of space with a single tile, provided that the dimension of the space is part of the input. These two results support the following conjecture: there is a fixed dimension $n$ such that translational tiling with a single tile is undecidable. One strategy towards solving this conjecture is to prove the undecidability of translational tiling of a fixed dimension space with a set of $k$ tiles, for a positive integer $k$ as small as possible. In this paper, it is shown that translational tiling the $3$-dimensional space with a set of $3$ polycubes is undecidable.</description>

      <title>chipfiring: A Python Package for Efficient Mathematical Analysis of Chip-Firing Games on Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00269v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents `chipfiring`, a comprehensive Python package for the mathematical analysis of chip-firing games on finite graphs. The package provides a robust toolkit for defining graphs and chip configurations (divisors), performing chip-firing operations, and analyzing fundamental properties such as winnability, linear equivalence, and divisor rank. We detail the core components of the library, including its object-oriented graph and divisor implementations, integrated Laplacian matrix computations, and an efficient implementation of Dhar's algorithm for determining the solvability of the dollar game. The `chipfiring` package is designed for researchers and students in graph theory, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry, providing essential algorithms and data structures for exploring these rich mathematical models. We describe the library's architecture, illustrate its usage with comprehensive examples, and highlight its specialized contributions compared to general-purpose graph libraries.</description>

      <title>Dudeney's Dissection is Optimal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03865v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle \dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation).
  Four weeks later, Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains perhaps the most famous example of dissection.
  In this paper (over a century later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal pieces.
  We reduce the problem to the analysis of discrete graph structures representing the correspondence between the edges and the vertices of the pieces forming each polygon.</description>

      <title>Simplification of Trajectory Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23025v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While there are software systems that simplify trajectory streams on the fly, few curve simplification algorithms with quality guarantees fit the streaming requirements. We present streaming algorithms for two such problems under the Fr\'{e}chet distance $d_F$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for some constant $d \geq 2$.
  Consider a polygonal curve $\tau$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in a stream. We present a streaming algorithm that, for any $\varepsilon\in (0,1)$ and $\delta &gt; 0$, produces a curve $\sigma$ such that $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon)\delta$ and $|\sigma|\le 2\,\mathrm{opt}-2$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far, and $\mathrm{opt} = \min\{|\sigma'|: d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i])\le \delta\}$. Let $\alpha = 2(d-1){\lfloor d/2 \rfloor}^2 + d$. The working storage is $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha})$ time for $d \geq 4$ . Thus, the whole $\tau$ can be simplified in $O(\varepsilon^{-\alpha}|\tau|\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time. Ignoring polynomial factors in $1/\varepsilon$, this running time is a factor $|\tau|$ faster than the best static algorithm that offers the same guarantees.
  We present another streaming algorithm that, for any integer $k \geq 2$ and any $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac{1}{17})$, maintains a curve $\sigma$ such that $|\sigma| \leq 2k-2$ and $d_F(\sigma,\tau[v_1,v_i])\le (1+\varepsilon) \cdot \min\{d_F(\sigma',\tau[v_1,v_i]): |\sigma'| \leq k\}$, where $\tau[v_1,v_i]$ is the prefix in the stream so far. The working storage is $O((k\varepsilon^{-1}+\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)})\log \frac{1}{\varepsilon})$. Each vertex is processed in $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log^2\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \in \{2,3\}$ and $O(k\varepsilon^{-(\alpha+1)}\log\frac{1}{\varepsilon})$ time for $d \geq 4$.</description>

      <title>TopoRec: Point Cloud Recognition Using Topological Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18725v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point cloud-based object/place recognition remains a problem of interest in applications such as autonomous driving, scene reconstruction, and localization. Extracting a meaningful global descriptor from a query point cloud that can be matched with the descriptors of the database point clouds is a challenging problem. Furthermore, when the query point cloud is noisy or has been transformed (e.g., rotated), it adds to the complexity. To this end, we propose a novel methodology, named TopoRec, which utilizes Topological Data Analysis (TDA) for extracting local descriptors from a point cloud, thereby eliminating the need for resource-intensive GPU-based machine learning training. More specifically, we used the ATOL vectorization method to generate vectors for point clouds. To test the quality of the proposed TopoRec technique, we have implemented it on multiple real-world (e.g., Oxford RobotCar, NCLT) and realistic (e.g., ShapeNet) point cloud datasets for large-scale place and object recognition, respectively. Unlike existing learning-based approaches such as PointNetVLAD and PCAN, our method does not require extensive training, making it easily adaptable to new environments. Despite this, it consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art learning-based and handcrafted baselines (e.g., M2DP, ScanContext) on standard benchmark datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy and strong generalization.</description>
