      <title>Unsupervised Learning of Spatio-Temporal Patterns in Spiking Neuronal Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to predict future events or patterns based on previous experience is crucial for many applications such as traffic control, weather forecasting, or supply chain management. While modern supervised Machine Learning approaches excel at such sequential tasks, they are computationally expensive and require large training data. A previous work presented a biologically plausible sequence learning model, developed through a bottom-up approach, consisting of a spiking neural network and unsupervised local learning rules. The model in its original formulation identifies only a specific type of sequence elements composed of synchronous spikes by activating a subset of neurons with identical stimulus preference. In this work, we extend the model to detect and learn sequences of various spatio-temporal patterns (STPs) by incorporating plastic connections in the input synapses. We showcase that the model is able to learn and predict high-order sequences. We further study the robustness of the model against different input settings and parameters.</description>

      <title>Double opponency serves as a basis for color constancy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Color constancy (CC) is one of the important perceptual abilities of the human visual system, which states that despite changes in illumination, the perceived colors of surfaces generally tend to remain constant. Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying CC have been debated for several decades. A specific type of cell, known as the double opponent cell in the primary visual cortex (V1), is strongly implicated in achieving CC. However, the exact functioning manner of this cell type remains uncertain. In this work, our quantitative analysis of concentric double-opponent cells in V1 revealed their ability to identify gray surfaces within color-biased scenes. These gray surfaces can then be used to estimate the illumination easily. For the first time, this finding offers a clear functional explanation of concentric double-opponent receptive fields of this cell type in the visual system. Building on this insight, we introduced a novel computational theory--gray-anchoring (GA) theory--to explain how CC is achieved in the visual system. Specifically, GA-based CC involves detecting and anchoring gray surfaces within complex scenes. Our new theory serves as a bridge among the retinex theory, anchoring theory, and the neural mechanisms underlying visual CC in color vision.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the field of electroencephalography (EEG) analysis has witnessed remarkable advancements, driven by the integration of machine learning and artificial intelligence. This survey aims to encapsulate the latest developments, focusing on emerging methods and technologies that are poised to transform our comprehension and interpretation of brain activity. We delve into self-supervised learning methods that enable the robust representation of brain signals, which are fundamental for a variety of downstream applications. We also explore emerging discriminative methods, including graph neural networks (GNN), foundation models, and large language models (LLMs)-based approaches. Furthermore, we examine generative technologies that harness EEG data to produce images or text, offering novel perspectives on brain activity visualization and interpretation. The survey provides an extensive overview of these cutting-edge techniques, their current applications, and the profound implications they hold for future research and clinical practice. The relevant literature and open-source materials have been compiled and are consistently being refreshed at \url{https://github.com/wpf535236337/LLMs4TS}</description>

      <title>Conditional Generative Models for Contrast-Enhanced Synthesis of T1w and T1 Maps in Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08894v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrast enhancement by Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) is a vital tool for tumor diagnosis in neuroradiology. Based on brain MRI scans of glioblastoma before and after Gadolinium administration, we address enhancement prediction by neural networks with two new contributions. Firstly, we study the potential of generative models, more precisely conditional diffusion and flow matching, for uncertainty quantification in virtual enhancement. Secondly, we examine the performance of T1 scans from quantitive MRI versus T1-weighted scans. In contrast to T1-weighted scans, these scans have the advantage of a physically meaningful and thereby comparable voxel range. To compare network prediction performance of these two modalities with incompatible gray-value scales, we propose to evaluate segmentations of contrast-enhanced regions of interest using Dice and Jaccard scores. Across models, we observe better segmentations with T1 scans than with T1-weighted scans.</description>

      <title>Oja's plasticity rule overcomes several challenges of training neural networks under biological constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a large literature on the similarities and differences between biological neural circuits and deep artificial neural networks (DNNs). However, modern training of DNNs relies on several engineering tricks such as data batching, normalization, adaptive optimizers, and precise weight initialization. Despite their critical role in training DNNs, these engineering tricks are often overlooked when drawing parallels between biological and artificial networks, potentially due to a lack of evidence for their direct biological implementation. In this study, we show that Oja's plasticity rule partly overcomes the need for some engineering tricks. Specifically, under difficult, but biologically realistic learning scenarios such as online learning, deep architectures, and sub-optimal weight initialization, Oja's rule can substantially improve the performance of pure backpropagation. Our results demonstrate that simple synaptic plasticity rules can overcome challenges to learning that are typically overcome using less biologically plausible approaches when training DNNs.</description>

      <title>Tracking objects that change in appearance with phase synchrony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02094v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Objects we encounter often change appearance as we interact with them. Changes in illumination (shadows), object pose, or movement of nonrigid objects can drastically alter available image features. How do biological visual systems track objects as they change? It may involve specific attentional mechanisms for reasoning about the locations of objects independently of their appearances -- a capability that prominent neuroscientific theories have associated with computing through neural synchrony. We computationally test the hypothesis that the implementation of visual attention through neural synchrony underlies the ability of biological visual systems to track objects that change in appearance over time. We first introduce a novel deep learning circuit that can learn to precisely control attention to features separately from their location in the world through neural synchrony: the complex-valued recurrent neural network (CV-RNN). Next, we compare object tracking in humans, the CV-RNN, and other deep neural networks (DNNs), using FeatureTracker: a large-scale challenge that asks observers to track objects as their locations and appearances change in precisely controlled ways. While humans effortlessly solved FeatureTracker, state-of-the-art DNNs did not. In contrast, our CV-RNN behaved similarly to humans on the challenge, providing a computational proof-of-concept for the role of phase synchronization as a neural substrate for tracking appearance-morphing objects as they move about.</description>

      <title>A Brain-Inspired Regularizer for Adversarial Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel in many visual tasks, but they tend to be sensitive to slight input perturbations that are imperceptible to the human eye, often resulting in task failures. Recent studies indicate that training CNNs with regularizers that promote brain-like representations, using neural recordings, can improve model robustness. However, the requirement to use neural data severely restricts the utility of these methods. Is it possible to develop regularizers that mimic the computational function of neural regularizers without the need for neural recordings, thereby expanding the usability and effectiveness of these techniques? In this work, we inspect a neural regularizer introduced in Li et al. (2019) to extract its underlying strength. The regularizer uses neural representational similarities, which we find also correlate with pixel similarities. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a new regularizer that retains the essence of the original but is computed using image pixel similarities, eliminating the need for neural recordings. We show that our regularization method 1) significantly increases model robustness to a range of black box attacks on various datasets and 2) is computationally inexpensive and relies only on original datasets. Our work explores how biologically motivated loss functions can be used to drive the performance of artificial neural networks.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Circuit Discovery for Inner Interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many proposed applications of neural networks in machine learning, cognitive/brain science, and society hinge on the feasibility of inner interpretability via circuit discovery. This calls for empirical and theoretical explorations of viable algorithmic options. Despite advances in the design and testing of heuristics, there are concerns about their scalability and faithfulness at a time when we lack understanding of the complexity properties of the problems they are deployed to solve. To address this, we study circuit discovery with classical and parameterized computational complexity theory: (1) we describe a conceptual scaffolding to reason about circuit finding queries in terms of affordances for description, explanation, prediction and control; (2) we formalize a comprehensive set of queries that capture mechanistic explanation, and propose a formal framework for their analysis; (3) we use it to settle the complexity of many query variants and relaxations of practical interest on multi-layer perceptrons (part of, e.g., transformers). Our findings reveal a challenging complexity landscape. Many queries are intractable (NP-hard, $\Sigma^p_2$-hard), remain fixed-parameter intractable (W[1]-hard) when constraining model/circuit features (e.g., depth), and are inapproximable under additive, multiplicative, and probabilistic approximation schemes. To navigate this landscape, we prove there exist transformations to tackle some of these hard problems (NP- vs. $\Sigma^p_2$-complete) with better-understood heuristics, and prove the tractability (PTIME) or fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) of more modest queries which retain useful affordances. This framework allows us to understand the scope and limits of interpretability queries, explore viable options, and compare their resource demands among existing and future architectures.</description>
