      <title>Garside shadows and biautomatic structures in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022, Osajda and Przytycki showed that any Coxeter group $W$ is biautomatic. Key to their proof is the notion of voracious projection of an element $g \in W$, which is used iteratively to construct a biautomatic structure for $W$: the voracious language. In this article, we generalize these two notions by defining them for any Garside shadow $B$ in a Coxeter system $(W,S)$. This leads to the result that any finite Garside shadow in $(W,S)$ can be used to construct a biautomatic structure for $W$. In addition, we show that for the Garside shadow $L$ of low elements, the biautomatic structure obtained corresponds to the original voracious language of Osajda and Przytycki. These results answer a question of Hohlweg and Parkinson.</description>

      <title>VC-dimension of generalized progressions in some nonabelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze generalized progressions in some nonabelian groups using a measure of complexity called VC-dimension, which was originally introduced in statistical learning theory by Vapnik and Chervonenkis. Here by a "generalized progression" in a group $G$, we mean a finite subset of $G$ built from a fixed set of generators in analogy to a (multidimensional) arithmetic progression of integers. These sets play an important role in additive combinatorics and, in particular, the study of approximate groups. Our two main results establish finite upper bounds on the VC-dimension of certain set systems of generalized progressions in finitely generated free groups and also the Heisenberg group over $\mathbb{Z}$.</description>

      <title>The Ingleton inequality holds for metacyclic groups and fails for supersoluble groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Ingleton inequality first appeared in matroid theory, where Ingleton proved in 1971 that every rank function coming from a representable matroid on four subsets satisfies a particular inequality. Because this inequality is not implied by submodularity, Shannon-type axioms alone, it and various analogues play a central role in separately linear and non-linear phenomena in a variety of areas of mathematics. The Ingleton inequality for finite groups concerns the various intersections of four subgroups. It holds for many quadruples of subgroups of finite groups, but not all, the smallest example being four subgroups of $S_5$, of order 120. Open questions are whether the Inlgeton inequality always holds for metacycle and nilpotent groups. (There is a proof in the literature due to Oggier and Stancu, but there is an already known issue with their proof, which we address in this article.)
  In this paper we prove that the Ingleton inequality always holds for metacycle groups, but that it fails for supersoluble groups, a class of groups only a little larger than nilpotent groups. Although we do not resolve the nilpotent case here we do make some reductions, and also prove that there are no nilpotent violators of the Ingleton inequality of order less than 1024. We end with a list of Ingleton inequality violating groups of order at most 1023.
  The article comes with a Magma package that allows reproduction of all results in the paper and for the reader to check the Ingleton inequality for any given finite group.</description>

      <title>Bochner-type theorems for distributional category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that in the presence of a geometric condition such as non-negative Ricci curvature, the distributional category of a manifold may be used to bound invariants, such as the first Betti number and macroscopic dimension, from above. Moreover, \`a la Bochner, when the bound is an equality, special constraints are imposed on the manifold. We show that the distributional category of a space also bounds the rank of the Gottlieb group, with equality imposing constraints on the fundamental group. These bounds are refined in the setting of cohomologically symplectic manifolds, enabling us to get specific computations for the distributional category and LS-category.</description>

      <title>On the Farrell--Tate $K$-theory of $\text{Out}(F_n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.21803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using L\"uck's Chern character isomorphism we obtain a general formula in terms of centralisers for the $p$-adic Farrell--Tate $K$-theory of any discrete group $G$ with a finite classifying space for proper actions. We apply this formula to $\text{Out}(F_n)$. The case $n=p+1$ turns out to be especially interesting for the following reason: Up to conjugacy there is exactly one order $p$ element in $\text{Out}(F_{p+1})$ which does not lift to an order $p$ element in $\text{Aut}(F_{p+1})$. We compute the rational cohomology of the centraliser of this element and as a consequence obtain a full calculation of the $p$-adic Farrell--Tate $K$-theory of $\text{Out}(F_{p+1})$ for any prime $p \geq 5$. Our arguments provide an infinite family of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ summands in $K^1(B \text{Out}(F_n)) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q}$, with no need for computer calculations: the first such summand is in $K^1(B \text{Out}(F_{12})) \otimes_\mathbb{Z} \mathbb{Q}$.</description>

      <title>Generic weights for finite reductive groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is motivated by the study of Alperin's weight conjecture in the representation theory of finite groups. We generalize the notion of $e$-cuspidality in the $e$-Harish-Chandra theory of finite reductive groups, and define generic weights in non-defining characteristic. We show that the generic weights play an analogous role as the weights defined by Alperin in the investigation of the inductive Alperin weight condition for simple groups of Lie type at most good primes. We hope that our approach will constitute a step towards an eventual proof of Alperin's weight conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an alternative way of computing Alexander polynomials of knots/links, based on the Artin representation of the corresponding braids by automorphisms of a free group. Then we apply the same method to other representations of braid groups discovered by Wada and compare the corresponding isotopic invariants to Alexander polynomials.</description>

      <title>Random Schr\"odinger operators and convolution on wreath products</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22485v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a spectral correspondence between random Schr\"odinger operators and deterministic convolution operators on wreath products, generalizing previous results that relate Lamplighter groups to Schr\"odinger operators with Bernoulli potentials. Using this correspondence in both directions, we obtain an elementary criterion for the absolute continuity of convolutions on wreath products, Lifschitz tail estimates for Schr\"odinger operators on Cayley graphs of polynomial growth, and an exact formula for the second moment of the Green function, expressed in terms of the wreath product with an Abelian group of lamps.</description>

      <title>Invariable generation of certain branch groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. Then $S\subseteq G$ is an invariable generating set of $G$ if every subset $S'$ obtained from $S$ by replacing each element with a conjugate is also a generating set of $G$. We investigate invariable generation among key examples of branch groups. In particular, we prove that all generating sets of the torsion Grigorchuk groups, of the branch Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki groups and of the torsion multi-EGS groups (which are natural generalisations of the Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki groups) are invariable generating sets. Furthermore, for the first Grigorchuk group and the torsion Grigorchuk-Gupta-Sidki groups, every finitely generated subgroup has a finite invariable generating set. Our results apply to finitely generated groups in $\mathcal{MN}$, the class of groups whose maximal subgroups are all normal. We then obtain that any $2$-generated group in $\mathcal{MN}$ is almost $\frac{3}{2}$-generated, and end by applying this observation to generating graphs.</description>

      <title>Submonoid Membership in n-dimensional lamplighter groups and S-unit equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07077v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Submonoid Membership is decidable in n-dimensional lamplighter groups $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}) \wr \mathbb{Z}^n$ for any prime $p$ and integer $n$. More generally, we show decidability of Submonoid Membership in semidirect products of the form $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$, where $\mathcal{Y}$ is any finitely presented module over the Laurent polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$. Combined with a result of Shafrir (2024), this gives the first example of a group $G$ and a finite index subgroup $\widetilde{G} \leq G$, such that Submonoid Membership is decidable in $\widetilde{G}$ but undecidable in $G$.
  To obtain our decidability result, we reduce Submonoid Membership in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ to solving S-unit equations over $\mathbb{F}_p[X_1^{\pm}, \ldots, X_n^{\pm}]$-modules. We show that the solution set of such equations is effectively $p$-automatic, extending a result of Adamczewski and Bell (2012). As an intermediate result, we also obtain that the solution set of the Knapsack Problem in $\mathcal{Y} \rtimes \mathbb{Z}^n$ is effectively $p$-automatic.</description>

      <title>Word problems and embedding-obstructions in cellular automata groups on groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05572v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study groups of reversible cellular automata, or CA groups, on groups. More generally, we consider automorphism groups of subshifts of finite type on groups. It is known that word problems of CA groups on virtually nilpotent groups are in co-NP, and can be co-NP-hard. We show that under the Gap Conjecture of Grigorchuk, their word problems are PSPACE-hard on all other groups. On free and surface groups, we show that they are indeed always in PSPACE. On a group with co-NEXPTIME word problem, CA groups themselves have co-NEXPTIME word problem, and on the lamplighter group (which itself has polynomial-time word problem) we show they can be co-NEXPTIME-hard. We show also nonembeddability results: the group of cellular automata on a non-cyclic free group does not embed in the group of cellular automata on the integers (this solves a question of Barbieri, Carrasco-Vargas and Rivera-Burgos); and the group of cellular automata in dimension $D$ does not embed in a group of cellular automata in dimension $d$ if $D &gt; d$ (this solves a question of Hochman).</description>

      <title>Continuity and equivariant dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the local-triviality dimensions of actions on $C^*$-algebras, which are invariants developed for noncommutative Borsuk-Ulam theory. While finiteness of the local-triviality dimensions is known to guarantee freeness of an action, we show that free actions need not have finite weak local-triviality dimension. Moreover, the local-triviality dimensions of a continuous field may be greater than those of its individual fibers, and the dimensions may fail to vary continuously across the fibers. However, in certain circumstances upper semicontinuity of the weak local-triviality dimension is guaranteed. We examine these results and counterexamples with a focus on noncommutative tori and noncommutative spheres, both in terms of computation and theory.</description>

      <title>Homology of Steinberg algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15112v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study homological invariants of the Steinberg algebra $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ of an ample groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ over a commutative ring $k$. For $\mathcal{G}$ principal or Hausdorff with ${\mathcal{G}}^{\rm{Iso}}\setminus{\mathcal{G}}^{(0)}$ discrete, we compute Hochschild and cyclic homology of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of groupoid homology. For any ample Hausdorff groupoid $\mathcal{G}$, we find that $H_*(\mathcal{G})$ is a direct summand of $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$; using this and the Dennis trace we obtain a map $\overline{D}_*:K_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))\to H_n(\mathcal{G},k)$. We study this map when $\mathcal{G}$ is the (twisted) Exel-Pardo groupoid associated to a self-similar action of a group $G$ on a graph, and compute $HH_*(\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G}))$ and $H_*(\mathcal{G},k)$ in terms of the homology of $G$, and the $K$-theory of $\mathcal{A}_k(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of that of $k[G]$.</description>
