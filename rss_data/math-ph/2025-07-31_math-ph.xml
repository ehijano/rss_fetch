      <title>Interrelation among Solvable Potentials and Extensions of SWKB Quantization Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exactly solvable Schr\"{o}dinger equations with the conventional shape-invariant potentials are known to be related with each other through point cannonical transformations. In this paper, we extend the idea to integral formulae called the SWKB integrals. By virtue of this, we derive extended forms of the SWKB quantization condition for certain classes of Natanzon potentials. We further demonstrate that the same idea can also be applied to obtain an exact quantization rule for a subclass of quantum systems with position-dependent effective masses, provided their solutions involve the classical orthogonal polynomials. Based on the findings, we conjecture about the implication of the exactness of the SWKB formula in relation to the classical orthogonal polynomials.</description>

      <title>What is the topological dual of the XXZ spin Chain?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a dual symmetry-protected topological (SPT) Hamiltonian for the $U(1)$ symmetric anisotropic spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain-a model that has traditionally been used to study spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases, with an intervening extended Luttinger liquid phase. By performing a non-local unitary transformation, we explicitly construct a local fermionic Hamiltonian that exhibits two nontrivial topological phases separated by an extended Luttinger liquid regime. We demonstrate the topological nature of these phases by analyzing the entanglement structure, deriving a non-local string order parameter, and constructing an exact zero mode operator that connects states in different fermionic parity sectors.</description>

      <title>Emergence of Finite-Time Singularities from Accelerated Event Recurrence: Insights into the Mechanism of Catastrophic Failure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a discrete-event modeling framework that captures the progression of geophysical systems toward catastrophic failure through sequences of distinct damage events. By representing system evolution as a succession of temporally accelerating and amplitude-varying events, the framework reveals how finite-time singularities, both logarithmic and power law types, naturally emerge from the interplay between shrinking interevent intervals and growing event magnitudes. This event-based perspective provides an intuitive physical understanding of rupture processes, highlighting how precursory signals such as accelerating strain rate, event frequency, and energy release can be traced back to simple underlying mechanisms. A mean-field formulation further links the observed power law exponents to the evolving stiffness of the system under constant or time-varying stress. Incorporating stochastic fluctuations, the model captures the inherent randomness of natural systems leading to the emergence of stochastic finite-time singular behavior. Altogether, this unified approach offers a simple conceptual and quantitative tool for interpreting the lead-up to failure in a wide range of geophysical settings.</description>

      <title>Inverse Mobius Spacetime in 1+1D Quantum Gravity: Functional Analytic Structures, Dirac Spectrum, and Pin Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we formulate a (1+1)-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity toy model whose Euclidean spacetime manifold is the M\"obius band $M$. Since $M$ is non-orientable, the relevant spin-statistics structure is Pin rather than Spin. To emphasize the role of orientation reversal, we refer to the universal orientable cover $\widetilde{M}$ as the inverse M\"obius band, which resolves the M\"obius twist into an infinite ribbon equipped with a $\mathbb{Z}$ deck action. We compute the Stiefel-Whitney classes $w_1$, $w_2$, classify all $\mathrm{Pin}^\pm$ structures, construct the associated pinor bundles, and analyze the Dirac operator under the twisted equivariance condition \[ \psi(x+1, w) = \gamma^w \psi(x, -w). \] Half-integer momentum quantization, spectral symmetry, vanishing mod-2 index, and $\eta_D(0) = 0$ follow. In JT gravity, the two inequivalent Pin lifts in each parity double the non-perturbative saddle-point sum, yet leave the leading Bekenstein-Hawking entropy unchanged. Full proofs and heat-kernel calculations are provided for completeness.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize H\r{a}stad's long-code test for projection games and show that it remains complete and sound against entangled provers.
  Combined with a result of Dong et al. \cite{Dong25}, which establishes that $\MIP^*=\RE$ with constant-length answers, we derive that $\LIN^*_{1-\epsilon,s}=\RE$, for some $1/2&lt; s&lt;1$ and for every sufficiently small $\epsilon&gt;0$, where LIN refers to linearity (over $\mathbb{F}_2$) of the verifier predicate. Achieving the same result with $\epsilon=0$ would imply the existence of a non-hyperlinear group.</description>

      <title>On a non-commutative sixth $q$-Painlev\'e system: from discrete system to surface theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the non-commutative formal geometry underlying a certain class of discrete integrable systems. Our main example is a non-commutative analog, labeled $q$-P$(A_3)$, of the sixth $q$-Painlev{\'e} equation. The system $q$-P$(A_3)$ is constructed by postulating an extended birational representation of the extended affine Weyl group $\widetilde{W}$ of type $D_5^{(1)}$ and by selecting the same translation element in $\widetilde{W}$ as in the commutative case. Starting from this non-commutative discrete system, we develop a non-commutative version of Sakaiâ€™s surface theory, which allows us to derive the same birational representation that we initially postulated. Moreover, we recover the well-known cascade of multiplicative discrete Painlev{\'e} equations rooted in $q$-P$(A_3)$ and establish a connection between $q$-P$(A_3)$ and the non-commutative $d$-Painlev{\'e} systems introduced in I. Bobrova. Affine Weyl groups and non-Abelian discrete systems: an application to the $d$-Painlev{\'e} equations.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Bialgebras and Quantum Groups: Algebraic Structures and Tensor Network Realizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework to define coalgebra and bialgebra structures on two-dimensional (2D) square lattices, extending the algebraic theory of Hopf algebras and quantum groups beyond the one-dimensional (1D) setting. Our construction is based on defining 2D coproducts through horizontal and vertical maps that satisfy compatibility and associativity conditions, enabling the consistent growth of vector spaces over lattice sites. We present several examples of 2D bialgebras, including group-like and Lie algebra-inspired constructions and a quasi-1D coproduct instance that is applicable to Taft-Hopf algebras and to quantum groups. The approach is further applied to the quantum group $U_q[su(2)]$, for which we construct 2D generalizations of its generators, analyze $q$-deformed singlet states, and derive a 2D R-matrix satisfying an intertwining relation in the semiclassical limit. Additionally, we show how tensor network states, particularly PEPS, naturally induce 2D coalgebra structures when supplemented with appropriate boundary conditions. Our results establish a local and algebraically consistent method to embed quantum group symmetries into higher-dimensional lattice systems, potentially connecting to the emerging theory of fusion 2-categories and categorical symmetries in quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Algorithm for computing the partition function of the Potts model for SP-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The q-state Potts model is a fundamental framework in statistical physics and graph theory, with its partition function encoding rich information about spin configurations. The multivariate Tutte polynomial (known as the partition function of the Potts model) can be defined on an arbitrary finite graph $G$ and encodes a lot of important combinatorial information about the graph. As a special case, it contains the familiar Tutte polynomial with two variables and, consequently, its specialization with one variable, such as the chromatic polynomial, the flow polynomial and the reliability polynomial. The main goal of this paper is to present an efficient algorithm for computing the Potts model partition function on SP-graphs (series-parallel graphs) with arbitrary weights. The algorithm for SP-graphs is based on simplifying the graph by replacing several edges with a single edge of equivalent weight, which significantly reduces computational complexity. In this paper, we present a linear-time algorithm for exactly computing the Potts model partition function on series-parallel graphs (SP-graphs).</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Properties of a Special Solution to the (3,4) String Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the asymptotic properties a special solution of the $(3,4)$ string equation, which appears in the study of the multicritical quartic $2$-matrix model. In particular, we show that in a certain parameter regime, the corresponding $\tau$-function has an asymptotic expansion which is `topological' in nature. Consequently, we show that this solution to the string equation with a specific set of Stokes data exists, at least asymptotically. We also demonstrate that, along specific curves in the parameter space, this $\tau$-function degenerates to the $\tau$-function for a tritronqu\'{e}e solution of Painlev\'{e} I (which appears in the critical quartic $1$-matrix model), indicating that there is a `renormalization group flow' between these critical points. This confirms a conjecture from [1].

      <title>On the Trotter Error in Many-body Quantum Dynamics with Coulomb Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of many-body quantum systems is central to advances in physics, chemistry, and quantum computing, with a key question being whether the simulation cost scales polynomially with the system size. In this work, we analyze many-body quantum systems with Coulomb interactions, which are fundamental to electronic and molecular systems. We prove that Trotterization for such unbounded Hamiltonians achieves a $1/4$-order convergence rate, with explicit polynomial dependence on the number of particles. The result holds for all initial wavefunctions in the domain of the Hamiltonian, and the $1/4$-order convergence rate is optimal, as previous studies have shown that it can be saturated by a specific initial eigenstate. The main challenges arise from the many-body structure and the singular nature of the Coulomb potential. Our proof strategy differs from prior state-of-the-art Trotter analyses, addressing both difficulties in a unified framework.</description>

Abstract: Extending the recent work of Cannarsa, Cheng and Fathi, we investigate topological properties of the locus ${\cal NU}(M,g)$ of multiple maximizing geodesics on a globally hyperbolic spacetime $(M,g)$, i.e.\ the set of causally related pairs $(x,y)$ for which there exists more than one maximizing geodesic (up to reparametrization) from $x$ to $y$. We will prove that this set is locally contractible. We will also define the notion of a Lorentzian Aubry set ${\cal A}$ and prove that the inclusions ${\cal NU}(M,g)\hookrightarrow \operatorname{Cut}_M\hookrightarrow J^+\backslash {\cal A}$ are homotopy equivalences.</description>

      <title>Numerical Methods for Solving Nonlinearly Coupled Poisson Equations in Dual-Continuum Modeled Porous Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Porous electrodes are widely used in electrochemical systems, where accurately determining electric potentials, particularly overpotentials, is essential for understanding electrode behavior. At the macroscopic scale, porous electrodes are typically modeled using a dual-continuum approach, treating the porous solid phase and the liquid electrolyte as spatially superimposed domains. Determining potential distributions requires solving two Poisson equations that are nonlinearly coupled through Butler-Volmer kinetics under galvanostatic and potentiostatic operating modes. Under galvanostatic operation, these equations form an underconstrained singular system due to all-Neumann boundary conditions, posing numerical challenges. This paper systematically presents numerical methods for solving nonlinearly coupled Poisson equations in dual-continuum porous electrodes, with a particular focus on galvanostatic solutions. We mathematically establish solution uniqueness in terms of the potential difference between the electrode and electrolyte (or overpotential), as well as the individual potentials up to a shared constant shift. To resolve the nonuniqueness of the solution, we introduce three numerical approaches: (1) Lagrange Constrained Method (LCM), (2) Dirichlet Substitution Method (DSM), and (3) Global Constraining Method (GCM), where GCM enables solving the overpotential without imposing an explicit system reference potential. Additionally, we develop both decoupled and fully coupled nonlinear solution strategies and evaluate their computational performance in both homogeneous and heterogeneous conductivity cases. The presented numerical methods are general for addressing similar underconstrained nonlinear systems. A Python implementation is provided at https://github.com/harrywang1129/porous_electrode_solver.</description>

      <title>Reflection Equivariance and the Heisenberg Picture for Spaces of Conformal Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22820v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monoidal product, braiding, balancing and weak duality are pieces of algebraic information that are well-known to have their origin in oriented genus zero surfaces and their mapping classes. More precisely, each of them correspond to operations of the cyclic framed $E_2$-operad. We extend this correspondence to include another algebraic piece of data, namely the modified trace, by showing that it amounts to a homotopy fixed point structure with respect to the homotopy involution that reverses the orientation of surfaces and dualizes the state spaces. We call such a homotopy fixed point structure reflection equivariance. As an application, we describe the effect of orientation reversal on spaces of conformal blocks and skein modules in the non-semisimple setting, throughout relying on their factorization homology description. This has important consequences: For a modular functor that is reflection equivariant relative to a rigid duality, i) the circle category is modular, and the resulting mapping class group representations are automatically the ones built by Lyubashenko, and ii) the resulting internal skein algebras have one simple representation, carrying a unique projective mapping class group representation making the action equivariant. While i) is a new topological characterization of not necessarily semisimple modular categories, ii) generalizes the implicit description of spaces of conformal blocks purely through the representation theory of moduli algebras given by Alekseev-Grosse-Schomerus from rational conformal field theories admitting a Hopf algebra description to finite rigid logarithmic conformal field theories. This also generalizes several results of Faitg from ribbon factorizable Hopf algebras to arbitrary modular categories.</description>

      <title>Real Noncommutative Convexity II: Extremality and nc convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue with the theory of real noncommutative (nc) convexity, following the recent and profound complex case developed by Davidson and Kennedy. The present paper focuses on the theory of nc extreme (and pure and maximal) points and the nc Choquet boundary in the real case, and on the theory of real nc convex and semicontinuous functions and real nc convex envelopes. Our main emphasis is on how these interact with complexification. For example some of our paper analyzes carefully how various notions of `extreme' or `maximal' interact with our earlier concept of the complexification of a convex set. Several new features appear in the real case in later sections of our paper, including the novel notion of the complexification of a nc convex function, and the complexification of the convex envelope of a nc function. With an Appendix by T. Russell.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For logarithmic conformal field theories whose monodromy data is given by a not necessarily semisimple modular category, we solve the problem of constructing and classifying the consistent systems of correlators. The correlator construction given in this article generalizes the well-known one for rational conformal field theories given by Fuchs-Runkel-Schweigert roughly twenty years ago and solves conjectures of Fuchs, Gannon, Schaumann and Schweigert. The strategy is, even in the rational special case, entirely different. The correlators are constructed using the extension procedures that can be devised by means of the modular microcosm principle. It is shown that, as in the rational case, the correlators admit a holographic description, with the main difference that the holographic principle is phrased in terms of factorization homology. The latter description is used to prove that the coefficients of the torus partition function are non-negative integers. Moreover, we show that the derived algebra of local operators associated to a consistent system of correlators carries a Batalin-Vilkovisky structure. We prove that it is equivalent to the Batalin-Vilkovisky structure on the Hochschild cohomology of the pivotal module category of boundary conditions, for the notion of pivotality due to Schaumann and Shimizu. This proves several expectations formulated by Kapustin-Rozansky and Fuchs-Schweigert for general conformal field theories.</description>

      <title>Poisson structure and Integrability of a Hamiltonian flow for the inhomogeneous six-vertex model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <title>Small deviations of Gaussian multiplicative chaos and the free energy of the two-dimensional massless Sinh--Gordon model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a global decomposition result for $\log$-correlated Gaussian fields on the $d$-dimensional torus and use this to derive new small deviations bounds for a class of Gaussian multiplicative chaos measures obtained from Gaussian fields with zero spatial mean on the $d$-dimensional torus. The upper bound is obtained by a modification of the method that was used in \cite{LRV}, and the lower bound is obtained by applying the Donsker--Varadhan variational formula.
  We also give the probabilistic path integral formulation of the massless Sinh--Gordon model on a torus of side length $R$, and study its partition function as $R$ tends to infinity. We apply the small deviation bounds for Gaussian multiplicative chaos to obtain lower and upper bounds for the logarithm of the partition function, leading to the existence of a non-zero and finite subsequential infinite volume limit for the free energy.</description>

      <title>Hilbert-Schmidt norm estimates for fermionic reduced density matrices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03488v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Hilbert-Schmidt norm of $k$-particle reduced density matrices of $N$-body fermionic states is bounded by $C_kN^{k/2}$ - matching the scaling behaviour of Slater determinant states. This generalises a recent result of Christiansen (2024) on 2-particle reduced density matrices to higher-order density matrices. Moreover, our estimate directly yields a lower bound on the von Neumann entropy and the 2-R\'enyi entropy of reduced density matrices, thereby providing further insight into conjectures of Carlen-Lieb-Reuvers (2016,2018).</description>

      <title>Categorifying Clifford QCA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14811v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of Clifford quantum cellular automata (QCAs) on arbitrary metric spaces and any qudits (of prime or composite dimensions) in terms of algebraic L-theory. Building on the delooping formalism of Pedersen and Weibel, we reinterpret Clifford QCAs as symmetric formations in a filtered additive category constructed from the geometry of the underlying space. This perspective allows us to identify the group of stabilized Clifford QCAs, modulo circuits and separated automorphisms, with the Witt group of the corresponding Pedersen--Weibel category. Notably, because the Pedersen--Weibel category depends only on the large-scale (coarse) structure of the metric space, so too does the classification of Clifford QCAs. For Euclidean lattices, the classification reproduces and expands upon known results, while for more general spaces -- including open cones over finite simplicial complexes -- we relate nontrivial QCAs to generalized homology theories with coefficients in the L-theory spectrum. We also outline extensions to QCAs with symmetry and mixed qudit dimensions, and discuss how these fit naturally into the L-theoretic framework.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Limits of Decoding: Critical Divergence of Kullback-Leibler Information and Free Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a statistical mechanical framework based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) to analyze the relativistic limits of decoding time-encoded information from a moving source. By modeling the symbol durations as entropy-maximizing sequences and treating the decoding process as context-sensitive inference, we identify KLD between the sender and receiver distributions as a key indicator of contextual mismatch. We show that, under Lorentz transformations, this divergence grows with the sender's velocity and exhibits critical divergence as the velocity approaches the speed of light. Furthermore, we derive an analytic expression for the Fisher information and demonstrate that decoding sensitivity diverges similarly, indicating instability near the relativistic limit. By introducing an information-theoretic free energy based on the decoding cost, we determine a critical velocity beyond which decoding becomes thermodynamically impossible. These results reveal a phase-transition-like behavior in relativistic information transfer and provide a unified interpretation of KLD, Fisher information, and free energy as measures of decodability. The formalism developed here offers new insights into high-speed communication, relativistic signal processing, and information geometry in non-inertial frames.</description>

      <title>On Frustration-Free Quantum Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of our work is to characterize the landscape of the frustration-free quantum spin models over the Cayley graph of a finitely generated group $G$. This is achieved by establishing $G$-equivariant morphisms from the partially ordered space of frustration-free models to the partially ordered spaces 1) of hereditary $C^\ast$-algebras of the underlying UHF quasi-local algebra of observables, 2) of open projections in its double dual, and 3) of subsets of pure state space. Our main result consists of an intrinsic characterization of the images of these morphisms, which captures the essence of frustration-freeness and enables us to extend the concept to generic AF-algebras. Additionally, using well established facts about AF-algebras, we prove density theorems, provide intrinsic characterizations of frustration-free ground states, and propose a definition of a boundary algebra for models constrained to half-lattices, under the sole assumption of frustration-freeness.</description>

      <title>Random non-Hermitian Hamiltonian framework for symmetry breaking dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose random non-Hermitian Hamiltonians to model the generic stochastic nonlinear dynamics of a quantum state in Hilbert space. Our approach features an underlying linearity in the dynamical equations, ensuring the applicability of techniques used for solving linear systems. Additionally, it offers the advantage of easily incorporating statistical symmetry, a generalization of explicit symmetry to stochastic processes. To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply it to describe real-time dynamics, starting from an initial symmetry-preserving state and evolving into a randomly distributed, symmetry-breaking final state. Our model serves as a quantum framework for the transition process, from disordered states to ordered ones, where symmetry is spontaneously broken.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A new age-structured diffusive model for the mathematical modelling of epidemics is suggested. The model can be considered as a generalization of two models suggested earlier for the same purposes. The Lie symmetry classification of the model is derived. It is shown that the model admits an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra of invariance. Using the Lie symmetries, exact solutions, in particular those of the travelling wave types and in terms of special functions, are constructed. An example of application of the correctly-specified exact solution for calculation of total numbers of infected individuals during an epidemic is presented.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics, based on string operators and many-body Hilbert space, to invertible topological excitations of any dimensions. This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a novel, rigorous, and self-contained theory of statistics. Our definition of statistics can be computed directly using a computer, and the result aligns with existing physical theories.</description>

Abstract: Based on an important mathematical conjecture, together with hypothesis of homological mirror symmetry in the context of Landau-Ginzburg models, we show that a class of compound Du Val singularities do not admit a crepant resolution. Most of these singularities sit in the type cEn. This implies that those singularities are not dual to four dimensional N =1 superconformal quiver gauge theories through stacks of D3 branes placed at the singularities. We verify this statement on the physics side by enumerating consistent gauge theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01996v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle coordinates for an Ising type model whose L-operator has been previously studied in the literature by Bazhanov and Sergeev. In comparison to computations with such operators that have been examined previously by the author for the 4-vertex, 6-vertex, and 20-vertex, models, computations for asymptotically approximating a collection of sixteen identities with the Poisson bracket, which together constitute the Poisson structure of the Ising type model, exhibit dependencies upon nearest neighbor interactions. Inspite of the fact that L-operators for the 20-vertex model are defined in terms of combinatorial, and algebraic, constituents unlike such operators for the 6-vertex model which are defined in terms of projectors and Pauli basis elements, L-operators for the Ising-type model can be used for concluding that a model which interpolates between the 6-vertex, and 8-vertex, models is exactly solvable.</description>

Abstract: Given the current interest in quantum information tasks with higher-dimensional systems, we present three possible extensions of the bit-flip channel to qutrit systems based on different interpretations of the channel. We compared our results with the commonly used cyclic one-parameter trit flip channels and demonstrated that they are particular cases of our more general formulation. Also, we extended these channels to higher-dimensional qudit systems, therefore defining different dit flip channels. Finally, we studied their impact on the Negativity, as an entanglement measure, of qubit-qutrit and 2-qutrit Werner states. In doing so, we demonstrated the inequivalence of these versions, as they affect the states' entanglement in very distinct ways.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Poisson structures of the Poincar\'e group can be linked to deformations of the Minkowski space-time, classified some time ago by Zakrewski. Based on this classification, various quantum Minkowski space-times with coordinates Lie algebras and specific Poincare Hopf algebras have been exhibited by Mercati and called T-Minkowski space-times. Here we construct the star products and involutions characterizing the $\star$-algebras for a broad family of Lie algebras which includes 11 out of 17 Lie algebras of T-Minkowski spaces. We show that the usual Lebesgue integral defines either a trace or a KMS weight ('twisted trace') depending on whether the Lie group of the coordinates' Lie algebra is unimodular or not. Finally, we give the Poincar\'e Hopf algebras when they are compatible with our $*$-product. General derivation of such symmetry Hopf algebras are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>First-passage properties of the jump process with a drift. Two exactly solvable cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties of a jump process with a constant drift, focusing on two key observables: the first-passage time $\tau$ and the number of jumps $n$ before the first-passage event. By mapping the problem onto an effective discrete-time random walk, we derive an exact expression for the Laplace transform of the joint distribution of $\tau$ and $n$ using the generalized Pollaczek-Spitzer formula. This result is then used to analyze the first-passage properties for two exactly solvable cases: (i) both the inter-jump intervals and jump amplitudes are exponentially distributed, and (ii) the inter-jump intervals are exponentially distributed while all jumps have the same fixed amplitude. We show the existence of two distinct regimes governed by the strength of the drift: (i) a survival regime, where the process remains positive indefinitely with finite probability; (ii) an absorption regime, where the first-passage eventually occurs; and (iii) a critical point at the boundary between these two phases. We characterize the asymptotic behavior of survival probabilities in each regime: they decay exponentially to a constant in the survival regime, vanish exponentially fast in the absorption regime, and exhibit power-law decay at the critical point. Furthermore, in the absorption regime, we derive large deviation forms for the marginal distributions of $\tau$ and n. The analytical predictions are validated through extensive numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: Mechanical effects that span multiple physical scales -- such as the influence of vanishing molecular viscosity on large-scale flow structures under specific conditions -- play a critical role in real fluid systems. The spin angular momentum-conserving Navier--Stokes equations offer a theoretical framework for describing such multiscale fluid dynamics by decomposing total angular momentum into bulk and intrinsic spin components. However, this framework still assumes locally non-solid rotational flows, a condition that remains empirically unverified. This study addresses such unvalidated assumptions intrinsic to the model and extends it within the framework of turbulence hierarchy theory. The theory suggests that under certain conditions, small-scale structures may transfer to larger scales through the rotational viscosity. To verify this, we conducted spectral analyses of freely decaying two-dimensional turbulence initialized with a vortex-concentrated distribution. The results indicate that rotational viscosity exhibits interscale transfer behavior, revealing a new mechanism by which order can propagate from small to large scales in Navier--Stokes turbulence.</description>
