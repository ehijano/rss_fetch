      <title>Orientations of graphs with at most one directed path between every pair of vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, we say that an orientation $D$ of $G$ is a KT orientation if, for all $u, v \in V(D)$, there is at most one directed path (in any direction) between $u$ and $v$. Graphs that admit such orientations have been used by Kierstead and Trotter (1992), Carbonero, Hompe, Moore, and Spirkl (2023), Bria\'nski, Davies, and Walczak (2024), and Gir\~ao, Illingworth, Powierski, Savery, Scott, Tamitegami, and Tan (2024) to construct graphs with large chromatic number and small clique number that served as counterexamples to various conjectures. Motivated by this, we consider which graphs admit KT orientations (named after Kierstead and Trotter). In particular, we construct a graph family with small independence number (sublinear in the number of vertices) which admits a KT orientation. We show that the problem of determining whether a given graph admits a KT orientation is NP-complete, even if we restrict ourselves to planar graphs. Finally, we provide an algorithm to decide if a graph with maximum degree at most 3 admits a KT orientation, whereas, for graphs with maximum degree 4, the problem remains NP-complete.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial transfer: a new method for constructing infinite families of nonabelian difference sets, partial difference sets, and relative difference sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For nearly a century, mathematicians have been developing techniques for constructing abelian automorphism groups of combinatorial objects, and, conversely, constructing combinatorial objects from abelian groups. While abelian groups are a natural place to start, recent computational evidence strongly indicates that the vast majority of transitive automorphism groups of combinatorial objects are nonabelian. This observation is the guiding motivation for this paper. We propose a new method for constructing nonabelian automorphism groups of combinatorial objects, which could be called the \textit{combinatorial transfer method}, and we demonstrate its power by finding (1) the first infinite families of nonabelian Denniston partial difference sets (including nonabelian Denniston PDSs of odd order), (2) the first infinite family of Spence difference sets in groups with a Sylow 3-subgroup that is non-normal and not elementary abelian, (3) the first infinite families of McFarland difference sets in groups with a Sylow $p$-subgroup that is non-normal and is not elementary abelian, (4) new infinite families of partial difference sets in nonabelian $p$-groups with large exponent, (5) an infinite family of semiregular relative difference sets whose forbidden subgroup is nonabelian, and (6) a converse to Dillon's Dihedral Trick in the PDS setting. We hope this paper will lead to more techniques to explore this largely unexplored topic.</description>

      <title>Structure and linear-Pollyanna for some square-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use $P_t$ and $C_t$ to denote a path and a cycle on $t$ vertices, respectively. A {\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges, a {\em hammer} is a graph obtained by identifying an endvertex of a $P_3$ with a vertex of a triangle. A class ${\cal F}$ is $\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\chi(G)\leq f(\omega(G))$ for all induced subgraphs $G$ of a graph in ${\cal F}$. A class ${\cal C}$ of graphs is {\em Pollyanna} (resp. {\em linear-Pollyanna}) if ${\cal C}\cap {\cal F}$ is polynomially (resp. linear-polynomially) $\chi$-bounded for every $\chi$-bounded class ${\cal F}$ of graphs. Chudnovsky {\em et al} \cite{CCDO2023} showed that both the classes of bull-free graphs and hammer-free graphs are Pollyannas. Let $G$ be a connected graph with no clique cutsets and no universal cliques. In this paper, we show that $G$ is $(C_4$, hammer)-free if and only if it has girth at least 5, and $G$ is $(C_4$, bull)-free if and only if it is a clique blowup of some graph of girth at least 5. As a consequence, we show that both the classes of $(C_4$, bull)-free graphs and $(C_4$, hammer)-free graphs are linear-Pollyannas.</description>

      <title>The Redei-Berge function and related combinatorial Hopf algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stanley and Grinberg introduced the symmetric function associated to digraphs, called the Redei-Berge symmetric function. In [8] is shown that this symmetric function arises from a suitable structure of combinatorial Hopf algebra on digraphs. In this paper, we introduce two new combinatorial Hopf algebras of posets and permutations and define corresponding Redei-Berge functions for them. By using both theories, of symmetric functions and of combinatorial Hopf algebras, we prove many properties of the Redei-Berge function. These include some forms of deletion-contraction property, which make it similar to the chromatic symmetric function. We also find some invariants of digraphs that are detected by the Redei-Berge function.</description>

      <title>A generalization of the Hamiltonian cycle in dense digraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let D be a digraph and C be a cycle in D. For any two vertices x and y in D, the distance from x to y is the minimum length of a path from x to y. We denote the square of Let $D$ be a digraph and $C$ be a cycle in $D$. For any two vertices $x$ and $y$ in $D$, the distance from $x$ to $y$ is the minimum length of a path from $x$ to $y$. We denote the square of the cycle $C$ to be the graph whose vertex set is $V(C)$ and for distinct vertices $x$ and $y$ in $C$, there is an arc from $x$ to $y$ if and only if the distance from $x$ to $y$ in $C$ is at most $2$. The reverse square of the cycle $C$ is the digraph with the same vertex set as $C$, and the arc set $A(C)\cup \{yx: \mbox{the vertices}\ x, y\in V(C)\ \mbox{and the distance from $x$ to $y$ on $C$ is $2$}\}$. In this paper, we show that for any real number $\gamma&gt;0$ there exists a constant $n_0=n_0(\gamma)$, such that every digraph on $n\geq n_0$ vertices with the minimum in- and out-degree at least $(2/3+\gamma)n$ contains the reverse square of a Hamiltonian cycle. Our result extends a result of Czygrinow, Kierstead and Molla.</description>

      <title>Overlapping substitutions and tilings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by \cite{DBZ},we generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. For such a substitution, the substitution matrix may have non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector gives the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. We also show that the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such contradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of overlapping substitution. We finish by mentioning a construction of overlapping substitutions from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

      <title>The Music and Mathematics of Maximal Evenness in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the concept of electric potential energy from physics, the mathematical field of graph theory, and the notion of majorization to study maximal evenness in a broader mathematical context than what was previously possible, so that we can go beyond the well-known one-dimensional maximally even sets into higher dimensional and more geometrically complex territory. We investigate musical connections between certain generalizations of maximally even sets, one of the oldest Puerto Rican musical traditions of African origin called bomba, and with certain scales ranging from the familiar to the esoteric.</description>

      <title>Maximal evenness in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define various notions of energy of a set of vertices in a graph, which generalize two of the most widely studied graphical indices: the Wiener index and the Harary index. We prove several theorems indicating that these notions of energy can be used to measure how evenly spread out a set of vertices is. For example, in one setting, a set of vertices of a cycle has minimal energy among all sets of vertices of equal size if and only if it is maximally even, as defined in Clough and Douthett's work on music theory. Generalizing a theorem of Clough and Douthett, we prove that a finite, simple, connected graph is distance degree regular if and only if whenever a set of vertices has minimal energy, its complement also has minimal energy. We provide several characterizations of sets of vertices in finite paths and cycles which have maximal Wiener index. For both finite paths and cycles, we prove that a set $A$ of vertices has maximal Wiener index, among all sets of the same size, if and only if swapping out any member of $A$ with some adjacent vertex not in $A$ never leads to a set with a strictly larger Wiener index; as a consequence, on paths and cycles, the usual gradient ascent algorithm provably produces a global maximizer. Furthermore, generalizing a theorem of Jiang, we prove that a set of vertices in a cycle has maximal Wiener index if and only if it satisfies a certain balanced condition.</description>

      <title>Towards Characterization of 5-List-Colorability of Toroidal Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through computer-assisted enumeration, we list minimal obstructions for 5-choosability of graphs on the torus with the following additional property: There exists a cyclic system of non-contractible triangles around the torus where the consecutive triangles are at distance at most four. This condition is satisfied by all previously known obstructions, and we verify that there are no additional obstructions with this property. This supports the conjecture that a toroidal graph is 5-choosable if and only if it is 5-colorable.</description>

      <title>Toward resolving Kang and Park's generalization of the Alder-Andrews Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Alder-Andrews Theorem, a partition inequality generalizing Euler's partition identity, the first Rogers-Ramanujan identity, and a theorem of Schur to $d$-distinct partitions of $n$, was proved successively by Andrews in 1971, Yee in 2008, and Alfes, Jameson, and Lemke Oliver in 2010. While Andrews and Yee utilized $q$-series and combinatorial methods, Alfes et al. proved the finite number of remaining cases using asymptotics originating with Meinardus together with high-performance computing. In 2020, Kang and Park conjectured a "level $2$" Alder-Andrews type partition inequality which relates to the second Rogers-Ramanujan identity. Duncan, Khunger, the second author, and Tamura proved Kang and Park's conjecture for all but finitely many cases using a combinatorial shift identity. Here, we generalize the methods of Alfes et al. to resolve nearly all of the remaining cases of Kang and Park's conjecture.</description>

      <title>Tight Bounds for the Number of Absent Scattered Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A scattered factor of a word $w$ is a word $u$ that can be obtained by deleting arbitary letters from $w$ and keep the order of the remaining. Barker et al. introduced the notion of $k$-universality, calling a word $k$-universal, if it contains all possible words of length $k$ over a given alphabet $\Sigma$ as a scattered factor. Kosche et al. introduced the notion of absent scattered factors to categorise the words not being scattered factors of a given word.
  In this paper, we investigate tight bounds on the possible number of absent scattered factors of a given length $k$ (also strictly longer than the shortest absent scattered factors) among all words with the same universality extending the results of Kosche et al. Specifically, given a length $k$ and universality index $\iota$, we characterize $\iota$-universal words with both the maximal and minimal number of absent scattered factors of length $k$. For the lower bound, we provide the exact number in a closed form. For the upper bound, we offer efficient algorithms to compute the number based on the constructed words. Moreover, by combining old results, we present an enumeration with constant delay of the set of scattered factors of a fixed length in time $O(|\Sigma||w|)$.</description>

      <title>Rollercoasters with Plateaus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the problem of detecting, counting, and enumerating (generating) all maximum length plateau-$k$-rollercoasters appearing as a subsequence of some given word (sequence, string), while allowing for plateaus. We define a plateau-$k$-rollercoaster as a word consisting of an alternating sequence of (weakly) increasing and decreasing \emph{runs}, with each run containing at least $k$ \emph{distinct} elements, allowing the run to contain multiple copies of the same symbol consecutively. This differs from previous work, where runs within rollercoasters have been defined only as sequences of distinct values. Here, we are concerned with rollercoasters of \emph{maximum} length embedded in a given word $w$, that is, the longest rollercoasters that are a subsequence of $w$.
  We present algorithms allowing us to determine the longest plateau-$k$-roller\-coasters appearing as a subsequence in any given word $w$ of length $n$ over an alphabet of size $\sigma$ in $O(n \sigma k)$ time, to count the number of plateau-$k$-rollercoasters in $w$ of maximum length in $O(n \sigma k)$ time, and to output all of them with $O(n)$ delay after $O(n \sigma k)$ preprocessing. Furthermore, we present an algorithm to determine the longest common plateau-$k$-rollercoaster within a set of words in $O(N k \sigma)$ where $N$ is the product of all word lengths within the set.</description>

Abstract: We give series solutions to single insertion place propagator-type systems of Dyson--Schwinger equations using binary tubings of rooted trees. These solutions are combinatorially transparent in the sense that each tubing has a straightforward contribution. The Dyson--Schwinger equations solved here are more general than those previously solved by chord diagram techniques, including systems and non-integer values of the insertion parameter $s$. We remark on interesting combinatorial connections and properties.</description>

      <title>On Degeneracy in the P-Matroid Oriented Matroid Complementarity Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.14585v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Klaus showed that the Oriented Matroid Complementarity Problem (OMCP) can be solved by a reduction to the problem of sink-finding in a unique sink orientation (USO) if the input is promised to be given by a non-degenerate extension of a P-matroid. In this paper, we investigate the effect of degeneracy on this reduction. On the one hand, this understanding of degeneracies allows us to prove a linear lower bound on the number of vertex evaluations required for sink-finding in P-matroid USOs, the set of USOs obtainable through Klaus' reduction. On the other hand, it allows us to adjust Klaus' reduction to also work with degenerate instances. Furthermore, we introduce a total search version of the P-Matroid Oriented Matroid Complementarity Problem (P-OMCP). Given any extension of any oriented matroid M, by reduction to a total search version of USO sink-finding we can either solve the OMCP, or provide a polynomial-time verifiable certificate that M is not a P-matroid. This places the total search version of the P-OMCP in the complexity class Unique End of Potential Line (UEOPL).</description>

      <title>Independent coalition in graphs: existence and characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.02079v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An independent coalition in a graph $G$ consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_1$ and $V_2$ neither of which is an independent dominating set but whose union $V_1 \cup V_2$ is an independent dominating set. An independent coalition partition, abbreviated, $ic$-partition, in a graph $G$ is a vertex partition $\pi= \lbrace V_1,V_2,\dots ,V_k \rbrace$ such that each set $V_i$ of $\pi$ either is a singleton dominating set, or is not an independent dominating set but forms an independent coalition with another set $V_j \in \pi$.
  The maximum number of classes of an $ic$-partition of $G$ is the independent coalition number of $G$, denoted by $IC(G)$. In this paper we study the concept of $ic$-partition. In particular, we discuss the possibility of the existence of $ic$-partitions in graphs and introduce a family of graphs for which no $ic$-partition exists. We also determine the independent coalition number of some classes of graphs and investigate graphs $G$ of order $n$ with $IC(G)\in\{1,2,3,4,n\}$ and the trees $T$ of order $n$ with $IC(T)=n-1$.</description>

      <title>Friezes over $\mathbb Z[\sqrt{2}]$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A frieze on a polygon is a map from the diagonals of the polygon to an integral domain which respects the Ptolemy relation. Conway and Coxeter previously studied positive friezes over $\mathbb{Z}$ and showed that they are in bijection with triangulations of a polygon. We extend their work by studying friezes over $\mathbb Z[\sqrt{2}]$ and their relationships to dissections of polygons. We largely focus on the characterization of unitary friezes that arise from dissecting a polygon into triangles and quadrilaterals. We identify a family of dissections that give rise to unitary friezes and conjecture that this gives a complete classification of dissections which admit a unitary frieze.</description>

      <title>Percolated stochastic block model via EM algorithm and belief propagation with non-backtracking spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16502v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Whereas Laplacian and modularity based spectral clustering is apt to dense graphs, recent results show that for sparse ones, the non-backtracking spectrum is the best candidate to find assortative clusters of nodes. Here belief propagation in the sparse stochastic block model is derived with arbitrary given model parameters that results in a non-linear system of equations; with linear approximation, the spectrum of the non-backtracking matrix is able to specify the number $k$ of clusters. Then the model parameters themselves can be estimated by the EM algorithm. Bond percolation in the assortative model is considered in the following two senses: the within- and between-cluster edge probabilities decrease with the number of nodes and edges coming into existence in this way are retained with probability $\beta$. As a consequence, the optimal $k$ is the number of the structural real eigenvalues (greater than $\sqrt{c}$, where $c$ is the average degree) of the non-backtracking matrix of the graph. Assuming, these eigenvalues $\mu_1 &gt;\dots &gt; \mu_k$ are distinct, the multiple phase transitions obtained for $\beta$ are $\beta_i =\frac{c}{\mu_i^2}$; further, at $\beta_i$ the number of detectable clusters is $i$, for $i=1,\dots ,k$. Inflation-deflation techniques are also discussed to classify the nodes themselves, which can be the base of the sparse spectral clustering.</description>

      <title>Erd\H os--Ko--Rado type results for partitions via spread approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address several Erd\H os--Ko--Rado type questions for families of partitions. Two partitions of $[n]$ are {\it $t$-intersecting} if they share at least $t$ parts, and are {\it partially $t$-intersecting} if some of their parts intersect in at least $t$ elements. The question of what is the largest family of pairwise $t$-intersecting partitions was studied for several classes of partitions: Peter Erd\H os and Sz\'ekely studied partitions of $[n]$ into $\ell$ parts of unrestricted size; Ku and Renshaw studied unrestricted partitions of $[n]$; Meagher and Moura, and then Godsil and Meagher studied partitions into $\ell$ parts of equal size. We improve and generalize the results proved by these authors. Meagher and Moura, following the work of Erd\H os and Sz\'ekely, introduced the notion of partially $t$-intersecting partitions, and conjectured, what should be the largest partially $t$-intersecting family of partitions into $\ell$ parts of equal size $k$. The main result of this paper is the proof of their conjecture for all $t, k$, provided $\ell$ is sufficiently large. All our results are applications of the spread approximation technique, introduced by Zakharov and the author. In order to use it, we need to refine some of the theorems from the original paper. As a byproduct, this makes the present paper a self-contained presentation of the spread approximation technique for $t$-intersecting problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We conjecture that the distribution of the edge-disjoint union of two random regular graphs on the same vertex set is asymptotically equivalent to a random regular graph of the combined degree, provided it grows as the number of vertices tends to infinity. We verify this conjecture for the cases when the graphs are sufficiently dense or sparse. We also prove an asymptotic formula for the expected number of spanning regular subgraphs in a random regular graph.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues and spanning trees with constrained degree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study some spanning trees with bounded degree and leaf degree from eigenvalues. For any integer $k\geq2$, a $k$-tree is a spanning tree in which every vertex has degree no more than $k$. Let $T$ be a spanning tree of a connected graph. The leaf degree of $T$ is the maximum number of end-vertices attached to $v$ in $T$ for any $v\in V(T)$. By referring to the technique shown in [Eigenvalues and $[a,b]$-factors in regular graphs, J. Graph Theory. 100 (2022) 458-469], for an $r$-regular graph $G$, we provide an upper bound for the fourth largest adjacency eigenvalue of $G$ to guarantee the existence of a $k$-tree. Moreover, for a $t$-connected graph, we prove a tight sufficient condition for the existence of a spanning tree with leaf degree at most $k$ in terms of spectral radius. This generalizes a result of Theorem 1.5 in [Spectral radius and spanning trees of graphs, Discrete Math. 346 (2023) 113400]. Finally, for a general graph $G$, we present two sufficient conditions for the existence of a spanning tree with leaf degree at most $k$ via the Laplacian eigenvalues of $G$ and the spectral radius of the complement of $G$, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19271v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $G$ is $k$-locally sparse if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$, the subgraph induced by its neighborhood contains at most $k$ edges. Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov showed that for $f &gt; 0$ if a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ is $\Delta^2/f$-locally-sparse, then $\chi(G) = O\left(\Delta/\log f\right)$. We introduce a more general notion of local sparsity by defining graphs $G$ to be $(k, F)$-locally-sparse for some graph $F$ if for each vertex $v \in V(G)$ the subgraph induced by the neighborhood of $v$ contains at most $k$ copies of $F$. Employing the R\"{o}dl nibble method, we prove the following generalization of the above result: for every bipartite graph $F$, if $G$ is $(k, F)$-locally-sparse, then $\chi(G) = O\left( \Delta /\log\left(\Delta k^{-1/|V(F)|}\right)\right)$. This improves upon results of Davies, Kang, Pirot, and Sereni who consider the case when $F$ is a path. Our results also recover the best known bound on $\chi(G)$ when $G$ is $K_{1, t, t}$-free for $t \geq 4$, and hold for list and correspondence coloring in the more general so-called ''color-degree'' setting.</description>

      <title>Hecke algebra action on twisted motivic Chern classes and K-theoretic stable envelopes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.12746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a linear semisimple algebraic group and $B$ its Borel subgroup. Let $\mathbb{T}\subset B$ be the maximal torus. We study the inductive construction of Bott-Samelson varieties to obtain recursive formulas for the twisted motivic Chern classes of Schubert cells in $G/B$. To this end we introduce two families of operators acting on the equivariant K-theory $K_\mathbb{T}(G/B)[y]$, the right and left Demazure-Lusztig operators depending on a parameter. The twisted motivic Chern classes coincide (up to normalization) with the K-theoretic stable envelopes. Our results imply wall-crossing formulas for a change of the weight chamber and slope parameters. The right and left operators generate a twisted double Hecke algebra. We show that in the type $A$ this algebra acts on the Laurent polynomials. This action is a natural lift of the action on $K_\mathbb{T}(G/B)[y]$ with respect to the Kirwan map. We show that the left and right twisted Demazure-Lusztig operators provide a recursion for twisted motivic Chern classes of matrix Schubert varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.12288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the log-Sobolev inequalities to R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities by replacing the entropy with the two-parameter entropy, which is a generalized version of entropy and closely related to R\'enyi divergences. We derive the sharp nonlinear dimension-free version of this kind of inequalities. Interestingly, the resultant inequalities show a transition phenomenon depending on the parameters. We then connect R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities to contractive and data-processing inequalities, concentration inequalities, and spectral graph theory. Our proofs in this paper are based on the information-theoretic characterization of the R\'enyi--Sobolev inequalities, as well as the method of types.</description>

      <title>Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields IV: an application to the Geometric Ramsey Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06649v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the fourth and the last part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the Geometric Ramsey Conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we proof a conjecture of Graham on the Remsey properties for spherical configurations in the finite field setting. To be more precise, we show that for any spherical configuration $X$ of $\mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ of complexity at most $C$ with $d$ being sufficiently large with respect to $C$ and $\vert X\vert$, and for some prime $p$ being sufficiently large with respect to $C$, $\vert X\vert$ and $\epsilon&gt;0$, any set $E\subseteq \mathbb{F}_{p}^{d}$ with $\vert E\vert&gt;\epsilon p^{d}$ contains at least $\gg_{C,\epsilon,\vert X\vert}p^{(k+1)d-(k+1)k/2}$ congruent copies of $X$, where $k$ is the dimension of $\text{span}_{\mathbb{F}_{p}}(X-X)$. The novelty of our approach is that we avoid the use of harmonic analysis, and replace it by the theory of spherical higher order Fourier analysis developed in previous parts of the series.</description>

      <title>Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields II: additive combinatorics for shifted ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06650v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of the series "Spherical higher order Fourier analysis over finite fields", aiming to develop the higher order Fourier analysis method along spheres over finite fields, and to solve the geometric Ramsey conjecture in the finite field setting.
  In this paper, we study additive combinatorial properties for shifted modules, i.e. the structure of sets of the form $E\hat{+} E$, where $E$ is a collection of shifted modules of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{R}[x_{1},\dots,x_{d}]$ and we identify two modules if their difference contains the zero polynomial. We show that under appropriate definitions, the set $E\hat{+} E$ enjoys properties similar to the conventional setting where $E$ is a subset of an abelian group. In particular, among other results, we prove the Balog-Gowers-Szemer\'edi theorem, the Rusza's quasi triangle inequality and a weak form of the Pl\"unnecke-Rusza theorem in the setting of shifted modules. We also show that for a special class of maps $\xi$ from $\mathbb{Z}_{K}^{d}$ to the collection of all shifted modules of $\mathbb{R}[x_{1},\dots,x_{d}]$, if the set $\xi(\mathbb{Z}_{K}^{d})+\xi(\mathbb{Z}_{K}^{d})$ has large additive energy, then $\xi$ is an almost linear Freiman homomorphism. This result is the crucial additive combinatorial input we need to prove the spherical Gowers inverse theorem in later parts of the series.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.13457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new framework for establishing approximate factorization of entropy on arbitrary probability spaces, using a geometric notion known as non-negative sectional curvature. The resulting estimates are equivalent to entropy subadditivity and generalized Brascamp-Lieb inequalities, and provide a sharp modified log-Sobolev inequality for the Gibbs sampler of several particle systems in both continuous and discrete settings. The method allows us to obtain simple proofs of known results, as well as some new inequalities. We illustrate this through various applications, including discrete Gaussian free fields on arbitrary networks, the down-up walk on uniform $n$-sets, the uniform measure over permutations, and the uniform measure on the unit sphere in $\R^n$. Our method also yields a simple, coupling-based proof of the celebrated logarithmic Sobolev inequality for Langevin diffusions in a convex potential, which is one of the most emblematic applications of the Bakry-\'Emery criterion.</description>
