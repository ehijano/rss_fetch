      <title>Magnetic Webs in Stellar Radiative Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rotational evolution of stellar radiative zones is an old puzzle. We argue that angular momentum (AM) transport by turbulent processes induced by differential rotation is insufficient, and propose that a key role is played by ``magnetic webs." We define magnetic webs as stable magnetic configurations that enforce corotation of their coupled mass shells. Stable magnetic configurations naturally form through relaxation of helical magnetic fields deposited in parts of radiative zones. We discuss the conditions for a magnetic configuration to be sufficiently sturdy to prevent the build up of differential rotation, and conclude that these conditions are easily met in stellar interiors. Low mass stars on the red giant branch (RGB) likely have their compact cores coupled to the lower part of their extended radiative mantle by a magnetic web that was deposited by the receding zone of core convection on the main sequence. This results in moderate core rotation that is broadly consistent with asteroseismic observations, as we illustrate with a stellar evolution model with mass $1.6M_\odot$. Evolving massive stars host more complicated patterns of convective zones that may leave behind many webs, transporting AM towards the surface. Efficient web formation likely results in most massive stars dying with magnetized and slowly rotating cores.</description>

      <title>Modelling the emergence and evolution of the rotation-activity relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Main-sequence stars follow a well-defined rotation-activity relation. There are two primary regimes: saturated, where the fractional X-ray luminosity $\log(L_{\rm X}/L_*)$ is approximately constant, and unsaturated, where the fractional X-ray luminosity decreases with increasing Rossby number (or decreasing rotation rate). Pre-main sequence (PMS) stars have a larger scatter in $\log(L_{\rm X}/L_*)$ than main-sequence stars, are observed to have saturated levels of X-ray emission, and do not follow the rotation-activity relation. We investigate how PMS stars evolve in the rotation-activity plane and the timescale over which the X-ray rotation-activity relation emerges. Using observational data of $\sim$600 stars from four PMS clusters, stellar internal structure models, a rotational evolution model, and observed X-ray luminosity trends with age, we simulate the evolution of the PMS stars in the rotation-activity plane up to ages of 100 Myr. Our model reproduces the rotation-activity relation found for main-sequence stars, with higher-mass stars beginning to form the unsaturated regime from around 10 Myr. After $\sim$25 Myr, the gradient of the unsaturated regime matches that found for main-sequence stars. For stars of mass greater than 0.6 M$_{\odot}$, the maximum age by which a star has left the saturated regime correlates with when the star leaves the PMS. We find that an intra-cluster age spread is a key factor in contributing to the observed scatter in $\log(L_{\rm X}/L_*)$, particularly for ages &lt; 10 Myr.</description>

      <title>Revealing a main-sequence star that consumed a planet with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subluminous red nova (SLRN) ZTF SLRN-2020 is the most compelling direct detection of a planet being consumed by its host star, a scenario known as a planetary engulfment event. We present JWST spectroscopy of ZTF SLRN-2020 taken +830 d after its optical emission peak using the NIRSpec fixed-slit $3-5$ $\mu$m high-resolution grating and the MIRI $5-12$ $\mu$m low-resolution spectrometer. NIRSpec reveals the $^{12}$CO fundamental band ($\nu=1-0$) in emission at $\sim4.7$ $\mu$m, Brackett-$\alpha$ emission, and the potential detection of PH$_3$ in emission at $\sim4.3$ $\mu$m. The JWST spectra are consistent with the claim that ZTF SLRN-2020 arose from a planetary engulfment event. We utilize DUSTY to model the late-time $\sim1-12$ $\mu$m spectral energy distribution (SED) of ZTF SLRN-2020, where the best-fit parameters indicate the presence of warm, $720^{+80}_{-50}$ K, circumstellar dust with a total dust mass of Log$\left(\frac{M_\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{M}_\odot}\right)=-10.61^{+0.08}_{-0.16}$ M$_\odot$. We also fit a DUSTY model to archival photometry taken +320 d after peak that suggested the presence of a cooler, T$_\mathrm{d}=280^{+450}_{-20}$ K, and more massive, Log$\left(\frac{M_\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{M}_\odot}\right)=-5.89^{+0.29}_{-3.21}$, circumstellar dust component. Assuming the cool component originates from the ZTF SLRN-2020 ejecta, we interpret the warm component as fallback from the ejecta. From the late-time SED model we measure a luminosity of L$_* = 0.29^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$ L$_\odot$ for the remnant host star, which is consistent with a $\sim0.7$ M$_\odot$ K-type star that should not yet have evolved off the main sequence. If ZTF SLRN-2020 was not triggered by stellar evolution, we suggest that the planetary engulfment was due to orbital decay from tidal interactions between the planet and the host star.</description>

      <title>MHD simulations of the slow-rise phase of solar eruptions initiated from a sheared magnetic arcade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Before solar eruptions, a short-term slow-rise phase is often observed, during which the pre-eruption structure ascends at speeds much greater than the photospheric motions but much less than those of the eruption phase. Numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the coronal evolution driven by photospheric motions up to eruptions have been used to explain the slow-rise phase, but their bottom driving speeds are much larger than realistic photospheric values. Therefore, it remains an open question how the excessively fast bottom driving impacts the slow-rise phase. Here we modelled the slow-rise phase before eruption initiated from a continuously sheared magnetic arcade. In particular, we performed a series of experiments with the bottom driving speed unprecedentedly approaching the photospheric value of around $1$ km s$^{-1}$. The simulations confirmed that the slow-rise phase is an ideal MHD process, i.e., a manifestation of the growing expansion of the sheared arcade in the process of approaching a fully open field state. The overlying field line above the core flux has a slow-rise speed modulated by the driving speed's magnitude but is always over an order of magnitude larger than the driving speed. The core field also expands with speed much higher than the driving speed but much lower than that of the overlying field. By incrementally reducing the bottom-driving speed to realistic photospheric values, we anticipate better matches between the simulated slow-rise speeds and some observed ones.</description>

      <title>The birth of Be star disks I. From localized ejection to circularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical Be stars are well known to eject mass, but the details governing the initial distribution and evolution of this matter into a disk are poorly constrained by observations. By combining high-cadence spectroscopy with contemporaneous space photometry from TESS, we have sampled about 30 mass ejection events in 13 Be stars. Our goal is to constrain the geometrical and kinematic properties of the ejecta, facilitating the investigation into the initial conditions and evolution, and understanding its interactions with preexisting material. The photometric variability is analyzed together with measurements of the rapidly changing emission features to identify the onset of outburst events and obtain information about the geometry of the ejecta and its evolution. All Be stars observed with sufficiently high cadence exhibit rapid oscillations of line asymmetry with a single frequency in the days following the start of the event. The emission asymmetry cycles break down after roughly 5 - 10 cycles, with the emission line profile converging toward approximate symmetry. In photometry, several frequencies typically emerge at relatively high amplitude at some point during the mass ejection process. In all observed cases, freshly ejected material was initially within a narrow azimuthal range, indicating it was launched from a localized region on the star. The material orbits the star with a frequency consistent with the near-surface Keplerian orbital frequency. This material circularizes into a disk configuration after several orbital timescales. This is true whether or not there was a preexisting disk. We find no evidence for precursor phases prior to the ejection of mass in our sample. The several photometric frequencies that emerge during outburst are at least partially stellar in origin. (Abstract abridged)</description>

      <title>Quasi-Periodic Pulsations in Ionospheric TEC Synchronized with Solar Flare EUV Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray radiation emitted during solar flares has been shown to significantly increase the electron density of the Earth's ionosphere. During flares, quasi-periodic pulsations (QPPs) in X-ray flux originating in the corona have previously been linked to subsequent pulsations in the Earth's ionospheric D-region. Similar pulsations have been detected in chromospheric EUV emission, although their impact on the Earth's ionosphere has not previously been investigated. Here, for the first time, synchronous pulsations were detected in solar EUV emission and ionospheric Total Electron Content (TEC) measurements. Using wavelet and periodogram analysis, we detect QPPs with approximately 85 second periods in chromospheric EUV emission lines (He II 304 \AA{}, C III 977 \AA{} and H I 972 \AA{}) from the Solar Dynamics Observatory Extreme Ultraviolet Variability Experiment (SDO/EVE) during the impulsive phase of an X5.4 flare on March 7, 2012. These lines contribute to ionization in the ionospheric E- and F-regions, resulting in subsequent variations of electron density with the same periodicity, which was detected in TEC measurements. This work demonstrates that the Earth's ionosphere is responsive to fine-scale fluctuations in EUV emission during flares, with a time delay of approximately 30 seconds found. These findings may have applications in atmospheric modelling and solar-terrestrial studies, including the calculation of ionospheric recombination rates.</description>

      <title>Double White Dwarf Tides with Multi-messenger Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Short-period Galactic double white dwarf (DWD) systems will be observable both in visible light through photometric monitoring and in mHz-range gravitational waves (GWs) with forthcoming space-based laser interferometry such as LISA. When only photometric variability is used to measure DWD intrinsic properties, there is a degeneracy between the chirp mass and binary tidal interaction, as orbital frequency time derivative is set by both GW radiation and tides. Without expensive radial velocity data from spectroscopic monitoring, this degeneracy may be lifted in principle by directly measuring the second time derivative of the orbital frequency through photometric monitoring over an ultra-long time baseline. Alternatively, the degeneracy can be removed by exploiting information in both photometric variability and the coherent GW waveform. Investigating both approaches, we find that direct measurement of the second time derivative is likely infeasible for most DWDs, while the multi-messenger method will disentangle measurements of the chirp mass and the binary moments of inertia, for a large sample of tidally locked systems. The latter information will enable empirical tests of WD structure models with finite temperature effects.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of magnetized turbulence in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) of our Galaxy is magnetized, compressible and turbulent, influencing many key ISM properties, like star formation, cosmic ray transport, and metal and phase mixing. Yet, basic statistics describing compressible, magnetized turbulence remain uncertain. Utilizing grid resolutions up to $10,080^3$ cells, we simulate highly-compressible, magnetized ISM-style turbulence with a magnetic field maintained by a small-scale dynamo. We measure two coexisting kinetic energy cascades, $\mathcal{E}_{{\rm kin}}(k) \propto k^{-n}$, in the turbulence, separating the plasma into scales that are non-locally interacting, supersonic and weakly magnetized $(n=2.01\pm 0.03\approx 2)$ and locally interacting, subsonic and highly magnetized $(n=1.465\pm 0.002\approx 3/2)$, where $k$ is the wavenumber. We show that the $3/2$ spectrum can be explained with scale-dependent kinetic energy fluxes and velocity-magnetic field alignment. On the highly magnetized modes, the magnetic energy spectrum forms a local cascade $(n=1.798\pm 0.001\approx 9/5)$, deviating from any known \textit{ab initio} theory. With a new generation of radio telescopes coming online, these results provide a means to directly test if the ISM in our Galaxy is maintained by the compressible turbulent motions from within it.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study of Thermonuclear X-ray Bursts from 4U 1820-30 with NICER: Accretion Disk Interactions and a Candidate Burst Oscillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the results obtained from timing and spectral studies of 15 thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 1820-30 observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) during its five years of observations between 2017-2022. All bursts showed clear signs of photospheric radius expansion, where the neutron star (NS) photosphere expanded more than 50 km above the surface. One of the bursts produced a super-expansion with a blackbody emission radius of 902 km for the first time with NICER. We searched for burst oscillations in all 15 bursts and found evidence of a coherent oscillation at 716 Hz in a burst, with a 2.9$\sigma$ detection level based on Monte Carlo simulations. If confirmed with future observations, 4U 1820-30 would become the fastest-spinning NS known in X-ray binary systems. The fractional rms amplitude of the candidate burst oscillation was found to be 5.8% in the energy range of 3-10 keV. Following the variable persistent model from burst time-resolved spectroscopy, an anti-correlation is seen between the maximum scaling factor value and the (pre-burst) persistent flux. We detected a low value of ionization at the peak of each burst based on reflection modeling of burst spectra. A partially interacting inner accretion disk or a weakly ionized outer disk may cause the observed ionization dip during the photospheric radius expansion phase.</description>

      <title>On the Origin of Spectral Features Observed during Thermonuclear X-ray Bursts and in the Aftermath Emission of a Long Burst from 4U 1820-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study 15 thermonuclear X-ray bursts from 4U 1820--30 observed with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). We find evidence of a narrow emission line at 1.0 keV and three absorption lines at 1.7, 3.0, and 3.75 keV, primarily around the photospheric radius expansion phase of most bursts. The 1.0 keV emission line remains constant, while the absorption features, attributed to wind-ejected species, are stable but show slight energy shifts, likely due to combined effects of Doppler and gravitational redshifts. We also examine with NICER the ``aftermath'' of a long X-ray burst (a candidate superburst observed by MAXI) on 2021 August 23 and 24. The aftermath emission recovers within half a day from a flux depression. During this recovery phase, we detect two emission lines at 0.7 and 1 keV, along with three absorption lines whose energies decreased to 1.57, 2.64, and 3.64 keV. Given the nature of the helium white-dwarf companion, these absorption lines during the aftermath may originate from an accretion flow, but only if the accretion environment is significantly contaminated by nuclear ashes from the superburst. This provides evidence of temporary metal enhancement in the accreted material due to strong wind loss. Moreover, we suggest that the absorption features observed during the short X-ray bursts and in the superburst aftermath share a common origin in heavy nuclear ashes enriched with elements like Si, Ar, Ca, or Ti, either from the burst wind or from an accretion flow contaminated by the burst wind.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave signals from primordial black holes orbiting solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) with masses between $10^{14}$ and $10^{20}$ kg are candidates to contribute a substantial fraction of the total dark matter abundance. When in orbit around the center of a star, which can possibly be a completely interior orbit, such objects would emit gravitational waves, as predicted by general relativity. In this work, we examine the gravitational wave signals emitted by such objects when they orbit typical stars, such as the Sun. We show that the magnitude of the waves that could eventually be detected on Earth from a possible PBH orbiting the Sun or a neighboring Sun-like star within our galaxy can be significantly stronger than those originating from a PBH orbiting a denser but more distant neutron star (NS). Such signals may be detectable by the LISA gravitational-wave detector. In addition, we estimate the contribution that a large collection of such PBH-star systems would make to the stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) within a range of frequencies to which pulsar timing arrays are sensitive.</description>

Abstract: The near-infrared (NIR) emission of the youngest protostars still needs to be characterized to better understand the evolution of their accretion and ejection activity. We analyze James Webb Space Telescope NIRSpec 1.7 -- 5.3 $\mu$m observations of two deeply embedded sources in the S68N protostellar core in Serpens. The North Central (NC) source exhibits a highly obscured spectrum (A_K ~ 4.8 mag) that is modeled with a pre-main-sequence photosphere and a hot disk component. The photospheric parameters are consistent with a young, low-mass photosphere, as suggested by the low surface gravity, log g of 1.95 $\pm$ 0.15 cm s$^{-2}$. The hot disk suggests that accretion onto the central protostellar embryo is ongoing, although prototypical accretion-tracing emission lines HI are not detected. The South Central (SC) source, which is even more embedded (A_K ~ 8 mag; no continuum is detected shortward of 3.6 $\mu$m) appears to be driving the large-scale S68N protostellar outflow, and launches a collimated hot molecular jet detected in \Ht and CO ro-vibrational lines. Shock modeling of the \Ht (ro)vibrational lines establishes that fast $C$-type shocks ($\geq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), with high pre-shock density ($\geq$ $10^7$ cm$^{-3}$), and strong magnetic field (b ~ 3--10, where $B = b\,\times\,\sqrt{\textrm{n}_{\textrm{H}} (\textrm{cm}^{-3})}\,\mu\textrm{G}$) best match the data. The bright CO fundamental line forest suggests energetic excitation, with the contribution of non-LTE effects, ie irradiation pumping. Detected OH and CH$^{+}$ ro-vibrational lines support this hypothesis. These two Class 0 protostars seem to be in very young evolutionary stages and still have to acquire the bulk of their final stellar masses. These results demonstrate that JWST enables unprecedented diagnostics of these first stages of the protostellar evolutionary phase.</description>

      <title>Simulating Solar Neighborhood Brown Dwarfs I: The Luminosity Function Above and Below the Galactic Plane</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Brown dwarfs form the key, yet poorly understood, link between stellar and planetary astrophysics. These objects offer unique tests of Galactic structure, but observational limitations have inhibited their large-scale analysis to date. Major upcoming sky surveys will reveal unprecedented numbers of brown dwarfs, among even greater numbers of stellar objects, greatly enhancing the statistical study of brown dwarfs. To extract the comparatively rare brown dwarfs from these massive datasets, we must understand the parameter space they will occupy. In this work, we construct synthetic populations of brown dwarfs in the Solar Neighborhood to explore their evolutionary properties using Gaia-derived star formation histories alongside observational mass, metallicity, and age relationships. We apply the Sonora Bobcat, SM08, and Sonora Diamondback evolutionary models. From the populations, we explore the space densities and median ages by spectral type. We present the simulated luminosity function and its evolution with distance from the Galactic Plane. Our simulation shows that brown dwarf population statistics are a function of height above/below the Galactic Plane and sample different age distributions. Interpreting the local sample requires combining evolutionary models, the initial mass function, the star formation history, and kinematic heating. Our models are a guide to how well height-dependent samples can test these scenarios. Sub-populations of brown dwarfs farther from the Plane are older and occupy a different region of parameter space than younger sub-populations closer to the Galactic Plane. Therefore, fully exploring population statistics both near and far from the Plane is critical to prepare for upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Topological ignition of the stealth coronal mass ejections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of hot topics in the solar physics are the so-called 'stealth' coronal mass ejections (CME), which are not associated with any appreciable energy release events in the lower corona, such as the solar flares. It is often assumed recently that these phenomena might be produced by some specific physical mechanism, but no particular suggestions were put forward. It is the aim of the present paper to show that a promising explanation of the stealth CMEs can be based on the so-called 'topological' ignition of the magnetic reconnection, when the magnetic null point is produced by a specific superposition of the remote sources (sunspots) rather than by the local current systems. As follows from our numerical simulations, the topological model explains very well all basic features of the stealth CMEs: (i) the plasma eruption develops without an appreciable heat release from the spot of reconnection, i.e., without the solar flare; (ii) the spot of reconnection (magnetic null point) can be formed far away from the location of the magnetic field sources; (iii) the trajectories of eruption are usually strongly curved, which can explain observability of CMEs generated behind the solar limb.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Modeling of Planet and Substellar Atmosphere: High-Resolution Emission, Transmission, and Reflection Spectroscopy with ExoJAX2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling based on differentiable programming holds great promise for astronomy, as it can employ techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, gradient-based optimization, and other machine learning techniques. This new programming paradigm has motivated us to develop the first auto-differentiable spectrum model of exoplanets and brown dwarfs, ExoJAX (Kawahara et al. 2022). ExoJAX is designed to directly calculate cross-sections as functions of temperature and pressure, rather than interpolating tabulated data, to minimize errors in high-dispersion spectra modeling. However, its application was primarily proof-of-concept and limited to narrowband high-dispersion emission spectroscopy. In this paper, we have enhanced the differentiable opacity calculation using a new fast and memory-efficient algorithm, and have developed differentiable radiative transfer schemes, including emission, transmission, and reflection spectroscopy. These enhancements significantly expand the range of applications, as demonstrated through actual atmospheric retrievals: high-dispersion emission spectra of the brown dwarf GL229 B, medium-dispersion transmission spectra of the hot Saturn WASP-39 b from JWST, and high-dispersion reflection spectra of Jupiter. We obtained a C/O ratio for GL229 B consistent with its host star, constrained WASP-39 b's radial velocity from molecular fine structures at original resolution ($R \sim 3,000$), and estimated Jupiter's metallicity consistent with previous studies.</description>

      <title>DW Cnc: a micronova with a negative superhump and a flickering spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic accreting white dwarfs in cataclysmic variables have been known to show bursts driven by different physical mechanisms; however, the burst occurrence is much rarer than in their non-magnetic counterparts. DW Cnc is a well-studied intermediate polar that showed a burst with a 4-magnitude amplitude in 2007. Here we report on a recent burst in DW Cnc observed by ASAS-SN that reached a peak luminosity of 6.6 $\times$ 10$^{33}$ erg~s$^{-1}$, another 4 mag increase from its quiescent high state level. The released energy of the burst suggests that these are micronovae, a distinctive type of burst seen in magnetic systems that may be caused by a thermonuclear runaway in the confined accretion flow. Only a handful of systems, most of them intermediate polars, have a reported micronova bursts. We also report on the reappearance of the negative superhump of DW~Cnc as shown by TESS and OPTICAM data after the system emerges from its low state and immediately before the burst. We further report on a new phenomenon, where the spin signal turns "on" and "off" on the precession period associated with the negative superhump, which may indicate pole flipping. The new classification of DW Cnc as a micronova as well as the spin variability show the importance of both monitoring known micronova systems and systematic searches for more similar bursts, to limit reliance on serendipitous discoveries.</description>

      <title>Nearly a Decade of Groundbreaking Speckle Interferometry at the International Gemini Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10765v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Since its inception, speckle interferometry has revolutionized high-resolution astronomical imaging, overcoming atmospheric challenges to achieve the diffraction limits of telescopes. Almost a decade ago, in 2018, a pair of speckle cameras -- 'Alopeke and Zorro -- were installed at the twin 8.1-meter Gemini North and South telescopes, two of the largest apertures in the world, in Hawai'i and Chile. Equipped with dual blue and red channels, 'Alopeke and Zorro deliver high-resolution imaging across optical bandpasses from 350 to 1000 nm, which has led to crucial discoveries in both stellar multiplicity and exoplanetary science. Furthermore, the broad and nonrestrictive access to these instruments, given by each Gemini Observatory partner and via the US NOIRLab open skies policy, has allowed our community to expand the applications of the instruments, supporting a wide range of scientific investigations from Solar System bodies, to morphological studies of stellar remnants, to evolved stars, to transient phenomena. This paper reviews the instrument technology and observational capabilities, and highlights key scientific contributions and discoveries of 'Alopeke and Zorro, emphasizing the enduring importance of speckle interferometry in advancing modern observational astronomy and expanding the frontiers of astronomical research.</description>

      <title>Doppler Shifted Transient Sodium Detection by KECK/HIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We carried out the first high-resolution transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-49 Ab with Keck/HIRES. Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}}. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}} with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}} (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 \% (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>
