      <title>Ergodicity of 2D singular stochastic Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the 2D stochastic Navier--Stokes equations driven by noise that has the regularity of space-time white noise but doesn't exactly coincide with it. We show that, provided that the intensity of the noise is sufficiently weak at high frequencies, this systems admits uniform bounds in time, so that it has an invariant measure, for which we obtain stretched exponential tail bounds.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity and Mixing of Sublinear Expectation System and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize an ergodic theory framework to explore sublinear expectation theory. Specifically, we investigate the pointwise Birkhoff's ergodic theorem for invariant sublinear expectation systems. By further assuming that these sublinear expectation systems are ergodic, we derive stronger results. Furthermore, we relax the conditions for the law of large numbers and the strong law of large numbers under sublinear expectations from independent and identical distribution to $\alpha$-mixing. These results can be applied to a class of stochastic differential equations driven by $G$-Brownian motion (i.e., $G$-SDEs), such as $G$-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes.
  As byproducts, we also obtain a series of applications for classical ergodic theory and capacity theory.</description>

      <title>On a boundary of the central limit theorem for strictly stationary, reversible Markov chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the class of (functions of) strictly stationary Markov chains in which (i) the second moments are finite and (ii) absolute regularity (beta-mixing) is satisfied with exponential mixing rate. For (functions of) Markov chains in that class that are also reversible, the central limit theorem holds, as a well known byproduct of results of Roberts, Rosenthal, and Tweedie in two papers in 1997 and 2001 involving reversible Markov chains. In contrast, for (functions of) Markov chains in that class that are not reversible, the central limit theorem may fail to hold, as is known from counterexamples, including ones with arbitrarily fast mixing rate (for absolute regularity). Here it will be shown that for Markov chains in that class that are reversible, the``borderline'' class of mixing rates (for absolute regularity) for the central limit theorem is in fact exponential. That will be shown here with a class of counterexamples: strictly stationary, countable-state Markov chains that are reversible, have finite second moments, and satisfy absolute regularity with mixing rates that can be arbitrarily close to (but not quite) exponential, but fail to satisfy the central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically optimal Wasserstein couplings for the small-time stable domain of attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop two novel couplings between general pure-jump L\'evy processes in $\R^d$ and apply them to obtain upper bounds on the rate of convergence in an appropriate Wasserstein distance on the path space for a wide class of L\'evy processes attracted to a multidimensional stable process in the small-time regime. We also establish general lower bounds based on certain universal properties of slowly varying functions and the relationship between the Wasserstein and Toscani--Fourier distances of the marginals. Our upper and lower bounds typically have matching rates. In particular, the rate of convergence is polynomial for the domain of normal attraction and slower than a slowly varying function for the domain of non-normal attraction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the study of edge statistics of random band matrices, we investigate random walks on large $d$-dimensional periodic lattices, whose transition matrices are determined by discretized density functions. Under certain moment assumption on the density, we prove local limit theorems for random walks in three different regimes according to the bandwidth parameter, random walk length and torus size.</description>

      <title>Probability Versions of Li-Yau Type Inequalities and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using stochastic analysis, two probability versions of Li-Yau type inequalities are established for diffusion semigroups on a manifold possibly with (non-convex) boundary. The inequalities are explicitly given by the Bakry-Emery curvature-dimension, as well as the lower bound of the second fundamental form if the boundary exists. As applications, a number of global and local estimates are presented, which extend or improve existing ones derived for manifolds without boundary. Compared with the maximum principle technique developed in the literature, the probabilistic argument we used is more straightforward and hence considerably simpler.</description>

Abstract: We derive asymptotic expansions for the probability density function of the product of two correlated normal random variables with non-zero means and arbitrary variances, and more generally the sum of independent copies of such random variables. As a consequence, we obtain asymptotic expansions for the tail probabilities, as well as asymptotic approximations for the quantile function.</description>

      <title>Diffusion of the random Lorentz process in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider the motion of a charged, point particle moving in the complement of a Poisson distribution of hard sphere scatterers in two dimensions under the effect of a fixed magnetic field. Building on, and extending a coupling method established by the authors, we show that this 'magnetic Lorentz gas' satisfies an invariance principle in an intermediate scaling limit. That is, we apply the low-density (Boltzmann-Grad) limit and simultaneously take the limit as time goes to infinity, then prove convergence of the rescaled trajectory to a Brownian motion in this limit.</description>

Abstract: This paper concerns the numerical approximation for the invariant distribution of Markovian switching L\'evy-driven stochastic differential equations. By combining the tamed-adaptive Euler-Maruyama scheme with the Multi-level Monte Carlo method, we propose an approximation scheme that can be applied to stochastic differential equations with super-linear growth drift and diffusion coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define Poisson genericity for infinite sequences in any finite or countable alphabet with an invariant exponentially-mixing probability measure. A sequence is Poisson generic if the number of occurrences of blocks of symbols asymptotically follows a Poisson law as the block length increases. We prove that almost all sequences are Poisson generic. Our result generalizes Peres and Weiss' theorem about Poisson genericity of integral bases numeration systems. In particular, we obtain that their continued fraction expansions for almost all real numbers are Poisson generic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we solve stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) numerically by using (possibly random) neural networks in the truncated Wiener chaos expansion of their corresponding solution. Moreover, we provide some approximation rates for learning the solution of SPDEs with additive and/or multiplicative noise. Finally, we apply our results in numerical examples to approximate the solution of three SPDEs: the stochastic heat equation, the Heath-Jarrow-Morton equation, and the Zakai equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper studies asymptotic properties of estimators of multidimensional stochastic differential equations driven by Brownian motions from high-frequency discrete data. Consistency and central limit properties of a class of estimators of the diffusion parameter and an approximate maximum likelihood estimator of the drift parameter based on a discretized likelihood function have been established in a suitable scaling regime involving the time-gap between the observations and the overall time span. Our framework is more general than that typically considered in the literature and, thus, has the potential to be applicable to a wider range of stochastic models.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Self-Organization in Fixed-Magnetization Particle Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hierarchical sorting is a fundamental task for programmable matter, inspired by the spontaneous formation of interfaces and membranes in nature. The task entails particles of different types, present in fixed densities, sorting into corresponding regions of a space that are themselves organized. By analyzing the Gibbs distribution of a general fixed-magnetization model of equilibrium statistical mechanics, we prove that particles moving stochastically according to local affinities solve the hierarchical sorting task. The analysis of fixed-magnetization models is notoriously difficult, and approaches that have led to recent breakthroughs in sampling the low-temperature regime only work in the variable-magnetization setting by default. To overcome this barrier, we introduce a new approach for comparing the partition functions of fixed- and variable-magnetization models. The core technique identifies a special class of configurations that contribute comparably to the two partition functions, which then serves as a bridge between the fixed- and variable-magnetization settings. Our main result is an estimate of the Gibbs distribution that unifies existing and new results for models at fixed magnetization, including the Ising, Potts, and Blume--Capel models, and leads to stochastic distributed algorithms for hierarchical sorting and other self-organizing tasks, like compression and separation.</description>

Abstract: We apply Principal Component Analysis for zero-coupon Treasury bonds to get level, slope, and curvature series. We model these as autoregressions of order 1, and analyze their innovations. For slope, but not for level and curvature, dividing these innovations by the Volatility Index VIX made for Standard \&amp; Poor 500 makes them closer to independent identically distributed normal. We state and prove stability results for bond returns based on this observation. We chose zero-coupon as opposed to classic coupon Treasury bonds because it is much easier to compute returns for these.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a uniform-in-time estimate for the mean-field convergence of the Consensus-Based Optimization (CBO) algorithm by rescaling the consensus point in the dynamics with a small parameter $\kappa \in (0,1)$. This uniform-in-time estimate is essential, as CBO convergence relies on a sufficiently large time horizon and is crucial for ensuring stable, reliable long-term convergence, the latter being key to the practical effectiveness of CBO methods.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the diffusive scaling of the Lorentz gas in the presence of an external force of mean-field type. In the weak coupling regime and for diffusive time scales, the test particle's law converges to the probability density satisfying the heat equation.

      <title>Probabilistic Voting Models with Varying Speeds of Correlation Decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.13360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We model voting behaviour in the multi-group setting of a two-tier voting system using sequences of de Finetti measures. Our model is defined by using the de Finetti representation of a probability measure (i.e. as a mixture of conditionally independent probability measures) describing voting behaviour. The de Finetti measure describes the interaction between voters and possible outside influences on them. We assume that for each population size there is a (potentially) different de Finetti measure, and as the population grows, the sequence of de Finetti measures converges weakly to the Dirac measure at the origin, representing a tendency toward weakening social cohesion as the population grows large. The resulting model covers a wide variety of behaviour, ranging from independent voting in the limit under fast convergence, a critical convergence speed with its own pattern of behaviour, to a subcritical convergence speed which yields a model in line with empirical evidence of real-world voting data, contrary to previous probabilistic models used in the study of voting. These models can be used, e.g., to study the problem of optimal voting weights in two-tier voting systems.</description>

      <title>Dynamical random field Ising model at zero temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the evolution of the zero-temperature random field Ising model as the mean of the external field $M$ increases from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. We focus on two types of evolutions: the ground state evolution and the Glauber evolution. For the ground state evolution, we investigate the occurrence of global avalanche, a moment where a large fraction of spins flip simultaneously from minus to plus. In two dimensions, no global avalanche occurs, while in three or higher dimensions, there is a phase transition: a global avalanche happens when the noise intensity is small, but not when it is large. Additionally, we study the zero-temperature Glauber evolution, where spins are updated locally to minimize the Hamiltonian. Our results show that for small noise intensity, in dimensions $d =2$ or $3$, most spins flip around a critical time $c_d = \frac{2 \sqrt{d}}{1 + \sqrt{d}}$ (but we cannot decide whether such flipping occurs simultaneously or not). We also connect this process to polluted bootstrap percolation and solve an open problem on it.</description>

      <title>Models of Opinion Dynamics with Random Parametrisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.13601v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of the Galam model of binary opinion dynamics in which iterative discussions take place in local groups of individuals and study the effects of random deviations from the group majority. The probability of a deviation or flip depends on the magnitude of the majority. Depending on the values of the flip parameters which give the probability of a deviation, the model shows a wide variety of behaviour. We are interested in the characteristics of the model when the flip parameters are themselves randomly selected, following some probability distribution. Examples of these characteristics are whether large majorities and ties are attractors or repulsors, or the number of fixed points in the dynamics of the model. Which of the features of the model are likely to appear? Which ones are unlikely because they only present as events of low probability with respect to the distribution of the flip parameters? Answers to such questions allow us to distinguish mathematical properties which are stable under a variety of assumptions on the distribution of the flip parameters from features which are very rare and thus more of theoretical than practical interest. In this article, we present both exact numerical results for specific distributions of the flip parameters and small discussion groups and rigorous results in the form of limit theorems for large discussion groups. Small discussion groups model friend or work groups -- people that personally know each other and frequently spend time together. Large groups represent scenarios such as social media or political entities such as cities, states, or countries.</description>

      <title>Exponential convergence rates for momentum stochastic gradient descent in the overparametrized setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove explicit bounds on the exponential rate of convergence for the momentum stochastic gradient descent scheme (MSGD) for arbitrary, fixed hyperparameters (learning rate, friction parameter) and its continuous-in-time counterpart in the context of non-convex optimization. In the small step-size regime and in the case of flat minima or large noise intensities, these bounds prove faster convergence of MSGD compared to plain stochastic gradient descent (SGD). The results are shown for objective functions satisfying a local Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequality and under assumptions on the variance of MSGD that are satisfied in overparametrized settings. Moreover, we analyze the optimal choice of the friction parameter and show that the MSGD process almost surely converges to a local minimum.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations as gradient flows on the space of probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.09530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general method to identify nonlinear Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations (FPK equations) as gradient flows on the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with a natural differential geometry. Our notion of gradient flow does not depend on any underlying metric structure such as the Wasserstein distance, but is derived from purely differential geometric considerations. We explicitly identify the associated entropy functions, which are not necessarily convex, and also the corresponding energy functionals, in particular their domains of definition. Furthermore, the latter functions are Lyapunov functions for the solutions of the FPK equations. Moreover, we show uniqueness results for such gradient flows, and we also prove that the gradient of $E$ is a gradient field on $\mathbb{R}^d$, which can be approximated by smooth gradient fields. These results cover classical and generalized porous media equations, where the latter have a generalized diffusivity function and a nonlinear transport-type first-order perturbation.</description>

      <title>DP-Coloring of Graphs from Random Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DP-coloring (also called correspondence coloring) of graphs is a generalization of list coloring that has been widely studied since its introduction by Dvo\v{r}\'{a}k and Postle in $2015$. DP-coloring of a graph $G$ is equivalent to an independent transversal of a DP-cover of $G$. Intuitively, a $k$-fold DP-cover of a graph $G$ is an assignment of lists of size $k$ to the vertices of $G$ where the names of colors vary from edge to edge. In this paper, we introduce the notion of random DP-covers and study the behavior of DP-coloring from such random covers. We prove a series of results about the probability that a graph is or is not DP-colorable from a random cover. These results support the following threshold behavior on random $k$-fold DP-covers as $\rho\to\infty$ where $\rho$ is the maximum density of a graph: graphs are non-DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently smaller than $\rho/\ln\rho$, and graphs are DP-colorable with high probability when $k$ is sufficiently larger than $\rho/\ln\rho$. Our results depend on $\rho$ growing fast enough and imply a sharp threshold for dense enough graphs. For sparser graphs, we analyze DP-colorability in terms of degeneracy. We also prove fractional DP-coloring analogs to these results.</description>

      <title>Projected Langevin Monte Carlo algorithms in non-convex and super-linear setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17077v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is of significant interest in many applications to sample from a high-dimensional target distribution $\pi$ with the density $\pi(\text{d} x) \propto e^{-U(x)} (\text{d} x) $, based on the temporal discretization of the Langevin stochastic differential equations (SDEs). In this paper, we propose an explicit projected Langevin Monte Carlo (PLMC) algorithm with non-convex potential $U$ and super-linear gradient of $U$ and investigate the non-asymptotic analysis of its sampling error in total variation distance. Equipped with time-independent regularity estimates for the associated Kolmogorov equation, we derive the non-asymptotic bounds on the total variation distance between the target distribution of the Langevin SDEs and the law induced by the PLMC scheme with order $\mathcal{O}(d^{\max\{3\gamma/2 , 2\gamma-1 \}} h |\ln h|)$, where $d$ is the dimension of the target distribution and $\gamma \geq 1$ characterizes the growth of the gradient of $U$. In addition, if the gradient of $U$ is globally Lipschitz continuous, an improved convergence order of $\mathcal{O}(d^{3/2} h)$ for the classical Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) scheme is derived with a refinement of the proof based on Malliavin calculus techniques. To achieve a given precision $\epsilon$, the smallest number of iterations of the PLMC algorithm is proved to be of order ${\mathcal{O}}\big(\tfrac{d^{\max\{3\gamma/2 , 2\gamma-1 \}}}{\epsilon} \ \cdot \ln (\tfrac{d}{\epsilon}) \cdot \ln (\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$. In particular, the classical Langevin Monte Carlo (LMC) scheme with the non-convex potential $U$ and the globally Lipschitz gradient of $U$ can be guaranteed by order ${\mathcal{O}}\big(\tfrac{d^{3/2}}{\epsilon} \cdot \ln (\tfrac{1}{\epsilon}) \big)$. Numerical experiments are provided to confirm the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>An $\alpha$-potential game framework for $N$-player dynamic games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16962v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes and studies a general form of dynamic $N$-player non-cooperative games called $\alpha$-potential games, where the change of a player's value function upon her unilateral deviation from her strategy is equal to the change of an $\alpha$-potential function up to an error $\alpha$. Analogous to the static potential game (which corresponds to $\alpha=0$), the $\alpha$-potential game framework is shown to reduce the challenging task of finding $\alpha$-Nash equilibria for a dynamic game to minimizing the $\alpha$-potential function. Moreover, an analytical characterization of $\alpha$-potential functions is established, with $\alpha$ represented in terms of the magnitude of the asymmetry of value functions' second-order derivatives. For stochastic differential games in which the state dynamic is a controlled diffusion, $\alpha$ is characterized in terms of the number of players, the choice of admissible strategies, and the intensity of interactions and the level of heterogeneity among players. Two classes of stochastic differential games, namely distributed games and games with mean field interactions, are analyzed to highlight the dependence of $\alpha$ on general game characteristics that are beyond the mean-field paradigm, which focuses on the limit of $N$ with homogeneous players. To analyze the $\alpha$-NE, the associated optimization problem is embedded into a conditional McKean-Vlasov control problem. A verification theorem is established to construct $\alpha$-NE based on solutions to an infinite-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, which is reduced to a system of ordinary differential equations for linear-quadratic games.</description>
