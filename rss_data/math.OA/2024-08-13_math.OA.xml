      <title>Amenable actions of compact and discrete quantum groups on von Neumann algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{G}$ be a compact quantum group and $A\subseteq B$ an inclusion of $\sigma$-finite $\mathbb{G}$-dynamical von Neumann algebras. We prove that the $\mathbb{G}$-inclusion $A\subseteq B$ is strongly equivariantly amenable if and only if it is equivariantly amenable, using techniques from the theory of non-commutative $L^p$-spaces. In particular, if $(A, \alpha)$ is a $\mathbb{G}$-dynamical von Neumann algebra with $A$ $\sigma$-finite, the action $\alpha: A \curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ is strongly (inner) amenable if and only if the action $\alpha: A \curvearrowleft \mathbb{G}$ is (inner) amenable. By duality, we also obtain the same result for $\mathbb{G}$ a discrete quantum group, so that, in particular, a discrete quantum group is inner amenable if and only it is strongly inner amenable. This result can be seen as a dynamical generalization of Tomatsu's result on the amenability/co-amenability duality. We provide an example of a co-amenable (non-Kac) compact quantum group that acts non-amenably on a von Neumann algebra. By duality, this gives an explicit example of an amenable discrete quantum group that acts non-amenably on a von Neumann algebra.</description>

      <title>On the Completely Positive Approximation Property for Non-Unital Operator Systems and the Boundary Condition for the Zero Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is two-fold: firstly, we give a characterization on the level of non-unital operator systems for when the zero map is a boundary representation. As a consequence, we show that a non-unital operator system arising from the direct limit of C*-algebras under positive maps is a C*-algebra if and only if its unitization is a C*-algebra. Secondly, we show that the completely positive approximation property and the completely contractive approximation property of a non-unital operator system is equivalent to its bidual being an injective von Neumann algebra. This implies in particular that all non-unital operator systems with the completely contractive approximation property must necessarily admit an abundance of positive elements.</description>

      <title>Rigid Graph Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove rigidity properties for von Neumann algebraic graph products. We introduce the notion of rigid graphs and define a class of II$_1$-factors named $\mathcal{C}_{\rm Rigid}$. For von Neumann algebras in this class we show a unique rigid graph product decomposition. In particular, we obtain unique prime factorization results and unique free product decomposition results for new classes of von Neumann algebras. We also prove several technical results concerning relative amenability and embeddings of (quasi)-normalizers in graph products. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions for a graph product to be nuclear and characterize strong solidity, primeness and free-indecomposability for graph products.</description>

      <title>Flatness of $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and commutativity of Frobenius algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor functor called $\alpha$-induction produces a new unitary fusion category from a Frobenius algebra, or a $Q$-system, in a braided unitary fusion category. A bi-unitary connection, which is a finite family of complex number subject to some axioms, realizes an object in any unitary fusion category. It also gives a characterization of a finite-dimensional nondegenerate commuting square in subfactor theory of Jones and realizes a certain $4$-tensor appearing in recent studies of $2$-dimensional topological order. We study $\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary connections, and show that flatness of the resulting $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections implies commutativity of the original Frobenius algebra. This gives a converse of our previous result and answers a question raised by R. Longo. We furthermore give finer correspondence between the flat parts of the $\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and the commutative Frobenius subalgebras studied by B\"ockenhauer-Evans.</description>

      <title>Operator means, barycenters, and fixed point equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The seminal work of Kubo and Ando from 1980 provided us with an axiomatic approach to means of positive operators. As most of their axioms are algebraic in nature, this approach has a clear algebraic flavor. On the other hand, it is highly natural to take the geometric viewpoint and consider a distance (understood in a broad sense) on the cone of positive operators, and define the mean of positive operators by an appropriate notion of the center of mass. This strategy often leads to a fixed point equation that characterizes the mean. The aim of this survey is to highlight those cases where the algebraic and the geometric approaches meet each other.</description>

      <title>Easy quantum groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A closed subgroup $G\subset_uU_N^+$ is called easy when its associated Tannakian category $C_{kl}=Hom(u^{\otimes k},u^{\otimes l})$ appears from a category of partitions, $C=span(D)$ with $D=(D_{kl})\subset P$, via the standard implementation of partitions as linear maps. The examples abound, and the main known subgroups $G\subset U_N^+$ are either easy, or not far from being easy. We discuss here the basic theory, examples and known classification results for the easy quantum groups $G\subset U_N^+$, as well as various generalizations of the formalism, known as super-easiness theories, and the unification problem for them.</description>
