      <title>Incidence bounds related to circular Furstenberg sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove bounds on approximate incidences between families of circles and families of points in the plane. As a consequence, we prove a lower bound for the dimension of circular $(u,v)$-Furstenberg sets, which is new for large $u$ and $v$.</description>

      <title>A series of definite integrals involving upper incomplete Gamma functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using probability theory we derive an expression for the sum of a series of definite integrals involving upper incomplete Gamma functions. In the proof, a normal variance mixture distribution with Beta mixing distributions plays a crucial role. We also give an interesting application of our result, namely, a new summation formula for some derivatives of the Bessel functions of the first kind and the Struve functions with respect to the order.</description>

      <title>On a new proof of the key step in the proof of Brouwer's fixed point theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a solution of Exercise 1.2.1 of [2] which yields a short new proof of a key step in one of proofs of Brouwer's fixed point theorem, 1910. A few people asked the author about the details of the solution and they might be interesting to a broader audience. Our approach is absolutely different from the ones using algebraic or differential topology or differential calculus and is based on a simple observation which somehow escaped many authors treating this theorem in the past.</description>

      <title>Direct and inverse problems for a third-order self-adjoint differential operator with non-local potential functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct and inverse problems for a third-order self-adjoint differential operator with non-local potential functions are considered. Firstly, the multiplicity for eigenvalues of the operator is analyzed, and it is proved that the differential operator has simple eigenvalues, except for finitely many eigenvalues of multiplicity two or three. Then the expressions of eigenfunctions and resolvent are obtained. Finally, the inverse problem for recovering non-local potential functions is solved.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic representation of ODE solutions with quantitative estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the probabilistic representation of the solutions of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) by the generation of random trees. We present sufficient conditions on equation coefficients that ensure the integrability and uniform integrability of the functionals of random trees used in this representation, and yield quantitative estimates of its explosion time. Those conditions rely on the analysis of a marked branching process that controls the growth of random trees, in which marks can be interpreted as mutant types in population genetics models. We also show how branching process explosion is connected to existence and uniqueness of ODE solutions.</description>

      <title>Generalized principal eigenvalue of time-periodic cooperative nonlocal dispersal systems and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10936v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that, in the study of the dynamical properties of nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, the sign of the principal eigenvalue of the linearized system plays an important role. However, for the nonlocal dispersal systems, due to the lack of compactness, the essential spectrum appear, and the principal eigenvalue may not exist. In this paper, by constructing monotonic upper and lower control systems, we obtain the generalized principal eigenvalue of the cooperative irreducible system and demonstrate that this generalized principal eigenvalue plays the same role as the usual principal eigenvalue.</description>

      <title>On the kernel learning problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classical kernel ridge regression problem aims to find the best fit for the output $Y$ as a function of the input data $X\in \mathbb{R}^d$, with a fixed choice of regularization term imposed by a given choice of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space, such as a Sobolev space. Here we consider a generalization of the kernel ridge regression problem, by introducing an extra matrix parameter $U$, which aims to detect the scale parameters and the feature variables in the data, and thereby improve the efficiency of kernel ridge regression. This naturally leads to a nonlinear variational problem to optimize the choice of $U$. We study various foundational mathematical aspects of this variational problem, and in particular how this behaves in the presence of multiscale structures in the data.</description>

      <title>Mixing for dynamical systems driven by stationary noises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper deals with the problem of long-time asymptotic behaviour of solutions for classes of ODEs and PDEs, perturbed by stationary noises. The latter are not assumed to be $\delta$-correlated in time, so that the evolution in question is not necessarily Markovian. We first prove an abstract result which imply the mixing for random dynamical systems satisfying appropriate dissipativity and controllability conditions. It is applicable to a large class of evolution equations, and we illustrate it on the examples of a chain of anharmonic oscillators coupled to heat reservoirs, the 2d Navier-Stokes system, and a complex Ginzburg-Landau equation. Our results also apply to the general theory of random processes on the 1d lattice and allow one to get for them results related to Dobrushin's theorems on reconstructing processes via their conditional distributions. The proof is based on an iterative construction with quadratic convergence. It uses the method of Kantorovich functional, introduced in [KPS02, Kuk02, Kuk06] in the context of randomly forced PDEs, and some ideas suggested in [Shi15, KNS20] to prove mixing with the help of controllability properties of an associated system</description>

      <title>Empirical plunge profiles of time-frequency localization operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For time-frequency localization operators with symbol $R\Omega$, we work out the exact large $R$ eigenvalue behavior for rotationally invariant $\Omega$ and conjecture that the same relation holds for all scaled symbols $R \Omega$ as long as the window is the standard Gaussian. Specifically, we conjecture that the $k$-th eigenvalue of the localization operator with symbol $R\Omega$ converges to $\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{erfc}\big( \sqrt{2\pi}\frac{k-|R\Omega|}{|\partial R\Omega|} \big)$ as $R \to \infty$. To support the conjecture, we compute the eigenvalues of discrete frame multipliers with various symbols using LTFAT and find that they agree with the behavior of the conjecture to a large degree.</description>

Abstract: For a general solution of the third Painlev\'e equation of complete type we show the Boutroux ansatz near the point at infinity. It admits an asymptotic representation in terms of the Jacobi sn-function in cheese-like strips along generic directions. The expression is derived by using isomonodromy deformation of a linear system governed by the third Painlev\'e equation of this type. In our calculation of the WKB analysis, the treated Stokes curve ranges on both upper and lower sheets of the two sheeted Riemann surface.</description>

Abstract: Given a compact set $E\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ we investigate for which values of $m$ we have that $\dim_\theta P_V(E)=m$ or $\dim_\theta P_V(E)=\dim_\theta E$ for $\gamma_{d,m}-$almost all $V\in G(d,m)$. Our result can be extended to more general functions that include orthogonal projections and fractional Brownian motion. As a particular case, letting $\theta=1$, the results are valid for the Box dimension.</description>

      <title>Vlasov Equations on Directed Hypergraph Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.03806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.03806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to investigate the mean field limit (MFL) of interacting particle systems on directed hypergraphs. We provide a non-trivial measure-theoretic viewpoint and make extensions of directed hypergraphs as directed hypergraph measures (DHGMs), which are measure-valued functions on a compact metric space. These DHGMs can be regarded as hypergraph limits which include limits of a sequence of hypergraphs that are sparse, dense, or of intermediate densities. Our main results show that the Vlasov equation on DHGMs are well-posed and its solution can be approximated by empirical distributions of large networks of higher-order interactions. The results are applied to a Kuramoto network in physics, an epidemic network, and an ecological network, all of which include higher-order interactions. To prove the main results on the approximation and well-posedness of the Vlasov equation on DHGMs, we robustly generalize the method of [Kuehn, Xu. Vlasov equations on digraph measures, JDE, 339 (2022), 261--349] to higher-dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The R\"ossler System is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, exhibiting a plethora of complex phenomena - and yet, only a few studies tackled its complexity analytically. In this paper we find sufficient conditions for the existence of chaotic dynamics for the R\"ossler System at some specific parameter values at which the flow satisfies a certain heteroclinic condition. This will allow us to prove the existence of infinitely many periodic trajectories for the flow, and study their bifurcations in the parameter space of the R\"ossler system.</description>

      <title>On rectifiability of Delone sets in intermediate regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we deal with Delone sets and their rectifiability under different classes of regularity. By pursuing techniques developed by Rivi\`ere and Ye, and Aliste-Prieto, Coronel and Gambaudo, we give sufficient conditions for a specific Delone set to be equivalent to the standard lattice by bijections having regularity in between bi-Lipschitz and bi-H\"older-homogeneous. From this criterion, we extend a result of McMullen by showing that, for any dimension $d\geq 1$, there exists a threshold of moduli of continuity $\mathcal{M}_d$, including the class of the H\"{o}lder ones, such that for every $\omega\in\mathcal{M}_d$, any two Delone sets within a certain class in $\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be distinguished under bi-$\omega$-equivalence. Also, we extend a result due to Aliste, Coronel, and Gambaudo, which establishes that every linearly repetitive Delone set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is rectifiable by extending it to a broader class of repetitive behaviors. Moreover, we show that for the modulus of continuity $\omega(t)=t(\log(1/t))^{1/d}$, every $\omega$-repetitive Delone set in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is equivalent to the standard lattice by a bi-$\omega$-homogeneous map. Finally, we address a problem of continuous nature related to the previous ones about finding solutions to the prescribed volume form equation in intermediate regularity, thereby extending the results of Rivi\`ere and Ye.</description>

Abstract: The universal limit theorem is a central result in rough path theory, which has been proved for: (i) rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{3}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{2}$; (ii) geometric rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$; (iii) branched rough paths with roughness $0&lt; \alpha \leq 1$. Planarly branched rough paths are natural generalizations of both rough paths and branched rough paths, in the sense that post-Lie algebras are generalizations of both Lie algebras and pre-Lie algebras. Here the primitive elements of the graded dual Hopf algebra of the Hopf algebra corresponding to the planarly branched rough paths (resp. rough paths, resp. branched rough paths) form a post-Lie (resp. Lie, resp. pre-Lie algebra). In this paper, we prove the universal limit theorem for planarly branched rough paths with roughness $\frac{1}{4}&lt; \alpha \leq \frac{1}{3}$, via the method of Banach fixed point theorem.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'e Inequality for Local Log-Polyak-Lojasiewicz Measures : Non-asymptotic Analysis in Low-temperature Regime</title>

Abstract: Potential functions in highly pertinent applications, such as deep learning in over-parameterized regime, are empirically observed to admit non-isolated minima. To understand the convergence behavior of stochastic dynamics in such landscapes, we propose to study the class of \logPLmeasure\ measures $\mu_\epsilon \propto \exp(-V/\epsilon)$, where the potential $V$ satisfies a local Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P\L) inequality, and its set of local minima is provably \emph{connected}. Notably, potentials in this class can exhibit local maxima and we characterize its optimal set S to be a compact $\mathcal{C}^2$ \emph{embedding submanifold} of $\mathbb{R}^d$ without boundary. The \emph{non-contractibility} of S distinguishes our function class from the classical convex setting topologically. Moreover, the embedding structure induces a naturally defined Laplacian-Beltrami operator on S, and we show that its first non-trivial eigenvalue provides an \emph{$\epsilon$-independent} lower bound for the \Poincare\ constant in the \Poincare\ inequality of $\mu_\epsilon$. As a direct consequence, Langevin dynamics with such non-convex potential $V$ and diffusion coefficient $\epsilon$ converges to its equilibrium $\mu_\epsilon$ at a rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(1/\epsilon)$, provided $\epsilon$ is sufficiently small. Here $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}$ hides logarithmic terms.</description>
