      <title>Resource Allocation for Mutualistic Symbiotic Radio with Hybrid Active-Passive Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mutualistic SR is a communication paradigm that offers high spectrum efficiency and low power consumption, where the SU transmits information by modulating and backscattering the PT's signal, enabling shared use of spectrum and power with PT. In return, the PT's performance can be enhanced by SU's backscattered signal, forming a mutualistic relationship. However, the low modulation rate causes extremely inferior transmission rates for SUs. To improve the SU transmission rate, this paper proposes a new mutualistic SR with HAPC to explore the tradeoff between BC and AC in terms of power consumption and transmission rate, enabling each SU to transmit signal via passive BC and AC alternatively. We propose two problems to maximize the total rate of all SUs under the fixed and dynamic SIC ordering, respectively. The fixed SIC ordering-based problem is to jointly optimize the SUs' reflection coefficients, the transmit power of each SU during AC, and the time allocation for each SU during BC and AC, subject to the energy causality constraint and the PT's transmission rate gain constraint. In addition to pondering the constraints involved in the fixed SIC ordering-based problem, the dynamic SIC ordering-based problem, which is a mixed integer programming one, further considers the SIC ordering constraint. The above two problems are solved by our proposed SCA-based and BCD-based iterative algorithms, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed mutualistic SR system outperforms traditional designs in terms of the rates achieved by SUs under the same constraints; 2) the total rate of all SUs under the dynamic SIC ordering is larger than that of the fixed one when the PT's minimum rate gain is high, and becomes nearly identical when the PT's minimum rate gain is low.</description>

      <title>Joint Scheduling and Multiflow Maximization in Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Towards the development of 6G mobile networks, it is promising to integrate a large number of devices from multi-dimensional platforms, and it is crucial to have a solid understanding of the theoretical limits of large-scale networks. We revisit a fundamental problem at the heart of network communication theory: the maximum multiflow (MMF) problem in multi-hop networks, with network coding performed at intermediate nodes. To derive the exact-optimal solution to the MMF problem (as opposed to approximations), conventional methods usually involve two steps: first calculate the scheduling rate region, and then find the maximum multiflow that can be supported by the achievable link rates. However, the NP-hardness of the scheduling part makes solving the MMF problem in large networks computationally prohibitive. In this paper, while still focusing on the exact-optimal solution, we provide efficient algorithms that can jointly calculate the scheduling rate region and solve the MMF problem, thereby outputting optimal values without requiring the entire scheduling rate region. We theoretically prove that our algorithms always output optimal solutions in a finite number of iterations, and we use various simulation results to demonstrate our advantages over conventional approaches. Our framework is applicable to the most general scenario in multi-source multi-sink networks: the multiple multicast problem with network coding. Moreover, by employing a graphical framework, we show that our algorithm can be extended to scenarios where propagation delays are large (e.g., underwater networks), in which recent studies have shown that the scheduling rate region can be significantly improved by utilizing such delays.</description>

      <title>Beam Squint Assisted Joint Angle-Distance Localization for Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO), mmWave/THz bands and ultra-wideband transmission, future 6G systems demand real-time positioning with centimeter or even millimeter level accuracy. This paper addresses the pronounced near-field beam squint problem caused by phase shifter based beamforming in wideband near-field scenarios and proposes a beam squint assisted joint angle-distance localization scheme. The key idea is to employ true-time-delay (TTD) units together with phase shifters (PS) to synthesize a controllable joint angle-distance (JAD) trajectory that establishes a unique mapping between subcarriers and spatial locations, enabling single scan acquisition of target angle and range. To implement this paradigm efficiently, we design a coarse to fine two stage estimator: a low complexity coarse stage based on subcarrier power peaks for user separation and candidate region selection, followed by a local high resolution refinement stage that applies spatial smoothing and near-field multiple signal classification (MUSIC) over multiple subcarriers and fuses the resulting spectra by geometric averaging to suppress spurious peaks. We theoretically prove the correctness and uniqueness of the MUSIC spatial spectrum peak under the proposed near-field steering model, and derive the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for joint angle-distance estimation. Simulation results in single and multi-user scenarios validate that the proposed method achieves very high accuracy and robustness, significantly outperforming conventional two-step approaches, and is promising for practical 6G sensing and localization deployments.</description>

      <title>On Finite-Blocklength Noisy Classical-Quantum Channel Coding With Amplitude Damping Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate practical finite-blocklength classical-quantum channel coding over the quantum amplitude damping channel (ADC), aiming to transmit classical information reliably through quantum outputs. Our findings indicate that for any finite blocklength, a naive (uncoded) approach fails to offer any advantage over the ADC. Instead, sophisticated encoding strategies that leverage both classical error-correcting codes and quantum input states are crucial for realizing quantum performance gains at finite blocklengths.</description>

      <title>Four classes of LCD codes from (*)-(L,P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It's well-known that maximum distance separable codes (in short, MDS) and linear complementary dual (in short, LCD) codes are very important in coding theory and practice. In 2023, Yue et al. [25] constructed three classes of LCD MDS codes via (*)-TGRS codes. Recently, Wu et al. [27] generalized the results given by Yue et al. and constructed several classes of LCD MDS codes. In this paper, we unify their constructions by defining the (*)-(L,P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (in short, (*)-(L,P)-TGRS) code, give the parity-check matrix of (*)-(L,P)-TGRS codes, and then construct four classes of LCD codes. Finally, some corresponding examples are given.</description>

      <title>Movable-Antenna Trajectory Optimization for Wireless Sensing: CRB Scaling Laws over Time and Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a new wireless sensing system utilizing a movable antenna (MA) that continuously moves and receives sensing signals to enhance sensing performance over the conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) sensing. We show that the angle estimation performance is fundamentally determined by the MA trajectory, and derive the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) of the mean square error (MSE) for angle-of-arrival (AoA) estimation as a function of the trajectory for both one-dimensional (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) antenna movement. For the 1D case, a globally optimal trajectory that minimizes the CRB is derived in closed form. Notably, the resulting CRB decreases cubically with sensing time in the time-constrained regime, whereas it decreases linearly with sensing time and quadratically with the movement line segment's length in the space-constrained regime. For the 2D case, we aim to achieve the minimum of maximum (min-max) CRBs of estimation MSE for the two AoAs with respect to the horizontal and vertical axes. To this end, we design an efficient alternating optimization algorithm that iteratively updates the MA's horizontal or vertical coordinates with the other being fixed, yielding a locally optimal trajectory. Numerical results show that the proposed 1D/2D MA-based sensing schemes significantly reduce both the CRB and actual AoA estimation MSE compared to conventional FPA-based sensing with uniform linear/planar arrays (ULAs/UPAs) as well as various benchmark MA trajectories. Moreover, it is revealed that the steering vectors of our designed 1D/2D MA trajectories have low correlation in the angular domain, thereby effectively increasing the angular resolution for achieving higher AoA estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Indoor Fluid Antenna Systems Enabled by Layout-Specific Modeling and Group Relative Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fluid antenna system (FAS) revolutionizes wireless communications by employing position-flexible antennas that dynamically optimize channel conditions and mitigate multipath fading. This innovation is particularly valuable in indoor environments, where signal propagation is severely degraded due to structural obstructions and complex multipath reflections. In this paper, we study the channel modeling and joint optimization of antenna positioning, beamforming, and power allocation for indoor FAS. In particular, we propose, for the first time, a layout-specific channel model and a novel group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm for indoor FAS. Compared to the state-of-the-art Sionna model, our approach achieves an $83.3\%$ reduction in computation time with an approximately $3$ dB increase in root-mean-square error (RMSE). When simplified to a two-ray model, our channel model enables a closed-form solution for the optimal antenna position, achieving near-optimal performance. {For the joint optimization problem, the proposed GRPO algorithm outperforms proximal policy optimization (PPO) and other baselines in sum-rate, while requiring only 49.2\% computational resources of PPO, due to its group-based advantage estimation.} Simulation results reveal that increasing either the group size or trajectory length in GRPO does not yield significant improvements in sum-rate, suggesting that these parameters can be selected conservatively without sacrificing performance.</description>

      <title>Improved Constructions and Lower Bounds for Maximally Recoverable Grid Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the study of Maximally Recoverable (MR) Grid Codes initiated by Gopalan et al. [SODA 2017]. More precisely, we study codes over an $m \times n$ grid topology with one parity check per row and column of the grid along with $h \ge 1$ global parity checks. Previous works have largely focused on the setting in which $m = n$, where explicit constructions require field size which is exponential in $n$. Motivated by practical applications, we consider the regime in which $m,h$ are constants and $n$ is growing. In this setting, we provide a number of new explicit constructions whose field size is polynomial in $n$. We further complement these results with new field size lower bounds.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication for Vehicular Networks: A Rate-Distortion Fundamental Limits of State Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The state-dependent memoryless channel (SDMC) is employed to model the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system for connected vehicular networks, where the transmitter conveys messages to the receiver while simultaneously estimating the state parameter of interest via the received echo signals. However, the performance of sensing has often been neglected in existing works. To address this gap, we establish the rate-distortion function for sensing performance in the SDMC model, which is defined based on standard information-theoretic principles to ensure clear operational meaning. In addition, we propose a modified Blahut-Arimoto type algorithm for solving the rate-distortion function and provide convergence proofs for the algorithm. We further define the capacity-rate-distortion tradeoff region, which, for the first time, unifies information-theoretic results for communication and sensing within a single optimization framework. Finally, we numerically evaluate the capacity-rate-distortion region and demonstrate the benefit of coding in terms of estimation rate for certain channels.</description>

      <title>Distributed Batch Matrix Multiplication: Trade-Offs in Download Rate, Randomness, and Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the trade-off between communication rate and privacy for distributed batch matrix multiplication of two independent sequences of matrices $\bold{A}$ and $\bold{B}$ with uniformly distributed entries. In our setting, $\bold{B}$ is publicly accessible by all the servers while $\bold{A}$ must remain private. A user is interested in evaluating the product $\bold{AB}$ with the responses from the $k$ fastest servers. For a given parameter $\alpha \in [0, 1]$, our privacy constraint must ensure that any set of $\ell$ colluding servers cannot learn more than a fraction $\alpha$ of $\bold{A}$. Additionally, we study the trade-off between the amount of local randomness needed at the encoder and privacy. Finally, we establish the optimal trade-offs when the matrices are square and identify a linear relationship between information leakage and communication rate.</description>

      <title>Version Age of Information with Contact Mobility in Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gossip network is considered in which a source node updates its status while other nodes in the network aim at keeping track of it as it varies over time. Information gets disseminated by the source sending status updates to the nodes, and the nodes gossiping with each other. In addition, the nodes in the network are mobile, and can move to other nodes to get information, which we term contact mobility. The goal for the nodes is to remain as fresh as possible, i.e., to have the same information as the source's. To evaluate the freshness of information, we use the Version Age-of-Information (VAoI) metric, defined as the difference between the version of information available at a given node and that at the source. We analyze the effect of contact mobility on information dissemination in the gossip network using a Stochastic Hybrid System (SHS) framework for different topologies and mobility scalings with increasing number of nodes. It is shown that with the presence of contact mobility the freshness of the network improves in both ends of the network connectivity spectrum: disconnected and fully connected gossip networks. We mathematically analyze the average version age scalings and validate our theoretical results via simulations. Finally, we incorporate the cost of mobility for the network by formulating and solving an optimization problem that minimizes a weighted sum of version age and mobility cost. Our results show that contact mobility, with optimized mobility cost, improves the average version age in the network.</description>

      <title>Graph-Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering for E-Commerce Customer Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: E-Commerce customer support requires quick and accurate answers grounded in product data and past support cases. This paper develops a novel retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework that uses knowledge graphs (KGs) to improve the relevance of the answer and the factual grounding. We examine recent advances in knowledge-augmented RAG and chatbots based on large language models (LLM) in customer support, including Microsoft's GraphRAG and hybrid retrieval architectures. We then propose a new answer synthesis algorithm that combines structured subgraphs from a domain-specific KG with text documents retrieved from support archives, producing more coherent and grounded responses. We detail the architecture and knowledge flow of our system, provide comprehensive experimental evaluation, and justify its design in real-time support settings. Our implementation demonstrates 23\% improvement in factual accuracy and 89\% user satisfaction in e-Commerce QA scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic and nonlinear compressive sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a smooth probabilistic reformulation of $\ell_0$ regularized regression that does not require Monte Carlo sampling and allows for the computation of exact gradients, facilitating rapid convergence to local optima of the best subset selection problem. The method drastically improves convergence speed compared to similar Monte Carlo based approaches. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that it outperforms compressive sensing algorithms such as IHT and (Relaxed-) Lasso across a wide range of settings and signal-to-noise ratios. The implementation runs efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs and is freely available at https://github.com/L0-and-behold/probabilistic-nonlinear-cs.
  We also contribute to research on nonlinear generalizations of compressive sensing by investigating when parameter recovery of a nonlinear teacher network is possible through compression of a student network. Building upon theorems of Fefferman and Markel, we show theoretically that the global optimum in the infinite-data limit enforces recovery up to certain symmetries. For empirical validation, we implement a normal-form algorithm that selects a canonical representative within each symmetry class. However, while compression can help to improve test loss, we find that exact parameter recovery is not even possible up to symmetries. In particular, we observe a surprising rebound effect where teacher and student configurations initially converge but subsequently diverge despite continuous decrease in test loss. These findings indicate fundamental differences between linear and nonlinear compressive sensing.</description>

      <title>Locally recoverable codes with multiple recovering sets from maximal curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a construction of locally recoverable codes (LRCs) with multiple recovery sets using algebraic curves with many rational points. By leveraging separable morphisms between smooth projective curves and expanding the class of curves previously considered, we significantly generalize and enhance the framework. Our approach corrects certain inaccuracies in the existing literature while extending results to a broader range of curves, thereby achieving better parameters and wider applicability. In addition, the constructions presented here result in LRCs with large availability.</description>

      <title>Strong converse exponent of channel interconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In their seminal work, Bennett et al. [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory (2002)] showed that, with sufficient shared randomness, one noisy channel can simulate another at a rate equal to the ratio of their capacities. We establish that when coding above this channel interconversion capacity, the exact strong converse exponent is characterized by a simple optimization involving the difference of the corresponding R\'enyi channel capacities with H\"older dual parameters. We further extend this result to the entanglement-assisted interconversion of classical-quantum channels, showing that the strong converse exponent is likewise determined by differences of sandwiched R\'enyi channel capacities. The converse bound is obtained by relaxing to non-signaling assisted codes and applying H\"older duality together with the data processing inequality for R\'enyi divergences. Achievability is proven by concatenating refined channel coding and simulation protocols that go beyond first-order capacities, attaining an exponentially small conversion error, remaining robust under small variations in the input distribution, and tolerating a sublinear gap between the conversion rates.</description>

      <title>Benford's Law from Turing Ensembles and Integer Partitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16314v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop two complementary generative mechanisms that explain when and why Benford's first-digit law arises. First, a probabilistic Turing machine (PTM) ensemble induces a geometric law for code length. Maximizing its entropy under a constraint on halting length yields Benford statistics. This model shows a phase transition with respect to the halt probability. Second, a constrained partition model (Einstein-solid combinatorics) recovers the same logarithmic profile as the maximum-entropy solution under a coarse-grained entropy-rate constraint, clarifying the role of non-ergodicity (ensemble vs.\ trajectory averages). We also perform numerical experiments that corroborate our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Two tales for a geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05066v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence (G-JSD) gained popularity in machine learning and information sciences thanks to its closed-form expression between Gaussian distributions. In this work, we introduce an alternative definition of the geometric Jensen--Shannon divergence tailored to positive densities which does not normalize geometric mixtures. This novel divergence is termed the extended G-JSD as it applies to the more general case of positive measures. We report explicitly the gap between the extended G-JSD and the G-JSD when considering probability densities, and show how to express the G-JSD and extended G-JSD using the Jeffreys divergence and the Bhattacharyya distance or Bhattacharyya coefficient. The extended G-JSD is proven to be a $f$-divergence which is a separable divergence satisfying information monotonicity and invariance in information geometry. We derive corresponding closed-form formula for the two types of G-JSDs when considering the case of multivariate Gaussian distributions often met in applications. We consider Monte Carlo stochastic estimations and approximations of the two types of G-JSD using the projective $\gamma$-divergences. Although the square root of the JSD yields a metric distance, we show that this is not anymore the case for the two types of G-JSD. Finally, we explain how these two types of geometric JSDs can be interpreted as regularizations of the ordinary JSD.</description>

      <title>Infinite-fold Asymptotic Quantum Advantage in Classical Correlation Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the hypothesis testing problem of distinguishing between correlated thermal noise and uncorrelated thermal noise of the same average energy on $K$ detectors in asymptotic asymmetric hypothesis testing. We compare the performance of heterodyne or homodyne detection with classical post-processing, the most general quantum strategy (involving any arbitrary measurement), and a simple strategy involving a photonic chip and On-Off detection. When the average received energy per detector goes to zero, the photonic chip strategy asymptotically achieves the optimal decrease in the error, while heterodyne/homodyne measurements do not. Thus, we show that linear optics and On-Off measurement are enough to achieve better detection than classical methods when detecting correlations in thermal optical signals.</description>

      <title>Binarized Neural Networks Converge Toward Algorithmic Simplicity: Empirical Support for the Learning-as-Compression Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20646v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling the informational complexity of neural networks is a central challenge in machine learning, with implications for generalization, optimization, and model capacity. While most approaches rely on entropy-based loss functions and statistical metrics, these measures often fail to capture deeper, causally relevant algorithmic regularities embedded in network structure. We propose a shift toward algorithmic information theory, using Binarized Neural Networks (BNNs) as a first proxy. Grounded in algorithmic probability (AP) and the universal distribution it defines, our approach characterizes learning dynamics through a formal, causally grounded lens. We apply the Block Decomposition Method (BDM) -- a scalable approximation of algorithmic complexity based on AP -- and demonstrate that it more closely tracks structural changes during training than entropy, consistently exhibiting stronger correlations with training loss across varying model sizes and randomized training runs. These results support the view of training as a process of algorithmic compression, where learning corresponds to the progressive internalization of structured regularities. In doing so, our work offers a principled estimate of learning progression and suggests a framework for complexity-aware learning and regularization, grounded in first principles from information theory, complexity, and computability.</description>
