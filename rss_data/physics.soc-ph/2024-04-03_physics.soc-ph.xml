      <title>Demand and Capacity Modeling for Advanced Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advanced Air Mobility encompasses emerging aviation technologies that transport people and cargo between local, regional, or urban locations that are currently underserved by aviation and other transportation modalities. The disruptive nature of these technologies has pushed industry, academia, and governments to devote significant investments to understand their impact on airspace risk, operational procedures, and passengers. A flexible framework was designed to assess the operational viability of these technologies and the sensitivity to a variety of assumptions. This framework is used to simulate air taxi traffic within New York City by replacing a portion of the city's taxi requests with trips taken with electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicles and evaluate the sensitivity of passenger trip time to a variety of system wide assumptions. In particular, the paper focuses on the impact of the passenger capacity, landing site vehicle capacity, and fleet size. The operation density is then compared with the current air traffic to assess operation constraints that will challenge the network UAM operations.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Review of Coastal Compound Flooding Literature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compound flooding, where the combination or successive occurrence of two or more flood drivers leads to an extreme impact, can greatly exacerbate the adverse consequences associated with flooding in coastal regions. This paper reviews the practices and trends in coastal compound flood research methodologies and applications, as well as synthesizes key findings at regional and global scales. Systematic review is employed to construct a literature database of 271 studies relevant to compound flood hazards in a coastal context. This review explores the types of compound flood events, their mechanistic processes, and synthesizes the definitions and terms exhibited throughout the literature. Considered in the review are six flood drivers (fluvial, pluvial, coastal, groundwater, damming/dam failure, and tsunami) and five precursor events and environmental conditions (soil moisture, snow, temp/heat, fire, and drought). Furthermore, this review summarizes the trends in research methodology, examines the wide range of study applications, and considers the influences of climate change and urban environments. Finally, this review highlights the knowledge gaps in compound flood research and discusses the implications of review findings on future practices. Our five recommendations for future compound flood research are to: 1) adopt consistent definitions, terminology, and approaches; 2) expand the geographic coverage of research; 3) pursue more inter-comparison projects; 4) develop modelling frameworks that better couple dynamic earth systems; and 5) design urban and coastal infrastructure with compound flooding in mind. We hope this review will help to enhance understanding of compound flooding, guide areas for future research focus, and close knowledge gaps.</description>

      <title>Methods of Stochastic Field Theory in Non-Equilibrium Systems -- Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking of Ergodicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a couple of investigations related to symmetry breaking phenomena, 'spontaneous stochasticity' and 'ergodicity breaking' have led to significant impacts in a variety of fields related to the stochastic processes such as economics and finance. We investigate on the origins and effects of those original symmetries in the action from the mathematical and the effective field theory points of view. It is naturally expected that whenever the system respects any symmetry, it would be spontaneously broken once the system falls into a vacuum state which minimizes an effective action of the dynamical system.</description>

      <title>The dual role of constructive agents in public goods games: limited alone, amplifying cooperation with destructive agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed a paradoxical phenomenon in public goods games, wherein destructive agents, harming both cooperators and defectors, can unexpectedly bolster cooperation. Building upon this intriguing premise, our paper introduces a novel concept: constructive agents, which confer additional benefits to both cooperators and defectors. We investigate the impact of these agents on cooperation dynamics within the framework of public goods games. Employing replicator dynamics, we find that unlike destructive agents, the mere presence of constructive agents does not significantly alter the defective equilibrium. However, when the benefits from constructive agents are outweighed by the damage inflicted by destructive agents, the coexistence of both agent types can amplify the ability of destructive agents to sustain cooperation. This occurs through the facilitation of a coexistence pattern involving cooperators, defectors, constructive agents, and destructive agents via cyclic dominance. Conversely, if the benefits from constructive agents surpass the harm caused by destructive agents, the presence of constructive agents nullifies the ability of destructive agents to foster cooperation. Our results highlights the nuanced dual role of constructive agents in shaping cooperation dynamics, emphasizing the necessity of carefully assessing incentive balances in evolutionary game theory.</description>

      <title>Structural and flow approaches to complex network systems lesions scale analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comparative analysis of structural and flow approaches to analysis of vulnerability of complex network systems (NS) from targeted attacks and non-target lesions of various types was carried out. Typical structural and functional scenarios of successive targeted attacks on the most important by certain characteristics system elements were considered, and scenarios of simultaneous group attacks on the most significant NS's components were proposed. The problem of system lesions scale from heterogeneous negative impacts was investigated and it was confirmed that the flow approach allows us to obtain a much more realistic picture of consequences of such lesions. It is shown that scenarios of group targeted attacks built on the basis of the NC flow model are more optimal from the point of view of choosing attack targets than structural ones.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal interactions in crowd dynamics: investigating the impact of moving threats on pedestrian speed preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems, such as human-human, human-vehicle, and human-robot systems, often have serious impacts on pedestrian safety and social order. A more comprehensive understanding of these systems is needed to optimize system stability and efficiency. Despite the importance of these interactions, empirical research in this area remains limited. Thus, in our study we explore this underresearched area, focusing on scenarios where nonreciprocity plays a critical role, such as mass stabbings, which pose a substantial risk to public safety. We conducted the first experiments on this system and analysed high-accuracy data obtained from these experiments. The extent of the direct threat zone is determined by the speed of the moving threat and the radius of danger occurrence. We further categorize potential threats into direct, adjacent, and rear-view zones, quantifying the level of threat for pedestrians. Our study revealed that a pedestrian's desired velocity correlated positively with potential threat intensity, increasing until near the direct threat zone. An emerging steady state is observed when escape routes are blocked by moving threats. This deviation affects the density-velocity relationship, making it distinct from the general relationship. This deviation signifies unique pedestrian behaviour in the presence of moving threats. Additionally, the rate of change in the angle for pedestrian motion in various desired directions is synchronized. This indicates the emergence of collective intelligence in nonreciprocal interaction crowd systems. As a result, our study may constitute a pioneering step towards understanding nonreciprocal interactions in crowd systems through laboratory experiments. These findings may enhance pedestrian safety and inform not only government crowd management strategies but also individual self-protection measures.</description>

      <title>Society's educational debts in biology, chemistry, and physics across race, gender, and class</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of collaborative instruction in helping students achieve higher grades in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses has led many educators and researchers to assume these methods also address inequities. However, little evidence tests this assumption. Structural inequities in our society have led to the chronic underrepresentation of Black, Hispanic, women, and first-generation students in STEM disciplines. Broadening participation from underrepresented groups in biology, chemistry, and physics would reduce social inequalities while harnessing diversity's economic impact on innovation and workforce expansion. We leveraged data on content knowledge from 18,791 students in 305 introductory courses using collaborative instruction at 45 institutions. We modeled student outcomes across the intersections of gender, race, ethnicity, and first-generation college status within and across science disciplines. Using these models, we examine the educational debts society owes college science students prior to instruction and whether instruction mitigates, perpetuates, or exacerbates those debts. The size of these educational debts and the extent to which courses added to or repaid these debts varied across disciplines. Across all three disciplines, society owed Black and Hispanic women and first-generation Black men the largest educational debts. Collaborative instructional strategies were not sufficient to repay society's educational debts.</description>

      <title>The temporal dynamics of group interactions in higher-order social networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.09967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Representing social systems as networks, starting from the interactions between individuals, sheds light on the mechanisms governing their dynamics. However, networks encode only pairwise interactions, while most social interactions occur among groups of individuals, requiring higher-order network representations. Despite the recent interest in higher-order networks, little is known about the mechanisms that govern the formation and evolution of groups, and how people move between groups. Here, we leverage empirical data on social interactions among children and university students to study their temporal dynamics at both individual and group levels, characterising how individuals navigate groups and how groups form and disaggregate. We find robust patterns across contexts and propose a dynamical model that closely reproduces empirical observations. These results represent a further step in understanding social systems, and open up research directions to study the impact of group dynamics on dynamical processes that evolve on top of them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11909v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Message-passing (MP) is a powerful tool for finding an approximate solution in optimization. We generalize it to nonlinear product-sum form, and numerically show the fast convergence for the minimum feedback vertex set and the minimum vertex cover known as NP-hard problems. From the linearity of MP in a logarithmic space, it is derived that an equilibrium solution exists in a neighborhood of random initial values. These results will give one of the reason why the convergence is very fast in collective computation based on a common mathematical background.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the hierarchical scales of scientists'mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Human behaviors, including scientific activities, are shaped by the hierarchical divisions of geography. As a result, researchers' mobility patterns vary across regions, influencing several aspects of the scientific community. These aspects encompass career trajectories, knowledge transfer, international collaborations, talent circulation, innovation diffusion, resource distribution, and policy development. However, our understanding of the relationship between the hierarchical regional scale and scientific movements is limited. This study aims to understand the subtle role of the geographical scales on scientists' mobility patterns across cities, countries, and continents. To this end, we analyzed 2.03 million scientists from 1960 to 2021, spanning institutions, cities, countries, and continents. We built a model based on hierarchical regions with different administrative levels and assessed the tendency for mobility from one region to another and the attractiveness of each region. Our findings reveal distinct nested hierarchies of regional scales and the dynamic of scientists' relocation patterns. This study sheds light on the complex dynamics of scientists' mobility and offers insights into how geographical scale and administrative divisions influence career decisions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Space Situational Awareness to Mitigate Risk: A Case Study in the Misidentification of Starlink Satellites as UAP in Commercial Aviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the past several years, the misidentification of SpaceX Starlink satellites as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP) by pilots and laypersons has generated unnecessary aviation risk and confusion. The many deployment and orbital evolution strategies, coupled with changing sun specular reflection angles, contribute to this gap in space situational awareness. In this paper we present a case analysis of an incident that generated multiple, corroborating reports of a UAP from five pilots on two commercial airline flights over the Pacific Ocean on August 10th, 2022. This incident included two cell phone photos and a video of an unrecognizable and possibly anomalous phenomenon. We then use supplemental two-line elements (TLEs) for the Starlink train of satellites launched that same day and Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) data from the flight with the photographs to reconstruct a view of these satellites from the cockpit at the time and place of the sighting. The success of this work demonstrates an approach that could, in principle, warn aviators about satellites that could be visible in unusual or novel illumination configurations, thus increasing space situational awareness and supporting aviation safety. We conclude with recommendations for governments and satellite operators to provide better a-priori data that can be used to create advisories to aviators and the public. The automated simulation of known specular reflection off constellations of satellites could also support researchers investigating sightings of unfamiliar aerial or aerospace objects as likely being from normal versus novel space events.</description>

      <title>Entropy and the City: Origins, trajectories and explorations of the concept in urban science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy is arguably one of the most powerful concepts to understand the world, from the behavior of molecules to the expansion of the universe, from how life emerges to how hybrid complex systems like cities come into being and continue existing. Yet, despite its widespread application, it is also one of the most misunderstood concepts across the sciences. This chapter seeks to demystify entropy and its main interpretations, along with some of its explorations in the context of cities. It first establishes the foundations of the concept by describing its trajectory since its inception in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics in the 19th century, its different incarnations from Boltzmanns pioneering formulation and Shannons information theory to its absorption in biology and the social sciences, until it reaches a nascent urban science in the 1960s. The chapter then identifies some of the main domains in which entropy has been explored to understand cities as complex systems, from entropy-maximizing models of spatial interaction and applications as a measure of urban form, diversity, and complexity to a tool for understanding conditions of self-organization and urban sustainability.</description>

      <title>Analyzing Common Social and Physical Features of Flash-Flood Vulnerability Hotspots in Urban Areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01085v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flash flooding events, with their intense and sudden nature, present unique challenges for disaster researchers and emergency planners. To quantify the extent to which hotspots of flash flooding share similar social and physical features, the research uses community scale crowdsourced data and k means clustering. Crowdsourced data offers the potential to allocate limited resources, to improve spatial understanding, and to minimize the future effects of natural hazards. The research evaluates the impacts of Tropical Storm Imelda on Houston Metropolitan and Hurricane Ida on New York City. It develops a combined flash flood impact index based on FEMA claims, 311 calls, and Waze traffic reports which is able to capture a combination of crowdsourced data for the societal impact of flash flooding. In addition, k means clustering offers an essential tool for evaluating attributes associated with flash flooding events by grouping data into k number clusters of features. Thus, k means clustering evaluates the significance of a community's socio demographic, social capital, and physical features to the combined flood impact index. To ensure accessibility and replicability to different types of communities, our research uses publicly available datasets to understand how socio demographic data, social capital, and physical connectivity and development affect flash flood resilience. The findings reveal the intricate relationships associated with flash flooding impact as a combination of socio demographic and physical features. For instance, the cluster with the highest scores of the flash flood impact index from Tropical Storm Imelda had the highest percentage of minority population and lower income while the cluster with the second highest score flash flood impact index had the highest percentage of impervious surface and number of POIs.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric inference of higher order interaction patterns in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15635v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for obtaining parsimonious decompositions of networks into higher order interactions which can take the form of arbitrary motifs.The method is based on a class of analytically solvable generative models, where vertices are connected via explicit copies of motifs, which in combination with non-parametric priors allow us to infer higher order interactions from dyadic graph data without any prior knowledge on the types or frequencies of such interactions. Crucially, we also consider 'degree--corrected' models that correctly reflect the degree distribution of the network and consequently prove to be a better fit for many real world--networks compared to non-degree corrected models. We test the presented approach on simulated data for which we recover the set of underlying higher order interactions to a high degree of accuracy. For empirical networks the method identifies concise sets of atomic subgraphs from within thousands of candidates that cover a large fraction of edges and include higher order interactions of known structural and functional significance. The method not only produces an explicit higher order representation of the network but also a fit of the network to analytically tractable models opening new avenues for the systematic study of higher order network structures.</description>
