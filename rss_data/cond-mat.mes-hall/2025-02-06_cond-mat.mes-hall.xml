      <title>Enhancing the hyperpolarizability of crystals with quantum geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that higher-order electric susceptibilities in crystals can be enhanced and understood through nontrivial topological invariants and quantum geometry, using one-dimensional $\pi$-conjugated chains as representative model systems. First, we show that the crystalline-symmetry-protected topology of these chains imposes a lower bound on their quantum metric and hyperpolarizabilities. Second, we employ numerical simulations to reveal the tunability of non-linear, quantum geometry-driven optical responses in various one-dimensional crystals in which band topology can be externally controlled. Third, we develop a semiclassical picture to deliver an intuitive understanding of these effects. Our findings offer a firm interpretation of otherwise elusive experimental observations of colossal hyperpolarizabilities and establish guidelines for designing topological materials of any dimensionality with enhanced non-linear optical properties.</description>

      <title>Effects of rotation on the thermodynamic properties of a quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the effects of rotation on the physical properties of a quantum dot described by a radial potential and subjected to a rotating reference frame. The interplay between rotation and confinement is analyzed by solving the Schr\"odinger equation for the system, yielding energy levels and wavefunctions as functions of angular velocity. We compute key thermodynamic properties, including the density of states, magnetization, entropy, and heat capacity, in the absence of an external magnetic field. Our results demonstrate that rotation induces significant modifications to the energy spectrum, removing degeneracies and generating oscillatory behaviors in magnetization akin to de Haas-van Alphen and Aharonov-Bohm-type oscillations. Furthermore, we observe an effect analogous to the magnetocaloric effect, where an increase in angular velocity leads to a decrease in temperature during adiabatic processes. These results reveal the potential of rotational effects to influence quantum systems and provide insights for future studies in mesoscopic physics.</description>

      <title>Variational Scarring in Open Two-Dimensional Quantum Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum scars have recently been directly visualized in graphene quantum dots (Nature 635, 841 (2024)), revealing their resilience and influence on electron dynamics in mesoscopic systems. Here, we examine variational scarring in two-dimensional quantum dots and demonstrate that these states remain robust even in an open system. We show that controlled perturbations enable modulation of electronic transmission via scarred states, presenting a viable approach to tuning quantum transport. These findings provide insights into the role of scarring in mesoscopic transport and open pathways for experimental realization in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Discrete chiral ballistic polariton laser</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light appears when the phase of an electromagnetic wavefront winds around its direction of propagation, also known as optical vorticity. Contrary to the binary-valued photon spin, the integer-valued optical vortex charge is unbounded with many advantages in optical communication and trapping and enhancing the capacity of data encoding and multiplexing. Singular optoelectronic and chiroptic quantum technologies rely on the development of coherent and compact light sources of well-defined and reconfigurable OAM. We propose an optically tunable discrete chiral exciton-polariton microlaser that leverages strong spin-dependent polariton interactions, structured pumping, and inherent cavity photon spin-to-angular momentum conversion to emit coherent nonlinear light of variable OAM. By choosing pumping patterns with broken inversion symmetry in the microcavity plane we invoke geometric frustration between spinor ballistic condensates which spontaneously obtain a high-charge circulating current locked with the pump polarization. Our optically configurable system requires only a planar cavity thus avoiding the need for specialized irreversible cavity patterning or metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity and magnetic ordering in chalcogen-intercalated graphene bilayers with charge compensation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of two-dimensional crystals with the structure AC$_8$XC$_8$, consisting of two layers of graphene, a chalcogen (X = O, S, Se, Te) intercalation layer, and an alkaline earth (A = Be, Ca, Mg, Sr, Ba) adlayer. The electronic band structure for the 20 compounds was studied using density functional theory. The chalcogen $p$ orbitals interact with the carbon $\pi$ orbitals to form weakly dispersing bands that intersect the Fermi level and give rise to complex Fermi surfaces featuring electron and hole pockets whose densities exactly compensate each other, and van Hove singularities that are very close to, or coincident with, the Fermi level in the majority of compounds studied. The resulting electron-electron interaction effects are studied using both the temperature-flow renormalisation group approach and a spin fluctuation model, which show a ferromagnetic phase with critical temperatures as high as $\sim 10^3$ K that coexists with $p$- or $f$-wave spin triplet superconductivity over a range of temperatures.</description>

      <title>Elimination of substrate-induced FMR linewidth broadening in the epitaxial system YIG-GGG by microstructuring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02978v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern quantum technologies and hybrid quantum systems offer the opportunity to utilize magnons on the level of single excitations. Long lifetimes, low decoherence rates, and a strong coupling rate to other subsystems propose the ferrimagnet yttrium iron garnet (YIG), grown on a gadolinium gallium garnet (GGG) substrate, as a suitable platform to host magnonic quantum states. However, the magnetic damping at cryogenic temperatures significantly increases due to the paramagnetic character and the highly inhomogeneous stray field of GGG, as recent experiments and simulations pointed out. Here, we report on temperature dependent ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy studies in YIG-GGG thin-films with different sample geometries. We experimentally demonstrate how to eliminate the asymmetric stray field-induced linewidth broadening via microstructuring of the YIG film. Additionally, our experiments reveal evidence of a non-Gilbert like behavior of the linewidth at cryogenic temperatures, independent of the inhomogeneous GGG stray field.</description>

      <title>Thermoelastic Damping Across the Phase Transition in van der Waals Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantitative understanding of the microscopic mechanisms responsible for damping in van der Waals nanomechanical resonators remains elusive. In this work, we investigate van der Waals magnets, where the thermal expansion coefficient exhibits an anomaly at the magnetic phase transition due to magnetoelastic coupling. Thermal expansion mediates the coupling between mechanical strain and heat flow and determines the strength of thermoelastic damping (TED). Consequently, variations in the thermal expansion coefficient are reflected directly in TED, motivating our focus on this mechanism. We extend existing TED models to incorporate anisotropic thermal conduction, a critical property of van der Waals materials. By combining the thermodynamic properties of the resonator material with the anisotropic TED model, we examine dissipation as a function of temperature. Our findings reveal a pronounced impact of the phase transition on dissipation, along with transitions between distinct dissipation regimes controlled by geometry and the relative contributions of in-plane and out-of-plane thermal conductivity. These regimes are characterized by the resonant interplay between strain and in-plane or through-plane heat propagation. To validate our theory, we compare it to experimental data of the temperature-dependent mechanical resonances of FePS$_3$ resonators.</description>

      <title>Significant Chiral Magnetotransport Magnified by Multiple Weyl Nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intertwining of magnetism with topology is known to give rise to exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we explore the magnetotransport properties of NdAlSi, a magnetic Weyl semimetal that spontaneously breaks inversion and time-reversal symmetries and hosts a large number of Weyl nodes. We observe a significant negative magnetoresistance, which we attribute to the chiral anomaly associated with multiple Weyl nodes. Remarkably, the extracted chiral coefficient reaches approximately $52~\mathrm{m\Omega}^{-1}~\mathrm{m}^{-1}~\mathrm{T}^{-2}$, larger than many other topological materials. Additionally, we observe an exotic anomalous Hall effect with an out-of-sync behavior, where the anomalous Hall resistance does not exactly follow the field dependence of the magnetization, in contrast to that in conventional ferromagnets. These rich quantum transport phenomena, driven by the interplay between magnetism and Weyl nodes, establish NdAlSi as a prime platform for exploring the intricate topological behaviors of magnetic Weyl semimetals.</description>

      <title>Spin-valley polarization control in WSe$_2$ monolayers using photochemical doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on the influence of a photochemical doping method on the spin-valley polarization degree ($P_{c}$) of excitons in WSe$_2$ monolayers. By varying the carrier density and transitioning from an excess of electrons (n-type) to an excess of holes (p-type), we observe a non-monotonic dependence of $P_{c}$ on the doping level. Using controlled, single-shot photochlorination steps, we unveil this non-monotonic behavior, with $P_{c}$ reaching a minimum value of less than 10$\%$ at 78 K near the charge neutrality point, while increasing by a factor of three at a hole density of $5 \times 10^{11} \,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$. The impact of the doping on $P_{c}$ is explained using a phenomenological model that accounts for various mechanisms influencing exciton polarization dynamics, including exciton-carrier scattering processes and exciton-to-trion conversion rates. Among these, exciton-carrier collisions emerge as the dominant mechanism driving the observed variations in $P_{c}$, while the exciton effective lifetime remains nearly independent of doping. These findings highlight the potential of photochemical methods for investigating valley physics and for effectively tuning the exciton polarization degree in transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Preservation in Commensurate Twisted Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry plays a key role in materials hosting Dirac electrons and underpins our ability to completely flatten the Dirac cone through the tuning of physical parameters such as twisting in van der Waals heterostructures. The emergent moir\'{e} patterns in twisted bilayers at small twist angles appear, at first glance, to be independent of the initial stacking order and hence are only shifted when one layer is translated with respect to the other. However, when the twist angle is large, differences can be seen at the level of both the lattice and electronic structure in the case of twisted bilayer graphene. In this work, we first address the problem of twisted Kagome bilayers and show that the rotational and dihedral symmetry of high-symmetry Kagome bilayers is preserved for all commensurate twist angles with a 6-fold symmetric twist centre. Hence, we demonstrate that the exact symmetry of small twist angle systems depends upon the initial stacking of the bilayer. We further apply the principles of our method to twisted bilayer graphene with a 3-fold symmetric twist centre to recover the results of [E. J. Mele, Phys. Rev. B 81, 161405 (2010)].</description>

      <title>Magnetic texture control in ion-implanted metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study experimentally the impact of the additive fabrication method on the magnetic properties of Fe$^+$-implanted Pd square artificial spin ice lattices. Our findings show that these lattices undergo magnetic collapse at higher temperatures than their continuous film counterparts. This behavior is attributed to the additive fabrication process, which induces an inhomogeneous Fe concentration within the lattice building blocks. Moreover, the implantation process creates a magnetic depth profile, enabling temperature-dependent tunability of the magnetic thickness. These additional internal degrees of freedom broaden the design possibilities for magnetic metamaterials, allowing precise fine-tuning of their static and dynamic properties to achieve complex and customizable behaviors.</description>

      <title>Thermal spin wave noise as a probe for the Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interfacial Dzyaloshinkii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is a key ingredient in the stabilization of chiral magnetic states in thin films. Its sign and strength often determine crucial properties of magnetic objects, like their topology or how they can be manipulated with currents. A few experimental techniques are currently available to measure DMI quantitatively, based on the study of domain walls, spin waves, or spin-orbit torques. In this work, we propose a qualitative variant of spin wave methods. We rely on magnetic noise from confined thermal spin waves in domain walls and skyrmions in perpendicularly magnetized thin films, which we probe with scanning NV center relaxometry. We show both numerically and experimentally that the sign of the DMI can be inferred from the amplitude of the detected noise, which is affected by the non-reciprocity in the spin wave dispersion. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the noise distribution around the contour of magnetic skyrmions reveals their N\'eel/Bloch nature, giving therefore also insight into the strength of DMI involved in their stabilization.</description>

      <title>Mie-enhanced micro-focused Brillouin light scattering with wavevector resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnons, the quanta of spin waves, are magnetic excitations of matter spanning through the entire crystal's Brillouin zone and covering a wide range of frequencies ranging from sub-gigahertz to hundreds of terahertz. Magnons play a crucial role in many condensed matter phenomena, such as the reduction of saturation magnetization with increasing temperature or Bose-Einstein condensation. However, current experimental techniques cannot resolve magnons with wavevectors between 30 and 300$\,$rad$\,\mu$m$^{-1}$. In this letter, we address this gap by tailoring the light in Brillouin light scattering process with dielectric periodic nanoresonators and thus gaining access to the previously unmeasurable spin waves with full wavevector resolution using table-top optical setup. Filling this gap can stimulate further experimental investigations of the fundamental phenomena associated with magnons but also stimulate the application of magnonics in computational and microwave devices. In addition, the same methodology can be applied to other excitations of matter, such as phonons, opening up new possibilities in e.g. mechanobiological studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the electronic and transport properties of bilayer borophene nanoribbons. In the first part, a four-orbital tight-binding model is derived by fitting the \emph{ab initio} band structure. The transport properties of armchair and zigzag bilayer borophene nanoribbons are then analyzed, both with and without periodic boundary conditions. In both scenarios, the nodal line causes conductance to increase with width and exhibit oscillations in narrow nanoribbons. Additionally, plots of current and charge density reveal that edge states have a more pronounced impact in narrower nanoribbons. Finally, uniaxial tensile strain is introduced as a tool to engineer the number of available transport channels.</description>

      <title>Reversible Switching of the Environment-Protected Quantum Spin Hall Insulator Bismuthene at the Graphene/SiC Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Spin Hall Insulators (QSHI) have been extensively studied both theoretically and experimentally because they exhibit robust helical edge states driven by spin-orbit coupling and offer the potential for applications in spintronics through dissipationless spin transport. However, to realize devices, it is indispensable to gain control over the interaction of the active layer with the substrate, and to protect it from environmental influences. Here we show that a single layer of elemental Bi, formed by intercalation of an epitaxial graphene buffer layer on SiC(0001), is a promising candidate for a QSHI. This layer can be reversibly switched between an electronically inactive precursor state and a ``bismuthene state'', the latter exhibiting the predicted band structure of a true two-dimensional bismuthene layer. Switching is accomplished by hydrogenation (dehydrogenation) of the sample, i.e., a partial passivation (activation) of dangling bonds of the SiC substrate, causing a lateral shift of Bi atoms involving a change of the adsorption site. In the bismuthene state, the Bi honeycomb layer is a prospective QSHI, inherently protected by the graphene sheet above and the H-passivated substrate below. Thus, our results represent an important step towards protected QSHI systems beyond graphene.</description>

      <title>Electronic properties and transport in metal/2D material/metal vertical junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the electronic and transport properties of metal/two-dimensional material/metal vertical heterostructures, with a focus on graphene, hexagonal boron nitride and two phases of molybdenum diselenide. Using density functional theory and non-equilibrium Green's function, we assess how stacking configurations and material thickness impact important properties, such as density of states, potential barriers and conductivity. For monolayers, strong orbital hybridization with the metallic electrodes significantly alters the electronic characteristics, with the formation of states within the gap of the semiconducting 2D materials. Trilayers reveal the critical role of interlayer coupling, where the middle layer retains its intrinsic properties, thus influencing the overall conductivity. Our findings highlight the potential for customized multilayer designs to optimize electronic device performance based on two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Revealing inter-band electron pairing in a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most superconducting mechanisms pair electrons within the same band, forming spin singlets. However, the discovery of multi-band superconductivity has opened new scenarios for pairing, particularly in systems with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we reveal inter-band pairing in the superconductor \bipd\ by mapping the amplitude of sub-gap Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states around Vanadium adatoms deposited on its surface. The surface of \bipd\ is characterized by spin-helical-like bands near the Fermi level. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals anisotropic YSR amplitude oscillations around the impurity, driven by spin-conserving Bogoliubov quasiparticle interference (BQPI). Analysis of the BQPI patterns at the YSR energy exposes inter-band pairing in this material. Interestingly, only a small subset of all possible inter-band scattering processes observed in the normal state contribute to the BQPI patterns. Combining experimental data and theory, we demonstrate that the observed band selectivity results from the hybridization of the band coupled with the impurity with other bands. Our findings reveal unconventional pairing mechanisms in \bipd\ and highlight the crucial role of spin-orbit interactions in their formation.</description>

      <title>Demagnetisation effects in single-domain particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: According to the classical laws of magnetism, the shape of magnetically soft objects limits the effective susceptibility. For example, spherical soft magnets cannot display an effective susceptibility larger than 3. Although true for macroscopic multi-domain magnetic materials, we show that magnetic nanoparticles in a single-domain state do not suffer from this limitation. We find that the differences between demagnetisation factors along principal axes are relevant and can influence susceptibility for single-domain particles, but do not limit the susceptibility as in the case for multi-domain particles. We validate this result experimentally on spherical nanoparticles with varying diameter (8 to 150 nm) and varying volume fraction (0.1 to 47 vol%). In agreement with our predictions, we measure susceptibilities largely above 3, in fact up to more than 250, for single-domain particles. Moreover, contrary to an existing model, we find that the susceptibility of non-interacting single-domain particles in a non-magnetic matrix scales simply linearly with the volume fraction of particles.</description>

      <title>Symmetry Analysis of the Non-Hermitian Electro-Optic Effect in Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how crystal symmetry tailors the non-Hermitian electro-optic effect driven by the Berry curvature dipole. Specifically, we demonstrate the critical influence of the material's point group symmetry and external electric biases in shaping this effect, leading to current-induced optical gain and non-reciprocal optical responses. Through a symmetry-based analysis of the crystallographic point groups, we identify how different symmetries affect the electro-optic response, enabling the engineering of polarization-dependent optical gain without the need for gyrotropic effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the non-Hermitian electro-optic response in a broad class of crystals is characterized by linear dichroic gain. In this type of response, the eigenpolarizations that activate the gain or dissipation are linearly polarized. Depending on the specific symmetry point group, it is possible to achieve gain (or dissipation) for all eigenpolarizations or to observe polarization-dependent gain and dissipation. Weyl semimetals emerge as promising candidates for realizing significant non-Hermitian electro-optic effects and linear dichroic gain. We further examine practical applications by studying the reflectance of biased materials in setups involving mirrors, demonstrating how optical gain and attenuation can be controlled via symmetry and bias configurations.</description>

      <title>Propagation of ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The coherent transport of time-resolved ultrafast excitations in nanoelectronic interferometers is expected to exhibit an interesting interplay between the interferences and the time-dependent drive. However, the typical frequencies required to unlock this physics are in the THz range, making its observation challenging. In this work, we consider the propagation of the excitation generated by ultrashort voltage pulses through a small quantum dot, a system which we argue can display similar physics at significantly lower frequencies. We model the system with a single resonant level connected to two infinite electrodes subjected to a time-dependent voltage bias. For short pulses, we predict that the behaviour of the dot contrasts sharply with the long pulse (adiabatic) limit: the current actually oscillates with the amplitude of the voltage pulse. In the ultrafast limit, we predict that the current can even be negative, i.e. flow against the voltage drop. Our results are obtained by a combination of two approaches that are in quantitative agreement: explicit analytical expressions in the ultrafast and ultraslow limits and exact numerical simulations. We discuss the applicability of our findings and conclude that this system should be within reach of existing experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Dynamics and lifetime of geometric excitations in moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02640v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-2 geometric excitations, known as graviton modes, generally exhibit vanishing lifetimes in lattice Chern bands, including in moir\'e systems. In contrast to the Landau levels, we first numerically demonstrate that the prominent graviton peaks in spectral functions diminish rapidly with increasing system sizes. We explore how the choice of interaction affects the strength of these peaks, with short-ranged interactions pushing the graviton mode far into the continuum of excitations, where it can be significantly scattered due to the increased density of states. We also analytically investigate the short lifetime of the graviton mode. In lattice systems, continuous rotational symmetry is broken, leading to highly anisotropic gapped excitations that mix different angular momentum or "spins''. This is despite the surprising emergence of a "guiding center" continuous rotational symmetry in the ground state, which is shared by the graviton mode. Consequently, the graviton mode in Chern bands can be strongly scattered by the anisotropic gapped excitations. However, the emergent rotational symmetry implies that gravitons can be robust in principle, and we propose experimental tuning strategies to lower the graviton mode energy below the continuum. We argue this is a necessary condition enabling the observation of graviton modes and geometric excitations in realistic moir\'e systems.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Cooper pairing in nano-patterned metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-patterning has been shown to be a powerful tool for manipulating the vibrational modes of elastic structures, with applications such as optical-mechanical mode coupling. Inspired by these recent developments in phononic band engineering, we propose a nano-patterning scheme to enhance the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in phonon-mediated nano-film superconductors, such as aluminum. Using the finite element method, we simulate the lattice vibrational modes of nano-patterned films within the Debye model. Our results show that periodic nano-patterning softens the lattice vibrational modes compared to bulk films. It also increases the density of states at high energies, resulting in a couple of percent enhancement in $T_c$. Moreover, we investigate connections to random matrix theory and provide an experimental design prescription to optimize nano-patterning for further enhancement of the superconducting transition temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This letter reports high performance beta-(AlxGa1-x)2O3/Ga2O3 Heterostructure FET (HFET) with improved regrowth process. Highly scaled I shaped gate have been fabricated with degenerately doped (N++) source/drain contact regrown by ozone molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Aiming to address the limitations observed in previous generation devices, this work incorporates a low-power BCl3/Ar and SF6/Ar plasma etching process to remove the AlGaO barrier layer and Ga2O3 layer respectively before regrowth. Additionally, the surface was cleaned and vacuum annealing was carried out before MBE regrowth to reduce any interface resistance between highly doped regrowth N++ and 2DEG layer. These meticulously designed fabrication steps enabled us to achieve the high DC current 0.5 A/mm at 5V drain bias with 6.1 $\mathrm{\Omega}$.mm on resistance (R\textsubscript{ON}) at V_GS=3V, peak transconductance (g_m) of 110 mS/mm at room temperature (V_DS=15V) and around 0.8 A/mm (V_DS=5V) peak I_ON} at low temperature (100K). Current gain cut-off frequency (f_T) of 32 GHz and peak power gain cut-off frequency (f_MAX) of 65 GHz were extracted from RF measurements. f_T.L_G product was estimated to be 6.1 GHz-$\mu$m for 191 nm L_G and 32 GHz f_T, which is one of the highest reported among Ga2O3 devices. With thicker Al2O3, device shows no current collapse demonstrating first time successful traps passivation with Al2O3 for Ga2O3 devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective interactions of nanoparticles arranged in periodic structures give rise to high-$Q$ in-plane diffractive modes known as surface lattice resonances (SLRs). While these resonances and their broader implications have been extensively studied within the framework of classical electrodynamics and linear response theory, a quantum optical theory capable of describing the dynamics of these structures, especially in the presence of material nonlinearities, beyond the use of \textit{ad hoc} few-mode approximations is largely missing. To this end, we consider here a lattice of metallic nanoparticles coupled to the background electromagnetic field and derive the quantum input-output relations within the electric dipole approximation. As a first application, we discuss coupling of the nanoparticle array to an external array of emitters and illustrate how the formalism can be extended to molecular optomechanics. Specifically, we show how the high $Q$-factors provided by SLRs can facilitate coupling between the nanoparticle array and collective vibrational modes. Finally, we examine a scenario in which the metallic nanoparticles themselves are replaced with saturable excitonic emitters, illustrating how the nonlinearity of the emitters can be used to switch the SLR condition between different electronic transitions. Our work provides a seamless framework to rigorously model SLR phenomena with quantum emitters without resorting to phenomenological treatments of either the electromagnetic environment or the material degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Gain compression in Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs) are increasingly used in various applications, including quantum computing, quantum sensing, and dark matter detection. However, one important characteristic of these amplifiers, gain compression, has not received much attention. As a result, there is a lack of comprehensive experimental exploration of this phenomenon in the existing literature. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of gain compression in a Josephson traveling-wave parametric amplifier based on a four-wave mixing process. We have implemented a novel setup to monitor the complex transmission of both the pump and signal tones, which allows us to simultaneously track pump depletion and signal amplification as functions of signal power and frequency across the entire bandwidth of the device. Our findings indicate that, while pump depletion occurs during gain compression, it is not the only mechanism involved in the saturation of a TWPA. Power-induced phase-matching processes also take place within the device. This study provides valuable insights for optimizing TWPAs for applications that require high total input power, such as multiplexed qubit readout or broadband photon emission.</description>

      <title>Imprinting of skyrmions and bimerons in an antiferromagnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically protected magnetic states in condensed matter physics, particularly antiferromagnetic (AFM) skyrmions (Sks) and bimerons (Bms), offer promising prospects for terahertz dynamics and sustained current-induced motion, thanks to their compensating multiple sub-lattice structure. However, nucleating AFM Sks and Bms is challenging due to the lack of net magnetization. Previous attempts to imprint pre-defined Sks and Bms in a ferromagnet (FM) and transfer them to an AFM using interfacial exchange bias in FM/AFM heterostructures have been hindered by complex multilayers with discontinuities, polycrystallinity, or multipartite chiral AFMs. Employing atomistic spin simulations, we demonstrate the viability of texture imprinting for nucleating Sks and Bms in AFMs, using a prototypical bipartite AFM layer in a multilayer structure free from discontinuities. Such imprinting is a crucial step towards understanding the static and dynamic properties of natural antiferromagnetic textures and their unique properties.</description>

      <title>Optical bound states in the continuum in subwavelength gratings made of an epitaxial van der Waals material</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High refractive index (4.4 at 1100 nm), negligibly small absorption in near-infrared spectral range, and ease of processing make MoSe$_2$ a perfect material for applications in near-infrared photonics. So far, implementation of MoSe$_2$-based photonic structures has been hindered by the lack of large surface MoSe$_2$ substrates. The use of molecular beam epitaxy allows the production of homogeneous layers of MoSe$_2$ with a few-inch surface and a thickness controlled at the sub-nm level. In the present work, we design by theoretical calculations and fabricate by a simple lithography process an ultrathin subwavelength grating out of 42-nm thick, epitaxially-grown MoSe$_2$ layer. Our polarization-resolved reflectivity measurements confirm that the gratings host a peculiar type of a confined optical mode that is a bound state in the continuum. Moreover, the fabricated structures enhance the efficiency of the third harmonic generation by over three orders of magnitude as compared to the unstructured MoSe$_2$ layer. The presented results are promising for the realization of flat, ultra-compact devices for lasing, wavefront control, and higher-order topological states of the light.</description>

Abstract: Altermagnetism is an emerging series of unconventional magnetic materials characterized by time-reversal symmetry breaking and spin-split bands in the momentum space with zero net magnetization. Metallic altermagnets offer unique advantages for exploring applications in spintronics as conductive metals allows for serving as electrode in magnetic tunneling junction (MTJ) and/or manipulation of spincurrent through external field. Through density functional theory calculations, the 2D altermagnet Cr4B3N was predicted to be stable, resulting from a N atom substitution in the FeSe-like CrB bilayer. Both intra- and inter-layered magnetic exchanges between Cr atoms are in antiferromagnetic with the first three neighbours. Leveraging the anisotropic spin-splittings with momentum dependency revealed in band structure, we designed three edge dependent Cr4B3N/square/Cr4B3N in-plane MTJs with the 7 \AA vaccume the barrie. We found that the Cr-B vertical edge-assembled electrodes based MTJs exhibited giant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) ratios of 91001% , by aligning the conduction channels of the electrodes in parallel and anti-parallel states in the momentum space. Our work deepens and generalizes understanding toward altermagnetic 2D metallic electrode with a newly established metal boride (MBene), and broadens applications of the nanoscale spintronics.</description>

      <title>Fragile topology on solid grounds and the Thouless conjecture</title>

Abstract: This paper provides a mathematical perspective on fragile topology in condensed matter physics. In dimension $d \le 3$, vanishing Chern classes characterize the topological phases of periodic media that exhibit localized Wannier functions. However, for special symmetries $I$ of the system, such as $C_{2z}T$ (space-time reversal), the existence of a localized set of Wannier functions that is also invariant under this symmetry $I$ may not always exist. In systems with fragile topology, Wannier functions cannot respect both the symmetry $I$ and the localization constraints. Nevertheless, this obstruction can be lifted by adding Chern-trivial line bundles, invariant under the $I$-symmetry. This allows for the construction of localized Wannier functions that respect symmetry. In the last section, we take on a broader perspective and obtain Wannier localization in dimensions $d=2,3$ without symmetry constraints for Chern nontrivial Bloch bundles. For $d=2$, we obtain the Wannier decay with Thouless exponent $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-2})$; for $d=3$, we obtain the decay rate $\mathcal{O}(|x|^{-7/3})$.</description>

Abstract: Connecting quantum dots through Andreev bound states in a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid provides a platform to create a Kitaev chain. Interestingly, in a double quantum dot, a pair of poor man's Majorana zero modes can emerge when the system is fine-tuned to a sweet spot, where superconducting and normal couplings are equal in magnitude. Control of the Andreev bound states is crucial for achieving this, usually implemented by varying its chemical potential. In this work, we propose using Andreev bound states in a short Josephson junction to mediate both types of couplings, with the ratio tunable by the phase difference across the junction. Now a minimal Kitaev chain can be easily tuned into the strong coupling regime by varying the phase and junction asymmetry, even without changing the dot-hybrid coupling strength. Furthermore, we identify an optimal sweet spot at $\pi$ phase, enhancing the excitation gap and robustness against phase fluctuations. Our proposal introduces a new device platform and a new tuning method for realizing quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains.</description>

      <title>Experimental signature of layer skyrmions and implications for band topology in twisted WSe2 bilayers</title>

Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) twisted homobilayers have been established as an ideal platform for studying strong correlation phenomena, as exemplified by the recent discovery of fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states in twisted MoTe2 and Chern insulators (CI) and unconventional superconductivity in twisted WSe2 (tWSe2). In these systems, nontrivial topology in the strongly layer-hybridized regime can arise from a spatial patterning of interlayer tunneling amplitudes and layer-dependent potentials that yields a lattice of layer skyrmions. Here we report on experimental signatures of skyrmion textures in the layer degree of freedom of Rhombohedral-stacked (R-stacked) tWSe2 homobilayers. This observation is based on scanning tunneling spectroscopy that separately resolves the Gamma-valley and K-valley moir\'e electronic states. We show that Gamma-valley states are subjected to a moir\'e potential with an amplitude of ~ 120 meV. At ~150 meV above the Gamma-valley, the K-valley states are subjected to a weaker moir\'e potential of ~30 meV. Most significantly, we reveal opposite layer polarizations of the K-valley at the MX and XM sites within the moir\'e unit cell, confirming the theoretically predicted layer skyrmion texture. The dI/dV mappings allow the parameters that enter the continuum model of moir\'e bands in twisted TMD bilayers to be determined experimentally, further establishing a direct correlation between the shape of the LDOS profile in real space and the topology of topmost moir\'e band.</description>

      <title>A primary quantum current standard based on the Josephson and the quantum Hall effects</title>

Abstract: The new definition of the ampere calls for a quantum current standard able to deliver a flow of elementary charges, $e$, controlled with a relative uncertainty of $10^{-8}$. Despite many efforts, nanodevices handling electrons one by one have never demonstrated such an accuracy for a net flow. The alternative route based on applying Ohm's law to the Josephson voltage and quantum Hall standards recently reached the target uncertainty in the milliampere range, but this was at the expense of the application of error corrections. Here, we present a new programmable quantum current generator, which combines both quantum standards and a superconducting cryogenic amplifier in a quantum electrical circuit enabling the current scaling without errors. Thanks to a full quantum instrumentation, we demonstrate the accuracy of the generated currents, in the microampere range, at quantized values, $\pm(n/p)ef_\mathrm{J}$, with relative uncertainties less than $10^{-8}$, where $n$ and $p$ are integer control parameters and $f_\mathrm{J}$ is the Josephson frequency. This experiment sets the basis of a universal quantum realization of the electrical units, for example able of improving high-value resistance measurements and bridging the gap with other quantum current sources.</description>

Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall states are the most prominent example of states with topological order, hosting excitations with fractionalized charge. Recent experiments in twisted $\text{MoTe}_2$ and graphene-based heterostructures provided evidence of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, which spontaneously break time-reversal symmetry and persist even without an external magnetic field. Understanding the unique properties of these states requires the characterization of their low-energy excitations. To that end, we construct a parton theory for the energy and momentum-resolved single-particle spectral function of FQAH states. We explicitly consider several experimentally observed filling fractions as well as a composite Fermi liquid in the half-filled Chern band. The parton description qualitatively captures our numerical exact diagonalization results. Additionally, we discuss how the finite bandwidth of the Chern band and the non-ideal quantum geometry affect the fractionalized excitations. Our work demonstrates that the energy and momentum-resolved electronic single-particle spectral function provides a valuable tool to characterize fractionalized excitations of FQAH states in moir\'e lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation of topology and disorder has attracted great intention due to appropriate disorder could induce the phase transition between trivial and nontrivial topological states. While it is widely recognized that strong disorder can produce rich phase diagrams in topological nontrivial states, moderate disorder has been proposed to induce transitions into topologically nontrivial phases counter-intuitively, leading to the concept of topological Anderson insulators. This phenomenon has been theoretically explored and simulated in various systems, yet experimental realization in solid state systems has remained elusive due to challenges in controlling disorder. Here, we report the experimental observation of Chern insulator state signed by the coexistence of quantized Hall plateau and zero longitudinal resistance in monolayer MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ Hall bar device, which originally hosts a trivial insulating state with Chern number $C$ = 0 in clean limit. We demonstrate that the observed trivial to nontrivial transition in this monolayer device can be attributed to disorder, evidenced by universal conductance fluctuations. Our findings substantiate the existence of a long-sought topological Anderson Chern insulator in real materials, a unique variant of the topological Anderson insulator characterized by broken time-reversal-symmetry.</description>

Abstract: Silicon Carbide (SiC) is a typical material for third-generation semiconductor. The thermal boundary resistance (TBR) of 4H-SiC/SiO2 interface, was investigated by both experimental measurements and theoretical calculations. The structure of 4H-SiC/SiO2 was characterized by using transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction. The TBR is measured as 8.11*10-8 m2K/W by 3-omega method. Furthermore, the diffuse mismatch model was employed to predict the TBR of different interfaces which is in good agreement with measurements. Heat transport behavior based on phonon scattering perspective was also discussed to understand the variations of TBR across different interfaces. Besides, the intrinsic thermal conductivity of SiO2 thin films (200~1,500 nm in thickness) on 4H-SiC substrates was measured by 3 omega procedure, as 1.42 W/mK at room temperature. It is believed the presented results could provide useful insights on the thermal management and heat dissipation for SiC devices.</description>

      <title>Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Algorithms for Logistics Scheduling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a job shop scheduling problem for an automatized robot in a high-throughput laboratory and a travelling salesperson problem with recently proposed digitized counterdiabatic quantum optimization (DCQO)algorithms. In DCQO, we find the solution of an optimization problem via an adiabatic quantum dynamics, which is accelerated with counterdiabatic protocols. Thereafter, we digitize the global unitary to encode it in a digital quantum computer. For the job-shop scheduling problem, we aim at finding the optimal schedule for a robot executing a number of tasks under specific constraints, such that the total execution time of the process is minimized. For the traveling salesperson problem, the goal is to find the path that covers all cities and is associated with the shortest traveling distance. We consider both hybrid and pure versions of DCQO algorithms and benchmark the performance against digitized quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). In comparison to QAOA, the DCQO solution is improved by several orders of magnitude in success probability using the same number of two-qubit gates. Moreover, we implement our algorithms on cloud-based superconducting and trapped-ion quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that circuit compression using counterdiabatic protocols is amenable to current NISQ hardware and can solve logistics scheduling problems, where other digital quantum algorithms show insufficient performance.</description>

      <title>Segregation to grain boundaries in disordered systems: an application to a Ni-based multi-component alloy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Segregation to defects, in particular to grain boundaries (GBs), is an unavoidable phenomenon leading to changed material behavior over time. With the increase of available computational power, unbiased quantum-mechanical predictions of segregation energies, which feed classical thermodynamics models of segregation (e.g., McLean isotherm), become available. In recent years, huge progress towards predictions closely resembling experimental observations was made by considering the statistical nature of the segregation process due to competing segregation sites at a single GB and/or many different types of co-existing GBs. In the present work, we further expand this field by explicitly showing how compositional disorder, present in real engineering alloys (e.g. steels or Ni-based superalloys), gives rise to a spectrum of segregation energies. With the example of a $\Sigma 5$ GB in a Ni-based model alloy (Ni-Co-Cr-Ti-Al), we show that the segregation energies of Fe, Mn, W, Nb, and Zr are significantly different from those predicted for pure elemental Ni. We further use the predicted segregation energy spectra in a statistical evaluation of GB enrichment, which allows for extracting segregation enthalpy and segregation entropy terms related to the chemical complexity in multi-component alloys.</description>

      <title>Evidence of P-wave Pairing in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ Superconductors from Phase-sensitive Measurement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: P-wave superconductors hold immense promise for both fundamental physics and practical applications due to their unusual pairing symmetry and potential topological superconductivity. However, the exploration of the p-wave superconductors has proved to be a complex endeavor. Not only are they rare in nature but also the identification of p-wave superconductors has been an arduous task in history. For example, phase-sensitive measurement, an experimental technique which can provide conclusive evidence for unconventional pairing, has not been implemented successfully to identify p-wave superconductors. Here, we study a recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), which were proposed theoretically to be a candidate of p-wave superconductors. We fabricate superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs) on exfoliated K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$, and perform the phase-sensitive measurement. We observe that such SQUIDs exhibit a pronounced second-order harmonic component sin(2$\pi$) in the current-phase relation, suggesting the admixture of 0- and $\pi$-phase. By carefully examining the magnetic field dependence of the oscillation patterns of critical current and Shapiro steps under microwave irradiation, we reveal a crossover from 0- to $\pi$-dominating phase state and conclude that the existence of the $\pi$-phase is in favor of the p-wave pairing symmetry in K$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$.</description>

      <title>Antiferroelectric Altermagnets: Antiferroelectricity Alters Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06071v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetoelectric coupling is crucial for uncovering fundamental phenomena and advancing technologies in high-density data storage and energy-efficient devices. The emergence of altermagnets, which unify the advantages of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, offers unprecedented opportunities for magnetoelectric coupling. However, electrically tuning altermagnets remains an outstanding challenge. Here, we demonstrate how this challenge can be overcome by using antiferroelectricity and ferroelectricity to modulate the spin splitting in altermagnets, employing a universal, symmetry-based design principle supported by an effective model. We introduce an unexplored class of multiferroics: antiferroelectric altermagnets (AFEAM), where antiferroelectricity and altermagnetism coexist in a single material. From first-principles calculations, we validate the feasibility of AFEAM in well-established van der Waals metal thio(seleno)phosphates and perovskite oxides. We reveal the design of AFEAM ranging from two-dimensional monolayers to three-dimensional bulk structures. Remarkably, even a weak electric field can effectively toggle spin polarization in the AFEAM by switching between antiferroelectric and ferroelectric states. Our findings not only enrich the understanding of magnetoelectric coupling but also pave the way for electrically controlled spintronic and multiferroic devices.</description>

      <title>Atomic-Scale Observation of Moire potential in Twisted Hexagonal Boron Nitride Layers by Electron Microscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moire superlattices (MSLs) are an emerging class of two-dimensional functional materials whose electronic states can be tuned by the twist angle between two van der Waals layers and/or the relative placement of the layers. The intriguing properties of MSLs are closely correlated to the moir\'e potential, which is the electrostatic potential induced by interlayer coupling. Intensive efforts have been made to understand the nature and distribution of the moire potential by using various experimental and theoretical techniques. However, the experimental observation of the moir\'e potential is still challenging because of the possible presence of the surface and/or interlayer contaminants. In this work, we develop a method to obtain hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) nanolayers (with or without twist) using a specially designed chemical exfoliation technique. The resulting hBN nanolayers are atomically clean and strain free, hence providing ideal MSLs for the investigation of their moir\'e potential. Aberration-corrected high resolution transmission electron microscopy measurements on the twisted hBN nanolayers allow us to observe moir\'e diffraction spots in Fourier space. Then, the moire potential is reconstructed by the inverse fast Fourier transform of the moire diffraction spots. It has been revealed that the local interlayer atomic overlap plays a decisive role in determining the periodicity and distribution of the moir\'e potential, as supported by density functional theory calculations. This work not only provides a general strategy to observe the moire potential in MSLs, but it also expands the application of electron microscopy to the further study of MSLs with atomic resolution.</description>

Abstract: Cavity exciton-polaritons exhibit ballistic transport and can achieve a distance of 100 $\mu $m in one picosecond. This ballistic transport significantly enhances mobility compared to that of bare excitons, which often move diffusively and become the bottleneck for energy conversion and transfer devices. Despite being robustly reproduced in experiments and simulations, there is no comprehensive microscopic theory addressing the group velocity of polariton transport, and its renormalization due to phonon scattering while still preserving this ballistic behavior. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory to describe the group velocity renormalization using a finite-temperature Green's function approach. Utilizing the generalized Holstein-Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, we analytically derive an expression for the group velocity renormalization and find that it is caused by phonon-mediated transitions from the lower polariton (LP) states to the dark states, then scattering from dark states back to LP. The dark states do not have to be populated in this process, serving as the virtual state for super-exchange (especially true for a large light-matter detuning). The theory predicts that the magnitude of group velocity renormalization scales linearly with the phonon bath reorganization energy under weak coupling conditions (perturbative regime for exciton-phonon coupling) and also linearly depends on the temperature in the high-temperature regime. These predictions are numerically verified using quantum dynamics simulations, demonstrating quantitative agreement. Our findings provide theoretical insights and a predictive analytical framework that advance the understanding and design of cavity-modified semiconductors and molecular ensembles, opening new avenues for engineered polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization: A disorder-induced quantum bound state</title>

Abstract: Electrons at the Fermi energy may lose their ability to propagate to long distances in certain disordered media. We use Green functions and solve parquet equations in high spatial dimensions to construct a conserving mean-field theory of the metallic and localized phases with the transition between them in the disordered Anderson model. We find that the static diffusion constant $D$ does not vanish at the Anderson localization transition. The divergence of a new time scale, proportional to the static electrical polarizability, signals the vanishing of diffusion. We introduce an extension of the diffusion equation to reach a consistent microscopic picture of the Anderson localization transition and the localized phase. Anderson localization is caused by the emergence of a spatially localized quantum bound state.</description>

      <title>Classification of pair symmetries in superconductors with unconventional magnetism</title>

Abstract: We consider superconductors with unconventional magnetism and investigate the emergence of superconducting correlations by carrying out a full classification of allowed Cooper pair symmetries. In particular, we focus on spin-singlet and spin-triplet superconductors under the influence of $d$-wave altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets. Under generic conditions, we find that unconventional magnets not only drive a spin-singlet to spin-triplet conversion but also they transfer their parity symmetry that induces superconducting correlations with higher angular momentum. For instance, a conventional spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor with $d$-wave altermagnetism is able to host odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $d$-wave superconducting pair amplitudes, while when combining with $p$-wave magnetism the emerging superconducting pairing acquires an even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $p$-wave symmetry. We further demonstrate that unconventional magnetism produces even more exotic superconducting correlations in spin-singlet $d$-wave superconductors, where odd-frequency mixed spin-triplet $g$-wave and even-frequency mixed spin-triplet $f$-wave pair symmetries are possible in altermagnets and $p$-wave magnets, respectively. We also discuss how these ideas generalize to spin-triplet $p$-wave superconductors and also show how our results can be applied to unconventional magnets with higher angular momentum, such as $f$-, $g$-, and $i$-wave. Our results can help understand the emergent superconducting correlations due to the interplay of unconventional magnetism and superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Landau-level composition of bound exciton states in magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16564v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.</description>
