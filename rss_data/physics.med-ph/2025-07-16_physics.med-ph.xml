      <title>Species-Dependent Electron Emission from Nanoparticles under Gamma Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, various nanoparticle species-including Au and Gd$_2$O$_3$-were irradiated with low-energy gamma rays, such as 59.5 keV photons from $^{241}$Am. Pulse-height spectra were recorded using a liquid-scintillation counting system before and after dispersing the nanoparticles into the scintillator, and the differences between them were analyzed to infer the interaction outcomes. Gd$_2$O$_3$ nanoparticles emitted numerous electrons; however, under identical experimental conditions, no detectable electron emission was observed from Au nanoparticles (AuNPs). Here, "detectable electron emission" refers to electrons with energies high enough to be registered by the liquid-scintillation detector used (approx 100 eV and, more typically, &gt;= 1-2 keV); however, it excludes electrons that may be emitted at lower energies. Thus, a species-dependent radiation-nanoparticle interaction was observed. Rigorous controls and falsification tests excluded various artefacts-including detector insensitivity, surface contamination, aggregation, quenching, and self-absorption-as causes for the absence of detectable electron emission from AuNPs. This observation potentially prompts a re-evaluation of the common assumption that nanoparticles behave like their bulk counterparts and emit electrons upon gamma-irradiation. Instead, our results suggest that the distinct internal environment of nanoparticles influences their interaction with radiation. These findings offer significant insights for practical applications, including a better mechanistic understanding of nanoparticle radiosensitization in cancer therapy, enhanced gamma-detection efficiency of organic scintillators, and the development of lightweight radiation shields.</description>

      <title>Quantitative multi-metabolite imaging of Parkinson's disease using AI boosted molecular MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional approaches for molecular imaging of Parkinson's disease (PD) in vivo require radioactive isotopes, lengthy scan times, or deliver only low spatial resolution. Recent advances in saturation transfer-based PD magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have provided biochemical insights, although the image contrast is semi-quantitative and nonspecific. Here, we combined a rapid molecular MRI acquisition paradigm with deep learning based reconstruction for multi-metabolite quantification of glutamate, mobile proteins, semisolid, and mobile macromolecules in an acute MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) mouse model. The quantitative parameter maps are in general agreement with the histology and MR spectroscopy, and demonstrate that semisolid magnetization transfer (MT), amide, and aliphatic relayed nuclear Overhauser effect (rNOE) proton volume fractions may serve as PD biomarkers.</description>

      <title>GALDS: A Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate model to predict neurite material transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neurons exhibit intricate geometries within their neurite networks, which play a crucial role in processes such as signaling and nutrient transport. Accurate simulation of material transport in the networks is essential for understanding these biological phenomena but poses significant computational challenges because of the complex tree-like structures involved. Traditional approaches are time-intensive and resource-demanding, yet the inherent properties of neuron trees, which consists primarily of pipes with steady-state parabolic velocity profiles and bifurcations, provide opportunities for computational optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a Graph-Autoencoder-based Latent Dynamics Surrogate (GALDS) model, which is specifically designed to streamline the simulation of material transport in neural trees. GALDS employs a graph autoencoder to encode latent representations of the network's geometry, velocity fields, and concentration profiles. These latent space representations are then assembled into a global graph, which is subsequently used to predict system dynamics in the latent space via a trained graph latent space system dynamic model, inspired by the Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) concept. The integration of an autoencoder allows for the use of smaller graph neural network models with reduced training data requirements. Furthermore, the Neural ODE component effectively mitigates the issue of error accumulation commonly encountered in recurrent neural networks. The effectiveness of the GALDS model is demonstrated through results on eight unseen geometries and four abnormal transport examples, where our approach achieves mean relative error of 3% with maximum relative error &lt;8% and demonstrates a 10-fold speed improvement compared to previous surrogate model approaches.</description>

      <title>Motion simulation of radio-labeled cells in whole-body positron emission tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell tracking is a subject of active research gathering great interest in medicine and biology. Positron emission tomography (PET) is well suited for tracking radio-labeled cells in vivo due to its exceptional sensitivity and whole-body capability. For validation, ground-truth data is desirable that realistically mimics the flow of cells in a clinical situation. This study develops a workflow (CeFloPS) for simulating moving radio-labeled cells in a human phantom. From the XCAT phantom, the blood vessels are reduced to nodal networks along which cells can move and distribute to organs and tissues. The movement is directed by the blood flow which is calculated in each node using the Hagen-Poiseuille equation and Kirchhoff's laws assuming laminar flow. Organs are voxelized and movement of cells from artery entry to vein exit is generated via a biased 3D random walk. The probabilities of whether cells move or stay in tissues are derived from rate constants of physiologically based compartment modeling. PET listmode data is generated using the Monte-Carlo simulation framework GATE based on the definition of a large-body PET scanner with cell paths as moving radioactive sources and the XCAT phantom providing attenuation data. From the flow simulation of 100000 cells, 100 sample cells were further processed by GATE and listmode data was reconstructed into images for comparison. As demonstrated by comparisons of simulated and reconstructed cell distributions, CeFloPS has the capacity to simulate the cell behavior of whole-body PET. It achieves this simulation in a way that is anatomically and physiologically reasonable, thereby providing valuable data for the development and validation of cell tracking algorithms.</description>

      <title>Shoot-through layers in upright proton arcs unlock advantages in plan quality and range verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: Upright proton therapy with compact delivery systems has the potential to reduce costs for treatments but could also lead to broadening of the beam penumbra due to energy selection close to the patient. Purpose: This study aims at combining upright static proton arcs with additional layers of shoot-through (ST) protons to sharpen the beam penumbra and improve plan quality for such systems. Methods: We examined various treatment plans for a virtual phantom: 3-beam IMPT, static arc (Arc) with/without ST (Arc+ST), and with/without collimation (+Coll). In the virtual phantom three different targets were utilized to study the effect on conformity index (CI), homogeneity index (HI), robustness and mean dose to the phantom volume. The phantom study was complemented with a head-and-neck (H&amp;N) patient case with a similar set of plans. The delivery time for all plans was estimated. A range verification concept that determines residual ranges of the ST protons was studied in simulated scenarios for the H&amp;N case. Results: In the phantom study, the Arc+ST plans show superior CI, HI and target robustness compared to the Arc+Coll plans. For the Arc plans without ST, the collimated plans perform better than the uncollimated plans. On the other hand, for Arc+ST, collimation has little impact on CI, HI and robustness. For the H&amp;N case, similar improvements for Arc+ST can be seen. These results imply that no aperture is needed when combining arcs with ST, which in turn substantially reduces treatment times. The range verification simulation shows that the method is sensitive to detect SPR errors, setup errors and changes in the patient anatomy. Conclusions: Combining proton arcs and ST layers can enhance compact upright proton solutions by improving plan quality. It is also tailored for the inclusion of a fast and straightforward residual range verification method.</description>

      <title>Robust Semi-Supervised CT Radiomics for Lung Cancer Prognosis: Cost-Effective Learning with Limited Labels and SHAP Interpretation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Background: CT imaging is vital for lung cancer management, offering detailed visualization for AI-based prognosis. However, supervised learning SL models require large labeled datasets, limiting their real-world application in settings with scarce annotations.
  Methods: We analyzed CT scans from 977 patients across 12 datasets extracting 1218 radiomics features using Laplacian of Gaussian and wavelet filters via PyRadiomics Dimensionality reduction was applied with 56 feature selection and extraction algorithms and 27 classifiers were benchmarked A semi supervised learning SSL framework with pseudo labeling utilized 478 unlabeled and 499 labeled cases Model sensitivity was tested in three scenarios varying labeled data in SL increasing unlabeled data in SSL and scaling both from 10 percent to 100 percent SHAP analysis was used to interpret predictions Cross validation and external testing in two cohorts were performed.
  Results: SSL outperformed SL, improving overall survival prediction by up to 17 percent. The top SSL model, Random Forest plus XGBoost classifier, achieved 0.90 accuracy in cross-validation and 0.88 externally. SHAP analysis revealed enhanced feature discriminability in both SSL and SL, especially for Class 1 survival greater than 4 years. SSL showed strong performance with only 10 percent labeled data, with more stable results compared to SL and lower variance across external testing, highlighting SSL's robustness and cost effectiveness.
  Conclusion: We introduced a cost-effective, stable, and interpretable SSL framework for CT-based survival prediction in lung cancer, improving performance, generalizability, and clinical readiness by integrating SHAP explainability and leveraging unlabeled data.</description>
