      <title>Uranus Flagship Science-Driven Tour Design: Community Input Poll</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highest priority Planetary Flagship from the Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey is the Uranus Orbiter and Probe. This mission enables broad, cross-disciplinary science of an ice giant system, including the planet, moons, rings, and magnetosphere. The ice giants represent a size class of planet that is largely unexplored but that is common among extrasolar planet systems. At the same time, Uranus is unique, possessing a regular satellite system, rings, and a complex magnetosphere surrounding a planet tilted over for extreme seasonal variation. Exploration of the Uranian system is guided by a broad suite of science Objectives and through remote sensing, in situ probe, and fields and particles experiments. Due to the rapid nature of the Decadal concept study, the orbital tour could not be perfectly optimized, but a best effort was made to include orbit insertion, probe release and relay, and multiple satellite flybys; some Objectives were necessarily better met than others by this tour. The mission's tour trajectory can be optimized to meet any of the Decadal Science Objectives, by focusing on a particular system target, for example magnetosphere, satellites, or planet interior, but the best tour will simultaneously meet the highest priority measurements for every Objective. The community-led (with no institutional or NASA sponsorship) poll described here was designed to collect broad science inputs on the tour parameters required for each Decadal Science Objective. Here we present results aggregated by Objective, as well as compared longitudinally, of the highest priority tour needs identified across all Objectives. Both the raw and aggregated data are made publicly available for future white papers, tour and trajectory work, as well as mission and instrument design teams, but the results are not binding nor decisional in any way.</description>

      <title>Effects of Jump Detection and Ramp Fitting Algorithms on NIRISS/SOSS Exoplanet Time-Series Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jump detection and ramp fitting are fundamental steps when elevating JWST data products from up-the-ramp measurements to integration level count rate images. Occurring at an early stage of the overall data reduction and calibration framework, these steps, and any biases introduced by them, have the potential to significantly impact end-stage scientific measurements. Here we explore the differential impacts of jump detection and ramp fitting for the current default JWST pipeline implementation versus a newly developed, likelihood-based method, in the context of NIRISS/SOSS exoplanet time-series observations. Across both on-sky data and a suite of simulated data, we find that the two methods show differences in end product transmission spectra of order 10's to 100's parts-per-million. For the simulated data in particular, we show that the likelihood method offers a 12-18% improvement in the residual scatter and maximum deviations from the simulated ground truth. Finally, by repeating our simulations across various noise prescriptions, we corroborate the need for group-level 1/f noise corrections and re-emphasize the default implementation of such procedures as a key priority for the JWST pipeline with respect to near-infrared time-series observing modes.</description>

      <title>Initial Observations of the First BlueBird Spacecraft and a Model of Their Brightness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on a large set of visual observations, the mean apparent magnitude of BlueBird satellites is 3.44, while the mean of magnitudes adjusted to a uniform distance of 1000 km is 3.84. Near zenith the spacecraft can be as bright as magnitude 0.5. While these spacecraft are bright enough to impact astronomical observations, they can for periods be fainter than the BlueWalker 3 prototype satellite. A model for their brightness shows that design changes since the BlueWalker 3 mission can explain the behavior of BlueBird.</description>

      <title>Pitch Angle Measurement Method based on Detector Counts Distribution. -I. Basic conception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an X-ray and gamma-ray all-sky monitor aiming for high energy astrophysical transients, Gravitational-wave high-energy Electromagnetic Counterpart All-sky Monitor (GECAM) has also made a series of observational discoveries on burst events of gamma-rays and particles in the low Earth orbit. Pitch angle is one of the key parameters of charged particles traveling around geomagnetic field. However, the usage of the GECAM-style instruments to measure the pitch angle of charged particles is still lacking. Here we propose a novel method for GECAM and similar instruments to measure the pitch angle of charged particles based on detector counts distribution. The basic conception of this method and simulation studies are described. With this method, the pitch angle of a peculiar electron precipitation event detected by GECAM-C is derived to be about 90$^\circ$, demonstrating the feasibility of our method. We note that the application of this method on GECAM-style instruments may open a new window for studying space particle events, such as Terrestrial Electron Beams (TEBs) and Lightning-induced Electron Precipitations (LEPs).</description>

      <title>Pattern-recognition techniques to search for gravitational waves from inspiraling, dark-dressed primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are compelling dark matter (DM) candidates, but current constraints suggest they cannot compose all of DM. This implies that additional DM components could coexist with PBHs, one of which could form "dark dresses" (DDs) around PBHs. DDs would cause PBH binaries to experience dynamical friction (DF), which would accelerate their inspirals with respect to those in vacuum. Ignoring DF effects in matched-filtering searches could lead to significant sensitivity loss, especially in systems with asymmetric mass-ratios of q ~ 10^{-3}. We thus show that a method designed to find time-frequency power-law tracks from inspiraling PBHs in vacuum could actually handle the presence of DDs with minimal modifications. This method, the generalized frequency-Hough (GFH), maps points in the detector's time-frequency plane to lines in the source parameter space. We show that this pattern-recognition technique can recover simulated DD signals in Gaussian noise, marking an important step forward in developing DM-aware methods beyond matched filtering.</description>

      <title>A Random Forest spectral classification of the Gaia 500-pc white dwarf population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third Gaia Data Release has provided the astronomical community with astrometric data of more than 1.8 billion sources, and low resolution spectra for 220 million. Such a large amount of data is difficult to handle by means of visual inspection. In this work, we present a spectral analysis of the Gaia white dwarf population up to 500 pc from the Sun based on artificial intelligence algorithms to classify the sample into their main spectral types and subtypes. In order to classify the sample, which consists of 78 920 white dwarfs with available Gaia spectra, we have applied a Random Forest algorithm to the Gaia spectral coefficients. We used the Montreal White Dwarf Database of already labeled objects as our training sample. The classified sample is compared with other already published catalogs and with our own higher resolution Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC) spectra, enabling the construction of a golden sample of well-classified objects. The Random Forest spectral classification of the 500-pc white dwarf population achieves an excellent global accuracy of 0.91 and an F1-score of 0.88 for the DA versus non-DA classification. In addition, we obtain a very high accuracy of 0.76 and a global F1-score of 0.62 for the non-DA subtype classification. In particular, our classification shows an excellent recall for DAs, DBs and DCs and a very good precision for DQs, DZs and DOs. The use of machine learning techniques, particularly the Random Forest algorithm, has enabled us to spectrally classify 78,920 white dwarfs with reasonable accuracy. Having an estimate of the spectral type for the vast majority of white dwarfs up to 500 pc provides the possibility of making better estimates of cooling ages, star formation rates, and stellar evolution processes, among other fundamental aspects for the study of the white dwarf population.</description>

      <title>OTI on FIRE: Testing the Efficacy of Orbital Torus Imaging to Recover the Galactic Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05590v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital Torus Imaging (OTI) is a dynamical inference method for determining the Milky Way's gravitational potential using stellar survey data. OTI uses gradients in stellar astrophysical quantities, such as element abundances, as functions of dynamical quantities, like orbital actions or energy, to estimate the Galactic mass distribution, assuming axisymmetry and steady-state of the system. While preliminary applications have shown promising outcomes, its sensitivity to disequilibrium effects is unknown. Here, we apply OTI to a benchmark Feedback in Realistic Environments (FIRE-2) cosmological hydrodynamic simulation, m12i, which enables a comparative analysis between known FIRE-2 vertical acceleration profiles and total surface mass densities to the analogous OTI-inferred results. We quantify OTI's accuracy within solar-analog volumes embedded in the simulated galactic disk. Despite a dynamically-evolving system, we find that OTI recovers the known vertical acceleration profiles within 3 sigma/1 sigma errors for 94%/75% of the volumes considered. We discuss the method's sensitivity to the local, instantaneous structure of the disk, reporting a loss in accuracy for volumes that have large (&gt;1.5 kpc) scale heights and low total density at z=1.1 kpc. We present realistic OTI error bars from both MCMC sampling and bootstrapping the FIRE-2 simulated data, which provides a touchstone for interpreting results obtained from current and forthcoming surveys such as SDSS-V, Gaia, WEAVE, and 4MOST.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric Newtonian Noise May Constrain Third-Generation Gravitational-Wave Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advanced gravitational-wave detector designs are pushing towards lower frequencies, where certain types of noise, previously considered negligible, may come to dominate the detectors' noise budgets. In particular, we revisit atmospheric Newtonian noise, caused by the fluctuating gravitational field as regions of high and low gas density move past the detector. We consider density perturbations both due to pressure waves (infrasound) and due to advected temperature fluctuations. In the absence of detailed site-specific models of topography, airflow, and building design, we present general scaling formulae that estimate the spectrum of atmospheric Newtonian noise, and show how it is affected by broad detector design choices. We confirm previous analyses that show that atmospheric Newtonian noise is not likely a strong contributor to advanced LIGO; however, it will be a dominant factor for third-generation detectors targeting low frequencies, with the low-frequency cutoff principally constrained by the depth of the detector underground.</description>

      <title>Non-degenerate pumping of superconducting resonator parametric amplifier with evidence of phase-sensitive amplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting resonator parametric amplifiers are potentially important components for a wide variety of fundamental physics experiments and utilitarian applications. We propose and realise an operation scheme that achieves amplification through the use of non-degenerate pumps, which addresses two key challenges in the design of parametric amplifiers: non-continuous gain across the band over which amplification is possible, and pump-tone removal. We have experimentally demonstrated the non-degenerate pumping scheme using a half-wave resonator amplifier based on NbN thin-film, and measured peak gain of 26 dB and 3-dB bandwidth of 0.5 MHz. The two non-degenerate pump tones were positioned ~10 bandwidths above and below the frequency at which peak gain occurs. We have found the non-degenerate pumping scheme to be more stable compared to the usual degenerate pumping scheme in terms of gain drift against time, by a factor of 4. This scheme also retains the usual flexibility of NbN resonator parametric amplifiers in terms of reliable amplification in a ~4 K environment, and is suitable for cross-harmonic amplification. The use of pump at different frequencies allows phase-sensitive amplification when the signal tone is degenerate with the idler tone. A gain of 23 dB and squeezing ratio of 6 dB have been measured.</description>

      <title>A Machine-Learning Compositional Study of Exoplanetary Material Accreted Onto Five Helium-Atmosphere White Dwarfs with $\texttt{cecilia}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first application of the Machine Learning (ML) pipeline $\texttt{cecilia}$ to determine the physical parameters and photospheric composition of five metal-polluted He-atmosphere white dwarfs without well-characterised elemental abundances. To achieve this, we perform a joint and iterative Bayesian fit to their $\textit{SDSS}$ (R=2,000) and $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ (R=4,500) optical spectra, covering the wavelength range from about 3,800\r{A} to 9,000\r{A}. Our analysis measures the abundances of at least two $-$and up to six$-$ chemical elements in their atmospheres with a predictive accuracy similar to that of conventional WD analysis techniques ($\approx$0.20 dex). The white dwarfs with the largest number of detected heavy elements are SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which simultaneously exhibit O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe in their $\textit{Keck/ESI}$ spectra. For all systems, we find that the bulk composition of their pollutants is largely consistent with those of primitive CI chondrites to within 1-2$\sigma$. We also find evidence of statistically significant ($&gt;2\sigma$) oxygen excesses for SDSS J0859$+$5732 and SDSS J2311$-$0041, which could point to the accretion of oxygen-rich exoplanetary material. In the future, as wide-field astronomical surveys deliver millions of public WD spectra to the scientific community, $\texttt{cecilia}$ aspires to unlock population-wide studies of polluted WDs, therefore helping to improve our statistical knowledge of extrasolar compositions.</description>

      <title>MNTES: Modeling Nonlinearity of TES detectors for Enhanced Cosmic Microwave Background measurements with LiteBIRD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional methods of converting electronic readout counts to optical power incident on Transition Edge Sensors (TES) for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) observations involve a linear approximation. For the upcoming LiteBIRD CMB satellite, strict nonlinearity requirements must be met to prevent contamination of the science band at 4f by the 2f signal, which arises from differential transmission or emissivity related to the half-wave plate's rotation rate fHWP. These constraints cannot be met using hardware solutions alone and therefore require a form of nonlinearity correction. We present MNTES, a novel physics-based, nonlinear calibration technique. This method leverages our physical understanding of the TES power balance equation, accounts for imperfect voltage bias by casting the bias network as its Th\'evenin equivalent, and can incorporate external information such as time-varying magnetic fields and focal plane temperature variations. The detector-specific parameters of MNTES will be measured during the ground calibration campaign prior to the LiteBIRD launch, yielding conversion functions that can take raw time-ordered data and output the reconstructed incident optical power. MNTES will allow us to achieve LiteBIRD's goal of measuring the primordial tensor fluctuation spectrum to {\delta}r &lt; 0.001.</description>

      <title>Bottom-up Background Simulations of the 2016 COSI Balloon Flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is a Compton telescope designed to survey the 0.2-5 MeV sky, consisting of a compact array of cross-strip germanium detectors. As part of its development, in 2016 COSI had a successful 46 day flight on board NASA's Super Pressure Balloon platform. This was a precursor to the COSI Small Explorer (COSI-SMEX) satellite mission that will launch in 2027 into a equatorial low Earth (530 km) orbit. The observation of MeV gamma-rays is dominated by background radiation, especially due to the activation of the detector materials induced by cosmic-ray interactions. Thus, background simulation and identification are crucial for the data analysis. Because the COSI-SMEX detectors will be similar to the ones used for the balloon flight, the balloon measurements provide an important tool for testing and cross-checking our background simulations for the upcoming space mission. In this work we perform Monte Carlo simulations of the background emission from the 2016 COSI balloon flight. Including a phenomenological shape correction, we obtain an agreement with the data at the 10-20% level for energies between 0.1-1.6 MeV, and we successfully reproduce most of the activation lines induced by cosmic ray interactions.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the significance of astrophysical events with multimessenger coincidences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coincident multimessenger observations of cosmic sources can offer numerous benefits, especially when used in the context of synergistic astrophysics. One significant advantage is enhancing the detection significance of separate detectors by correlating their data and assuming joint emission. We have formulated an approach for updating the Bayesian posterior probability of an astrophysical origin, namely $p_{\rm astro}$, relying on multimessenger coincidences assuming an emission model. The description is applicable to any combination of messengers. We demonstrated the formalism for the gravitational waves and high-energy neutrinos case. Applying our method to the public data of candidate coincident high-energy neutrinos with subthreshold gravitational-wave triggers, we found that in the case of highly energetic neutrino coincidences, $p_{\rm astro}$ can increase from approximately $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.9$. The amount of improvement depends on the assumed joint emission model. If models are trusted, the marked improvement makes subthreshold detections much more confident. Moreover, the model dependency can also be used to test the consistency of different models. This work is a crucial step toward the goal of uniting all detectors on equal footing into a statistically integrated, Earth-sized observatory for comprehensive multimessenger astrophysics.</description>

Abstract: We present Gemini/GHOST high-resolution spectra of five stars observed in two low surface brightness Milky Way satellites, Sagittarius II (Sgr2) and Aquarius II (Aqu2). For Aqu2, the velocities and metallicities of the two stars are consistent with membership in a dark matter-dominated ultra faint dwarf galaxy (UFD). The chemical abundance ratios suggest inefficient star formation from only one or a few supernovae (e.g., low Na, Sr, Ba), and enriched potassium (K) from super-AGB stars. For Sgr2, the velocity and metallicity dispersions of its members are not clearly resolved and our detailed chemical abundances show typical ratios for metal-poor stars, with low dispersions. There is only one exception - we report the discovery of an r-process enhanced star (Sgr2584, [Eu/Fe]= $+0.7 \pm 0.2 $; thus, an r-I star). As r-I stars are found in both UFDs (Tuc III, Tuc IV, Grus II) and globular clusters (M15 and M92), then this does not help to further classify the nature of Sgr2. Our exploration of Sgr2 demonstrates the difficulty in classifying some of the faintest (ambiguous) satellites. We advocate for additional diagnostics in analysing the ambiguous systems, such as exploring radial segregation (by mass and/or chemistry), N-body simulations, and the need for dark matter to survive Galactic tidal effects. The spectra analysed in this paper were taken as part of the GHOST commissioning observations, testing faint observation limits (G &lt; 18.8) and the single and double IFU observing modes.</description>
