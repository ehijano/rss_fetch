      <title>Soft-Output Successive Cancellation List Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithm for approximating the codebook probability that is compatible with all successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding algorithms, including SC list (SCL) decoding. This approximation is based on an auxiliary distribution that mimics the dynamics of decoding algorithms with an SC decoding schedule. Based on this codebook probability and SCL decoding, we introduce soft-output SCL (SO-SCL) to generate both blockwise and bitwise soft-output (SO).
  Using that blockwise SO, we first establish that, in terms of both block error rate (BLER) and undetected error rate (UER), SO-SCL decoding of dynamic Reed-Muller (RM) codes significantly outperforms the CRC-concatenated polar codes from 5G New Radio under SCL decoding. Moreover, using SO-SCL, the decoding misdetection rate (MDR) can be constrained to not exceed any predefined value, making it suitable for practical systems.
  Proposed bitwise SO can be readily generated from blockwise SO via a weighted sum of beliefs that includes a term where SO is weighted by the codebook probability, resulting in a soft-input soft-output (SISO) decoder. Simulation results for SO-SCL iterative decoding of product codes and generalized LDPC (GLDPC) codes, along with information-theoretical analysis, demonstrate significant superiority over existing list-max and list-sum approximations.</description>

      <title>Resilience and Criticality: Brothers in Arms for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop the first comprehensive tutorial on designing future 6G networks that synergistically integrate notions of resilience and criticality from the ground up. While resilience refers to the ability to absorb, adapt to, and recover from adversarial or challenging conditions, criticality indicates the degree of importance or urgency assigned to a particular service or component. Despite a spiking interest in designing resilient wireless networks, most prior works do not provide a unified resilience definition, nor harness the intricate interplay between resilience and criticality. In order to fill this gap, in this paper, we highlight the importance of a criticality-aware approach as a key enabler for providing reliable and resilient service functionality. Moreover, we delve into the unique challenges and opportunities of the envisioned 6G features pertaining to resilience and (mixed) criticality. After reviewing resilience definitions, we present a core resilience strategy, a unified resilience metric, different criteria for service criticality, and prioritization frameworks, that augment the 6G resilience prospects. Afterwards, we explore the opportunities presented by promising technologies that enable a resilient 6G network design from a radio access network protocol stack perspective. We briefly revisit state-of-the-art network architectures, establish a rough connection to the Open-RAN Alliance vision, and discuss opportunities, existing techniques, and promising enabling mechanisms for 6G at each layer. Finally, the article discusses important research directions and open problems concerning resilience and criticality in 6G.</description>

      <title>Meta-Reinforcement Learning With Mixture of Experts for Generalizable Multi Access in Heterogeneous Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on spectrum sharing in heterogeneous wireless networks, where nodes with different Media Access Control (MAC) protocols to transmit data packets to a common access point over a shared wireless channel. While previous studies have proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based multiple access protocols tailored to specific scenarios, these approaches are limited by their inability to generalize across diverse environments, often requiring time-consuming retraining. To address this issue, we introduce Generalizable Multiple Access (GMA), a novel Meta-Reinforcement Learning (meta-RL)-based MAC protocol designed for rapid adaptation across heterogeneous network environments. GMA leverages a context-based meta-RL approach with Mixture of Experts (MoE) to improve representation learning, enhancing latent information extraction. By learning a meta-policy during training, GMA enables fast adaptation to different and previously unknown environments, without prior knowledge of the specific MAC protocols in use. Simulation results demonstrate that, although the GMA protocol experiences a slight performance drop compared to baseline methods in training environments, it achieves faster convergence and higher performance in new, unseen environments.</description>

      <title>Truly SubNyquist Multicomponent Linear FM Signal Decomposition Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate extraction of multicomponent linear frequency modulation (LFM) signal parameters, such as onset frequency, linear modulation frequency, amplitude, and initial phase, is of great importance in the fields of ISAR, cognitive radio, electronic countermeasures, and star-ground communications. However, the task of accurately extracting the characteristic parameters of a signal is challenging when it has an extraordinarily large bandwidth as well as cross or neighboring components in the time-frequency domain. In this paper, we first review the main current methods used for multicomponent LFM signal decomposition and their challenges, and then propose a novel multi-parameter feature parameter extraction algorithm. The algorithmrealizes the direct and accurate extraction of thefeature parameters of multicomponent LFM signals at ultra-low sub-Nyquist sampling rate for the first time. Moreover, the algorithm is optimized for the computational complexity and anti-noise problems in practical applications, so that it has high accuracy, high efficiency and good noise robustness. We also compare the algorithm with innovative and existing methods, and the results show that the algorithm has excellent performance in feature parameter extraction accuracy, noise immunity and computational speed.</description>

      <title>On the Application of Blind Interference Alignment for Bistatic Integrated Communication and Sensing Integration Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems provide significant enhancements in performance and resource efficiency compared to individual sensing and communication systems, primarily attributed to the collaborative use of wireless resources, radio waveforms, and hardware platforms. The performance limits of a system are crucial for guiding its design; however, the performance limits of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems remain an open question. This paper focuses on the bistatic ISAC systems with dispersed multi-receivers and one sensor. Compared to the monostatic ISAC systems, the main challenge is that that the communication messages are unknown to the sensor and thus become its interference, while the channel information between the transmitters and the sensor is unknown to the transmitters. In order to mitigate the interference at the sensor while maximizing the communication degree of freedom, we introduce the blind interference alignment strategy for various bistatic ISAC settings, including interference channels, MU-MISO channels, and MU-MIMO channels. Under each of such system, the achieved ISAC tradeoff points by the proposed schemes in terms of communication and sensing degrees of freedom are characterized, which outperforms the time-sharing between the two extreme sensing-optimal and communication-optimal points.Simulation results also demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly improve on the ISAC performance compared to treating interference as noise at the sensor.</description>

      <title>Recursively Extended Permutation Codes under Chebyshev Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the construction and analysis of permutation codes under the Chebyshev distance. The direct product group permutation (DPGP) codes, introduced independently by Kl\o ve et al. and Tamo et al., represent the best-known permutation codes in terms of both size and minimum distance. These codes possess algebraic structures that facilitate efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. In particular, this study focuses on recursively extended permutation (REP) codes, which were also introduced by Kl\o ve et al. We examine the properties of REP codes and prove that, in terms of size and minimum distance, the optimal REP code is equivalent to the DPGP codes. Furthermore, we present efficient encoding and decoding algorithms for REP codes.</description>

      <title>Joint Mode Selection and Beamforming Designs for Hybrid-RIS Assisted ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a hybrid reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system, where each RIS element can flexibly switch between the active and passive modes. Subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for each communication user (CU) and the transmit power constraints for both the base station (BS) and the active RIS elements, with the objective of maximizing the minimum beampattern gain among multiple targets, we jointly optimize the BS transmit beamforming for ISAC and the mode selection of each RIS reflecting element, as well as the RIS reflection coefficient matrix. Such formulated joint hybrid-RIS assisted ISAC design problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear program, which is decomposed into two low-dimensional subproblems being solved in an alternating manner. Specifically, by using the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) technique along with the rank-one beamforming construction process, we efficiently obtain the optimal ISAC transmit beamforming design at the BS. Via the SDR and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques, we jointly determine the active/passive mode selection and reflection coefficient for each RIS element. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed design solution is significantly superior to the existing baseline solutions.</description>

      <title>Providing Differential Privacy for Federated Learning Over Wireless: A Cross-layer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning framework that inherently allows edge devices to maintain their local training data, thus providing some level of privacy. However, FL's model updates still pose a risk of privacy leakage, which must be mitigated. Over-the-air FL (OTA-FL) is an adapted FL design for wireless edge networks that leverages the natural superposition property of the wireless medium. We propose a wireless physical layer (PHY) design for OTA-FL which improves differential privacy (DP) through a decentralized, dynamic power control that utilizes both inherent Gaussian noise in the wireless channel and a cooperative jammer (CJ) for additional artificial noise generation when higher privacy levels are required. Although primarily implemented within the Upcycled-FL framework, where a resource-efficient method with first-order approximations is used at every even iteration to decrease the required information from clients, our power control strategy is applicable to any FL framework, including FedAvg and FedProx as shown in the paper. This adaptation showcases the flexibility and effectiveness of our design across different learning algorithms while maintaining a strong emphasis on privacy. Our design removes the need for client-side artificial noise injection for DP, utilizing a cooperative jammer to enhance privacy without affecting transmission efficiency for higher privacy demands. Privacy analysis is provided using the Moments Accountant method. We perform a convergence analysis for non-convex objectives to tackle heterogeneous data distributions, highlighting the inherent trade-offs between privacy and accuracy. Numerical results show that our approach with various FL algorithms outperforms the state-of-the-art under the same DP conditions on the non-i.i.d. FEMNIST dataset, and highlight the cooperative jammer's effectiveness in ensuring strict privacy.</description>

      <title>Refining Concentration for Gaussian Quadratic Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We visit and slightly modify the proof of Hanson-Wright inequality (HW inequality) for concentration of Gaussian quadratic chaos where we are able to tighten the bound by increasing the absolute constant in its formulation from its largest currently known value of 0.125 to at least 0.145 in the symmetric case. We also present a sharper version of the so-called Laurent-Massart inequality (LM inequality) through which we are able to increase the absolute constant in HW inequality from its largest currently available value of 0.134 due to LM inequality itself to at least 0.152 in the positive-semidefinite case. Generalizing HW inequality in the symmetric case, we derive a sequence of concentration bounds for Gaussian quadratic chaos indexed over m = 1, 2, 3,... that involves the Schatten norms of the underlying matrix. The case m = 1 reduces to HW inequality. These bounds exhibit a phase transition in behaviour in the sense that m = 1 results in the tightest bound if the deviation is smaller than a critical threshold and the bounds keep getting tighter as the index m increases when the deviation is larger than the aforementioned threshold. Finally, we derive a concentration bound that is asymptotically tighter than HW inequality both in the small and large deviation regimes.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of XL-MIMO with Rotary and Movable Antennas for High-speed Railway</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rotary and movable antennas (ROMA) technology is efficient in enhancing wireless network capacity by adjusting both the antenna spacing and three-dimensional (3D) rotation of antenna surfaces, based on the spatial distribution of users and channel statistics. Applying ROMA to high-speed rail (HSR) wireless communications can significantly improve system performance in terms of array gain and spatial multiplexing. However, the rapidly changing channel conditions in HSR scenarios present challenges for ROMA configuration. In this correspondence, we propose a analytical framework for configuring ROMA-based extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) system in HSR scenarios based on spatial correlation. First, we develop a localization model based on a mobility-aware near-field beam training algorithm to determine the real-time position of the train relay antennas. Next, we derive the expression for channel orthogonality and antenna spacing based on the spatial correlation matrix, and obtain the optimal antenna spacing when the transceiver panels are aligned in parallel. Moreover, we propose an optimization algorithm for the rotation angle of the transceiver panels, leveraging the differential evolution method, to determine the optimal angle. Finally, numerical results are provided to validate the computational results and optimization algorithm.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Learning for IRS-Assisted MEC Systems with Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) systems have shown notable improvements in efficiency, such as reduced latency, higher data rates, and better energy efficiency. However, the resource competition among users will lead to uneven allocation, increased latency, and lower throughput. Fortunately, the rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) technique has emerged as a promising solution for managing interference and optimizing resource allocation in MEC systems. This paper studies an IRS-assisted MEC system with RSMA, aiming to jointly optimize the passive beamforming of the IRS, the active beamforming of the base station, the task offloading allocation, the transmit power of users, the ratios of public and private information allocation, and the decoding order of the RSMA to minimize the average delay from a novel uplink transmission perspective. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and the optimization variables are highly coupled, we propose a hierarchical deep reinforcement learning-based algorithm to optimize both continuous and discrete variables of the problem. Additionally, to better extract channel features, we design a novel network architecture within the policy and evaluation networks of the proposed algorithm, combining convolutional neural networks and densely connected convolutional network for feature extraction. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm not only exhibits excellent convergence performance but also outperforms various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Delay-Doppler Signal Processing with Zadoff-Chu Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much of the engineering behind current wireless systems has focused on designing an efficient and high-throughput downlink to support human-centric communication such as video streaming and internet browsing. This paper looks ahead to design of the uplink, anticipating the emergence of machine-type communication (MTC) and the confluence of sensing, communication, and distributed learning. We demonstrate that grant-free multiple access is possible even in the presence of highly time-varying channels. Our approach provides a pathway to standards adoption, since it is built on enhancing the 2-step random access procedure which is already part of the 5GNR standard. This 2-step procedure uses Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences as preambles that point to radio resources which are then used to upload data. We also use ZC sequences as preambles / pilots, but we process signals in the Delay-Doppler (DD) domain rather than the time-domain. We demonstrate that it is possible to detect multiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread using a receiver with no knowledge of the channel other than the worst case delay and Doppler spreads. Our approach depends on the mathematical properties of ZC sequences in the DD domain. We derive a closed form expression for ZC pilots in the DD domain, we characterize the possible self-ambiguity functions, and we determine the magnitude of the possible cross-ambiguity functions. These mathematical properties enable detection of multiple pilots through solution of a compressed sensing problem. The columns of the compressed sensing matrix are the translates of individual ZC pilots in delay and Doppler. We show that columns in the design matrix satisfy a coherence property that makes it possible to detect multiple preambles in a single Zak-OTFS subframe using One-Step Thresholding (OST), which is an algorithm with low complexity.</description>

      <title>Pilot-Aided Simultaneous Communication And Localisation (PASCAL) Under Practical Imperfections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18762v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a system model called pilot-aided simultaneous communication and localisation (PASCAL) and illustrates its performance in the presence of practical gain and phase imperfections. Specifically, we consider the scenario where multiple single-antenna unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) transmit data packets to a multi-antenna base station (BS) that has the dual responsibility of detecting communication signals and localising UAVs using their pilot symbols. Two forms of receiver signal processing approaches are adopted, including disjoint localisation and communication by using maximum likelihood estimation and multiple signal classification (MUSIC), as well as joint localisation and data detection achieved by the newly proposed algorithms. To evaluate the asymptotic localisation performance in the presence of gain-phase imperfections, the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is derived, while for evaluating the communication's performance, the average sum data rate (SDR) for all the UAVs is derived in closed-form. It is shown that these derived expressions concur with simulations. The results reveal that while the proposed PASCAL system can be sensitive to gain-phase imperfections, it remains to be a powerful and efficient means to achieve reliable simultaneous localisation and communications.</description>

Abstract: The technological landscape is rapidly evolving toward large-scale systems. Networks supporting massive connectivity through numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices are at the forefront of this advancement. In this paper, we examine Wireless Power Transfer (WPT)-enabled networks, where a server requires to collect data from these IoT devices to compute a task with massive Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (mURLLC) services.} We focus on information freshness, using Age-of-Information (AoI) as the key performance metric. Specifically, we aim to minimize the maximum AoI among IoT devices by optimizing the scheduling policy. Our analytical findings demonstrate the convexity of the problem, enabling efficient solutions. We introduce the concept of AoI-oriented cluster capacity and analyze the relationship between the number of supported devices and network AoI performance. Numerical simulations validate our proposed approach's effectiveness in enhancing AoI performance, highlighting its potential for guiding the design of future IoT systems requiring mURLLC services.</description>

      <title>Truly Sub-Nyquist Generalized Eigenvalue Method with High-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02700</link>

Abstract: The achievement of spectral super-resolution sensing is critically important for a variety of applications, such as radar, remote sensing, and wireless communication. However, in compressed spectrum sensing, challenges such as spectrum leakage and the picket-fence effect significantly complicate the accurate extraction of super-resolution signal components. Additionally, the practical implementation of random sampling poses a significant hurdle to the widespread adoption of compressed spectrum sensing techniques. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a generalized eigenvalue method that leverages the incoherence between signal components and the linearity-preserving characteristics of differential operations. This method facilitates the precise extraction of signal component parameters with super-resolution capabilities under sub-Nyquist sampling conditions. The proposed technique is founded on uniform sub-Nyquist sampling, which represents a true sub-Nyquist approach and effectively mitigates the complexities associated with hardware implementation. Furthermore, the proposed method diverges from traditional compressed sensing techniques by operating outside the discrete Fourier transform framework. This departure successfully eliminates spectral leakage and the picket-fence effect. Moreover, it substantially reduces the detrimental impacts of random sampling on signal reconstruction and hardware implementation, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness and feasibility of spectral super-resolution sensing.</description>

      <title>What should a neuron aim for? Designing local objective functions based on information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In modern deep neural networks, the learning dynamics of the individual neurons is often obscure, as the networks are trained via global optimization. Conversely, biological systems build on self-organized, local learning, achieving robustness and efficiency with limited global information. We here show how self-organization between individual artificial neurons can be achieved by designing abstract bio-inspired local learning goals. These goals are parameterized using a recent extension of information theory, Partial Information Decomposition (PID), which decomposes the information that a set of information sources holds about an outcome into unique, redundant and synergistic contributions. Our framework enables neurons to locally shape the integration of information from various input classes, i.e. feedforward, feedback, and lateral, by selecting which of the three inputs should contribute uniquely, redundantly or synergistically to the output. This selection is expressed as a weighted sum of PID terms, which, for a given problem, can be directly derived from intuitive reasoning or via numerical optimization, offering a window into understanding task-relevant local information processing. Achieving neuron-level interpretability while enabling strong performance using local learning, our work advances a principled information-theoretic foundation for local learning strategies.</description>

      <title>Non-Transferability in Communication Channels and Tarski`s Truth Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08405v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article explores the concept of transferability within communication channels, with a particular focus on the inability to transmit certain situations through these channels. The Channel Non-Transferability Theorem establishes that no encoding-decoding mechanism can fully transmit all propositions, along with their truth values, from a transmitter to a receiver. The theorem underscores that when a communication channel attempts to transmit its own error state, it inevitably enters a non-transferable condition. I argue that Tarski`s Truth Undefinability Theorem parallels the concept of non-transferability in communication channels. As demonstrated in this article, the existence of non-transferable codes in communication theory is mathematically equivalent to the undefinability of truth as articulated in Tarski`s theorem. This equivalence is analogous to the relationship between the existence of non-computable functions in computer science and G\"odel`s First Incompleteness Theorem in mathematical logic. This new perspective sheds light on additional aspects of Tarski`s theorem, enabling a clearer expression and understanding of its implications.
  Keywords: Non-Transferability, Channel Theory, Tarski`s Truth Theorem, Semantic.</description>

      <title>On large Sidon sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Sidon set $M$ is a subset of $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ such that the sum of four distinct elements of $M$ is never 0. The goal is to find Sidon sets of large size. In this note we show that the graphs of almost perfect nonlinear (APN) functions with high linearity can be used to construct large Sidon sets. Thanks to recently constructed APN functions $\mathbb{F}_2^8\to \mathbb{F}_2^8$ with high linearity, we can construct Sidon sets of size 192 in $\mathbb{F}_2^{15}$, where the largest sets so far had size 152. Using the inverse and the Dobbertin function also gives larger Sidon sets as previously known. Each of the new large Sidon sets $M$ in $\mathbb{F}_2^t$ yields a binary linear code with $t$ check bits, minimum distance 5, and a length not known so far. Moreover, we improve the upper bound for the linearity of arbitrary APN functions.</description>

      <title>Mixed-Precision Quantization: Make the Best Use of Bits Where They Matter Most</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03101v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mixed-precision quantization offers superior performance to fixed-precision quantization. It has been widely used in signal processing, communication systems, and machine learning. In mixed-precision quantization, bit allocation is essential. Hence, in this paper, we propose a new bit allocation framework for mixed-precision quantization from a search perspective. First, we formulate a general bit allocation problem for mixed-precision quantization. Then we introduce the penalized particle swarm optimization (PPSO) algorithm to address the integer consumption constraint. To improve efficiency and avoid iterations on infeasible solutions within the PPSO algorithm, a greedy criterion particle swarm optimization (GC-PSO) algorithm is proposed. The corresponding convergence analysis is derived based on dynamical system theory. Furthermore, we apply the above framework to some specific classic fields, i.e., finite impulse response (FIR) filters, receivers, and gradient descent. Numerical examples in each application underscore the superiority of the proposed framework to the existing algorithms.</description>
