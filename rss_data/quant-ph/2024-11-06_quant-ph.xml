      <title>Reply to "Comment on "Unified Framework for Open Quantum Dynamics with Memory""</title>

Abstract: We present our response to the commentary piece by Makri {\it et al.} [arXiv:2410.08239], which raises critiques of our work [Nat. Commun. 15, 8087 (2024)]. In our paper, we considered various settings of open-quantum system dynamics, including non-commuting, non-diagonalizable system-bath coupling, and bosonic/spin/fermionic baths. For these, we showed a direct and explicit relationship between the discrete-time memory kernel ($\mathcal K$) of the generalized quantum master equation (GQME) and the discrete-time influence functions ($I$) of the path integrals. As an application of this, we showed one can construct $\mathcal K$ without projection-free dynamics inputs that conventional methods require, and we also presented a quantum sensing protocol that characterizes the bath spectral density from reduced system dynamics. As the Comment focused on the relationship between ($\mathcal K$) and $I$ in one specific setup (i.e., commuting, diagonalizable system-bath coupling with a bosonic bath), we focus on that aspect in this response. In summary, we could not find a set of equations that explicitly connect $I$ and $\mathcal K$ from Makri's 2020 paper [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 16, 4038 (2020)]. Furthermore, while our analysis is specific to the choice of discretization of path-integral and GQME, we have not found issues with the GQME discretization employed. As per critiques on citations, in our paper, we note that we had acknowledged Makri's driven SMatPI work and Wang and Cai's tree-based SMatPI work for the number of Dyck paths needed for the computation of the memory kernel.</description>

      <title>Time series and the meaning of quantum non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum non-locality has become a popular term. Yet, its precise meaning, and even its mere existence, is the subject of controversies. The main cause of the controversies is the never ending discussion on the appropriate definitions of Locality and Realism in the derivation of Bell's inequalities. On the other hand, Louis Sica derived Bell's inequalities from the hypothesis that time series of outcomes observed in one station do not change if the setting in the other (distant) station is changed. The derivation is based on arithmetical properties of time series only; it does not involve the definitions of Locality, Realism and probabilities, and is valid for series of any length. An important consequence is that violation of Bell's inequalities implies the series recorded (at the same time) in one station to be different if the setting in the other station is changed. This result gives precise meaning to the idea of quantum non-locality, and also makes evident why using it for faster than light signaling is impossible (because the difference is between factual and counter-factual series). Finally, it is demonstrated that series of outcomes, even if they violate Bell's inequalities, can be always embedded in a set of factual and counter-factual data that does hold to Bell's inequalities. Loosely speaking, the factual world may be quantum or not, but the union of factual and counter-factual worlds is always classical.</description>

      <title>Near-Optimal Quantum Algorithm for Finding the Longest Common Substring between Run-Length Encoded Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a near-optimal quantum algorithm for the longest common substring (LCS) problem between two run-length encoded (RLE) strings, with the assumption that the prefix-sums of the run-lengths are given.
  Our algorithm costs $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{2/3}/d^{1/6-o(1)}\cdot\mathrm{polylog}(\tilde{n}))$ time, while the query lower bound for the problem is $\tilde{\Omega}(n^{2/3}/d^{1/6})$, where $n$ and $\tilde{n}$ are the encoded and decoded length of the inputs, respectively, and $d$ is the encoded length of the LCS.
  We justify the use of prefix-sum oracles for two reasons. First, we note that creating the prefix-sum oracle only incurs a constant overhead in the RLE compression. Second, we show that, without the oracles, there is a $\Omega(n/\log^2n)$ lower bound on the quantum query complexity of finding the LCS given two RLE strings due to a reduction of $\mathsf{PARITY}$ to the problem.
  With a small modification, our algorithm also solves the longest repeated substring problem for an RLE string.</description>

      <title>qGDP: Quantum Legalization and Detailed Placement for Superconducting Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers are currently limited by their qubit numbers, which hampers progress towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. A major challenge in scaling these systems is crosstalk, which arises from unwanted interactions among neighboring components such as qubits and resonators. An innovative placement strategy tailored for superconducting quantum computers can systematically address crosstalk within the constraints of limited substrate areas.
  Legalization is a crucial stage in placement process, refining post-global-placement configurations to satisfy design constraints and enhance layout quality. However, existing legalizers are not supported to legalize quantum placements. We aim to address this gap with qGDP, developed to meticulously legalize quantum components by adhering to quantum spatial constraints and reducing resonator crossing to alleviate various crosstalk effects.
  Our results indicate that qGDP effectively legalizes and fine-tunes the layout, addressing the quantum-specific spatial constraints inherent in various device topologies. By evaluating diverse NISQ benchmarks. qGDP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art legalization engines, delivering substantial improvements in fidelity and reducing spatial violation, with average gains of 34.4x and 16.9x, respectively.</description>

      <title>A Coverage-Guided Testing Framework for Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) combine quantum computing and neural networks, leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement to improve machine learning models. These quantum characteristics enable QNNs to potentially outperform classical neural networks in tasks such as quantum chemistry simulations, optimization problems, and quantum-enhanced machine learning. However, they also introduce significant challenges in verifying the correctness and reliability of QNNs. To address this, we propose QCov, a set of test coverage criteria specifically designed for QNNs to systematically evaluate QNN state exploration during testing, focusing on superposition and entanglement. These criteria help detect quantum-specific defects and anomalies. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and QNN models validate QCov's effectiveness in identifying quantum-specific defects and guiding fuzz testing, thereby improving QNN robustness and reliability.</description>

      <title>Schmidt Decomposition of Multipartite States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states can be written in infinitely many ways depending on the choices of basis. Schmidt decomposition of a quantum state has a lot of properties useful in the study of entanglement. All bipartite states admit Schmidt decomposition, but this does not extend to multipartite systems. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of Schmidt decompositions of multipartite states. Moreover, we provide an efficient algorithm to obtain the decomposition for a Schmidt decomposable multipartite state.</description>

      <title>Quantized topological phases beyond square lattices in Floquet synthetic dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological effects manifest in a variety of lattice geometries. While square lattices, due to their simplicity, have been used for models supporting nontrivial topology, several exotic topological phenomena such as Dirac points, Weyl points and Haldane phases are most commonly supported by non-square lattices. Examples of prototypical non-square lattices include the honeycomb lattice of graphene and the Kagome lattice, both of which break fundamental symmetries and can exhibit quantized transport, especially when long-range hoppings and gauge fields are incorporated. The challenge of controllably realizing long-range hoppings and gauge fields has motivated a large body of research focused on harnessing lattices encoded in "synthetic" dimensions. Photons in particular have many internal degrees of freedom and hence show promise for implementing these synthetic dimensions; however, most photonic synthetic dimensions has hitherto created 1D or 2D square lattices. Here we show that non-square lattice Hamiltonians can be implemented using Floquet synthetic dimensions. Our construction uses dynamically modulated ring resonators and provides the capacity for direct $k$-space engineering of lattice Hamiltonians. Such a construction lifts constraints on the orthogonality of lattice vectors that make square geometries simpler to implement, and instead transfers the complexity to the engineering of complex Floquet drive signals. We simulate topological signatures of the Haldane and the brick-wall Haldane model and observe them to be robust in the presence of external optical drive and photon loss, and discuss unique characteristics of their topological transport when implemented on these Floquet lattices. Our proposal demonstrates the potential of driven-dissipative Floquet synthetic dimensions as a new architecture for $k$-space Hamiltonian simulation of high-dimensional lattice geometries.</description>

      <title>Scalable Quantum Simulations of Scattering in Scalar Field Theory on 120 Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulations of collisions of fundamental particles on a quantum computer are expected to have an exponential advantage over classical methods and promise to enhance searches for new physics. Furthermore, scattering in scalar field theory has been shown to be BQP-complete, making it a representative problem for which quantum computation is efficient. As a step toward large-scale quantum simulations of collision processes, scattering of wavepackets in one-dimensional scalar field theory is simulated using 120 qubits of IBM's Heron superconducting quantum computer ibm_fez. Variational circuits compressing vacuum preparation, wavepacket initialization, and time evolution are determined using classical resources. By leveraging physical properties of states in the theory, such as symmetries and locality, the variational quantum algorithm constructs scalable circuits that can be used to simulate arbitrarily-large system sizes. A new strategy is introduced to mitigate errors in quantum simulations, which enables the extraction of meaningful results from circuits with up to 4924 two-qubit gates and two-qubit gate depths of 103. The effect of interactions is clearly seen, and is found to be in agreement with classical Matrix Product State simulations. The developments that will be necessary to simulate high-energy inelastic collisions on a quantum computer are discussed.</description>

      <title>Scar-induced imbalance in staggered Rydberg ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the kinematically-constrained model of Rydberg atoms on a two-leg ladder with staggered detuning, $\Delta \in [0,1]$, has quantum many-body scars (QMBS) in its spectrum and represents a non-perturbative generalization of the paradigmatic PXP model defined on a chain. We show that these QMBS result in coherent many-body revivals and site-dependent magnetization dynamics for both N\'eel and Rydberg vacuum initial states around $\Delta=1$. The latter feature leads to eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH)-violating finite imbalance at long times in a disorder free system. This is further demonstrated by constructing appropriate local imbalance operators that display finite long-time averages for N\'eel and vacuum initial states. We also study the fidelity and Shannon entropy for such dynamics which, along with the presence of long-time finite imbalance, brings out the qualitatively different nature of QMBS in PXP ladders with $\Delta \sim 1$ from those in the PXP chain.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of dynamical quasi-condensation on a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hard-core bosons (HCB) in one dimension are predicted to show surprisingly interesting dynamics after a quantum quench. Far from equilibrium, quasi-condensation at finite momenta has been observed in numerical studies, while the equilibrium state at late times is expected to violate conventional thermodynamics. The integrability of the model supposedly constraints the momentum distribution to approach a generalized Gibbs ensemble. The experimental observation of these phenomena has proven non-trivial, as optical lattice platforms do not directly access the momentum distribution. NISQ devices overcome this limitation. We use circuit compression in order to simulate dynamics to arbitrarily long times with negligible Trotter-error on IBMQ and directly observe quasi-condensation. Coherence is maintained across all time scales as indicated by the lowest natural orbitals. The equilibrium distribution at late times is seemingly well described by a Gibbs ensemble, indicating that small but finite systematic errors perturb the hard-core boson model away from integrability. We demonstrate that quantum simulation provides observational access to HCB physics.</description>

      <title>Bethe Ansatz, Quantum Circuits, and the F-basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Bethe Ansatz is a method for constructing exact eigenstates of quantum-integrable spin chains. Recently, deterministic quantum algorithms, referred to as "algebraic Bethe circuits", have been developed to prepare Bethe states for the spin-1/2 XXZ model. These circuits represent a unitary formulation of the standard algebraic Bethe Ansatz, expressed using matrix-product states that act on both the spin chain and an auxiliary space. In this work, we systematize these previous results, and show that algebraic Bethe circuits can be derived by a change of basis in the auxiliary space. The new basis, identical to the "F-basis" known from the theory of quantum-integrable models, generates the linear superpositions of plane waves that are characteristic of the coordinate Bethe Ansatz. We explain this connection, highlighting that certain properties of the F-basis (namely, the exchange symmetry of the spins) are crucial for the construction of algebraic Bethe circuits. We demonstrate our approach by presenting new quantum circuits for the inhomogeneous spin-1/2 XXZ model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Linear System Solvers: A Survey of Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solving linear systems of equations plays a fundamental role in numerous computational problems from different fields of science. The widespread use of numerical methods to solve these systems motivates investigating the feasibility of solving linear systems problems using quantum computers. In this work, we provide a survey of the main advances in quantum linear systems algorithms, together with some applications. We summarize and analyze the main ideas behind some of the algorithms for the quantum linear systems problem in the literature. The analysis begins by examining the Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL) solver. We note its limitations and reliance on computationally expensive quantum methods, then highlight subsequent research efforts which aimed to address these limitations and optimize runtime efficiency and precision via various paradigms. We focus in particular on the post-HHL enhancements which have paved the way towards optimal lower bounds with respect to error tolerance and condition number. By doing so, we propose a taxonomy that categorizes these studies. Furthermore, by contextualizing these developments within the broader landscape of quantum computing, we explore the foundational work that have inspired and informed their development, as well as subsequent refinements. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of these algorithms in differential equations, quantum machine learning, and many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Polynomial-Time Classical Simulation of Noisy Circuits with Naturally Fault-Tolerant Gates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a polynomial-time classical algorithm that samples from the output distribution of low-depth noisy Clifford circuits with any product-state inputs and final single-qubit measurements in any basis. This class of circuits includes Clifford-magic circuits and Conjugated-Clifford circuits, which are important candidates for demonstrating quantum advantage using non-universal gates. Additionally, our results generalize a simulation algorithm for IQP circuits [Rajakumar et. al, SODA'25] to the case of IQP circuits augmented with CNOT gates, which is another class of non-universal circuits that are relevant to current experiments. Importantly, our results do not require randomness assumptions over the circuit families considered (such as anticoncentration properties) and instead hold for \textit{every} circuit in each class. This allows us to place tight limitations on the robustness of these circuits to noise. In particular, we show that there is no quantum advantage at large depths with realistically noisy Clifford circuits, even with perfect magic state inputs, or IQP circuits with CNOT gates, even with arbitrary diagonal non-Clifford gates. The key insight behind the algorithm is that interspersed noise causes a decay of long-range entanglement, and at depths beyond a critical threshold, the noise builds up to an extent that most correlations can be classically simulated. To prove our results, we merge techniques from percolation theory with tools from Pauli path analysis.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Computable One-Way Functions without One-Way Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a classical oracle relative to which $\mathsf{P} = \mathsf{NP}$ but quantum-computable quantum-secure trapdoor one-way functions exist. This is a substantial strengthening of the result of Kretschmer, Qian, Sinha, and Tal (STOC 2023), which only achieved single-copy pseudorandom quantum states relative to an oracle that collapses $\mathsf{NP}$ to $\mathsf{P}$. For example, our result implies multi-copy pseudorandom states and pseudorandom unitaries, but also classical-communication public-key encryption, signatures, and oblivious transfer schemes relative to an oracle on which $\mathsf{P}=\mathsf{NP}$. Hence, in our new relativized world, classical computers live in "Algorithmica" whereas quantum computers live in "Cryptomania," using the language of Impagliazzo's worlds.
  Our proof relies on a new distributional block-insensitivity lemma for $\mathsf{AC^0}$ circuits, wherein a single block is resampled from an arbitrary distribution.</description>

      <title>Optimizing random local Hamiltonians by dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in quantum simulation is to prepare low-energy states of strongly interacting many-body systems. In this work, we study the problem of preparing a quantum state that optimizes a random all-to-all, sparse or dense, spin or fermionic $k$-local Hamiltonian. We prove that a simplified quantum Gibbs sampling algorithm achieves a $\Omega(\frac{1}{k})$-fraction approximation of the optimum, giving an exponential improvement on the $k$-dependence over the prior best (both classical and quantum) algorithmic guarantees. Combined with the circuit lower bound for such states, our results suggest that finding low-energy states for sparsified (quasi)local spin and fermionic models is quantumly easy but classically nontrivial. This further indicates that quantum Gibbs sampling may be a suitable metaheuristic for optimization problems.</description>

      <title>On additive error approximations to #BQP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Counting complexity characterizes the difficulty of computing functions related to the number of valid certificates to efficiently verifiable decision problems. Here we study additive approximations to a quantum generalization of counting classes known as #BQP. First, we show that there exist efficient quantum algorithms that achieve additive approximations to #BQP problems to an error exponential in the number of witness qubits in the corresponding verifier circuit, and demonstrate that the level of approximation attained is, in a sense, optimal. We next give evidence that such approximations can not be efficiently achieved classically by showing that the ability to return such approximations is BQP-hard. We next look at the relationship between such additive approximations to #BQP and the complexity class DQC$_1$, showing that a restricted class of #BQP problems are DQC$_1$-complete.</description>

      <title>Multipartite entanglement structures in quantum stabilizer states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for visualizing the internal structure of multipartite entanglement in pure stabilizer states. Our algorithm graphically organizes the many-body correlations in a hierarchical structure. This provides a rich taxonomy from which one can extract a number of traditional quantities such as entanglement depth and entanglement entropy. Our construction is gauge invariant and goes beyond traditional entanglement measures by visually revealing how quantum information and entanglement is distributed. We use this tool to analyze the internal structures of prototypical stabilizer states (GHZ state, cluster state, stabilizer error correction codes) and are able to contrast the complexity of highly entangled volume law states generated by random unitary operators and random projective measurements.</description>

      <title>Random Distillation Protocols in Long Baseline Telescopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum-enhanced astronomical imaging, multiple distant apertures work together by utilizing quantum resources distributed from a central server. Our findings suggest that pre-processing the stellar light received by all telescopes can improve imaging performance without increasing resource consumption. The pre-processing leverages weak quantum measurements and modifies random-party entanglement distillation protocols from quantum information science. Intuitively, this approach allows us to collapse the stellar light that is originally coherent between all telescopes to one pair of telescopes with probability arbitrarily close to one. The central server can then distribute entanglement solely to the pair of telescopes receiving a photon, thereby enhancing the efficiency of resource utilization. We discuss two types of resources that benefit from this pre-processing: shared entanglement and a shared reference frame.</description>

      <title>Towards a universal gateset for $\mathsf{QMA}_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ is $\mathsf{QMA}$ with perfect completeness, i.e., the prover must accept with a probability of exactly $1$ in the YES-case. Whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ and $\mathsf{QMA}$ are equal is still a major open problem. It is not even known whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ has a universal gateset; Solovay-Kitaev does not apply due to perfect completeness. Hence, we do not generally know whether $\mathsf{QMA}_1^G=\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G'}$ (superscript denoting gateset), given two universal gatesets $G,G'$. In this paper, we make progress towards the gateset question by proving that for all $k\in\mathbb N$, the gateset $G_{2^k}$ (Amy et al., RC 2024) is universal for all gatesets in the cyclotomic field $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k}),\zeta_{2^k}=e^{2\pi i/2^k}$, i.e. $\mathsf{QMA}_1^G\subseteq\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all gatesets $G$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$. For $\mathsf{BQP}_1$, we can even show that $G_2$ suffices for all $2^k$-th cyclotomic fields. We exhibit complete problems for all $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$: Quantum $l$-SAT in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$ is complete for $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$ for all $l\ge4$, and $l=3$ if $k\ge3$, where quantum $l$-SAT is the problem of deciding whether a set of $l$-local Hamiltonians has a common ground state. Additionally, we give the first $\mathsf{QMA}_1$-complete $2$-local Hamiltonian problem: It is $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_{2^k}}$-complete (for $k\ge3$) to decide whether a given $2$-local Hamiltonian $H$ in $\mathbb{Q}(\zeta_{2^k})$ has a nonempty nullspace. Our techniques also extend to sparse Hamiltonians, and so we can prove the first $\mathsf{QMA}_1(2)$-complete (i.e. $\mathsf{QMA}_1$ with two unentangled provers) Hamiltonian problem. Finally, we prove that the Gapped Clique Homology problem defined by King and Kohler (FOCS 2024) is $\mathsf{QMA}_1^{G_2}$-complete, and the Clique Homology problem without promise gap is PSPACE-complete.</description>

      <title>Narrow optical linewidths in stoichiometric layered rare-earth crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rare-earth emitters in solids are well-suited for implementing efficient, long-lived quantum memory coupled to integrated photonics for scalable quantum technologies. They are typically introduced as dopants in a solid-state host, but this introduces disorder and limits the available density of emitters. Stoichiometric materials can offer high densities with narrow optical linewidths. The regular spacing of emitters also opens possibilities for quantum information processing and collective effects. Here we show narrow optical linewidths in a layered stoichiometric crystalline material, NaEu(IO$_3$)$_4$. We observed an inhomogeneous linewidth of 2.2(1) GHz and a homogeneous linewidth of 120(4) kHz. Using spectral hole-burning techniques, we observe a hyperfine spin lifetime of 1.9(4) s. Furthermore, we demonstrate an atomic frequency comb delay of up to 800 ns.</description>

      <title>Effects of position-dependent mass (PDM) on the bound-state solutions of a massive spin-0 particle subjected to the Yukawa potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advent of Albert Einstein's theory of special relativity, Klein and Gordon made the first attempt to elevate time to the status of a coordinate in the Schr\"odinger equation. In this study, we graphically discuss the eigenfunctions and eigenenergies of the Klein-Gordon equation with a Yukawa-type potential (YP), within a position-dependent mass (PDM) framework. We conclude that the PDM leads to the equivalence of the positive ($E^+$) and negative ($E^-$) solution states at low energies. We observe that in the energy spectrum as a function of $\eta$ (YP intensity factor), the PDM can induce gap closure at the critical point where $E^+$ and $E^-$ become imaginary. In the spectrum as a function of $\alpha$ (YP shielding factor), it can compel the energies to be zero at $\alpha=0$, instead of being equal to $(m_0c^2)$ as in the invariant mass case.</description>

      <title>Relating Quantum Tamper-Evident Encryption to Other Cryptographic Notions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum tamper-evident encryption scheme is a non-interactive symmetric-key encryption scheme mapping classical messages to quantum ciphertexts such that an honest recipient of a ciphertext can detect with high probability any meaningful eavesdropping. This quantum cryptographic primitive was first introduced by Gottesman in 2003. Beyond formally defining this security notion, Gottesman's work had three main contributions: showing that any quantum authentication scheme is also a tamper-evident scheme, noting that a quantum key distribution scheme can be constructed from any tamper-evident scheme, and constructing a prepare-and-measure tamper-evident scheme using only Wiesner states inspired by Shor and Preskill's proof of security for the BB84 quantum key distribution scheme.
  In this work, we further our understanding of tamper-evident encryption by formally relating it to other cryptographic primitives in an information-theoretic setting. In particular, we show that tamper evidence implies encryption, answering a question left open by Gottesman, we show that it can be constructed from any encryption scheme with revocation and vice-versa, and we formalize an existing sketch of a construction of quantum money from any tamper-evident encryption scheme. These results also yield as a corollary that any scheme allowing the revocation of a message must be an encryption scheme. Finally, we show separations between tamper evidence and other primitives, notably that tamper evidence does not imply authentication and does not imply uncloneable encryption.</description>

      <title>Expressivity of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic quantum computation with one qubit (DQC1) is of significant theoretical and practical interest due to its computational advantages in certain problems, despite its subuniversality with limited quantum resources. In this work, we introduce parameterized DQC1 as a quantum machine learning model. We demonstrate that the gradient of the measurement outcome of a DQC1 circuit with respect to its gate parameters can be computed directly using the DQC1 protocol. This allows for gradient-based optimization of DQC1 circuits, positioning DQC1 as the sole quantum protocol for both training and inference. We then analyze the expressivity of the parameterized DQC1 circuits, characterizing the set of learnable functions, and show that DQC1-based machine learning (ML) is as powerful as quantum neural networks based on universal computation. Our findings highlight the potential of DQC1 as a practical and versatile platform for ML, capable of rivaling more complex quantum computing models while utilizing simpler quantum resources.</description>

      <title>Practical, optimal preparation of general quantum state with exponentially improved robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02782v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation, as a general process of loading classical data to quantum device, is essential for end-to-end implementation of quantum algorithms. Yet, existing methods suffer from either high circuit depth or complicated hardware, limiting their practicality and robustness. In this work, we overcome these limitations with a bucket-brigade approach. The tree architectures of our hardware represents the simplest connectivity required for achieving sub-exponential circuit depth. Leveraging the bucket-brigade mechanism that can suppress the error propagation between different branches, our approach exhibit exponential improvement on the robustness compared to existing depth-optimal methods. More specifically, the infidelity scales as $O(\text{polylog}(N))$ with data size $N$, as oppose to $O(N)$ for conventional methods. Moreover, our approach is the first to simultaneously achieve linear Clifford$+T$ circuit depth, gate count number, and space-time allocation. These advancements offer the opportunity for processing big data in both near-term and fault-tolerant quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Synchronous manipulation of nuclear spins via boron vacancy centers in hexagonal boron nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a method for entangling operations on nuclear spins surrounding a negatively charged boron vacancy (VB-center) point defect in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). To this end, we propose to employ the electron spin of a VB-center as a control qubit. We show that in the presence of a background magnetic field and by applying control pulses one can collectively manipulate the state of the nuclei with $\hat{U}_z$ and $\hat{U}_x$ rotations. These rotations can serve for implementing the synchronous three-qubit $X$, $Z$, and the Hadamard gates. Through our numerical analyses considering realistic system parameters and the decoherence effects, we demonstrate that these gates can be executed with high fidelities. Furthermore, as an example for the application of our toolbox, we utilize these collective gates to prepare the highly entangled GHZ states among the three nuclear spins with a fidelity of $0.99$. By including the electron decoherence effects we find that the relative deviations of the gate fidelities from the noisy terms are negligibly small, proving the noise-resilience of our protocols. Our work can serve as the groundstone for exploiting the nuclear spins in hBN in future quantum technological applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation is a promising pathway toward practical quantum advantage by simulating large-scale quantum systems. In this work, we propose communication-efficient distributed quantum simulation protocols by exploring three quantum simulation algorithms, including the product formula, the truncated Taylor series, and the processing of quantum signals over a quantum network. Our protocols are further shown to be optimal by deriving a lower bound on the quantum communication complexity for distributed quantum simulations with respect to evolution time and the number of distributed quantum processing units. Additionally, our distributed techniques go beyond quantum simulation and are applied to distributed versions of Grover's algorithms and quantum phase estimation. Our work not only paves the way for achieving a practical quantum advantage by scalable quantum simulation but also enlightens the design of more general distributed architectures across various physical systems for quantum computation.</description>

Abstract: The modern Hopfield network, proposed by Krotov and Hopfield, is a mathematical generalization of the Hopfield network, which is a basic model of associative memory that employs higher-order interactions. This study introduces an open quantum model for discrete modern Hopfield networks that generalizes the open quantum Hopfield network. Our model integrates dissipative quantum spin systems, governed by quantum master equations, with classical hopping terms and additional quantum effects through a transverse field. We analytically examined the behavior of the stable fixed points and numerically determined the phase diagram. The results demonstrated qualitatively distinct behaviors from the open quantum Hopfield network, showing that the ferromagnetic and limit cycle phases have additional stable fixed points.</description>

      <title>Generally covariant evolution equations from a cognitive treatment of time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The treatment of time in relativity does not conform to that in quantum theory. To resolve the discrepancy, a formalization of time is introduced in an accompanying paper, starting from the assumption that the treatment of time in physics must agree with our cognition. The formalization has two components: sequential time $n$ and relational time $t$. The evolution of physical states is described in terms of $n$. The role of $t$ is to quantify distances between events in space-time. There is a space-time associated with each $n$, in which $t$ represents the knowledge at time $n$ about temporal distances between present and past events. This approach leads to quantum evolution equations expressed in terms of a continuous evolution parameter $\sigma$, which interpolates between discrete sequential times $n$. Rather than describing the evolution of the world at large, these evolution equations provide probabilites of a set of predefined outcomes in well-defined experimental contexts. When the context is designed to measure spatio-temporal position $(x,t)$, time $t$ becomes an observable with Heisenberg uncertainty $\Delta t$ on the same footing as $x$. The corresponding evolution equation attains the same symmetric form as that suggested by Stueckelberg in 1941. When the context is such that the metric of space-time is measured, the corresponding evolution equation may be seen as an expression of quantum gravity. In short, the aim of this paper is to propose a coherent conceptual basis for the treatment of time in evolution equations, in so doing clarifying their meaning and domain of validity.</description>

      <title>Quantum machine learning for multiclass classification beyond kernel methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is considered one of the current research fields with immense potential. In recent years, Havl\'i\v{c}ek et al. [Nature 567, 209-212 (2019)] have proposed a quantum machine learning algorithm with quantum-enhanced feature spaces, which effectively addressed a binary classification problem on a superconducting processor and offered a potential pathway to achieving quantum advantage. However, a straightforward binary classification algorithm falls short in solving multiclass classification problems. In this paper, we propose a quantum algorithm that rigorously demonstrates that quantum kernel methods enhance the efficiency of multiclass classification in real-world applications, providing a clear quantum advantage. To demonstrate quantum advantage, we design six distinct quantum kernels within the quantum algorithm to map input data into quantum state spaces and estimate the corresponding quantum kernel matrices. The results from quantum simulations reveal that the quantum algorithm outperforms its classical counterpart in handling six real-world multiclass classification problems. Furthermore, we leverage a family of performance metrics to comprehensively evaluate the classification performance of the quantum algorithm. The results indicate that the quantum algorithm achieves satisfactory classification accuracy and excels in terms of precision, recall, and F1 score for macroaverage, microaverage, and weighted average methods.</description>

      <title>Almost Linear Decoder for Optimal Geometrically Local Quantum Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02928v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Geometrically local quantum codes, which are error-correcting codes embedded in $\mathbb{R}^D$ with the checks only acting on qubits within a fixed spatial distance, have garnered significant interest. Recently, it has been demonstrated how to achieve geometrically local codes that maximize both the dimension and the distance, as well as the energy barrier of the code. In this work, we focus on the constructions involving subdivision and show that they have an almost linear time decoder, obtained by combining the decoder of the outer good qLDPC code and a generalized version of the Union-Find decoder. This provides the first decoder for an optimal 3D geometrically local code. We also consider the decoder under random circuit level noise and demonstrate the existence of a finite threshold error rate.</description>

      <title>Fast Unconditional Reset and Leakage Reduction of a Tunable Superconducting Qubit via an Engineered Dissipative Bath</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid and accurate initialization of qubits, reset, is a crucial building block for various tasks in quantum information processing, such as quantum error-correction and estimation of statistics of noisy quantum devices with many qubits. We demonstrate unconditional reset of a frequency-tunable transmon qubit that simultaneously resets multiple excited states by utilizing a metamaterial waveguide engineered to provide a cold bath over a wide spectral range, while providing strong protection against Purcell decay of the qubit. We report reset error below 0.13% (0.16%) when prepared in the first (second) excited state of the transmon within 88ns. Additionally, through the sharp roll-off in the density of states of the metamaterial waveguide, we implement a leakage reduction unit that selectively resets the transmon's second excited state to 0.285(3)% residual population within 44ns while acting trivially in the computational subspace as an identity operation that preserves encoded information with an infidelity of 0.72(1)%.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic quantum teleportation with ensembles of qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop methods for performing quantum teleportation of the total spin variables of an unknown state, using quantum nondemolition measurements, spin projection measurements, and classical communication. While theoretically teleportation of high-dimensional states can be attained with the assumption of generalized Bell measurements, this is typically experimentally non-trivial to implement. We introduce two protocols and show that, on average, the teleportation succeeds in teleporting the spin variables of a spin coherent state with average zero angular error in the ideal case, beating classical strategies based on quantum state estimation. In a single run of the teleportation, there is an angular error at the level of ~ 0.1 radians for large ensembles. A potential physical implementation for the scheme is with atomic ensembles and quantum nondemolition measurements performed with light. We analyze the decoherence of the protocols and find that the protocol is robust even in the limit of large ensemble sizes.</description>

      <title>Quantum surface effects on quantum emitters coupled to surface plasmon polariton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As an ideal platform to explore strong quantized light-matter interactions, surface plasmon polariton (SPP) has inspired many applications in quantum technologies. It was recently found that quantum surface effects (QSEs) of the metal, including nonlocal optical response, electron spill-out, and Landau damping, contribute additional loss sources to the SPP. Such a deteriorated loss of the SPP severely hinders its realization of long-distance quantum interconnect. Here, we investigate the non-Markovian dynamics of quantum emitters (QEs) coupled to a common SPP in the presence of the QSEs in a planar metal-dielectric nanostructure. A mechanism to overcome the dissipation of the QEs caused by the lossy SPP is discovered. We find that, as long as the QE-SPP bound states favored by the QSEs are formed, a dissipationless entanglement among the QEs is created. It leads to that the separated QEs are coherently correlated in a manner of the Rabi-like oscillation mediated by the SPP even experiencing the metal absorption. Our study on the QSEs refreshes our understanding of the light-matter interactions in the absorptive medium and paves the way for applying the SPP in quantum interconnect.</description>

      <title>A variational quantum algorithm for tackling multi-dimensional Poisson equations with inhomogeneous boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design a variational quantum algorithm to solve multi-dimensional Poisson equations with mixed boundary conditions that are typically required in various fields of computational science. Employing an objective function that is formulated with the concept of the minimal potential energy, we not only present in-depth discussion on the cost-efficient &amp; noise-robust design of quantum circuits that are essential for evaluation of the objective function, but, more remarkably, employ the proposed algorithm to calculate bias-dependent spatial distributions of electric fields in semiconductor systems that are described with a two-dimensional domain and up to 10-qubit circuits. Extending the application scope to multi-dimensional problems with mixed boundary conditions for the first time, fairly solid computational results of this work clearly demonstrate the potential of variational quantum algorithms to tackle Poisson equations derived from physically meaningful problems.</description>

      <title>Scalable multipartite entanglement criteria for continuous variables</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multipartite entanglement detection is crucial for the develop of quantum information science and quantum computation, communication, simulation and metrology tasks. In contrast to experiments, where several handreds of qubits have been entangled to build a quantum computer or a quantum simulator, theoretically only for lower dimensional quantum system such as two qubit system or two-mode Gaussian state and some special quantum states, efficient criteria have been developed to detect the entanglement. An efficient and practical entanglement detection method is anticipated to appear for current scalable quantum system. Based on the matched entanglement witness scheme and integrated uncertainty relations, we propose a quite general entanglement detection method for all kinds of multipartite entanglement of multimode continuous variable systems. With the covariance matrix of any randomly generated multimode continuous variable quantum state, our criterion can detect entanglement, genuine entanglement and other kinds of inseparabilities almost imidiately.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Pure-State Consistency of Local Density Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the computational complexity of the pure consistency of local density matrices ($\mathsf{PureCLDM}$) and pure $N$-representability ($\mathsf{Pure}$-$N$-$\mathsf{Representability}$) problems. In these problems the input is a set of reduced density matrices and the task is to determine whether there exists a global \emph{pure} state consistent with these reduced density matrices. While mixed $\mathsf{CLDM}$, i.e. where the global state can be mixed, was proven to be $\mathsf{QMA}$-complete by Broadbent and Grilo [JoC 2022], almost nothing was known about the complexity of the pure version. Before our work the best upper and lower bounds were $\mathsf{QMA}(2)$ and $\mathsf{QMA}$. Our contribution to the understanding of these problems is twofold.
  Firstly, we define a pure state analogue of the complexity class $\mathsf{QMA}^+$ of Aharanov and Regev [FOCS 2003], which we call $\mathsf{PureSuperQMA}$. We prove that both $\mathsf{Pure}$-$N$-$\mathsf{Representability}$ and $\mathsf{PureCLDM}$ are complete for this new class. Along the way we supplement Broadbent and Grilo by proving hardness for 2-qubit reduced density matrices and showing that mixed $N$-$\mathsf{Representability}$ is $\mathsf{QMA}$ complete.
  Secondly, we improve the upper bound on $\mathsf{PureCLDM}$. Using methods from algebraic geometry, we prove that $\mathsf{PureSuperQMA} \subseteq \mathsf{PSPACE}$. Our methods, and the $\mathsf{PSPACE}$ upper bound, are also valid for $\mathsf{PureCLDM}$ with exponential or even perfect precision, hence $\mathsf{precisePureCLDM}$ is not $\mathsf{preciseQMA}(2) = \mathsf{NEXP}$-complete, unless $\mathsf{PSPACE} = \mathsf{NEXP}$. We view this as evidence for a negative answer to the longstanding open question whether $\mathsf{PureCLDM}$ is $\mathsf{QMA}(2)$-complete.</description>

      <title>Multiple-basis representation of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical simulation of quantum physics is a central approach to investigating physical phenomena. Quantum computers enhance computational capabilities beyond those of classical resources, but it remains unclear to what extent existing limited quantum computers can contribute to this enhancement. In this work, we explore a new hybrid, efficient quantum-classical representation of quantum states, the multiple-basis representation. This representation consists of a linear combination of states that are sparse in some given and different bases, specified by quantum circuits. Such representation is particularly appealing when considering depth-limited quantum circuits within reach of current hardware. We analyze the expressivity of multiple-basis representation states depending on the classical simulability of their quantum circuits. In particular, we show that multiple-basis representation states include, but are not restricted to, both matrix-product states and stabilizer states. Furthermore, we find cases in which this representation can be used, namely approximation of ground states, simulation of deeper computations by specifying bases with shallow circuits, and a tomographical protocol to describe states as multiple-basis representations. We envision this work to open the path of simultaneous use of several hardware-friendly bases, a natural description of hybrid computational methods accessible for near-term hardware.</description>

      <title>Proposals for 3D self-correcting quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A self-correcting quantum memory is a type of quantum error correcting code that can correct errors passively through cooling. A major open question in the field is whether self-correcting quantum memories can exist in 3D. In this work, we propose two candidate constructions for 3D self-correcting quantum memories. The first construction is an extension of Haah's code, which retains translation invariance. The second construction is based on fractals with greater flexibility in its design. Additionally, we review existing 3D quantum codes and suggest that they are not self-correcting.</description>

      <title>All three-angle variants of Tsirelson's precession protocol, and improved bounds for wedge integrals of Wigner functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tsirelson's precession protocol is a nonclassicality witness that can be defined for both discrete and continuous variable systems. Its original version involves measuring a precessing observable, like the quadrature of a harmonic oscillator or a component of angular momentum, along three equally-spaced angles. In this work, we characterise all three-angle variants of this protocol. For continuous variables, we show that the maximum score $\mathbf{P}_3^\infty$ achievable by the quantum harmonic oscillator is the same for all such generalised protocols. We also derive markedly tighter bounds for $\mathbf{P}_3^\infty$, both rigorous and conjectured, which translate into improved bounds on the amount of negativity a Wigner function may have in certain wedge-shaped regions of phase space. For discrete variables, we show that changing the angles significantly improves the score for most spin systems. Like the original protocol, these generalised variants can detect non-Gaussian and multipartite entanglement when applied on composite systems. Overall, this work broadens the scope of Tsirelson's original protocol, making it capable to detect the nonclassicality and entanglement of many more states.</description>

      <title>Efficient Hamiltonian, structure and trace distance learning of Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we initiate the study of Hamiltonian learning for positive temperature bosonic Gaussian states, the quantum generalization of the widely studied problem of learning Gaussian graphical models. We obtain efficient protocols, both in sample and computational complexity, for the task of inferring the parameters of their underlying quadratic Hamiltonian under the assumption of bounded temperature, squeezing, displacement and maximal degree of the interaction graph. Our protocol only requires heterodyne measurements, which are often experimentally feasible, and has a sample complexity that scales logarithmically with the number of modes. Furthermore, we show that it is possible to learn the underlying interaction graph in a similar setting and sample complexity. Taken together, our results put the status of the quantum Hamiltonian learning problem for continuous variable systems in a much more advanced state when compared to spins, where state-of-the-art results are either unavailable or quantitatively inferior to ours. In addition, we use our techniques to obtain the first results on learning Gaussian states in trace distance with a quadratic scaling in precision and polynomial in the number of modes, albeit imposing certain restrictions on the Gaussian states. Our main technical innovations are several continuity bounds for the covariance and Hamiltonian matrix of a Gaussian state, which are of independent interest, combined with what we call the local inversion technique. In essence, the local inversion technique allows us to reliably infer the Hamiltonian of a Gaussian state by only estimating in parallel submatrices of the covariance matrix whose size scales with the desired precision, but not the number of modes. This way we bypass the need to obtain precise global estimates of the covariance matrix, controlling the sample complexity.</description>

      <title>A unifying framework for quantum simulation algorithms for time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing interest in simulating time-dependent Hamiltonians using quantum algorithms, driven by diverse applications, such as quantum adiabatic computing. While techniques for simulating time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics are well-established, time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics is less explored and it is unclear how to systematically organize existing methods and to find new methods. Sambe-Howland's continuous clock elegantly transforms time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics into time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics, which means that by taking different discretizations, existing methods for time-independent Hamiltonian dynamics can be exploited for time-dependent dynamics. In this work, we systemically investigate how Sambe-Howland's clock can serve as a unifying framework for simulating time-dependent Hamiltonian dynamics. Firstly, we demonstrate the versatility of this approach by showcasing its compatibility with analog quantum computing and digital quantum computing. Secondly, for digital quantum computers, we illustrate how this framework, combined with time-independent methods (e.g., product formulas, multi-product formulas, qDrift, and LCU-Taylor), can facilitate the development of efficient algorithms for simulating time-dependent dynamics. This framework allows us to (a) resolve the problem of finding minimum-gate time-dependent product formulas; (b) establish a unified picture of both Suzuki's and Huyghebaert and De Raedt's approaches; (c) generalize Huyghebaert and De Raedt's first and second-order formula to arbitrary orders; (d) answer an unsolved question in establishing time-dependent multi-product formulas; (e) and recover continuous qDrift on the same footing as time-independent qDrift. Thirdly, we demonstrate the efficacy of our newly developed higher-order Huyghebaert and De Raedt's algorithm through digital adiabatic simulation.</description>

      <title>Frequency locking: a distinctive feature of the coherent population trapping and the stationarity effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the case where phase modulation of the harmonic signal is used to obtain the error signal for the frequency stabilization to a reference atomic transition. High-frequency modulation, or analog of the Pound-Drever-Hall regime, is considered. We demonstrate that for coherent population trapping, the maximal error-signal slope retains at a certain level with growth in the modulation frequency, while for other types of resonances it drops steadily. The investigation of the low-frequency modulation regime reveals the stationarity effect. We show that in this case, the maximal steepness of the error signal does not depend on the modulation frequency and is reached at a fixed value of the frequency deviation.</description>

      <title>Pseudorandom Function-like States from Common Haar Unitary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent active studies have demonstrated that cryptography without one-way functions (OWFs) could be possible in the quantum world. Many fundamental primitives that are natural quantum analogs of OWFs or pseudorandom generators (PRGs) have been introduced, and their mutual relations and applications have been studied. Among them, pseudorandom function-like state generators (PRFSGs) [Ananth, Qian, and Yuen, Crypto 2022] are one of the most important primitives. PRFSGs are a natural quantum analogue of pseudorandom functions (PRFs), and imply many applications such as IND-CPA secret-key encryption (SKE) and EUF-CMA message authentication code (MAC). However, only known constructions of (many-query-secure) PRFSGs are ones from OWFs or pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs). In this paper, we construct classically-accessible adaptive secure PRFSGs in the invertible quantum Haar random oracle (QHRO) model which is introduced in [Chen and Movassagh, Quantum]. The invertible QHRO model is an idealized model where any party can access a public single Haar random unitary and its inverse, which can be considered as a quantum analog of the random oracle model. Our PRFSG constructions resemble the classical Even-Mansour encryption based on a single permutation, and are secure against any unbounded polynomial number of queries to the oracle and construction. To our knowledge, this is the first application in the invertible QHRO model without any assumption or conjecture. The previous best construction in the idealized model is PRFSGs secure up to o({\lambda}/ log {\lambda}) queries in the common Haar state model [Ananth, Gulati, and Lin, TCC 2024].</description>

      <title>Architectures for Heterogeneous Quantum Error Correction Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) is essential for future quantum computers due to its ability to exponentially suppress physical errors. The surface code is a leading error-correcting code candidate because of its local topological structure, experimentally achievable thresholds, and support for universal gate operations with magic states. However, its physical overhead scales quadratically with number of correctable errors. Conversely, quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes offer superior scaling but lack, on their own, a clear path to universal logical computation. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly evident is becoming that there are significant advantages to designing architectures using multiple codes. Heterogeneous architectures provide a clear path to universal logical computation as well as the ability to access different resource trade offs. To address this, we propose integrating the surface code and gross code using an ancilla bus for inter-code data movement. This approach involves managing trade-offs, including qubit overhead, a constrained instruction set, and gross code (memory) routing and management. While our focus is on the gross-surface code architecture, our method is adaptable to any code combination and the constraints generated by that specific architecture. Motivated by the potential reduction of physical qubit overhead, an ever important feature in the realization of fault tolerant computation, we perform the first full system study of heterogeneous error-correcting codes, discovering architectural trade-offs and optimizing around them. We demonstrate physical qubit reductions of up to 6.42x when executing an algorithm to a specific logical error rate, at the cost of up to a 3.43x increase in execution time.</description>

      <title>PRS Length Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most fundamental results in classical cryptography is that the existence of Pseudo-Random Generators (PRG) that expands $k$ bits of randomness to $k+1$ bits that are pseudo-random implies the existence of PRG that expand $k$ bits of randomness to $k+f(k)$ bits for any $f(k)=poly(k)$.
  It appears that cryptography in the quantum realm sometimes works differently than in the classical case. Pseudo-random quantum states (PRS) are a key primitive in quantum cryptography, that demonstrates this point. There are several open questions in quantum cryptography about PRS, one of them is - can we expand quantum pseudo-randomness in a black-box way with the same key length? Although this is known to be possible in the classical case, the answer in the quantum realm is more complex. This work conjectures that some PRS generators can be expanded, and provides a proof for such expansion for some specific examples. In addition, this work demonstrates the relationship between the key length required to expand the PRS, the efficiency of the circuit to create it and the length of the resulting expansion.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Independent Set and Laplacian of an independence complex are QMA-hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Independent Set is a well known NP-hard optimization problem. In this work, we define a fermionic generalization of the Independent Set problem and prove that the optimization problem is QMA-hard in a $k$-particle subspace using perturbative gadgets. We discuss how the Fermionic Independent Set is related to the problem of computing the minimum eigenvalue of the $k^{\text{th}}$-Laplacian of an independence complex of a vertex weighted graph. Consequently, we use the same perturbative gadget to prove QMA-hardness of the later problem resolving an open conjecture from arXiv:2311.17234 and give the first example of a natural topological data analysis problem that is QMA-hard.</description>

      <title>Quantum Error Mitigation via Linear-Depth Verifier Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Implementing many important sub-circuits on near-term quantum devices remains a challenge due to the high levels of noise and the prohibitive depth on standard nearest-neighbour topologies. Overcoming these barriers will likely require quantum error mitigation (QEM) strategies. This work introduces the notion of efficient, high-fidelity verifier circuit architectures that we propose for use in such a QEM scheme. We provide a method for constructing verifier circuits for any quantum circuit that is accurately represented by a low-dimensional matrix product operator (MPO). We demonstrate our method by constructing explicit verifier circuits for multi-controlled single unitary gates as well as the quantum Fourier transform (QFT). By transpiling the circuits to a 2D array of qubits, we estimate the crossover point where the verifier circuit is shallower than the circuit itself, and hence useful for QEM. We propose a method of in situ QEM using the verifier circuit architecture. We conclude that our approach may be useful for calibrating quantum sub-circuits to counter coherent noise but cannot correct for the incoherent noise present in current devices.</description>

      <title>Error Interference in Quantum Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding algorithmic error accumulation in quantum simulation is crucial due to its fundamental significance and practical applications in simulating quantum many-body system dynamics. Conventional theories typically apply the triangle inequality to provide an upper bound for the error. However, these often yield overly conservative and inaccurate estimates as they neglect error interference -- a phenomenon where errors in different segments can destructively interfere. Here, we introduce a novel method that directly estimates the long-time algorithmic errors with multiple segments, thereby establishing a comprehensive framework for characterizing algorithmic error interference. We identify the sufficient and necessary condition for strict error interference and introduce the concept of approximate error interference, which is more broadly applicable to scenarios such as power-law interaction models, the Fermi-Hubbard model, and higher-order Trotter formulas. Our work demonstrates significant improvements over prior ones and opens new avenues for error analysis in quantum simulation, offering potential advancements in both theoretical algorithm design and experimental implementation of Hamiltonian simulation.</description>

      <title>Robust self-testing for nonlocal games with robust game algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an operator-algebraic formulation of robust self-testing in terms of states on C*-algebras. We show that a quantum correlation p is a robust self-test only if among all (abstract) states, there is a unique one achieving p. We show that the "if" direction of this statement also holds, provided that p is optimal/perfect for a nonlocal game that has a robust game algebra. This last condition applies to many nonlocal games of interest, including all XOR games, synchronous games, and boolean constrained system (BCS) games.
  For those nonlocal games with robust game algebras, we prove that self-testing is equivalent to the uniqueness of finite-dimensional tracial states on the associated game algebra, and robust self-testing is equivalent to the uniqueness of amenable tracial states. Applying this tracial-state characterization of self-testing to parallel repetition, we show that a synchronous game is a self-test for perfect quantum strategies if and only if its parallel repeated version is a self-test for perfect quantum strategies.
  As a proof approach, we give the first quantitative Gower-Hatami theorem that is applicable to C*-algebras. Here "quantitative" means there is a constructive bound on the distance between the approximate representations and exact representations. We also demonstrate how this quantitative Gowers-Hatami theorem can be used to calculate the explicit robustness function of a self-test.</description>

      <title>ShadowGPT: Learning to Solve Quantum Many-Body Problems from Randomized Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose ShadowGPT, a novel approach for solving quantum many-body problems by learning from randomized measurement data collected from quantum experiments. The model is a generative pretrained transformer (GPT) trained on simulated classical shadow data of ground states of quantum Hamiltonians, obtained through randomized Pauli measurements. Once trained, the model can predict a range of ground state properties across the Hamiltonian parameter space. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the transverse-field Ising model and the $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster-Ising model, accurately predicting ground state energy, correlation functions, and entanglement entropy. This approach highlights the potential of combining quantum data with classical machine learning to address complex quantum many-body challenges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of genuine tripartite non-Gaussian entanglement in a quantum gravitational system formed by a quantum harmonic oscillator coupled to a single frequency of a quantized gravitational wave. For this purpose, we introduce a new entanglement witness, well-suited for the graviton-matter interaction Hamiltonian analysed here. We show that the witness is non-zero for the three-mode states generated by the Hamiltonian when the system starts in the ground state, thus proving the generation of genuine multipartite quantum entanglement at the most fundamental level of theoretical graviton-matter interactions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We exhibit a total search problem whose communication complexity in the quantum SMP (simultaneous message passing) model is exponentially smaller than in the classical two-way randomized model. Moreover, the quantum protocol is computationally efficient and its solutions are classically verifiable, that is, the problem lies in the communication analogue of the class TFNP. Our problem is a bipartite version of a query complexity problem recently introduced by Yamakawa and Zhandry (JACM 2024). We prove the classical lower bound using the structure-vs-randomness paradigm for analyzing communication protocols.</description>

      <title>Low-Overhead Entangling Gates from Generalised Dehn Twists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalise the implementation of logical quantum gates via Dehn twists from topological codes to the hypergraph and balanced products of cyclic codes. These generalised Dehn twists implement logical entangling gates with no additional qubit overhead and $\mathcal{O}(d)$ time overhead. Due to having more logical degrees of freedom in the codes, there is a richer structure of attainable logical gates compared to those for topological codes. To illustrate the scheme, we focus on families of hypergraph and balanced product codes that scale as $[[18q^2,8,2q]]_{q\in \mathbb{N}}$ and $[[18q,8,\leq 2q]]_{q\in \mathbb{N}}$ respectively. For distance 6 to 12 hypergraph product codes, we find that the set of twists and fold-transversal gates generate the full logical Clifford group. For the balanced product code, we show that Dehn twists apply to codes in this family with odd $q$. We also show that the $[[90,8,10]]$ bivariate bicycle code is a member of the balanced product code family that saturates the distance bound. We also find balanced product codes that saturate the bound up to $q\leq8$ through a numerical search.</description>

      <title>Quantum One-Time Protection of any Randomized Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The meteoric rise in power and popularity of machine learning models dependent on valuable training data has reignited a basic tension between the power of running a program locally and the risk of exposing details of that program to the user. At the same time, fundamental properties of quantum states offer new solutions to data and program security that can require strikingly few quantum resources to exploit, and offer advantages outside of mere computational run time. In this work, we demonstrate such a solution with quantum one-time tokens.
  A quantum one-time token is a quantum state that permits a certain program to be evaluated exactly once. One-time security guarantees, roughly, that the token cannot be used to evaluate the program more than once. We propose a scheme for building quantum one-time tokens for any randomized classical program, which include generative AI models. We prove that the scheme satisfies an interesting definition of one-time security as long as outputs of the classical algorithm have high enough min-entropy, in a black box model.
  Importantly, the classical program being protected does not need to be implemented coherently on a quantum computer. In fact, the size and complexity of the quantum one-time token is independent of the program being protected, and additional quantum resources serve only to increase the security of the protocol. Due to this flexibility in adjusting the security, we believe that our proposal is parsimonious enough to serve as a promising candidate for a near-term useful demonstration of quantum computing in either the NISQ or early fault tolerant regime.</description>

      <title>Degeneracies In a Weighted Sum of Two Squares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is an attempt to classify and quantify instances when a weighted sum of two squares of positive integers, $3n_{1}^2+n_{2}^2$, can be realized in more than one way. Our project was inspired by a particular study of two-dimensional quantum billiards [S. G. Jackson, H. Perrin, G. E. Astrakharchik, and M. Olshanii, SciPost Phys. Core 7, 062 (2024)] where the weighted sums of interest represents an energy level with the two integers being the billiard's quantum numbers; there, the 3-fold degeneracies seem to dominate the energy spectrum. Interestingly, contrary to the conventional paradigm, these degeneracies are not caused by some non-commuting symmetries of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in insulators and superconductors are known for their robust edge modes, linked to bulk invariants through the bulk-boundary correspondence. While this principle traditionally applies to gapped phases, recent advances have extended it to gapless systems, where topological edge states persist even in the absence of a bulk gap. We extend this framework to periodically driven chains with chiral symmetry, revealing the existence of topological edge zero- and pi-modes despite the lack of bulk gaps in the quasienergy spectrum. By examining the half-period decomposition of chiral evolutions, we construct topological invariants that circumvent the need to define the Floquet Hamiltonian, making them more suitable for generalization to the gapless regime. We provide explicit examples, including generalizations of the Kitaev chain and related spin models, where localized pi-modes emerge even when the bulk is gapless at the same quasi-energy as the edge modes. We numerically study the effect of interactions, which give a finite lifetime to the edge modes in the thermodynamic limit with the decay rate consistent with Fermi's Golden Rule.</description>

      <title>On Complexity and Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the relationship between complexity and duality in quantum systems, focusing on how local and non-local operators evolve under time evolution. We find that non-local operators, which are dual to local operators under specific mappings, exhibit behavior that mimics the growth of their local counterparts, particularly when considering state complexity. For the open transverse Ising model this leads to a neat organisation of the operator dynamics on either side of the duality, both consistent with growth expected in a quadratic fermion model like the Kitaev chain. When examing periodic chains, however, the mapping of boundary terms provides access to multiple branches of highly complex operators. These give rise to much larger saturation values of complexity for parity-mixing operators and are in contrast to what one would expect for a quadratic Hamiltonian. Our results shed light on the intricate relationship between non-locality, complexity growth, and duality in quantum systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we investigate the code properties of holographic fractal geometries initiated in \cite{Pastawski:2016qrs}. We study reconstruction wedges in $AdS_3/CFT_2$ for black hole backgrounds, which are in qualitative agreement with the vacuum-AdS approximation using generalized entanglement entropy in \cite{Bao:2022tgv}. In higher dimensions, we study reconstruction wedges for the infinite, straight strip in $AdS_{d+1}/CFT_{d}$ and clarify the roles of `straight' and `infinite' in their code properties. Lastly, we comment on uberholography from the perspective of complexity transfer and one-shot holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate relativistic effects on the performance of a quantum battery in an open quantum framework. We consider an Unruh-DeWitt detector driven by a coherent classical pulse as a quantum battery that is interacting with a massless scalar field through a quadratic coupling. The battery follows a trajectory composed of uniform acceleration along one direction, combined with constant four-velocity components in the orthogonal plane to the acceleration. Accelerated motion degrades the performance of the quantum battery rapidly in the absence of the orthogonal velocity component. We show that the quadratic scalar field coupling enhances coherence and stability in the presence of orthogonal velocity. We observe that decoherence is mitigated significantly, resulting in remarkable improvement in the battery capacity and efficiency compared to the case of the usual linear field coupling. This opens up the possibility of nonlinear environmental coupling enabling stored energy to be retained over longer durations, leading to more efficient operation of quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of a superconducting flux qubit to single bismuth donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The realization of a quantum computer represents a tremendous scientific and technological challenge due to the extreme fragility of quantum information. The physical support of information, namely the quantum bit or qubit, must at the same time be strongly coupled to other qubits by gates to compute information, and well decoupled from its environment to keep its quantum behavior. An interesting physical system for realizing such qubits are magnetic impurities in semiconductors, such as bismuth donors in silicon. Indeed, spins associated to bismuth donors can reach an extremely long coherence time -- of the order of seconds. Yet it is extremely difficult to establish and control efficient gates between these spins. Here we demonstrate a protocol where single bismuth donors can coherently transfer their quantum information to a superconducting flux qubit, which acts as a mediator or quantum bus. This superconducting device allows to connect distant spins on-demand with little impact on their coherent behavior.</description>

      <title>Realization of a fast triple-magic all-optical qutrit in strontium-88</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical clock states of alkaline earth and alkaline earth-like atoms are the fundament of state-of-the-art optical atomic clocks. An important prerequisite for the operation of optical clocks are magic trapping conditions, where electronic and motional dynamics decouple. Here, we identify and experimentally demonstrate simultaneous magic trapping for two clock transitions in $^{88}$Sr, realizing so-called triple-magic conditions at a specially chosen magic angle. Under these conditions, we operate an all-optical qutrit comprising the ground state $^1S_0$, and the two metastable clock states $^3P_0$ and $^3P_2$. We demonstrate fast optical control in an atom array using two- and three-photon couplings to realize high-fidelity manipulation between all qutrit states. Furthermore, at the magic angle we measure atom-atom coherence times between the metastable states as long as 773(21) ms. Our work opens several new directions, including qutrit-based quantum metrology on optical transitions and high-fidelity and high-coherence manipulation on the $^{88}$Sr fine-structure qubit.</description>

      <title>A new family of ladder operators for macroscopic systems, with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a series of recent scientific contributions the role of bosonic and fermionic ladder operators in a macroscopic realm has been investigated. Creation, annihilation and number operators have been used in very different contexts, all sharing the same common main feature, i.e. the relevance of {\em discrete changes} in the description of the system. The main problem when using this approach is that computations are easy for Hamiltonians which are quadratic in the ladder operators, but become very complicated, both at the analytical and at the numerical level, when the Hamiltonian is not quadratic. In this paper we propose a possible alternative approach, again based on some sort of ladder operators, but for which an analytic solution can often be deduced without particular difficulties. We describe our proposal with few applications, mostly related to different versions of a predator-prey model, and to love affairs (from a decision-making point of view).</description>

      <title>Observation of quantum-classical transition behavior of LGI in a dissipative quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Leggett-Garg inequality (LGI) is a powerful tool for distinguishing between quantum and classical properties in studies of macroscopic systems. Applying the LGI to non-Hermitian systems with dissipation presents a fascinating opportunity, as competing mechanisms can either strengthen or weaken LGI violations. On one hand, dissipation-induced nonlinear interactions amplify LGI violations compared to Hermitian systems; on the other hand, dissipation leads to decoherence, which could weaken the LGI violation. In this paper, we investigate a non-Hermitian system of ultracold Fermi gas with dissipation. Our experiments reveal that as dissipation increases, the upper bound of the third-order LGI parameter $K_3$ initially rises, reaching its maximum at the exceptional point (EP), where $K_3 = C_{21} + C_{32} - C_{31}$, encompassing three two-time correlation functions. Beyond a certain dissipation threshold, the LGI violation weakens, approaching the classical limit, indicating a quantum-to-classical transition (QCT). Furthermore, we observe that the LGI violation decreases with increasing evolution time, reinforcing the QCT in the time domain. This study provides a crucial stepping stone for using the LGI to explore the QCT in many-body open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Influence of field mass and acceleration on entanglement generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the entanglement dynamics of two detectors undergoing uniform acceleration and circular motion within a massive scalar field, while also investigating the influence of the anti-Unruh effect on entanglement harvesting. Contrary to the conventional understanding of the weak anti-Unruh effect, where entanglement typically increases, we observe that the maximum entanglement between detectors does not exhibit a strict monotonic dependence on detector acceleration. Particularly at low accelerations, fluctuations in the entanglement maxima show a strong correlation with fluctuations in detector transition rates.We also find that the maximum entanglement of detectors tends to increase with smaller field mass. Novelly, our findings indicate the absence of a strong anti-Unruh effect in (3+1)-dimensional massive scalar fields. Instead, thermal effects arising from acceleration contribute to a decrease in the detector entanglement maximum.</description>

      <title>Modulation of spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates: analytical characterization of acceleration-induced transitions between energy bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The effects of modulating spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates are analytically studied. A sinusoidal driving of the coupling amplitude is shown to induce significant changes in the energy bands and in the associated spin-momentum locking. Moreover, in agreement with recent experimental results, gravitational acceleration of the modulated system is found to generate transitions between the modified energy bands. The applicability of the Landau-Zener (LZ) model to the understanding of the experimental findings is rigorously traced. Through a sequence of unitary transformations and the reduction to the spin space, the modulated Hamiltonian, with the gravitational potential incorporated, is shown to correspond to an extended version of the LZ scenario. The generalization of the basic LZ model takes place along two lines. First, the dimensionality is enlarged to combine the description of the external dynamics with the internal-state characterization. Second, the model is extended to incorporate two avoided crossings emerging from the changes induced in the energy bands by the modulation. Our approach allows a first-principle derivation of the effective model-system parameters. The obtained analytical results provide elements to control the transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: III-V nanowire heterostructures can act as sources of single and entangled photons and are enabling technologies for on-chip applications in future quantum photonic devices. The unique geometry of nanowires allows to integrate lattice-mismatched components beyond the limits of planar epilayers and to create radially and axially confined quantum structures. Here, we report the plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy growth of thin GaAs/GaAsN/GaAs core-multishell nanowires monolithically integrated on Si (111) substrates, overcoming the challenges caused by the low solubility of N and a high lattice mismatch. The nanowires have a GaAsN shell of 10 nm containing 2.7% N, which reduces the GaAs bandgap drastically by 400 meV. They have a symmetric core-shell structure with sharp boundaries and a defect-free zincblende phase. The high structural quality reflects in their excellent opto-electroinic properties, including remarkable single photon emission from quantum confined states in the thin GaAsN shell with a second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay as low as 0.056.</description>

      <title>Exploring the properties of quantum scars in a toy model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of ergodicity and explore its deviation caused by quantum scars in an isolated quantum system, employing a pedagogical approach based on a toy model. Quantum scars, originally identified as traces of classically unstable orbits in certain wavefunctions of chaotic systems, have recently regained interest for their role in non-ergodic dynamics, as they retain memory of their initial states. We elucidate these features of quantum scars within the same framework of this toy model. The integrable part of the model consists of two large spins, with a classical counterpart, which we combine with a random matrix to induce ergodic behavior. Scarred states can be selectively generated from the integrable spin Hamiltonian by protecting them from the ergodic states using a projector method. Deformed projectors mimic the 'quantum leakage' of scarred states, enabling tunable mixing with ergodic states and thereby controlling the degree of scarring. In this simple model, we investigate various properties of quantum scarring and shed light on different aspects of many-body quantum scars observed in more complex quantum systems. Notably, the underlying classicality can be revealed through the entanglement spectrum and the dynamics of 'out-of-time-ordered correlators'.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Advantage for Local Problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first local problem that shows a super-constant separation between the classical randomized LOCAL model of distributed computing and its quantum counterpart. By prior work, such a separation was known only for an artificial graph problem with an inherently global definition [Le Gall et al. 2019]. We present a problem that we call iterated GHZ, which is defined using only local constraints. Formally, it is a family of locally checkable labeling problems [Naor and Stockmeyer 1995]; in particular, solutions can be verified with a constant-round distributed algorithm. We show that in graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$, any classical (deterministic or randomized) LOCAL model algorithm will require $\Omega(\Delta)$ rounds to solve the iterated GHZ problem, while the problem can be solved in $1$ round in quantum-LOCAL. We use the round elimination technique to prove that the iterated GHZ problem requires $\Omega(\Delta)$ rounds for classical algorithms. This is the first work that shows that round elimination is indeed able to separate the two models, and this also demonstrates that round elimination cannot be used to prove lower bounds for quantum-LOCAL. To apply round elimination, we introduce a new technique that allows us to discover appropriate problem relaxations in a mechanical way; it turns out that this new technique extends beyond the scope of the iterated GHZ problem and can be used to e.g. reproduce prior results on maximal matchings [FOCS 2019, PODC 2020] in a systematic manner.</description>

      <title>State-dependent control of the motional modes of trapped ions using an integrated optical lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we study the interaction of trapped ions with a state-dependent, high-intensity optical lattice formed above an ion trap chip using integrated photonics. We use a single ion to map the optical potential landscape over many periods of the standing-wave field. For a single ion sitting in the centre of the lattice we observe a state-dependent trap-frequency shift of $2\pi\times 3.33(4)$ kHz, corresponding to a bare optical potential of $2\pi\times 76.8(5)$ kHz for the electronic ground state. We extend this to two ions, measuring state-dependent shifts of both axial modes. Additionally, using the internal-state dependence of the interaction, we perform a direct measurement of the energy distribution of the motion of a single ion using carrier spectroscopy. Improvements to the setup would allow to increase the state-dependent curvature by more than 50 times, providing a tool which can be utilised for motional state control, and multi-ion gates using optical potentials produced in a scalable fashion.</description>

      <title>Hierarchy of degenerate stationary states in a boundary-driven dipole-conserving spin chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kinetically constrained spin chains serve as a prototype for structured ergodicity breaking in isolated quantum systems. We show that such a system exhibits a hierarchy of degenerate steady states when driven by incoherent pump and loss at the boundary. By tuning the relative pump and loss and how local the constraints are, one can stabilize mixed steady states, noiseless subsystems, and various decoherence-free subspaces, all of which preserve large amounts of information. We also find that a dipole-conserving bulk suppresses current in steady state. These exact results based on the flow in Hilbert space hold regardless of the specific Hamiltonian or drive mechanism. Our findings show that a competition of kinetic constraints and local drives can induce different forms of ergodicity breaking in open systems, which should be accessible in quantum simulators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.05246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of free electrons moving parallel and above a semiconductor surface can be influenced by shining laser light onto the surface. Here we report strong deflection of aloof electrons by an undoped GaAs surface illuminated with a 633nm laser. The deflecting electric field from the surface photovoltaic charges extends 100 {\mu}m into the vacuum. As surface photovoltage (SPV) is sensitive to the electronic states of the GaAs surface, the aloof electron beam serves as a probe for SPV charge dynamics at the mesoscopic length scale. The observed in-plane SPV charge distribution persists beyond 1 second after the laser beam is blocked. Our work suggests the possibility of writing designed 2D charge patterns on semiconductor surfaces with a scanning laser beam, providing unusual flexibility for electron beam manipulation.</description>

      <title>Iterative Qubit Coupled Cluster using only Clifford circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.10501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of quantum algorithms for ground-state energy estimation is directly impacted by the quality of the initial state, where quality is traditionally defined in terms of the overlap of the input state with the target state. An ideal state preparation protocol can be characterized by being easily generated classically and can be transformed to a quantum circuit with minimal overhead while having a significant overlap with the targeted eigenstate of a given Hamiltonian. We propose a method that meets these requirements by introducing a variant of the iterative qubit coupled cluster (iQCC) approach, which exclusively uses Clifford circuits. These circuits can be efficiently simulated on a classical computer, with polynomial scaling according to the Gottesman-Knill theorem. Since the iQCC method has been developed as a quantum algorithm firstly, our variant can be mapped naturally to quantum hardware. We additionally implemented several optimizations to the algorithm enhancing its scalability. We demonstrate the algorithm's correctness in ground-state simulations for small molecules such as H2, LiH, and H2O, and extend our study to complex systems like the titanium-based compound Ti(C5H5)(CH3)3 with a (20, 20) active space, requiring 40 qubits. Results show that the convergence of the algorithm is well-behaved, and the ground state can be represented accurately. Moreover, we show an automated workflow for restricting the qubit active space, thus relieving computational resources by considering only qubits affected by non-trivial operations.</description>

Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era, ab initio computation of the electronic structure problems has become one of the major benchmarks for identifying the boundary between classical and quantum computational power. Basis sets play a key role in the electronic structure methods implemented on both classical and quantum devices. To investigate the consequences of the single-particle basis sets, we propose a framework for more customizable basis set generation and optimization. This framework allows composite basis sets to go beyond typical basis set frameworks, such as atomic basis sets, by introducing the concept of mixed-contracted Gaussian-type orbitals. These basis set generations set the stage for more flexible variational optimization of basis set parameters. To realize this framework, we have developed an open-source software package named ``Quiqbox'' in the Julia programming language. We demonstrate various examples of using Quiqbox for basis set optimization and generation, ranging from optimizing atomic basis sets on the Hartree--Fock level, preparing the initial state for VQE computation, and constructing basis sets with completely delocalized orbitals. We also include various benchmarks of Quiqbox for basis set optimization and ab initial electronic structure computation.</description>

      <title>Trainability Enhancement of Parameterized Quantum Circuits via Reduced-Domain Parameter Initialization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.06858v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) have been widely used as a machine learning model to explore the potential of achieving quantum advantages for various tasks. However, training PQCs is notoriously challenging owing to the phenomenon of plateaus and/or the existence of (exponentially) many spurious local minima. To enhance trainability, in this work we propose an efficient parameter initialization strategy with theoretical guarantees. We prove that by reducing the initial domain of each parameter inversely proportional to the square root of circuit depth, the magnitude of the cost gradient decays at most polynomially with respect to qubit count and circuit depth. Our theoretical results are substantiated through numerical simulations of variational quantum eigensolver tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that the reduced-domain initialization strategy can protect specific quantum neural networks from exponentially many spurious local minima. Our results highlight the significance of an appropriate parameter initialization strategy, offering insights to enhance the trainability and convergence of variational quantum algorithms.</description>

Abstract: In order to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computation, we need to repeat the following sequence of four steps: First, perform 1 or 2 qubit quantum gates (in parallel if possible). Second, do a syndrome measurement on a subset of the qubits. Third, perform a fast classical computation to establish which errors have occurred (if any). Fourth, depending on the errors, we apply a correction step. Then the procedure repeats with the next sequence of gates. In order for these four steps to succeed, we need the error rate of the gates to be below a certain threshold. Unfortunately, the error rates of current quantum hardware are still too high. On the other hand, current quantum hardware platforms are designed with these four steps in mind. In this work we make use of this four-step scheme not to carry out fault-tolerant computations, but to enhance short, constant-depth, quantum circuits that perform 1 qubit gates and nearest-neighbor 2 qubit gates. To explore how this can be useful, we study a computational model which we call Local Alternating Quantum Classical Computations (LAQCC). In this model, qubits are placed in a grid allowing nearest neighbor interactions; the quantum circuits are of constant depth with intermediate measurements; a classical controller can perform log-depth computations on these intermediate measurement outcomes to control future quantum operations. This model fits naturally between quantum algorithms in the NISQ era and full fledged fault-tolerant quantum computation. We show that LAQCC circuits can create long-ranged interactions, which constant-depth quantum circuits cannot achieve, and use it to construct a range of useful multi-qubit gates. With these gates, we create three new state preparation protocols for a uniform superposition over an arbitrary number of states, W-states, Dicke states and may-body scar states.</description>

      <title>The cost of solving linear differential equations on a quantum computer: fast-forwarding to explicit resource counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07881v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How well can quantum computers simulate classical dynamical systems? There is increasing effort in developing quantum algorithms to efficiently simulate dynamics beyond Hamiltonian simulation, but so far exact resource estimates are not known. In this work, we provide two significant contributions. First, we give the first non-asymptotic computation of the cost of encoding the solution to general linear ordinary differential equations into quantum states -- either the solution at a final time, or an encoding of the whole history within a time interval. Second, we show that the stability properties of a large class of classical dynamics allow their fast-forwarding, making their quantum simulation much more time-efficient. From this point of view, quantum Hamiltonian dynamics is a boundary case that does not allow this form of stability-induced fast-forwarding. In particular, we find that the history state can always be output with complexity $O(T^{1/2})$ for any stable linear system. We present a range of asymptotic improvements over state-of-the-art in various regimes. We illustrate our results with a family of dynamics including linearized collisional plasma problems, coupled, damped, forced harmonic oscillators and dissipative nonlinear problems. In this case the scaling is quadratically improved, and leads to significant reductions in the query counts after inclusion of all relevant constant prefactors.</description>

      <title>Epistemic Boundaries and Quantum Uncertainty: What Local Observers Can (Not) Predict</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.09121v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of quantum theory's salient features is its apparent indeterminism, i.e. measurement outcomes are typically probabilistic. We formally define and address whether this uncertainty is unavoidable or whether post-quantum theories can offer a predictive advantage while conforming to the Born rule on average. We present a no-go claim combining three aspects: predictive advantage, no-signalling, and reliable intersubjectivity between quantum observers. The results of the analysis lead to the conclusion that there exists a fundamental limitation on genuine predictive advantage. However, we uncover a fascinating possibility: When the assumption of reliable intersubjectivity between different observers is violated, subjective predictive advantage can, in principle, exist. This, in turn, entails an epistemic boundary between different observers of the same theory. The findings reconcile us to quantum uncertainty as an aspect of limits on Nature's predictability.</description>

      <title>Quantum channels that destroy negative conditional entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.15705v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Counter-intuitive to classical notions, quantum conditional entropy can be negative, playing a pivotal role in information-processing tasks. This article delves deeply into quantum channels, emphasizing negative conditional entropy breaking channels (NCEB) and introducing negative conditional entropy annihilating channels (NCEA). We characterize these channels from both topological and information-theoretic perspectives, examining their properties when combined serially and NCEB in parallel. Our exploration extends to complimentary channels associated with NCEB, leading to the introduction of information-leaking channels. Utilizing the parameters of the standard depolarizing channel, we provide tangible examples and further characterization. We demonstrate the relationship of NCEB and NCEA with newly introduced channels like coherent information breaking (CIB) and mutual information breaking (MIB), along with standard channels like zero capacity channels. Preservation of quantum resources is an integral constituent of quantum information theory. Recognizing this, we lay prescriptions to detect channels that do not break the negativity of conditional entropy, ensuring the conservation of this quantum resource.</description>

      <title>Scattering wave packets of hadrons in gauge theories: Preparation on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00840v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Effect of Crosstalk Error on Circuit Fidelity Using Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Current advancements in technology have focused the attention of the quantum computing community toward exploring the potential of near-term devices whose computing power surpasses that of classical computers in practical applications. An unresolved central question revolves around whether the inherent noise in these devices can be overcome or whether any potential quantum advantage would be limited. There is no doubt that crosstalk is one of the main sources of noise in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) systems, and it poses a fundamental challenge to hardware designs. Crosstalk between parallel instructions can corrupt quantum states and cause incorrect program execution. In this study, we present a necessary analysis of the crosstalk error effect on NISQ devices. Our approach is extremely straightforward and practical to estimate the crosstalk error of various multi-qubit devices. In particular, we combine the randomized benchmarking (RB) and simultaneous randomized benchmarking (SRB) protocol to estimate the crosstalk error from the correlation controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate. We demonstrate this protocol experimentally on 5-, 7-, \&amp; 16-qubit devices. Our results demonstrate the crosstalk error model of three different IBM quantum devices over the experimental week and compare the error variation against the machine, number of qubits, quantum volume, processor, and topology. We then confirm the improvement in the circuit fidelity on different benchmarks by up to 3.06x via inserting an instruction barrier, as compared with an IBM quantum noisy device which offers near-optimal crosstalk mitigation in practice. Finally, we discuss the current system limitation, its tradeoff on fidelity and depth, noise beyond the NISQ system, and mitigation opportunities to ensure that the quantum operation can perform its quantum magic undisturbed.</description>

Abstract: This study presents a novel quantum algorithm for lattice gas automata simulation with a single time step, demonstrating logarithmic complexity in terms of $CX$ gates. The algorithm is composed of three main steps: collision, mapping, and propagation. A computational complexity analysis and a comparison using different error rates and number of shots are provided. Despite the impact of noise, our findings indicate that accurate simulations could be achieved already on current noisy devices. This suggests potential for efficient simulation of classical fluid dynamics using quantum lattice gas automata, conditional on advancements to expand the current method to multiple time steps and state preparation.</description>

      <title>PDQMA = DQMA = NEXP: QMA With Hidden Variables and Non-collapsing Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define and study a variant of QMA (Quantum Merlin Arthur) in which Arthur can make multiple non-collapsing measurements to Merlin's witness state, in addition to ordinary collapsing measurements. By analogy to the class PDQP defined by Aaronson, Bouland, Fitzsimons, and Lee (2014), we call this class PDQMA. Our main result is that PDQMA = NEXP; this result builds on the PCP theorem and complements the result of Aaronson (2018) that PDQP/qpoly = ALL. While the result has little to do with quantum mechanics, we also show a more "quantum" result: namely, that QMA with the ability to inspect the entire history of a hidden variable is equal to NEXP, under mild assumptions on the hidden-variable theory. We also observe that a quantum computer, augmented with quantum advice and the ability to inspect the history of a hidden variable, can solve any decision problem in polynomial time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07068v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum tomography approaches typically consider a set of observables which we wish to measure, design a measurement scheme which measures each of the observables and then repeats the measurements as many times as necessary. We show that instead of considering only the simple set of observables, one should consider a multiset of the observables taking into account the required repetitions, to minimize the number of measurements. This leads to a graph theoretic multicolouring problem. We show that multiset tomography offers at most quadratic improvement but it is achievable. Furthermore, despite the NP-hard optimal colouring problem, the multiset approach with greedy colouring algorithms already offers asymptotically quadratic improvement in test cases.</description>

      <title>Quantum Optimal Control Theory for the Shaping of Flying Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The control of flying qubits carried by itinerant photons is ubiquitous in quantum networks. Beside their logical states, the shape of flying qubits must also be tailored for high-efficiency information transmission. In this paper, we introduce quantum optimal control theory to the shaping of flying qubits. Building on the flying-qubit control model established in our previous work, we design objective functionals for the generation of shaped flying qubits under practical constraints on the emitters and couplers. Numerical simulations employing gradient-descent algorithms demonstrate that the optimized control can effectively mitigate unwanted level and photon leakage caused by these non-idealities. Notably, while coherent control offers limited shaping capacity with a fixed coupler, it can significantly enhance the shaping performance when combined with a tunable coupler that has restricted tunability. The proposed optimal control framework provides a systematic approach to achieving high-quality control of flying qubits using realistic quantum devices.</description>

Abstract: We study extensions of the mappings arising in usual channel-state duality to the case of Hilbert spaces with a direct sum structure. This setting arises in representations of algebras with centers, which are commonly associated with constraints, and it has many physical applications from quantum many-body theory to holography and quantum gravity. We establish that there is a general relationship between non-separability of the state and the isometric properties of the induced channel. We also provide a generalisation of our approach to algebras of trace-class operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a mathematical framework for symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy with a non-abelian symmetry group. To obtain a reduced density matrix that is block-diagonal in the non-abelian charges, we define subsystems operationally in terms of subalgebras of invariant observables. We derive exact formulas for the average and the variance of the typical entanglement entropy for the ensemble of random pure states with fixed non-abelian charges. We focus on compact, semisimple Lie groups. We show that, compared to the abelian case, new phenomena arise from the interplay of locality and non-abelian symmetry, such as the asymmetry of the entanglement entropy under subsystem exchange, which we show in detail by computing the Page curve of a many-body system with SU(2) symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04244v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Certified randomness guaranteed to be unpredictable by adversaries is central to information security. The fundamental randomness inherent in quantum physics makes certification possible from devices that are only weakly characterised, i.e. requiring little trust in their implementation. It was recently shown that the amount of certifiable randomness can be greatly improved using the so-called Entropy Accumulation Theorem generalised to prepare-and-measure settings. Furthermore, this approach allows a finite-size analysis which avoids assuming that all rounds are independent and identically distributed. Here, we demonstrate this improvement in semi-device-independent randomness certification from untrusted measurements.</description>

      <title>Strategic Data Re-Uploads: A Pathway to Improved Quantum Classification Data Re-Uploading Strategies for Improved Quantum Classifier Performance</title>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising field that explores the applications of quantum computing to machine learning tasks. A significant hurdle in the advancement of quantum machine learning lies in the development of efficient and resilient quantum classifiers capable of accurately mapping input data to specific, discrete target outputs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to improve quantum classifier performance by using a data re-uploading strategy. Re-uploading classical information into quantum states multiple times can enhance the accuracy of quantum classifiers. We investigate the effects of different cost functions, such as fidelity and trace distance, on the optimization process and the classification results. We demonstrate our approach to two classification patterns: a linear classification pattern (LCP) and a non-linear classification pattern (NLCP). We evaluate the efficacy of our approach by benchmarking it against four distinct optimization techniques: L-BFGS-B, COBYLA, Nelder-Mead, and SLSQP. Additionally, we study the different impacts of fixed datasets and random datasets. Our results show that our approach can achieve high classification accuracy and robustness and outperform the existing quantum classifier models.</description>

      <title>Momentum dependent quantum Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant many-body systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06307v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Ruelle-Pollicott resonances in translationally invariant quantum many-body lattice systems via spectra of a momentum-resolved operator propagator on infinite systems. Momentum dependence gives insight into the decay of correlation functions, showing that, depending on their symmetries, different correlation functions in general decay with different rates. Focusing on the kicked Ising model the spectrum seems to be typically composed of an annular random matrix like ring whose size we theoretically predict, and few isolated resonances. We identify several interesting regimes, including a mixing regime with a power-law decay of correlation functions. In that regime we also observe a huge difference in time-scales of different correlation functions due to an almost conserved operator. An exact expression for the singular values of the operator propagator is conjectured, showing that it becomes singular at a special point.</description>

Abstract: Random spin systems at low temperatures are glassy and feature computational hardness in finding low-energy states. We study the random all-to-all interacting fermionic Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model and prove that, in contrast, (I) the low-energy states have polynomial circuit depth, yet (II) the annealed and quenched free energies agree to inverse-polynomially low temperatures, ruling out a glassy phase transition in this sense. These results are derived by showing that fermionic and spin systems significantly differ in their commutation index, which quantifies the non-commutativity of Hamiltonian terms. Our results suggest that low-temperature strongly interacting fermions, unlike spins, belong in a classically nontrivial yet quantumly easy phase.</description>

      <title>Improved Circuit Lower Bounds and Quantum-Classical Separations</title>

Abstract: Kumar used a switching lemma to prove exponential-size lower bounds for a circuit class GC^0 that not only contains AC^0 but can--with a single gate--compute functions that require exponential-size TC^0 circuits. His main result was that switching-lemma lower bounds for AC^0 lift to GC^0 with no loss in parameters, even though GC^0 requires exponential-size TC^0 circuits. Informally, GC^0 is AC^0 with unbounded-fan-in gates that behave arbitrarily inside a sufficiently small Hamming ball but must be constant outside it.
  We show that polynomial-method lower bounds for AC^0[p] lift to GC^0[p] with no loss in parameters, complementing Kumar's result for GC^0 and the switching lemma. As an application, we prove Majority requires depth-d GC^0[p] circuits of size $2^{\Omega(n^{1/2(d-1)})}$, matching the state-of-the-art lower bounds for AC^0[p]. We also show that E^NP requires exponential-size GCC^0 circuits (the union of GC^0[m] for all m), extending the result of Williams.
  It is striking that the switching lemma, polynomial method, and algorithmic method all generalize to GC^0-related classes, with the first two methods doing so without any loss.
  We also establish the strongest known unconditional separations between quantum and classical circuits:
  1. There's an oracle relative to which BQP is not contained in the class of languages decidable by uniform families of size-$2^{n^{O(1)}}$ GC^0 circuits, generalizing Raz and Tal's relativized separation of BQP from the polynomial hierarchy.
  2. There's a search problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but average-case hard for exponential-size GC^0 circuits.
  3. There's a search problem that QNC^0/qpoly circuits can solve but average-case hard for exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits.
  4. There's an interactive problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits cannot.</description>

      <title>The Cram\'{e}r-Rao approach and global quantum estimation of bosonic states</title>

Abstract: Quantum state estimation is a fundamental task in quantum information theory, where one estimates real parameters continuously embedded in a family of quantum states. In the theory of quantum state estimation, the widely used Cram\'er Rao approach which considers local estimation gives the ultimate precision bound of quantum state estimation in terms of the quantum Fisher information. However practical scenarios need not offer much prior information about the parameters to be estimated, and the local estimation setting need not apply. In general, it is unclear whether the Cram\'er-Rao approach is applicable for global estimation instead of local estimation. In this paper, we find situations where the Cram\'er-Rao approach does and does not work for quantum state estimation problems involving a family of bosonic states in a non-IID setting, where we only use one copy of the bosonic quantum state in the large number of bosons setting. Our result highlights the importance of caution when using the results of the Cram\'er-Rao approach to extrapolate to the global estimation setting.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cryptography and Meta-Complexity</title>

Abstract: In classical cryptography, one-way functions (OWFs) are the minimal assumption, while it is not the case in quantum cryptography. Several new primitives have been introduced such as pseudorandom state generators (PRSGs), one-way state generators (OWSGs), one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), and EFI pairs. They seem to be weaker than OWFs, but still imply many useful applications. Now that the possibility of quantum cryptography without OWFs has opened up, the most important goal in the field is to build a foundation of it. In this paper, we, for the first time, characterize quantum cryptographic primitives with meta-complexity. We show that one-way puzzles (OWPuzzs) exist if and only if GapK is weakly-quantum-average-hard. GapK is a promise problem to decide whether a given bit string has a small Kolmogorov complexity or not. Weakly-quantum-average-hard means that an instance is sampled from a QPT samplable distribution, and for any QPT adversary the probability that it makes mistake is larger than ${\rm 1/poly}$. We also show that if quantum PRGs exist then GapK is strongly-quantum-average-hard. Here, strongly-quantum-average-hard is a stronger version of weakly-quantum-average-hard where the probability that the adversary makes mistake is larger than $1/2-1/{\rm poly}$. Finally, we show that if GapK is weakly-classical-average-hard, then inefficient-verifier proofs of quantumness (IV-PoQ) exist. Weakly-classical-average-hard is the same as weakly-quantum-average-hard except that the adversary is PPT. IV-PoQ are a generalization of proofs of quantumness (PoQ) that capture sampling-based and search-based quantum advantage, and an important application of OWpuzzs. This is the fist time that quantum advantage is based on meta-complexity. (Note: There are two concurrent works[Khurana-Tomer,arXiv:2409.15248; Cavalar-Goldin-Gray-Hall,arXiv:2410.04984].)</description>

      <title>Robustness of near-thermal dynamics on digital quantum computers</title>

Abstract: Understanding the impact of gate errors on quantum circuits is crucial to determining the potential applications of quantum computers, especially in the absence of large-scale error-corrected hardware. We put forward analytical arguments, corroborated by extensive numerical and experimental evidence, that Trotterized quantum circuits simulating the time-evolution of systems near thermal equilibrium are substantially more robust to both quantum gate errors and Trotter (discretization) errors than is widely assumed. In Quantinuum's trapped-ion computers, the weakly entangling gates that appear in Trotterized circuits can be implemented natively, and their error rate is smaller when they generate less entanglement; from benchmarking, we know that the error for a gate $\exp[-i (Z\otimes Z) \tau]$ decreases roughly linearly with $\tau$, up to a small offset at $\tau = 0$. We provide extensive evidence that this scaling, together with the robustness of near-thermal dynamics to both gate and discretization errors, facilitates substantial improvements in the achievable accuracy of Trotterized dynamics on near-term quantum computers. We make heavy use of a new theoretical tool -- a statistical ensemble of random product states that approximates a thermal state, which can be efficiently prepared with low noise on quantum computers. We outline how the random product state ensemble can be used to predict, optimize, and design Hamiltonian simulation experiments on near-thermal quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Improved bounds for testing low stabilizer complexity states</title>

Abstract: Stabilizer states are fundamental families of quantum states with crucial applications such as error correction, quantum computation, and simulation of quantum circuits. In this paper, we study the problem of testing how close or far a quantum state is to a stabilizer state. We make two contributions: First, we improve the state-of-the-art parameters for the tolerant testing of stabilizer states. In particular, we show that there is an efficient quantum primitive to distinguish if the maximum fidelity of a quantum state with a stabilizer state is $\geq \epsilon_1$ or $\leq \epsilon_2$, given one of them is the case, provided that $\epsilon_2 \leq \epsilon_1^{O(1)}$. This result improves the parameters in the previous work [AD24] which assumed $\epsilon_2 \leq e^{- 1/\epsilon^{O(1)}_1}$ [AD24]. Our proof technique extends the toolsets developed in [AD24] by applying a random Clifford map which balances the characteristic function of a quantum state, enabling the use of standard proof techniques from higher-order Fourier analysis for Boolean functions [HHL19, Sam07], where improved testing bounds are available.
  Second, we study the problem of testing low stabilizer rank states. We show that if for an infinite family of quantum states stabilizer rank is lower than a constant independent of system size, then stabilizer fidelity is lower bounded by an absolute constant. Using a result of [GIKL22], one of the implications of this result is that low approximate stabilizer rank states are not pseudo-random.
  At the same time our work was completed and posted on arXiv, two other groups [BvDH24, ABD24] independently achieved similar exponential to polynomial improvements for tolerant testing, each using a different approach.</description>

      <title>Shortcuts to adiabatic state transfer in time-modulated two-level non-Hermitian systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nontrivial spectral properties of non-Hermitian systems can give rise to intriguing effects that lack counterparts in Hermitian systems. For instance, when dynamically varying system parameters along a path enclosing an exceptional point (EP), chiral mode conversion occurs. A recent study [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 113802 (2024)] demonstrates the achievability of pure adiabatic state transfer by specifically selecting a trajectory in the system parameter space where the corresponding evolution operator exhibits a real spectrum while winding around an EP. However, the intended adiabatic state transfer becomes fragile when taking into account the effect of the nonadiabatic transition. In this work, we propose a scheme for achieving robust and rapid adiabatic state transfer in time-modulated two-level non-Hermitian systems by appropriately modulating system Hamiltonian and time-evolution trajectory. Numerical simulations confirm that complete adiabatic transfer can always be achieved even under nonadiabatic conditions after one period for different initialized adiabatic states, and the scheme remains insensitive to moderate fluctuations in control parameters. Therefore, this scheme offers alternative approaches for quantum-state engineering in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

Abstract: The rapid advancement of quantum technologies calls for the design and deployment of quantum-safe cryptographic protocols and communication networks. There are two primary approaches to achieving quantum-resistant security: quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC). While each offers unique advantages, both have drawbacks in practical implementation. In this work, we introduce the pros and cons of these protocols and explore how they can be combined to achieve a higher level of security and/or improved performance in key distribution. We hope our discussion inspires further research into the design of hybrid cryptographic protocols for quantum-classical communication networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum resistance is vital for emerging cryptographic systems as quantum technologies continue to advance towards large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers. Resistance may be offered by quantum key distribution (QKD), which provides information-theoretic security using quantum states of photons, but may be limited by transmission loss at long distances. An alternative approach uses classical means and is conjectured to be resistant to quantum attacks, so-called post-quantum cryptography (PQC), but it is yet to be rigorously proven, and its current implementations are computationally expensive. To overcome the security and performance challenges present in each, here we develop hybrid protocols by which QKD and PQC inter-operate within a joint quantum-classical network. In particular, we consider different hybrid designs that may offer enhanced speed and/or security over the individual performance of either approach. Furthermore, we present a method for analyzing the security of hybrid protocols in key distribution networks. Our hybrid approach paves the way for joint quantum-classical communication networks, which leverage the advantages of both QKD and PQC and can be tailored to the requirements of various practical networks.</description>

      <title>An Exponential Separation Between Quantum and Quantum-Inspired Classical Algorithms for Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02087v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Achieving a provable exponential quantum speedup for an important machine learning task has been a central research goal since the seminal HHL quantum algorithm for solving linear systems and the subsequent quantum recommender systems algorithm by Kerenidis and Prakash. These algorithms were initially believed to be strong candidates for exponential speedups, but a lower bound ruling out similar classical improvements remained absent. In breakthrough work by Tang, it was demonstrated that this lack of progress in classical lower bounds was for good reasons. Concretely, she gave a classical counterpart of the quantum recommender systems algorithm, reducing the quantum advantage to a mere polynomial. Her approach is quite general and was named quantum-inspired classical algorithms. Since then, almost all the initially exponential quantum machine learning speedups have been reduced to polynomial via new quantum-inspired classical algorithms. From the current state-of-affairs, it is unclear whether we can hope for exponential quantum speedups for any natural machine learning task.
  In this work, we present the first such provable exponential separation between quantum and quantum-inspired classical algorithms. We prove the separation for the basic problem of solving a linear system when the input matrix is well-conditioned and has sparse rows and columns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00343v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized string-net models have been recently proposed in order to enlarge the set of possible topological quantum phases emerging from the original string-net construction. In the present work, we do not consider vertex excitations and restrict to plaquette excitations, or fluxons, that satisfy important identities. We explain how to compute the energy-level degeneracies of the generalized string-net Hamiltonian associated to an arbitrary unitary fusion category. In contrast to the degeneracy of the ground state, which is purely topological, that of excited energy levels depends not only on the Drinfeld center of the category, but also on internal multiplicities obtained from the tube algebra defined from the category. For a noncommutative category, these internal multiplicities result in extra nontopological degeneracies. Our results are valid for any trivalent graph and any orientable surface. We illustrate our findings with nontrivial examples.</description>

Abstract: We provide a solution to the v-representability problem for a non-relativistic quantum many-particle system on a ring domain in terms of Sobolev spaces and their duals. Any one-particle density that is square-integrable, has a square-integrable weak derivative, and is gapped away from zero can be realized from the solution of a many-particle Schr\"odinger equation, with or without interactions, by choosing a corresponding external potential. This potential can contain a distributional contribution but still gives rise to a self-adjoint Hamiltonian. Importantly, this allows for a well-defined Kohn-Sham procedure but, on the other hand, invalidates the usual proof of the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem.</description>

      <title>Parametric instability in a magnomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10796v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study parametric instability in a magnomechanical system, specifically examining magnon tunneling between moving ferromagnetic insulators. Our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations generate spin currents above a critical velocity threshold, while no spin currents occur below this threshold at low temperatures. The critical velocity depends on magnon stiffness and Zeeman energy. Approaching the threshold, the spin current becomes divergent, linked to the PT-symmetry-breaking transition. This enhanced behavior could offer high-sensitivity measurements and efficient spin current generation in magnon-based quantum technology.</description>

      <title>Online Locality Meets Distributed Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We connect three distinct lines of research that have recently explored extensions of the classical LOCAL model of distributed computing: A. distributed quantum computing and non-signaling distributions [e.g. STOC 2024], B. finitely-dependent processes [e.g. Forum Math. Pi 2016], and C. locality in online graph algorithms and dynamic graph algorithms [e.g. ICALP 2023].
  We prove new results on the capabilities and limitations of all of these models of computing, for locally checkable labeling problems (LCLs). We show that all these settings can be sandwiched between the classical LOCAL model and what we call the randomized online-LOCAL model. Our work implies limitations on the quantum advantage in the distributed setting, and we also exhibit a new barrier for proving tighter bounds. Our main technical results are these: 1. All LCL problems solvable with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model admit a finitely-dependent distribution with locality $O(1)$. This answers an open question by Holroyd [2024], and also presents a new barrier for proving bounds on distributed quantum advantage using causality-based arguments. 2. In rooted trees, if we can solve an LCL problem with locality $o(\log \log \log n)$ in the randomized online-LOCAL model (or any of the weaker models, such as quantum-LOCAL), we can solve it with locality $O(\log^\star n)$ in the classical deterministic LOCAL model. One of many implications is that in rooted trees, $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in quantum-LOCAL is not stronger than $O(\log^\star n)$ locality in classical LOCAL.</description>

      <title>Satisfiability of commutative vs. non-commutative CSPs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mermin-Peres magic square is a celebrated example of a system of Boolean linear equations that is not (classically) satisfiable but is satisfiable via linear operators on a Hilbert space of dimension four. A natural question is then, for what kind of problems such a phenomenon occurs? Atserias, Kolaitis, and Severini answered this question for all Boolean Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs): For 0-Valid-SAT, 1-Valid-SAT, 2-SAT, Horn-SAT, and Dual Horn-SAT, classical satisfiability and operator satisfiability is the same and thus there is no gap; for all other Boolean CSPs, these notions differ as there are gaps, i.e., there are unsatisfiable instances that are satisfiable via operators on Hilbert spaces.
  We generalize their result to CSPs on arbitrary finite domains and give an almost complete classification: First, we show that NP-hard CSPs admit a separation between classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Second, we show that tractable CSPs of bounded width have no satisfiability gaps of any kind. Finally, we show that tractable CSPs of unbounded width can simulate, in a satisfiability-gap-preserving fashion, linear equations over an Abelian group of prime order $p$; for such CSPs, we obtain a separation of classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. Furthermore, if $p=2$, such CSPs also have gaps separating classical satisfiability and satisfiability via operators on finite- and infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional fracton topological orders with boundary Toeplitz braiding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02482v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study a class of 3D non-liquid states that show exotic boundary phenomena in the thermodynamical limit. More concretely, we focus on a class of 3D fracton topological orders formed via stacking 2D twisted \(\mathbb{Z}_N\) topologically ordered layers along \(z\)-direction. Nearby layers are coupled while maintaining translation symmetry along \(z\) direction. The effective field theory is given by the infinite-component Chern-Simons (iCS) field theory, with an integer-valued symmetric block-tridiagonal Toeplitz \(K\)-matrix whose size is thermodynamically large. With open boundary conditions (OBC) along \(z\), certain choice of \(K\)-matrices exhibits exotic boundary ``Toeplitz braiding'', where the mutual braiding phase angle between two anyons at opposite boundaries oscillates and remains non-zero in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, in trivial case, the mutual braiding phase angle decays exponentially to zero in the thermodynamical limit. As a necessary condition, this phenomenon requires the existence of boundary zero modes in the \(K\)-matrix spectrum under OBC. We categorize nontrivial \(K\)-matrices into two distinct types. Each type-I possesses two boundary zero modes, whereas each type-II possesses only one boundary zero mode. Interestingly, the integer-valued Hamiltonian matrix of the familiar 1D SSH can be used as a non-trivial $K$-matrix. Importantly, since large-gauge-invariance ensures integer quantized \(K\)-matrix entries, global symmetries are not needed to protect these zero modes. We also present numerical simulation as well as finite size scaling, further confirming the above analytical results. Symmetry fractionalization is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Superradiant Interactions of the Cosmic Neutrino Background, Axions, Dark Matter, and Reactor Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we do three things. First, we outline the conditions under which the interaction rate of inelastic processes that change the internal state of a system of $N$ targets scales as $N^2$. This is an effect distinct from coherent elastic scattering, but with the same scaling. Second, we compute rates for such processes for various weakly interacting particles. Finally, we point to potential quantum observables for these processes, beyond energy exchange. Maximal coherence in inelastic processes is achieved when the targets are placed in an equal superposition of the ground and excited states. These coherent inelastic processes are analogous to Dicke superradiance, and we thus refer to them as superradiant interactions. We compute the superradiant interaction rates for the Cosmic Neutrino Background (C$\nu$B), dark matter scattering and absorption, and late-universe particles, such as reactor neutrinos, when the two-level system is realized by nuclear or electron spins in a magnetic field. The rates can be sizeable on macroscopic yet small targets. For example, the C$\nu$B interacts with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(\text{Hz})$ when scattering off a 10~cm liquid or solid-state density spin-polarized sphere, a $\mathcal{O}(10^{21})$ enhancement compared to the incoherent contribution. For QCD axion dark matter, similar rates can be achieved with much smaller samples, $N \sim \mathcal{O}(10^{15})\left(\frac{m}{2\times 10^{-8}~\text{eV}}\right)^{-1/2}$, where $m$ is the axion mass. Using the Lindblad formalism, we show that these superradiant interactions can manifest as a source of noise on the system. This points to new observables, sensitive to the sum of the excitation and de-excitation rates, and can be viewed as introducing diffusion and decoherence to the system. The effects presented in this paper may point to a new class of ultra-low threshold detectors.</description>

      <title>Two-doublon Bloch oscillations in the mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08194v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactions between particles normally induce the decay of the particles Bloch oscillations (BOs) in a periodic lattice. In the limit of strong on-site interactions, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form doublon bound states and undergo BOs in the presence of a tilted potential. Here we investigate the impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a mass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive an effective Hamiltonian for doublons, and show that a slight change in $V$ can qualitatively alter their dynamic behaviors. Notably, at a resonance point, the doublons behave like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system may exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the resonance point. Numerical results are presented to demonstrate our conclusions in both one- and two-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Atlas: Hierarchical Partitioning for Quantum Circuit Simulation on GPUs (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09055v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents techniques for theoretically and practically efficient and scalable Schr\"odinger-style quantum circuit simulation. Our approach partitions a quantum circuit into a hierarchy of subcircuits and simulates the subcircuits on multi-node GPUs, exploiting available data parallelism while minimizing communication costs. To minimize communication costs, we formulate an Integer Linear Program that rewards simulation of "nearby" gates on "nearby" GPUs. To maximize throughput, we use a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the subcircuit simulated by each kernel at a GPU. We realize these techniques in Atlas, a distributed, multi-GPU quantum circuit simulator. Our evaluation on a variety of quantum circuits shows that Atlas outperforms state-of-the-art GPU-based simulators by more than 2$\times$ on average and is able to run larger circuits via offloading to DRAM, outperforming other large-circuit simulators by two orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional and Selective Displacement Sensing of a Levitated Nanoparticle via Spatial Mode Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08827v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a novel detection method that significantly improves the precision of real-time measurement of the three-dimensional displacement of a levitated dipolar scatterer. Our technique relies on the spatial mode decomposition of the light scattered by the levitated object, allowing us to simultaneously and selectively extract the position information of all translational degrees of freedom with minimal losses. To this end, we collect all the light back-scattered from a levitated nanoparticle using a parabolic mirror and couple it into a spatial mode sorter. The sorter effectively demultiplexes the information content of the scattered electric field, resulting in each of the nanoparticle's translational degrees of freedom being selectively encoded in the amplitude of orthogonal optical modes. We report measurement efficiencies of ${(\eta_{^{\mathrm{tot}}}^{_{x}}, \eta_{^{\mathrm{tot}}}^{_{y}}, \eta_{^{\mathrm{tot}}}^{_{z}}) = (0.14, 0.16, 0.32)}$ $&gt;$ 1/9, which should enable the 3D motional quantum ground state of a levitated optomechanical system. Further, we believe this technique opens up the possibility to implement coherent feedback control of a levitated nanoparticle.</description>

      <title>Mode entanglement and isospin pairing in two-nucleon systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12583v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the entanglement and correlation in two-nucleon systems using isospin formalism. With the help of Slater decomposition, we derive analytical expressions for various entanglement measures. Specifically, we analyse the one- and two-mode entropies, mutual informations, and a basis-independent characteristic known as the one-body entanglement entropy.
  To understand the impact of pairing, we consider interactions involving isovector and isoscalar L=0 pairing terms. Our findings show that certain pairing interactions can maximize one-body entanglement entropy of ground states when both total angular momentum and total isospin have zero projections.
  We provide numerical examples for the sd shell and explore the mutual informations in LS coupled and jj coupled single-particle bases. We find that the shell structure and angular momentum coupling significantly impact the measures of entanglement. We outline the implications of conserving angular momentum and isospin on one-mode entropies, irrespective of particle number.</description>

      <title>Testing Bell inequalities and probing quantum entanglement at CEPC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum entanglement and test violation of Bell-type inequality at the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), which is one of the most attractive future colliders. It's a promising particle collider designed to search new physics, make Standard Model (SM) precision measurements, and serving as a Higgs factory. Our study is based on a fast simulation of the $Z$ boson pair production from Higgs boson decay at $\sqrt{s} = 250$ GeV. The detector effects are also included in the simulation. The spin density matrix of the joint $ZZ$ system is parametrized using irreducible tensor operators and reconstructed from the spherical coordinates of the decay leptons. To test Bell inequalities, we construct observable quantities for the $H \to ZZ*$ process in CEPC by using the (Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu) CGLMP inequality, whose value is determined from the density matrix of the Z boson pairs. The sensitivity of the Bell inequality violation is observed with more than 1$\sigma$ and the presence of the quantum entanglement is probed with more than 2$\sigma$ confidence level.</description>

      <title>Quantum optimization for Nonlinear Model Predictive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a general and flexible control approach, used in many industrial contexts, and is based on the online solution of a nonlinear optimization problem. This operation requires in general a high computational cost, which may compromise the NMPC implementation in ``fast'' applications, especially if a large number variables is involved. To overcome this issue, we propose a quantum computing approach for the solution of the NMPC optimization problem. Assuming the availability of an efficient quantum computer, the approach has the potential to considerably decrease the computational time and/or enhance the solution quality compared to classical algorithms.</description>

      <title>Consistency of EFT illuminated via relative entropy: A case study in scalar field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Relative entropy is a non-negative quantity and offers a powerful means of achieving a unified understanding of fundamental properties in physics, including the second law of thermodynamics and positivity bounds on effective field theories (EFTs). We analyze the relative entropy in scalar field theories and show that the non-negativity of relative entropy is potentially violated in perturbative calculations based on operator and loop expansions. Conversely, this suggests that the consistency of the EFT description in the scalar field theory can be identified by the sign of the relative entropy. In fact, we revisit an EFT of single-field inflation and present a relation between its non-linear parameter $f_{\rm NL}$ and the consistency condition of the EFT description derived from the relative entropy method. We find that interesting regions of $f_{\rm NL}$ that are observationally allowed can be constrained from the relative entropy by imposing the consistency of the EFT description.</description>
