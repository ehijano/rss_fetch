      <title>Improved Accuracy of Robot Localization Using 3-D LiDAR in a Hippocampus-Inspired Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model.
  The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Effects of Word Length, Frequency, and Predictability on Dyslexia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We ask where, and under what conditions, dyslexic reading costs arise in a large-scale naturalistic reading dataset. Using eye-tracking aligned to word-level features (word length, frequency, and predictability), we model how each feature influences dyslexic time costs. We find that all three features robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for dyslexics.</description>

      <title>Does Object Binding Naturally Emerge in Large Pretrained Vision Transformers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Object binding, the brain's ability to bind the many features that collectively represent an object into a coherent whole, is central to human cognition. It groups low-level perceptual features into high-level object representations, stores those objects efficiently and compositionally in memory, and supports human reasoning about individual object instances. While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of "which parts belong together" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Dreaming: A Global Workspace Approach to World Model-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.21142v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Humans leverage rich internal models of the world to reason about the future, imagine counterfactuals, and adapt flexibly to new situations. In Reinforcement Learning (RL), world models aim to capture how the environment evolves in response to the agent's actions, facilitating planning and generalization. However, typical world models directly operate on the environment variables (e.g. pixels, physical attributes), which can make their training slow and cumbersome; instead, it may be advantageous to rely on high-level latent dimensions that capture relevant multimodal variables. Global Workspace (GW) Theory offers a cognitive framework for multimodal integration and information broadcasting in the brain, and recent studies have begun to introduce efficient deep learning implementations of GW. Here, we evaluate the capabilities of an RL system combining GW with a world model. We compare our GW-Dreamer with various versions of the standard PPO and the original Dreamer algorithms. We show that performing the dreaming process (i.e., mental simulation) inside the GW latent space allows for training with fewer environment steps. As an additional emergent property, the resulting model (but not its comparison baselines) displays strong robustness to the absence of one of its observation modalities (images or simulation attributes). We conclude that the combination of GW with World Models holds great potential for improving decision-making in RL agents.</description>

      <title>NOBLE -- Neural Operator with Biologically-informed Latent Embeddings to Capture Experimental Variability in Biological Neuron Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04536v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the cellular properties of neurons is fundamental to understanding their function in the brain. In this quest, the generation of bio-realistic models is central towards integrating multimodal cellular data sets and establishing causal relationships. However, current modeling approaches remain constrained by the limited availability and intrinsic variability of experimental neuronal data. The deterministic formalism of bio-realistic models currently precludes accounting for the natural variability observed experimentally. While deep learning is becoming increasingly relevant in this space, it fails to capture the full biophysical complexity of neurons, their nonlinear voltage dynamics, and variability. To address these shortcomings, we introduce NOBLE, a neural operator framework that learns a mapping from a continuous frequency-modulated embedding of interpretable neuron features to the somatic voltage response induced by current injection. Trained on synthetic data generated from bio-realistic neuron models, NOBLE predicts distributions of neural dynamics accounting for the intrinsic experimental variability. Unlike conventional bio-realistic neuron models, interpolating within the embedding space offers models whose dynamics are consistent with experimentally observed responses. NOBLE enables the efficient generation of synthetic neurons that closely resemble experimental data and exhibit trial-to-trial variability, offering a $4200\times$ speedup over the numerical solver. NOBLE is the first scaled-up deep learning framework that validates its generalization with real experimental data. To this end, NOBLE captures fundamental neural properties in a unique and emergent manner that opens the door to a better understanding of cellular composition and computations, neuromorphic architectures, large-scale brain circuits, and general neuroAI applications.</description>

      <title>NeuroPilot: A Realtime Brain-Computer Interface system to enhance concentration of students in online learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The prevalence of online learning poses a vital challenge in real-time monitoring of students' concentration. Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual intervention, and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights about learners' mental focus as it is deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (Butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high- amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet, and statistical features were extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy was found to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon detection of a non-attention state and maintains focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants underwent a 10-minute session comprising a 5-minute baseline phase devoid of feedback, succeeded by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were activated if participants exhibited inattention for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.</description>
