      <title>Random Text, Zipf's Law, Critical Length,and Implications for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a deliberately simple, fully non-linguistic model of text: a sequence of independent draws from a finite alphabet of letters plus a single space symbol. A word is defined as a maximal block of non-space symbols. Within this symbol-level framework, which assumes no morphology, syntax, or semantics, we derive several structural results. First, word lengths follow a geometric distribution governed solely by the probability of the space symbol. Second, the expected number of words of a given length, and the expected number of distinct words of that length, admit closed-form expressions based on a coupon-collector argument. This yields a critical word length k* at which word types transition from appearing many times on average to appearing at most once. Third, combining the exponential growth of the number of possible strings of length k with the exponential decay of the probability of each string, we obtain a Zipf-type rank-frequency law p(r) proportional to r^{-alpha}, with an exponent determined explicitly by the alphabet size and the space probability.
  Our contribution is twofold. Mathematically, we give a unified derivation linking word lengths, vocabulary growth, critical length, and rank-frequency structure in a single explicit model. Conceptually, we argue that this provides a structurally grounded null model for both natural-language word statistics and token statistics in large language models. The results show that Zipf-like patterns can arise purely from combinatorics and segmentation, without optimization principles or linguistic organization, and help clarify which phenomena require deeper explanation beyond random-text structure.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Conformal Prediction for Quantum Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18225</link>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning seeks to leverage quantum computers to improve upon classical machine learning algorithms. Currently, robust uncertainty quantification methods remain underdeveloped in the quantum domain, despite the critical need for reliable and trustworthy predictions. Recent work has introduced quantum conformal prediction, a framework that produces prediction sets that are guaranteed to contain the true outcome with user-specified probability. In this work, we formalise how the time-varying noise inherent in quantum processors can undermine conformal guarantees, even when calibration and test data are exchangeable. To address this challenge, we draw on Adaptive Conformal Inference, a method which maintains validity over time via repeated recalibration. We introduce Adaptive Quantum Conformal Prediction (AQCP), an algorithm which preserves asymptotic average coverage guarantees under arbitrary hardware noise conditions. Empirical studies on an IBM quantum processor demonstrate that AQCP achieves target coverage levels and exhibits greater stability than quantum conformal prediction.</description>
