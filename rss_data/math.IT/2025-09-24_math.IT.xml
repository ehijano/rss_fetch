      <title>Functional Information Decomposition: A First-Principles Approach to Analyzing Functional Relationships</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Information theory, originating from Shannon's work on communication systems, has become a fundamental tool across neuroscience, genetics, physics, and machine learning. However, the application of information theory is often limited to the simplest case: mutual information between two variables. A central challenge in extending information theory to multivariate systems is decomposition: understanding how the information that multiple variables collectively provide about a target can be broken down into the distinct contributions that are assignable to individual variables or their interactions. To restate the problem clearly, what is sought after is a decomposition of the mutual information between a set of inputs (or parts) and an output (or whole). In this work, we introduce Functional Information Decomposition (FID) a new approach to information decomposition that differs from prior methods by operating on complete functional relationships rather than statistical correlations, enabling precise quantification of independent and synergistic contributions.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Neural/Traditional OFDM Receiver with Learnable Decider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods have emerged as promising solutions for enhancing receiver performance in wireless orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, offering significant improvements over traditional estimation and detection techniques. However, DL-based receivers often face challenges such as poor generalization to unseen channel conditions and difficulty in effectively tracking rapid channel fluctuations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a hybrid receiver architecture that integrates the strengths of both traditional and neural receivers. The core innovation is a discriminator neural network trained to dynamically select the optimal receiver whether it is the traditional or DL-based receiver according on the received OFDM block characteristics. This discriminator is trained using labeled pilot signals that encode the comparative performance of both receivers. By including anomalous channel scenarios in training, the proposed hybrid receiver achieves robust performance, effectively overcoming the generalization issues inherent in standalone DL approaches.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.18698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the first part of this article, we consider ruled surfaces defined over a finite field; we introduce invariants for them, and describe some explicit contructions that illustrate possible behaviour of these invariants. In the second part, we consider evaluation codes on some such surfaces; we first estimate their parameters, then we construct asymptotically good families of such codes, and we show that their asymptotic parameters are better than the ones of the corresponding product codes. We also consider local properties of these codes.</description>

      <title>New constructions of cyclic constant-dimension subspace codes based on Sidon spaces and subspace polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, two new constructions of Sidon spaces are given by tactfully adding new parameters and flexibly varying the number of parameters. Under the parameters $ n= (2r+1)k, r \ge2 $ and $p_0=\max \{i\in \mathbb{N}^+: \lfloor \frac{r}{i}\rfloor&gt;\lfloor \frac{r}{i+1} \rfloor \}$, the first construction produces a cyclic CDC in $\mathcal{G}_q(n, k)$ with minimum distance $2k-2$ and size $\frac{\left((r+\sum\limits_{i=2}^{p_0}(\lfloor \frac{r}{i}\rfloor-\lfloor \frac{r}{i+1} \rfloor))(q^k-1)(q-1)+r\right)(q^k-1)^{r-1}(q^n-1)}{q-1}$. Given parameters $n=2rk,r\ge 2$ and if $r=2$, $p_0=1$, otherwise, $p_0=\max\{ i\in \mathbb{N}^+: \lceil\frac{r}{i}\rceil-1&gt;\lfloor \frac{r}{i+1} \rfloor \}$, a cyclic CDC in $\mathcal{G}_q(n, k)$ with minimum distance $2k-2$ and size $\frac{\left((r-1+\sum\limits_{i=2}^{p_0}(\lceil \frac{r}{i}\rceil-\lfloor \frac{r}{i+1} \rfloor-1))(q^k-1)(q-1)+r-1\right)(q^k-1)^{r-2}\lfloor \frac{q^k-2}{2}\rfloor(q^n-1)}{q-1}$ is produced by the second construction. The sizes of our cyclic CDCs are larger than the best known results. In particular, in the case of $n=4k$, when $k$ goes to infinity, the ratio between the size of our cyclic CDC and the Sphere-packing bound (Johnson bound) is approximately equal to $\frac{1}{2}$. Moreover, for a prime power $q$ and positive integers $k,s$ with $1\le s&lt; k-1$, a cyclic CDC in $\mathcal{G}_q(N, k)$ of size $e\frac{q^N-1}{q-1}$ and minimum distance $\ge 2k-2s$ is provided by subspace polynomials, where $N,e$ are positive integers. Our construction generalizes previous results and, under certain parameters, provides cyclic CDCs with larger sizes or more admissible values of $ N $ than constructions based on trinomials.</description>

      <title>A Convex Demixing Approach for Hybrid-Field Channel Estimation of XL-MIMO Systems via Atomic Norm Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel estimation is a critical task in extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems for 6G wireless communications. A hybrid-field channel model effectively characterizes the mixed far-field and near-field scattering components in practical XL-MIMO systems. In this paper, we propose a convex demixing approach for hybrid-field channel estimation within the atomic norm minimization (ANM) framework. By promoting sparsity of the far-field and near-field components directly in the continuous parameter domain, a demixing scheme that minimizes a weighted sum of two atomic norms is proposed. We show that the resulting ANM is equivalent to a computationally feasible semi-definite programming (SDP). Numerical experiments on simulated data demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches for hybrid-field channel estimation.</description>

      <title>A Two-Dimensional Super-Resolution Method for Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Near-Field Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided localization in the radiating near-field requires range-aware spherical-wave models, which inherently couple angles and ranges and thus complicate accurate 3D positioning. Using the Fresnel approximation, we show that the RIS response can be expressed as the element-wise product of a 2D far-field steering vector and a range-dependent quadratic-phase chirp. By modeling these chirp components within a low-dimensional subspace, we reformulate the joint recovery of azimuth, elevation, and range under a 2D super-resolution framework, resulting in a 2D atomic norm minimization (2D-ANM) problem. Solving this via semi-definite programming (SDP) yields gridless azimuth-elevation estimation and high-accuracy range recovery. Simulations demonstrate accurate 3D localization and enhanced robustness of the proposed scheme, compared with subspace and compressive sensing methods.</description>

      <title>From Fixed to Fluid: Unlocking the New Potential with Fluid RIS (FRIS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to its flexible and intelligent electromagnetic signal manipulation, the technology of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) has attracted widespread attention. However, the potential of current RISs can only be partly unlocked due to their fixed geometry and element patterns. Motivated by the concept of the fluid antenna system (FAS), a novel RIS system, termed fluid RIS (FRIS), has been developed. Unlike traditional RISs, FRIS allows the element positions or radiation patterns to exhibit ``fluid" properties, i.e., dynamic reconfigurability, to adapt to the wireless environment, offering enhanced beamforming flexibility and environmental adaptability. Given that research on FRIS is still in its infancy, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of its current developments and future prospects. Specifically, the key features of FRIS are first presented, including its classification, fundamental mechanisms, and advantages. Next, potential application scenarios of FRIS are analyzed and discussed, followed by two illustrative case studies demonstrating its potential. Finally, the main open challenges and future research directions related to FRIS are highlighted.</description>

      <title>1-bit RIS-aided Index Modulation with Quantum Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a new index modulation (IM) scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted communications with 1-bit RIS phase resolution. In addition to the traditional modulated symbols, extra bits of information are embedded in the binary RIS phase vector by indexing the cardinality of the positive phases shifts. To maximize capacity, the IM-based RIS vector is selected so as to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver. The proposed IM design requires the solution of a quadratic binary optimization problem with an equality constraint at the transmitter as well as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem at the receiver. Since commercial solvers cannot directly handle constraints, a penalty method that embeds the equality constraint in the objective function is investigated. To overcome the empirical tuning of the penalty parameter, an iterative Augmented Lagrangian optimization technique is also investigated where a QUBO problem is solved at each iteration. The proposed design and associated mathematical framework are tested in a real-world quantum annealing device provided by D-WAVE. Rigorous experimental results demonstrate that the D-WAVE heuristic efficiently solves the considered combinatorial problems. Furthermore, theoretical bounds on the average capacity are provided. Both experimental and theoretical results show that the proposed design outperforms conventional counterparts.</description>

      <title>Optimum Spectrum Extension for PAPR Reduction of DFT-s-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Uplink coverage in cellular networks is constrained by the maximum UE transmit power, making peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) reduction essential. While DFT-s-OFDM with frequency-domain spectral shaping (FDSS) achieves significantly lower PAPR than OFDM, especially with pi/2-BPSK, the PAPR remains too high for higher-rate transmission. Spectrum extension (SE) combined with FDSS (FDSS-SE) can further reduce the PAPR for higher-order QAM. This paper considers FDSS-SE with parametrized FDSS windows spanning a range of possible power ripples, as well as arbitrary circular shifts of the subcarrier coefficients. We optimize both the frequency shift and the SE size, and show that there exists an optimal SE size for reducing the PAPR and another one for increasing the rate. Analysis and simulations reveal that both optima largely depend on the window attenuation but are nearly invariant in proportion to the bandwidth. While the PAPR-optimal SE size is nearly invariant to the constellation order of regular QAM, the rate-optimal SE size depends also on the SNR. These insights provide practical guidelines for beyond-5G uplink coverage enhancement, highlighting that SE size should be individually configured according to the user's FDSS window and link quality.</description>

      <title>Structure-Fair Quantum Circuit Complexity: An Information-Theoretic Lower Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fairly quantifying the complexity of quantum states that possess intrinsic structures (such as symmetries or encodings) is a fundamental challenge for benchmarking quantum technologies. We introduce the "Reference-Contingent Complexity" (RCC). Its core idea is to utilize the quantum relative entropy to measure the extent to which a state deviates from its "structured vacuum" (the maximum entropy state within its constrained subspace), thereby only pricing the generation of non-trivial information. We establish a central theorem, establishing that the RCC is a rigorous information-theoretic lower bound on universal quantum circuit complexity, a bound that features a linear leading term, a universal logarithmic correction, and a precise physical correction for the non-uniformity of the spectral distribution. Furthermore, we establish an operational protocol based on quantum hypothesis testing, which connects this theoretical lower bound to experimentally accessible observables. This work provides a structurally-fair yardstick for quantum technologies and offers a new perspective for exploring the intrinsic connection between computational cost and the generation of non-trivial information.</description>

      <title>Using Age of Information for Throughput Optimal Spectrum Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a spectrum sharing problem where two users attempt to communicate over N channels. The Primary User (PU) has prioritized transmissions and its occupancy on each channel over time can be modeled as a Markov chain. The Secondary User (SU) needs to determine which channels are free at each time-slot and attempt opportunistic transmissions. The goal of the SU is to maximize its own throughput, while simultaneously minimizing collisions with the PU, and satisfying spectrum access constraints. To solve this problem, we first decouple the multiple-channel problem into N single-channel problems. For each decoupled problem, we prove that there exists an optimal threshold policy that depends on the last observed PU occupancy and the freshness of this occupancy information. Second, we establish the indexability of the decoupled problems by analyzing the structure of the optimal threshold policy. Using this structure, we derive a Whittle index-based scheduling policy that allocates SU transmissions using the Age of Information (AoI) of accessed channels. We also extend our insights to PU occupancy models that are correlated across channels and incorporate learning of unknown Markov transition matrices into our policies. Finally, we provide detailed numerical simulations that demonstrate the performance gains of our approach.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Optimizing AoI-Energy Tradeoff under Unknown Channel Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a real-time monitoring system where a source node (with energy limitations) aims to keep the information status at a destination node as fresh as possible by scheduling status update transmissions over a set of channels. The freshness of information at the destination node is measured in terms of the Age of Information (AoI) metric. In this setting, a natural tradeoff exists between the transmission cost (or equivalently, energy consumption) of the source and the achievable AoI performance at the destination. This tradeoff has been optimized in the existing literature under the assumption of having a complete knowledge of the channel statistics. In this work, we develop online learning-based algorithms with finite-time guarantees that optimize this tradeoff in the practical scenario where the channel statistics are unknown to the scheduler. In particular, when the channel statistics are known, the optimal scheduling policy is first proven to have a threshold-based structure with respect to the value of AoI (i.e., it is optimal to drop updates when the AoI value is below some threshold). This key insight was then utilized to develop the proposed learning algorithms that surprisingly achieve an order-optimal regret (i.e., $O(1)$) with respect to the time horizon length.</description>

      <title>Barycentric decompositions for extensive monotone divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study sets of divergences or dissimilarity measures in a generalized real-algebraic setting which includes the cases of classical and quantum multivariate divergences. We show that a special subset of divergences, the so-called test spectrum, characterizes the rest of the divergences through barycentres and that the extreme points of relevant convex subsets of general divergences are contained within the test spectrum. Only some special parts of the test spectrum may contain non-extreme elements. We are able to fully characterize the test spectrum in the case of classical multivariate divergences. The quantum case is much more varied, and we demonstrate that essentially all the bivariate and multivariate quantum divergences suggested previously in literature are within the test spectrum and extreme within the set of all quantum (multivariate) divergences. This suggests that the variability of quantum divergences is real since all the previously suggested divergences are independent of each other.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.01153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.01153v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A near-field integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) framework is proposed, which introduces an additional distance dimension for both sensing and communications compared to the conventional far-field system. In particular, the Cramer-Rao bound for the near-field joint distance and angle sensing is derived, which is minimized subject to the minimum communication rate requirement of each user. Both fully digital antennas and hybrid digital and analog antennas are investigated. For fully digital antennas, a globally optimal solution of the ISAC waveform is obtained via semidefinite relaxation. For hybrid antennas, a high-quality solution is obtained through two-stage optimization. Numerical results demonstrate the performance gain introduced by the additional distance dimension of the near-field ISAC over the far-field ISAC.</description>

      <title>Robust Energy-Efficient DRL-Based Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS Systems with Jitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we propose an energy-efficient design for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) communication system with nonlinear energy harvesting (EH) and UAV jitter. A joint optimization problem is formulated to maximize the EH efficiency of the UAV-mounted RIS by controlling the user powers, RIS phase shifts, and time-switching factor, subject to quality of service and practical EH constraints. The problem is nonconvex and time-coupled due to UAV angular jitter and nonlinear EH dynamics, making it intractable for conventional optimization methods. To address this, we reformulate the problem as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) environment and develop a smoothed softmax dual deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm. The proposed method incorporates action clipping, entropy regularization, and softmax-weighted Q-value estimation to improve learning stability and exploration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm converges reliably under various UAV jitter levels and achieves an average EH efficiency of 45.07\%, approaching the 53.09\% upper bound of exhaustive search, and outperforming other DRL baselines.</description>

      <title>Distributed Hybrid Sketching for $\ell_2$-Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20301</link>

Abstract: Linear algebraic operations are ubiquitous in engineering applications, and arise often in a variety of fields including statistical signal processing and machine learning. With contemporary large datasets, to perform linear algebraic methods and regression tasks, it is necessary to resort to both distributed computations as well as data compression. In this paper, we study \textit{distributed} $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, a common technique used to efficiently perform linear regression. In our setting, data is distributed across multiple computing nodes and a goal is to minimize communication between the nodes and the coordinator in the distributed centralized network, while maintaining the geometry of the dataset. Furthermore, there is also the concern of keeping the data private and secure from potential adversaries. In this work, we address these issues through randomized sketching, where the key idea is to apply distinct sketching matrices on the local datasets. A novelty of this work is that we also consider \textit{hybrid sketching}, \textit{i.e.} a second sketch is applied on the aggregated locally sketched datasets, for enhanced embedding results. One of the main takeaways of this work is that by hybrid sketching, we can interpolate between the trade-offs that arise in off-the-shelf sketching matrices. That is, we can obtain gains in terms of embedding dimension or multiplication time. Our embedding arguments are also justified numerically.</description>

      <title>Saturation-Aware Snapshot Compressive Imaging: Theory and Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11869v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) uses coded masks to compress a 3D data cube into a single 2D snapshot. In practice, multiplexing can push intensities beyond the sensor's dynamic range, producing saturation that violates the linear SCI model and degrades reconstruction. This paper provides the first theoretical characterization of SCI recovery under saturation. We model clipping as an element-wise nonlinearity and derive a finite-sample recovery bound for compression-based SCI that links reconstruction error to mask density and the extent of saturation. The analysis yields a clear design rule: optimal Bernoulli masks use densities below one-half, decreasing further as saturation strengthens. Guided by this principle, we optimize mask patterns and introduce a novel reconstruction framework, Saturation-Aware PnP Net (SAPnet), which explicitly enforces consistency with saturated measurements. Experiments on standard video-SCI benchmarks confirm our theory and demonstrate that SAPnet significantly outperforms existing PnP-based methods.</description>

      <title>A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19375v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</description>

      <title>A Neural Difference-of-Entropies Estimator for Mutual Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating Mutual Information (MI), a key measure of dependence of random quantities without specific modelling assumptions, is a challenging problem in high dimensions. We propose a novel mutual information estimator based on parametrizing conditional densities using normalizing flows, a deep generative model that has gained popularity in recent years. This estimator leverages a block autoregressive structure to achieve improved bias-variance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust DNN Partitioning and Resource Allocation Under Uncertain Inference Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In edge intelligence systems, deep neural network (DNN) partitioning and data offloading can provide real-time task inference for resource-constrained mobile devices. However, the inference time of DNNs is typically uncertain and cannot be precisely determined in advance, presenting significant challenges in ensuring timely task processing within deadlines. To address the uncertain inference time, we propose a robust optimization scheme to minimize the total energy consumption of mobile devices while meeting task probabilistic deadlines. The scheme only requires the mean and variance information of the inference time, without any prediction methods or distribution functions. The problem is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) that involves jointly optimizing the DNN model partitioning and the allocation of local CPU/GPU frequencies and uplink bandwidth. To tackle the problem, we first decompose the original problem into two subproblems: resource allocation and DNN model partitioning. Subsequently, the two subproblems with probability constraints are equivalently transformed into deterministic optimization problems using the chance-constrained programming (CCP) method. Finally, the convex optimization technique and the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) technique are employed to obtain the optimal solution of the resource allocation subproblem and a stationary point of the DNN model partitioning subproblem, respectively. The proposed algorithm leverages real-world data from popular hardware platforms and is evaluated on widely used DNN models. Extensive simulations show that our proposed algorithm effectively addresses the inference time uncertainty with probabilistic deadline guarantees while minimizing the energy consumption of mobile devices.</description>

      <title>VIBE: Annotation-Free Video-to-Text Information Bottleneck Evaluation for TL;DR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17423v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many decision-making tasks, where both accuracy and efficiency matter, still require human supervision. For example, tasks like traffic officers reviewing hour-long dashcam footage or researchers screening conference videos can benefit from concise summaries that reduce cognitive load and save time. Yet current vision-language models (VLMs) often produce verbose, redundant outputs that hinder task performance. Existing video caption evaluation depends on costly human annotations and overlooks the summaries' utility in downstream tasks. We address these gaps with Video-to-text Information Bottleneck Evaluation (VIBE), an annotation-free method that scores VLM outputs using two metrics: grounding (how well the summary aligns with visual content) and utility (how informative it is for the task). VIBE selects from randomly sampled VLM outputs by ranking them according to the two scores to support effective human decision-making. Human studies on LearningPaper24, SUTD-TrafficQA, and LongVideoBench show that summaries selected by VIBE consistently improve performance-boosting task accuracy by up to 61.23% and reducing response time by 75.77% compared to naive VLM summaries or raw video.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.</description>
