      <title>The Mathematical Construction of the BFV Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a cryptographic scheme that enables computations to be performed directly on encrypted data, as if the data were in plaintext. BFV is one of the most popular FHE schemes. The BFV scheme is designed for homomorphic addition and multiplication of integers. BFV's encoding scheme does not require such approximation issues, because BFV is designed to encode only integers. Therefore, BFV guarantees exact encryption and decryption. BFV is suitable for use cases where the encrypted and decrypted values should exactly match (e.g., voting, financial computation), whereas CKKS is suitable for the use cases that tolerate tiny errors (e.g., data analytics, machine learning).
  In BFV, each plaintext is encrypted as an RLWE ciphertext. Therefore, BFV's ciphertext-to-ciphertext addition, ciphertext-to-plaintext addition, and ciphertext-to-plaintext multiplication are implemented based on GLWE's homomorphic addition and multiplication, with $k = 1$ to make GLWE an RLWE.
  This tutorial article is designed to help the reader understand how BFV works from the mathematical level.</description>

      <title>On graph classes with constant domination-packing ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dominating number $\gamma(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the minimum size of a vertex set whose closed neighborhood covers all the vertices of the graph. The packing number $\rho(G)$ of $G$ is the maximum size of a vertex set whose closed neighborhoods are pairwise disjoint. In this paper we study graph classes ${\cal G}$ such that $\gamma(G)/\rho(G)$ is bounded by a constant $c_{\cal G}$ for each $G\in {\cal G}$. We propose an inductive proof technique to prove that if $\cal G$ is the class of $2$-degenerate graphs, then there is such a constant bound $c_{\cal G}$. We note that this is the first monotone, dense graph class that is shown to have constant ratio. We also show that the classes of AT-free and unit-disk graphs have bounded ratio.
  In addition, our technique gives improved bounds on $c_{\cal G}$ for planar graphs, graphs of bounded treewidth or bounded twin-width. Finally, we provide some new examples of graph classes where the ratio is unbounded.</description>

      <title>Graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to path-length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two graph parameters are said to be coarsely equivalent if they are within constant factors from each other for every graph $G$. Recently, several graph parameters were shown to be coarsely equivalent to tree-length. Recall that the length of a tree-decomposition ${\cal T}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal T}(G)$, and the tree-length $tl(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all tree-decompositions of $G$. Similarly, the length of a path-decomposition ${\cal P}(G)$ of a graph $G$ is the largest diameter of a bag in ${\cal P}(G)$, and the path-length $pl(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum of the length, over all path-decompositions of $G$. In this paper, we present several graph parameters that are coarsely equivalent to path-length. Among other results, we show that the path-length of a graph $G$ is small if and only if one of the following equivalent conditions is true: (a) $G$ can be embedded to an unweighted caterpillar tree (equivalently, to a graph of path-width one) with a small additive distortion; (b) there is a constant $r\ge 0$ such that for every triple of vertices $u,v,w$ of $G$, disk of radius $r$ centered at one of them intercepts all paths connecting two others; (c) $G$ has a $k$-dominating shortest path with small $k\ge 0$; (d) $G$ has a $k'$-dominating pair with small $k'\ge 0$; (e) some power $G^\mu$ of $G$ is an AT-free (or even a cocomparability) graph for a small integer $\mu\ge 0$.</description>

      <title>On Almost Fair and Equitable Allocations of Indivisible Items for Non-monotone Valuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit well-studied problems of fair allocation of indivisible items among agents with general, non-monotone valuations. We explore the existence and efficient computation of allocations that satisfy either fairness or equity constraints. The fairness notions we consider ensure that each agent values her bundle at least as much as others', allowing for (any or some) item removal, while the equity guarantees roughly equal valuations among agents, with similar adjustments. For objective valuations where items are classified as either goods or chores, we present a pseudo-polynomial local-search algorithm computing an ``equitable-up-to-any-good-or-any-chore'' (EQX*) allocation, a weaker version of an ``equitable-up-to-any-item" (EQX) allocation. Additionally, we provide a polynomial-time greedy algorithm that computes an ``equitable-up-to-one-item" (EQ1) allocation, and a similar algorithm returning an EQX* allocation when the valuations are also additive. As a key technical contribution of this work, by leveraging fixed-point theorems (such as Sperner's Lemma and its variants), we establish the existence of ``equitable-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore'' (EQ1*) and ``envy-free-up-to-one-good-and-one-chore'' (EF1*) allocations for non-negative (and possibly non-objective and non-monotone) valuations. This holds even when items are arranged in a path and bundles must form connected sub-paths. Additionally, we present a polynomial-time dynamic-programming algorithm that computes an EQ1* allocation. Finally, we extend the EF1* and EQ1* results to non-positive valuations using a novel multi-coloring variant of Sperner's lemma, a combinatorial result of independent interest. For monotone non-increasing valuations and path-connected bundles, this implies the existence of EF1 and EQ1 allocations, with EQ1 allocations being efficiently computable.</description>

      <title>Decidability of Querying First-Order Theories via Countermodels of Finite Width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06348v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generic framework for establishing the decidability of a wide range of logical entailment problems (briefly called querying), based on the existence of countermodels that are structurally simple, gauged by certain types of width measures (with treewidth and cliquewidth as popular examples). As an important special case of our framework, we identify logics exhibiting width-finite finitely universal model sets, warranting decidable entailment for a wide range of homomorphism-closed queries, subsuming a diverse set of practically relevant query languages. As a particularly powerful width measure, we propose to employ Blumensath's partitionwidth, which subsumes various other commonly considered width measures and exhibits highly favorable computational and structural properties. Focusing on the formalism of existential rules as a popular showcase, we explain how finite partitionwidth sets of rules subsume other known abstract decidable classes but - leveraging existing notions of stratification - also cover a wide range of new rulesets. We expose natural limitations for fitting the class of finite unification sets into our picture and suggest several options for remedy.</description>

      <title>Treewidth 2 in the Planar Graph Product Structure Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that every planar graph is contained in $H_1\boxtimes H_2\boxtimes K_2$ for some graphs $H_1$ and $H_2$ both with treewidth 2. This resolves a question of Liu, Norin and Wood [arXiv:2410.20333]. We also show this result is best possible: for any $c \in \mathbb{N}$, there is a planar graph $G$ such that for any tree $T$ and graph $H$ with $\text{tw}(H) \leq 2$, $G$ is not contained in $H \boxtimes T \boxtimes K_c$.</description>
