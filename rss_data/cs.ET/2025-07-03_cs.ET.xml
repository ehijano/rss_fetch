      <title>StorySpace: Technology supporting reflection, expression, and discourse in classroom narrative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The StorySpace project studies the role new interface technologies might play in high school education. With this approach in mind, StorySpace is specifically designed to support and enhance classroom narrative, an already well-established classroom activity. StorySpace strives to achieve this through adherence to three design goals. The first is to trigger student reflection and interpretation. The narrative medium created by StorySpace should represent the topic of classroom discussion and learning in all its complexity. In building their representation, the students will then be confronted with that same complexity. The medium should also itself be exciting and compelling, making classroom narrative interesting and fun.</description>

      <title>Detecting Multiple Diseases in Multiple Crops Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: India, as a predominantly agrarian economy, faces significant challenges in agriculture, including substantial crop losses caused by diseases, pests, and environmental stress. Early detection and accurate identification of diseases across different crops are critical for improving yield and ensuring food security. This paper proposes a deep learning based solution for detecting multiple diseases in multiple crops, aimed to cover India's diverse agricultural landscape. We first create a unified dataset encompassing images of 17 different crops and 34 different diseases from various available repositories. Proposed deep learning model is trained on this dataset and outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of accuracy and the number of crops, diseases covered. We achieve a significant detection accuracy, i.e., 99 percent for our unified dataset which is 7 percent more when compared to state-of-the-art handling 14 crops and 26 different diseases only. By improving the number of crops and types of diseases that can be detected, proposed solution aims to provide a better product for Indian farmers.</description>

      <title>A wireless, inexpensive optical tracker for the CAVE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CAVE displays offer many advantages over other virtual reality (VR) displays, including a large, unencumbering viewing space. Unfortunately, the typical tracking subsystems used with CAVE displays tether the user and lessen this advantage. We have designed a simple, low-cost feet tracker that is wireless, leaving the user free to move. The tracker can be assembled for less than $200 US, and achieves an accuracy of 10 cm at a 20 Hz sampling rate. We have tested the prototype with two applications: a visualization supporting close visual inspection, and a walkthrough of the campus. Although the tracking was convincing, it was clear that the tracker's limitations make it less than ideal for applications requiring precise visual inspection. However, the freedom of motion allowed by the tracker was a compelling supplement to our campus walkthrough, allowing users to stroll and look around corners.</description>

      <title>Vertiport Terminal Scheduling and Throughput Analysis for Multiple Surface Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vertical Take-Off and Landing (VTOL) vehicles are gaining traction in both the delivery drone market and passenger transportation, driving the development of Urban Air Mobility (UAM) systems. UAM seeks to alleviate road congestion in dense urban areas by leveraging urban airspace. To handle UAM traffic, vertiport terminals (vertiminals) play a critical role in supporting VTOL vehicle operations such as take-offs, landings, taxiing, passenger boarding, refueling or charging, and maintenance. Efficient scheduling algorithms are essential to manage these operations and optimize vertiminal throughput while ensuring safety protocols. Unlike fixed-wing aircraft, which rely on runways for take-off and climbing in fixed directions, VTOL vehicles can utilize multiple surface directions for climbing and approach. This flexibility necessitates specialized scheduling methods. We propose a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to holistically optimize vertiminal operations, including taxiing, climbing (or approach) using multiple directions, and turnaround at gates. The proposed MILP reduces delays by up to 50%. Additionally, we derive equations to compute upper bounds of the throughput capacity of vertiminals, considering its core elements: the TLOF pad system, taxiway system, and gate system. Our results demonstrate that the MILP achieves throughput levels consistent with the theoretical maximum derived from these equations. We also validate our framework through a case study using a well-established vertiminal topology from the literature. Our MILP can be used to find the optimal configuration of vertiminal. This dual approach, MILP and throughput analysis, allows for comprehensive capacity analysis without requiring simulations while enabling efficient scheduling through the MILP formulation.</description>

      <title>Neural CRNs: A Natural Implementation of Learning in Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work introduces Neural CRNs, a general-purpose chemical neural network framework that embeds learning directly into mass-action chemical reaction systems. Unlike prior approaches that chemically implement and compose discrete neural computations, Neural CRNs adopt an analog computing approach, where both forward and backward passes of learning are implemented as continuous-time evolutions of molecular concentrations. Such an analog formulation naturally aligns with the analog nature of chemical kinetics, yielding concise circuits and practicable reactions. We demonstrate this efficiency by constructing a streamlined supervised learning procedure executable in just two sequential stages. We then implement several learning circuits to demonstrate the framework's linear and nonlinear modeling capabilities and to validate its learning procedure. These circuits are implemented entirely using unimolecular and bimolecular reactions, avoiding the complexity of higher-order chemistries. In summary, Neural CRNs offer a compact, scalable, and autonomous framework for biochemical learning, opening new avenues for adaptive computing in synthetic biology, bioengineering, and biomedicine.</description>

      <title>Controversy and consensus: common ground and best practices for life cycle assessment of emerging technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10382v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The past decade has seen a surge in public and private applications of life cycle assessment (LCA), accelerated by emerging policies and disclosure practices mandating its use for sustainability impact reporting. Simultaneously, the magnitude and diversity of stakeholder groups affected by decisions informed by LCA have expanded rapidly. This has intensified the need for LCA to be conducted more quickly, accurately, and--crucially--earlier in the technology development cycle, when products and materials can still be readily modified, replaced, or optimized. When applied early, LCA has the potential to guide design choices, steer innovation, and avoid "lock-in" of adverse environmental impacts. However, this growing demand has surfaced several unresolved challenges around best practices for assessing sustainability at early stages of technology development. In this paper, we examine six such controversial topics--(1) appropriate use of LCA, (2) uncertainty assessment, (3) comparison with incumbents, (4) methodological standardization, (5) scale-up from laboratory or pilot data, and (6) stakeholder engagement--selected to highlight key debates from a series of workshop-style discussions convened by the LCA of Emerging Technologies Research Network. Rather than a comprehensive review with definitive conclusions, this paper adopts a Faraday Discussion-style approach to spotlight areas of agreement and disagreement among our network of LCA experts. For each issue, we present a declarative resolution, summarize key arguments for and against it, identify points of consensus, and provide recommendations. We aim to raise awareness of shared challenges in emerging technology assessment and foster more transparent, evidence-based, and context-informed approaches within the LCA community.</description>

      <title>Communicating Smartly in Molecular Communication Environments: Neural Networks in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent developments in the Internet of Bio-Nano Things (IoBNT) are laying the groundwork for innovative applications across the healthcare sector. Nanodevices designed to operate within the body, managed remotely via the internet, are envisioned to promptly detect and actuate on potential diseases. In this vision, an inherent challenge arises due to the limited capabilities of individual nanosensors; specifically, nanosensors must communicate with one another to collaborate as a cluster. Aiming to research the boundaries of the clustering capabilities, this survey emphasizes data-driven communication strategies in molecular communication (MC) channels as a means of linking nanosensors. Relying on the flexibility and robustness of machine learning (ML) methods to tackle the dynamic nature of MC channels, the MC research community frequently refers to neural network (NN) architectures. This interdisciplinary research field encompasses various aspects, including the use of NNs to facilitate communication in MC environments, their implementation at the nanoscale, explainable approaches for NNs, and dataset generation for training. Within this survey, we provide a comprehensive analysis of fundamental perspectives on recent trends in NN architectures for MC, the feasibility of their implementation at the nanoscale, applied explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques, and the accessibility of datasets along with best practices for their generation. Additionally, we offer open-source code repositories that illustrate NN-based methods to support reproducible research for key MC scenarios. Finally, we identify emerging research challenges, such as robust NN architectures, biologically integrated NN modules, and scalable training strategies.</description>
