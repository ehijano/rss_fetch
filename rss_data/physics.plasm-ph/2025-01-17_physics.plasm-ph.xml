      <title>On the number of atomic configurations in hot plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose approximate and accurate formulas for the number of electron configurations in hot plasmas. Such a quantity is an ingredient of algorithms devoted to the generation of configurations or superconfigurations, which is a pre-requisite of opacity calculations. One of the main formulas involves Bessel functions of fractional order and the procedure for improving the accuracy through a series expansion is explained.</description>

      <title>Ionisation Calculations using Classical Molecular Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By performing an ensemble of molecular dynamics simulations, the model-dependent ionisation state is computed for strongly interacting systems self-consistently. This is accomplished through a free energy minimisation framework based on the technique of thermodynamic integration. To illustrate the method, two simple models applicable to partially ionised hydrogen plasma are presented in which pair potentials are employed between ions and neutral particles. Within the models, electrons are either bound in the hydrogen ground state or distributed in a uniform charge-neutralising background. Particular attention is given to the transition between atomic gas and ionised plasma, where the effect of neutral interactions is explored beyond commonly used models in the chemical picture. Furthermore, pressure ionisation is observed when short range repulsion effects are included between neutrals. The developed technique is general, and we discuss the applicability to a variety of molecular dynamics models for partially ionised warm dense matter.</description>

      <title>New Insights on the High Reconnection Rate and the Diminishment of Ion Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently discovered electron-only reconnection has drawn great interests due to abnormal features like lack of ion outflows and high reconnection rates. Using particle-in-cell simulations, we investigate their physical mechanisms. The reconnection rate, when normalized by ion parameters ($R_i$), may appear anomalously high, whereas that normalized by electron parameters ($R_e$) remains ~0.1. We propose that the essence of high $R_i$ is insufficient field line bending outside the electron diffusion region, indicating an incomplete development of the ion diffusion region. It may result from bursty reconnection in thin current sheets, or small system sizes. The ion outflow diminishes at high $\beta_i$ when the gyroradius ($\rho_i$) exceeds the system size. Low-velocity ions still experience notable acceleration from Hall fields. However, a local distribution includes many high-velocity ions that experience random accelerations from different electric fields across $\rho_i$, resulting in near-zero bulk velocities. Our study helps understand reconnection structures and the underlying physics for transitions between different regimes.</description>
