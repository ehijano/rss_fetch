      <title>Derived Functors, Resolutions, and Homological Dualities in n-ary Gamma-Semirings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops the homological backbone of the theory of non-commutative $n$-ary $\Gamma$-semirings. Starting from an $n$-ary $\Gamma$-semiring $(T,+,\tilde{\mu})$ and its $\Gamma$-ideals, we work in the slot-sensitive categories of left, right, and bi-$\Gamma$-modules, and endow the bi-module category with a Quillen exact structure compatible with the $n$-ary multiplication. Within this exact framework we construct bar-type projective resolutions and cofree-based injective resolutions under natural $\Gamma$-Noetherian and $\Gamma$-regular hypotheses on $T$, and we obtain finite projective resolutions for finitely presented bi-modules under $\Gamma$-Noetherian conditions. On this basis we define the derived functors $\ExtG$ and $\TorG$ for bi-$\Gamma$-modules, prove their balance with respect to projective and injective resolutions, establish long exact sequences and a Yoneda interpretation via iterated extensions, and construct K\"unneth-type spectral sequences and base-change isomorphisms. Interpreting bi-$\Gamma$-modules as quasi-coherent sheaves on the non-commutative $\Gamma$-spectrum $\SpecGnC{T}$, these homological invariants provide the appropriate derived language for a non-commutative $\Gamma$-geometry and prepare the ground for the spectral and geometric analysis carried out in the third part of this series.</description>

      <title>Connected Hopf Algebras that are Not Hopf Ore Extensions of Enveloping Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a family of connected Hopf algebras with finite Gelfand-Kirillov dimension, none of which is an iterated Hopf Ore extension of the universal enveloping algebra of its primitive part. This provides a negative answer to a question posed by Li and Zhou. It is also demonstrated that these connected Hopf algebras can be formulated as an iterated crossed product of enveloping algebras.</description>

      <title>A new approach to the grammic monoid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give an alternative description of the grammic monoid in terms of weakly increasing subsequences. Specifically, we show that words $u,v$ in the generators $\{1,\ldots, n\}$ determine the same element of the grammic monoid of rank $n$ if and only if for all $1 \leq p \leq q$, the maximum length of a weakly increasing subsequence on alphabet $\{p,\ldots, q\}$ is the same in $u$ and $v$. Our proof makes use of a particular tropical representation of the plactic monoid determined by such sequences: we demonstrate that the grammic monoid is isomorphic to the image of this representation, and (by applying a result of the first author and Kambites) immediately deduce that the grammic monoid of rank $n$ satisfies exactly the same semigroup identities as the monoid of $n \times n$ upper triangular tropical matrices. This gives a partial generalisation of a result of Volkov, who has shown that the grammic monoid of rank $3$ satisfies exactly the same semigroup identities as the plactic monoid of rank $3$ which in turn is known (by applying a result of the first author and Kambites) to satisfy the exactly the same semigroup identities as the monoid of $3 \times 3$ upper triangular tropical matrices. Furthermore, we find that the grammic monoid of infinite rank does not satisfy any non-trivial semigroup identity, and demonstrate that the grammic congruence satisfies some useful compatibility properties.</description>

      <title>Varieties of graded $W$-algebras and asymptotic behavior of codimension growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $W$ be a $G$-graded algebra over a field of characteristic zero, where $G$ is a finite group. We develope a theory of generalized $G$-graded polynomial identities satisfied by any finite-dimensional $W$-algebra $A$, by mean of the graded multiplier algebra of $A.$ In particular, we first prove that the graded generalized exponent exists and equals the ordinary one. Then, we explicitly compute the $G$-graded generalized identities of $UT_2,$ the $2 \times 2$ upper triangular matrix algebra equipped with its canonical $\mathbb{Z}_2$-grading, under all the possible graded $W$-actions. Finally, we exhibit examples of varieties of graded $W$-algebras with almost polynomial growth of the codimensions.</description>

      <title>The Waring Problem of Complex Binary Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Waring problem of forms concerns the expression of homogeneous multivariate polynomials as sums of powers of linear forms. This paper focuses on complex binary forms, and we solve the Waring problem for them using basic tools in algebra and analysis. In particular, we present elementary treatments of the Apolarity Lemma and Sylvester's 1851 Theorem, which are easily accessible and will provide an ideal approach for future extension to the general case.</description>

      <title>Strongly and Uniformly Strongly co-Hopfian Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the so-called {\it strongly co-Hopfian} and {\it uniformly strongly co-Hopfian} Abelian groups, significantly generalizing some important results due to Abdelalim in the J. Math. Analysis (2015). Specifically, we prove that any strongly co-Hopfian group is a direct sum of an sp-group and a divisible group, both of which are strongly co-Hopfian. We also show that a group whose maximal torsion subgroup and corresponding torsion-free factor are both strongly co-Hopfian will also be strongly co-Hopfian. We provide several examples demonstrating that the converse of this statement does {\it not} generally hold, thus illustrating that the structure of genuinely mixed strongly co-Hopfian groups is rather complicated and does {\it not} entirely depend on the structure of its maximal torsion subgroup. We also establish that a strongly co-Hopfian group is cotorsion exactly when it is algebraically compact and, particularly, a reduced (adjusted) cotorsion group is strongly co-Hopfian only when its maximal torsion subgroup is strongly co-Hopfian. Additionally, we demonstrate that a strongly co-Hopfian group is uniformly strongly co-Hopfian exactly when its maximal torsion subgroup is strongly co-Hopfian.</description>

      <title>Extension Condition "violations" and Merge optimality constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze, using the mathematical formulation of Merge within the Strong Minimalist Thesis framework, a set of linguistic phenomena, including head-to-head movement, phrasal affixes and syntactic cliticization, verb-particle alternation, and operator-variable phenomena. These are often regarded as problematic, as violations of the Extension Condition. We show that, in fact, all of these phenomena can be explained without involving any EC violation. We first show that derivations using Sideward Merge are possible for all of these cases: these respect EC, though they involve some amount of optimality violations, with respect to Resource Restrictions cost functions, andthe amount of violation differs among these cases. We show that all the cases that involve large optimality violations can be derived in alternative ways involving neither EC nor the use of SM. The main remaining case (head-to-head movement) only involves SM with minimal violations of optimality (near equilibrium fluctuations). We analyze explicitly also the cases of multiple wh-fronting, clusters of clitics in Romance languages and possessor agreement construction in Korean, and how an explanation of these phenomena based on SM can be made compatible with the colored operad generators for phases and theta roles. We also show that the EC condition has a clear algebraic meaning in the mathematical formulation of Merge and is therefore an intrinsic structural algebraic constraint of the model, rather than an additional assumption. We also show that the minimal optimality violating SM plays a structural role in the Markovian properties of Merge, and we compare different optimality conditions coming from Minimal Search and from Resource Restriction in terms of their effect on the dynamics of the Hopf algebra Markov chain, in a simple explicit example.</description>

      <title>Eventual periodicity of the Smith forms of integer matrix powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Smith forms of the powers of an integer square matrix behave in an eventually periodic manner. More precisely, if $\mathrm{SF}(M)$ denotes the Smith form of $M \in \Z^{m \times m}$, then for every $A \in \Z^{m \times m}$ there exist $n_0 \in \N$, an integer $T \geq 1$, and a constant diagonal matrix $D \in \Z^{m \times m}$ such that $n \geq n_0$ implies $\mathrm{SF}(A^{n+T})=D \cdot \mathrm{SF}(A^n)$. This provides an eventually affirmative answer to a conjecture posed in 2013 by R. Bruner. We also show that both $n_0$ and $T$ can be arbitrarily large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2208.11841v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Kupershmidt operators, Nijenhuis operators, and Kupershmidt-Nijenhuis structures on finite-dimensional pre-Malcev algebras over a field of characteristic zero. We construct several new families of complex pre-Malcev algebras that are not pre-Lie algebras in dimensions two, three and four. We use the compatibility of linear operators to establish connections between Kupershmidt operators, Nijenhuis operators, and Kupershmidt-Nijenhuis structures on pre-Malcev algebras. Moreover, we use a method from computational ideal theory to characterize the geometric structures of the varieties of Kupershmidt operators and Nijenhuis operators on a three-dimensional complex pre-Malcev algebra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.07305v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that in a PI-ring (or polynomial identity ring) $S$, for an element $A \in \mathbb{M}_m(S)$ if $A^n= A^{n+1}X$ for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$ and $X \in \mathbb{M}_m(S)$, then there exists an element $Y\in \mathbb{M}_m(S)$ such that $A^n = YA^{n+1}$. As a consequence, we show that this property also holds in matrix rings over commutative rings, thereby confirming a recent conjecture proposed by C\u{a}lug\u{a}reanu and Pop. Moreover, we present another independent proofs of this conjecture, highlighting different structural approaches and techniques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the concept of Aut-stable subspaces has played an important role in the characterization of polynomial rings, a topic that remains a challenging problem in algebraic geometry (see [8]). It turns out that polynomial rings with more than two variables do not have any Aut-stable subspaces over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero [7]. In this work, we characterize all Aut-stable subspaces and Aut-stable subalgebras of Grassmann algebras.</description>

      <title>Cluster structures via representation theory: cluster ensembles, tropical duality, cluster characters and quantisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a general theory of cluster categories, applying to a 2-Calabi-Yau extriangulated category $\mathcal{C}$ and cluster-tilting subcategory $\mathcal{T}$ satisfying only mild finiteness conditions. We show that the structure theory of $\mathcal{C}$ and the representation theory of $\mathcal{T}$ give rise to the rich combinatorial structures of seed data and cluster ensembles, via Grothendieck groups and homological algebra. We demonstrate that there is a natural dictionary relating cluster-tilting subcategories and their tilting theory to A-side tropical cluster combinatorics and, dually, relating modules over $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ to the X-side; here $\underline{\mathcal{T}}$ is the image of $\mathcal{T}$ in the triangulated stable category of $\mathcal{C}$. Moreover, the exchange matrix associated to $\mathcal{T}$ arises from a natural map $p_{\mathcal{T}}\colon\mathrm{K}_0(\operatorname{mod}\underline{\mathcal{T}})\to\mathrm{K}_0(\mathcal{T})$ closely related to taking projective resolutions.
  Via our approach, we categorify many key identities involving mutation, g-vectors and c-vectors, including in infinite rank cases and in the presence of loops and 2-cycles. We are also able to define A- and X-cluster characters, which yield A- and X-cluster variables when there are no loops or 2-cycles, and which enable representation-theoretic proofs of cluster-theoretical statements.
  Continuing with the same categorical philosophy, we give a definition of a quantum cluster category, as a cluster category together with the choice of a map closely related to the adjoint of $p_{\mathcal{T}}$. Our framework enables us to show that any Hom-finite exact cluster category admits a canonical quantum structure, generalising results of Gei{\ss}--Leclerc--Schr\"oer.</description>

Abstract: This paper develops a theory of $C^\infty$-superrings and their associated $C^\infty$-superschemes. We prove a key equivalence between the category of fair affine $C^\infty$-superschemes and the category of fair $C^\infty$-superrings. We place special emphasis on split $C^\infty$-superrings, which generalize the function algebras of supermanifolds and serve as building blocks for more complex, non-split structures.</description>

      <title>Noetherian pointed Hopf algebras are affine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.19293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a field. In this paper, we introduce the notions of $\textit{reduction order}$ and $\textit{reduction-factorization}$ on words, and use them to show that any right or left Noetherian pointed Hopf algebra over $k$ is affine. This result offers a partial affirmative answer to the classical affineness question for Noetherian Hopf algebras posed by Wu and Zhang \cite{WZ2003}. For a pointed Hopf algebra $H$ over $k$, we construct a well-ordered set $X$ such that: (1) $H$ is generated, as an algebra, by the subset $X_I$ of irreducible letters (with respect to the reduction order); and (2) $X_I$ is finite whenever $H$ is right Noetherian.</description>
