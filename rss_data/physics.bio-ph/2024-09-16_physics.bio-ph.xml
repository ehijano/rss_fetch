      <title>Mechanosensitive ion channels: Old but new</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ion channels orchestrate the communication between cells and their environment. These are special proteins capable of changing their shape to allow ions to pass through membranes in response to stimuli like membrane tension. As the letters are written and exchanged in the form of ionic currents, the energetic cost of this communication is of interest to many. To this end, we introduce the nanoscale thermodynamics of mechanosensitive ion channels, which amounts to defining work and heat for traces obtained during patch-clamp experiments. We also discuss the interplay between ion channel physics and evolution by showing how information-processing capabilities are coupled with the energy landscapes of channels.</description>

      <title>Dynamic landscapes and statistical limits on growth during cell fate specification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complexity of gene regulatory networks in multicellular organisms makes interpretable low-dimensional models highly desirable. An attractive geometric picture, attributed to Waddington, visualizes the differentiation of a cell into diverse functional types as gradient flow on a dynamic potential landscape, but it is unclear under what biological constraints this metaphor is mathematically precise. Here, we show that growth-maximizing regulatory strategies that guide a single cell to a target distribution of cell types are described by time-dependent potential landscapes, under certain generic growth-control tradeoffs. Our analysis leads to a sharp bound on the time it takes for a population to grow to a target distribution of a certain size. We show how the framework can be used to compute Waddington-like epigenetic landscapes and growth curves in an illustrative model of growth and differentiation. The theory suggests a conceptual link between nonequilibrium thermodynamics and cellular decision-making during development.</description>

      <title>On the mechanism of thermal self-regulation of trees: a kind of homeothermic observation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: What is certain is that surface temperatures around the globe vary considerably, regardless of the time scales or underlying causes. Since 1850, we have observed an average increase in global surface temperature anomalies of 1.2$^{\circ}$ and a median increase of 0.7$^{\circ}$: this overall difference masks significant regional differences. Nearly 60\% of the world's population now lives in urban areas, where vegetation cover has been significantly reduced, despite the paradoxical fact that vegetation plays an important role in regulating the thermal environment (\textit{eg} through the shading provided by tree canopies). Continuous electrical and thermal measurements of trees in a Parisian grove (France) show and quantify that canopies are not the only protectors against heat waves; we must also consider the role of tree trunks. It is clear that these trunks probably regulate themselves, possibly by modulating the uptake of groundwater, whose geothermal stability is well established at a depth of just one meter. This quantitative observation should not be overlooked in the urban planning of our cities.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning in meiosis II oocytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cytoplasmic streaming, the persistent flow of fluid inside a cell, induces intracellular transport, which plays a key role in fundamental biological processes. In meiosis II mouse oocytes (developing egg cells) awaiting fertilisation, the spindle, which is the protein structure responsible for dividing genetic material in a cell, must maintain its position near the cell cortex (the thin actin network bound to the cell membrane) for many hours. However, the cytoplasmic streaming that accompanies this stable positioning would intuitively appear to destabilise the spindle position. Here, through a combination of numerical and analytical modelling, we reveal a new, hydrodynamic mechanism for stable spindle positioning beneath the cortical cap. We show that this stability depends critically on the spindle size and the active driving from the cortex, and demonstrate that stable spindle positioning can result purely from a hydrodynamic suction force exerted on the spindle by the cytoplasmic flow. Our findings show that local fluid dynamic forces can be sufficient to stabilise the spindle, explaining robustness against perturbations not only perpendicular but also parallel to the cortex. Our results shed light on the importance of cytoplasmic streaming in mammalian meiosis.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic hovering of swimming bacteria above surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flagellated bacteria are hydrodynamically attracted to rigid walls, yet past work shows a 'hovering' state where they swim stably at a finite height above surfaces. We use numerics and theory to reveal the physical origin of hovering. Simulations first show that hovering requires an elongated cell body and results from a tilt away from the wall. Theoretical models then identify two essential asymmetries: the response of width-asymmetric cells to active flows created by length-asymmetric cells. A minimal model reconciles near and far-field hydrodynamics, capturing all key features of hovering.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Optimization of non-Kasha Behavior and of Transient Dynamics in Model Retinal Isomerization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing a model of retinal isomerization in Rhodopsin, the first step in vision, that accounts for both experimental transient and stationary state observables is challenging. Here, multi-objective Bayesian optimization is employed to refine the parameters of a minimal two-state-two-mode (TM) model describing the photoisomerization of retinal in Rhodopsin. With an appropriate selection of objectives, the optimized retinal model predicts excitation wavelength-dependent fluorescence spectra that closely align with experimentally observed non-Kasha behavior in the non-equilibrium steady state. Further, adjustments to the potential energy surface within the TM model reduce the discrepancies across the time domain. Overall, agreement with experimental data is excellent.</description>

      <title>Persistent pseudopod splitting is an effective chemotaxis strategy in shallow gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single-cell organisms and various cell types use a range of motility modes when following a chemical gradient, but it is unclear which mode is best suited for different gradients. Here, we model directional decision-making in chemotactic amoeboid cells as a stimulus-dependent actin recruitment contest. Pseudopods extending from the cell body compete for a finite actin pool to push the cell in their direction until one pseudopod wins and determines the direction of movement. Our minimal model provides a quantitative understanding of the strategies cells use to reach the physical limit of accurate chemotaxis, aligning with data without explicit gradient sensing or cellular memory for persistence. To generalize our model, we employ reinforcement learning optimization to study the effect of pseudopod suppression, a simple but effective cellular algorithm by which cells can suppress possible directions of movement. Different pseudopod-based chemotaxis strategies emerge naturally depending on the environment and its dynamics. For instance, in static gradients, cells can react faster at the cost of pseudopod accuracy, which is particularly useful in noisy, shallow gradients where it paradoxically increases chemotactic accuracy. In contrast, in dynamics gradients, cells form \textit{de novo} pseudopods. Overall, our work demonstrates mechanical intelligence for high chemotaxis performance with minimal cellular regulation.</description>

      <title>Advancing flight physics through natural adaptation and animal learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluid dynamics, and flight in particular, is a domain where organisms challenge our understanding of its physics. Integrating the current knowledge of animal flight, we propose to revisit the use of live animals to study physical phenomena. After a short description of the physics of flight, we examine the broad literature on animal flight focusing on studies of living animals. We start out reviewing the diverse animal species studied so far and then focus on the experimental techniques used to study them quantitatively. Our network analysis reveals how the three clades of animals performing powered flight - insects, birds and bats - are studied using substantially different combinations of measurement techniques. We then combine these insights with a new paradigm for increasing our physical understanding of flight. This paradigm relies on the concept of Animal Learning, where animals are used as probes to study fluid phenomena and variables involved in flight, harnessing their natural adaptability.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-RNA with parallel aligned single-strands and periodic base sequence as a new universality class</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a field theory for RNA-like polymers with periodic base sequence GCGCG..., where only single-strands aligned in the same direction form double strands. The field theory is derived from a lattice model that incorporates excluded volume effects, base sequence, and temperature dependent renaturation/denaturation.
  The artificial directionality leads to a novel universality class, not related to conventional branched polymers and Lee-Yang field theory. This universality class is unstable against natural pairing, where oppositely aligned single-strands form double strands. The denaturation/renaturation transition is a continuous crossover between two $\varphi_{n=0}^{4}$ critical points and the critical point of the new universality class.</description>

      <title>Hippocampal synchronization in a realistic CA1 neuron model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work delves into studying the synchronization in two realistic neuron models using Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. Unlike simplistic point-like models, excitatory synapses are here randomly distributed along the dendrites, introducing strong stochastic contributions into their signal propagation. To focus on the role of different excitatory positions, we use two copies of the same neuron whose synapses are located at different distances from the soma and are exposed to identical Poissonian distributed current pulses. The synchronization is investigated through a specifically defined spiking correlation function, and its behavior is analyzed as a function of several parameters: inhibition weight, distance from the soma of one synaptic group, excitatory inactivation delay, and weight of the excitatory synapses.</description>

      <title>Effects of synapse location, delay and background stochastic activity on synchronising hippocampal CA1 neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10460v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the synchronisation of neurons in a realistic model under the Hodgkin-Huxley dynamics. To focus on the role of the different locations of the excitatory synapses, we use two identical neurons where the set of input signals is grouped at two different distances from the soma. The system is intended to represent a CA1 hippocampal neuron in which the synapses arriving from the CA3 neurons of the trisynaptic pathway appear to be localised in the apical dendritic region and are, in principle, either proximal or distal to the soma. Synchronisation is studied using a specifically defined spiking correlation function as a function of various parameters such as the distance from the soma of one of the synaptic groups, the inhibition weight and the associated activation delay. We found that the neurons' spiking activity depends nonmonotonically on the relative dendritic location of the synapses and their inhibitory weight, whereas the synchronisation measure always decreases with inhibition, and strongly depends on its activation time delay. The background activity on the somas results essentially independent on the fluctuation intensity and strongly support the importance of the balance between inhibition and excitation for neuronal synchronization.</description>

Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is known as a powerful machine learning approach for learning complex dynamics from limited data. Here, we use RC to predict highly stochastic dynamics of cell shapes. We find that RC is able to predict the steady state climate from very limited data. Furthermore, the RC learns the timescale of transients from only four observations. We find that these capabilities of the RC to act as a dynamic twin allows us to also infer important statistics of cell shape dynamics of unobserved conditions.</description>

Abstract: We propose a statistical physics model of a neutral community, where each agent can represent identical plant species growing in the vertical direction with sunlight in the form of rich-get-richer competition. Disturbance added to this ecosystem, which makes an agent restart from the lowest growth level, is realized as a stochastic resetting. We show that in this model for sufficiently strong competition, vertical diversity characterized by a family of Hill numbers robustly emerges as a local maximum at intermediate disturbance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07766v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit old electrical measurements conducted on a poplar tree in 2003 (Gibert et al. 2006), which showed the presence of a diurnal electrical signal, attributed to an electrokinetic phenomenon correlated with sap flow, even in winter. We reanalyze these data using the singular spectrum analysis method and demonstrate that the electrical signal measured at various locations (roots, trunk, and branches) on the poplar tree can be decomposed to over 80\% into a sum of 7 pseudo-periods, all linked to luni-solar tides. The precision of the extracted periods exceeds that of models. To validate these old measurements, we have reproduced the 2003 protocol since 2018 at the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, on 3 oak trees and 3 hornbeams. The electrical signals today exhibit the same characteristics as those of 2003. Tidal forces could be a driving force of sap flow in trees.</description>

      <title>A practical approach to calculating magnetic Johnson noise for precision measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic Johnson noise is an important consideration for many applications involving precision magnetometry, and its significance will only increase in the future with improvements in measurement sensitivity. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be utilized to derive analytic expressions for magnetic Johnson noise in certain situations. But when used in conjunction with finite element analysis tools, the combined approach is particularly powerful as it provides a practical means to calculate the magnetic Johnson noise arising from conductors of arbitrary geometry and permeability. In this paper, we demonstrate this method to be one of the most comprehensive approaches presently available to calculate thermal magnetic noise. In particular, its applicability is shown to not be limited to cases where the noise is evaluated at a point in space but also can be expanded to include cases where the magnetic field detector has a more general shape, such as a finite size loop, a gradiometer, or a detector that consists of a polarized atomic species trapped in a volume. Furthermore, some physics insights gained through studies made using this method are discussed</description>
