      <title>Zero Indirect Band Gap and Flat Bands in a Niobium Oxyiodide Cluster Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explorative chemistry in a reaction system composed of NbI4, Li2(CN2), and Li2O has led to the discovery of a number of niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds. During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Stripe antiferromagnetism in van der Waals metal HoTe3 decoupled from charge density wave order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $R\mathrm{Te}_3$ ($R = \text{rare earth}$) family of layered van der Waals (vdW) compounds hosts coexisting magnetic and charge density wave (CDW) orders, yet the interplay between these degrees of freedom remains little explored. Combining polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction on single-crystal $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$, we identify two distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, both exhibiting a collinear $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ motif within individual vdW layers. The two phases are distinguished by the vdW stacking of magnetic layers: ferromagnetic (FM) stacking in the higher-temperature AFM-II phase, here termed ``vertical-stripe'', and AFM stacking in the AFM-I ground state, here termed ``tilted-stripe''; the two phases have propagation vectors $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m2}} = (0.48, 0, 0)$ and $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m1}} = (0.5, 0.5, 0)$, respectively. In contrast to the CDW-driven exotic magnetism in $\mathrm{DyTe}_3$, $\mathrm{TbTe}_3$, and $\mathrm{GdTe}_3$, we find no evidence for coupling between magnetism and CDW in $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$. The relative alignment between AFM and CDW propagation vectors, as well as single-ion anisotropy, are likely essential for generating coupled spin/charge orders in layered vdW systems.</description>

      <title>Liouvillian interpolation of the self-energy of cluster dynamical mean-field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two widely-used non-local extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), cellular DMFT (CDMFT) and the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), both yield self-energies marred by having some unphysical properties: CDMFT yields real-space self-energies that are not translationally invariant, and DCA yields momentum-space self-energies with discontinuities in their momentum dependence. It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extensive Monte Carlo study of the classical Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions $J_n$ between the first, second, and third neighbors is performed in a broad region of $J_2 / J_1$, $J_3 / J_1$ ratios, and temperature. The character of the phase transitions is analyzed via the Binder cumulant method. The Neel temperature $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and the frustration parameter (the ratio $f= |\theta|/T_{\mathrm{N}}$, $\theta$ being the Curie-Weiss temperature) are calculated. A comparison with the Tyablikov approximation is carried out. The strength of the frustration effects is explored. Possible applications to antiferromagnetic perovskites, such as CaMnO$_3$ and HgMnO$_3$, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic magnetism at the surface of a non-magnetic bulk insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The potential for topological Kondo insulating behavior in d-electron systems has attracted interest in studying the surface states of the correlated insulators FeSb2 and FeSi. While detailed studies and theoretical description of a spin-orbit coupled ferromagnetic surface state have been applied to FeSi, the magnetic properties of the surface states of FeSb2 have not been addressed. Here, we report on the surface magnetic properties of FeSb2, utilizing the surface area dependence of magnetic susceptibility to separate the surface Curie-Weiss temperature dependence from the bulk spin-gap susceptibility. We use these results to further extract the surface magnetic anisotropy of a thin, rough-surfaced single-crystal FeSb2 to compare with the observed magnetotransport anisotropy, and find good agreement between the anisotropy in the surface magnetization and surface magnetotransport. We conclude with evidence of an anomalous Hall contribution to the low-temperature surface transport.</description>

      <title>Entanglement negativity in decohered topological states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part.</description>

      <title>A Tale of Two Plateaus: Competing Orders in Spin-1 and Spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ Pyrochlore Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations with bond dimensions up to $20\ 000$ to determine the magnetization curves of spin-1 and spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnets. Both models exhibit a robust half-magnetization plateau, and we find that the same 16-site state (quadrupled unit cell) is selected in both cases on the largest 64-site cubic cluster we consider for the plateau state. This contrasts sharply with the effective quantum dimer model prediction which favors the ``R'' state, and demonstrates the breakdown of the perturbative mechanism at the Heisenberg point. These results provide a nonperturbative characterization of field-induced phases in pyrochlore magnets and predictive guidance for spin-1 and spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ materials.</description>

      <title>Ab Initio Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo in the Thermodynamic Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction via interpolative separable density fitting with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $O(N^3)$ and $O(N^2)$ with arbitrary basis, respectively, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>Superexchanges and Charge Transfer in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04739v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of ambient-pressure superconductivity with $T_c$ above 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films represents a significant advance in the field of nickelate superconductor. Motivated by the experimental reports, here we study an 11-band $d-p$ Hubbard model with tight-binding parameters derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations, using large scale determinant quantum Monte Carlo and cellular dynamical mean-field theory. Our results reveal that the major superexchange couplings in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films can be substantially weaker than in the bulk material at 29.5 Gpa. Specifically, the out-of-plane antiferromagnetic correlation between Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals is reduced by about 27\% in film, while the in-plane magnetic correlations remain largely unaffected. We evaluate the corresponding antiferromagnetic coupling constants, $J_{\perp}$ and $J_{\parallel}$ using perturbation theory. With regard to charge transfer properties, we find that the biaxial compression in films reduces charge transfer gap. We also resolve the orbital distribution of doped holes and electrons among the in-plane (Ni$-d_{x^2-y^2}$ and O$-p_x/p_y$) and the out-of-plane (Ni$-d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and O$-p_z$) orbitals, uncovering a pronounced particle-hole asymmetry. Theses findings lay a groundwork for the study of low-energy $t-J$ model of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films and provide key insights into the understanding of physical distinctions between the film and bulk bilayer nickelates.</description>

      <title>KPZ-like transport in long-range interacting spin chains proximate to integrability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Isotropic integrable spin chains such as the Heisenberg model feature superdiffusive spin transport belonging to an as-yet-unidentified dynamical universality class closely related to that of Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang (KPZ). To determine whether these results extend to more generic one-dimensional models, particularly those realizable in quantum simulators, we investigate spin and energy transport in non-integrable, long-range Heisenberg models using state-of-the-art tensor network methods. Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 &lt; \alpha &lt; \infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges. Finally, we consider anisotropic spin models naturally realized in Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules, demonstrating that a wide range of long-lived, non-diffusive transport can be observed in experimental settings.</description>

      <title>Quantum-classical correspondence for spins at finite temperatures with application to Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum-to-classical mapping for an arbitrary system of interacting spins at finite temperatures. We prove that, in the large-$S$ limit, the asymptotic form of the partition function coincides with that of a classical model for spins of length $S_C=\sqrt{S(S+1)}$. Quantum corrections to the leading term form a series in powers of $1/[S(S+1)]$. This representation provides a rigorous basis for classical modeling of realistic magnetic Hamiltonians. As an application, the classical Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compute transition temperatures for several topical materials with known interaction parameters, including MnF$_2$, MnTe, Rb$_2$MnF$_4$, MnPSe$_3$, FePS$_3$, FePSe$_3$, CoPS$_3$, CrSBr, and CrI$_3$. The resulting transition temperatures show good agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <title>$p$-wave magnet driven field-free Josephson diode effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions, has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically in models of bulk superconductors and Josephson junctions (JJs). In this work, we construct a Josephson junction using a recently discovered unconventional coplanar magnet, the $p$-wave magnet (PM), with proximity-induced superconductivity, and demonstrate the emergence of a Josephson diode effect (JDE). The barrier region is formed by another unconventional collinear magnet, namely an altermagnet (AM). We illustrate that apart from time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the mirror operation $M_{yz}$ emerges as the key symmetry constraint. Also, unlike earlier models that realize the JDE using unconventional magnets, this setup does not require Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or different superconductors across the junction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the realization of the JDE in this framework requires only minimal conditions while maintaining high performance. The effect remains robust across a broad parameter regime, and thus making the system particularly promising for applications in quantum circuits and computing technologies.</description>

      <title>1+1d SPT phases with fusion category symmetry: interface modes and non-abelian Thouless pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with finite non-invertible symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ in 1+1d. In particular, we investigate interfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix product states. After revealing how to extract the $\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant, we identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the interface of two $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation theory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode between different $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the bulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the classification of one-parameter families of $\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on the explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is identified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which is the pump of a local excitation within a $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by generalizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we conjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general gapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher dimensions.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06377v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. Finally, we develop quantum circuit realizations of our model paving the way towards the creation of exact Majorana strong zero modes with digital quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Resonating Valence Bond Ground States on Corner-sharing Simplices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10471v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has been known to have resonating valence bond (RVB) ground states on certain corner-sharing simplex lattices. Examples include both the quasi-1D sawtooth lattice with open boundary and a larger class of higher dimensional lattices without boundaries. The two types of results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. In the second class of lattices, the simplest simplex is a tetrahedron. We hereby generalize both results by studying the singly hole-doped system on the quasi-1D lattice of a tetrahedron chain, which can be considered a stripe of the pyrochlore or checkerboard lattices. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.</description>

      <title>Competing magnetic order in EuPd$_3$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26105v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single crystals of EuPd$_3$Si$_2$ were grown using a high-temperature EuPd-flux method. The material was structurally and chemically characterized by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, powder x-ray diffraction, Laue method and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The structural analysis confirmed the orthorhombic crystal structure (space group $Imma$) but revealed differences in the lattice parameters and bond distances in comparison to previous work by Sharma et al.. The composition is close to the ideal 1:3:2 stoichiometry with an occupation of 7 % of the Si sites by Pd. The heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility show two magnetic transitions indicating magnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N1}= 61\,\rm K$ and a spin reorientation at $T_{\rm N2}= 40\,\rm K$. The orthorhombic material shows magnetic anisotropy with field applied along the three main symmetry axes, which is summarized in the temperature-field phase diagrams. The susceptibility data hint to an alignment of the magnetic moments along $[100]$ between $T_{\rm N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$. Below $T_{\rm N2}$ the magnetic structure changes to an arrangement with moments canted away from $[100]$. In contrast to published work by Sharma et al., the single crystals investigated in this study are suggested to show AFM order below $T_{\rm N1}$ instead of ferromagnetism that sets in at higher $T_{\rm C1}=78\,\rm K$ which might originate from certain differences in the structure, composition or defects that have an impact on the dominant coupling constants of the RKKY interaction.</description>

      <title>Learning Degenerate Manifolds of Frustrated Magnets with Boltzmann Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.</description>

      <title>Primary charge-4e superconductivity from doping a featureless Mott insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05899v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Universal electrical transport of composite Fermi liquid to Metal transition in Moir\'e systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute universal electrical transport near continuous transitions between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a metallic phase in moire Chern bands, focusing on fillings $\nu=-1/2$ and $\nu=-3/4$. The critical theory represents a novel QED-Chern-Simons framework: a charged sector at a bosonic Laughlin-superfluid critical point is coupled, via emergent gauge fields and Chern-Simons mixing, to a neutral spinon Fermi surface. Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$. Gauge-mediated inelastic scattering removes the collisionless Drude singularity and produces a universal scaling function $\Sigma(\omega/T)$ and finite DC conductivities $\sigma(0) \approx 0.033 e^2/\hbar$ ($\nu=-1/2$) and $0.047 e^2/\hbar$ ($\nu=-3/4$). We also identify a Chern-Simons "filtering" mechanism that suppresses transmission of Landau damping from the spinon Fermi surface to the critical gauge mode. Our approach provides concrete transport diagnostics for detecting quantum criticality in moire superlattices.</description>

      <title>Electronic and structural properties of Rh- and Pd-based kagome layered shandites from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shandite structure hosts transition metal ions arranged in kagome layers. These layers are stacked rhombohedrally and are interspersed with post-transition metal ions and chalcogens. The electronic states near the Fermi level are dominated by the transition metal $d$-orbitals and feature saddle points near several of the high-symmetry positions of the Brillouin zone, most notably the F and L points. Combining symmetry considerations with ab initio methods, we study the electronic and structural properties of these materials with an emphasis on the connection between electronic saddle points at specific momenta and structural instabilities at these momenta. While the parent compounds studied are all found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions, we show that, in specific compounds, moving the saddle point closer to the Fermi level using either hydrostatic pressure or doping, can induce a structural instability. The importance of the electronic degrees of freedom in driving this instability is supported by the dependence of the frequency of the soft phonon mode on the electronic smearing temperature. Our first-principles calculations show that as the smearing temperature is increased, the compound becomes structurally stable again, indicating that the electron-phonon coupling is playing an important role. Our findings survey the structural properties of a large family of shandite materials and shed light on the role played by saddle points in the electronic structure in driving structural instabilities in rhombohedrally stacked kagome-layered materials.</description>

      <title>Kekul\'e Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06451v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekul\'e ordering in moir\'e graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekul\'e modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekul\'e PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.</description>

      <title>Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.14211v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We numerically map out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and {trimer} phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. Within the explored ranges of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths, the in-vacuum three-body states are always more deeply bound than the two-body ones. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper {trimer} phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.</description>

      <title>Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06256v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.</description>
