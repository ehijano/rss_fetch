      <title>A framework to identify supercritical and subcritical Turing bifurcations: Case study of a system sustaining cubic and quadratic autocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on an autocatalytic reaction-diffusion model and carry out multiple scale weakly nonlinear analysis. A cubic and a quadratic autocatalytic reaction system is analysed. We develop a framework to identify the critical surfaces in parameter space across which the nature of the Turing bifurcation changes from supercritical to subcritical. These are verified by direct numerical simulations of the system. Using weakly nonlinear analysis, we derive equations up to the fifth order that governs the amplitude of the spatial patterns. The limit point of the bifurcating solution is captured accurately by extending the analysis to the fifth order for the case of subcritical bifurcation. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with the predictions of the weakly nonlinear analysis for supercritical bifurcations. We show that when multiple steady states arise Turing patterns can coexist with another spatially uniform steady states. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be extended to get different patterns like squares and hexagons in a two-dimensional domain. We show that the shape of Turing patterns is influenced by the domain size. This shows that the geometry can influence the kind of patterns formed in natural systems. This study will aid the experimentalist identify operating conditions where Turing patterns can be obtained.</description>

      <title>Coupled Nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) Equations for two interacting electrostatic wavepackets in a non-Maxwellian fluid plasma model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonlinear dynamics of two co-propagating electrostatic wavepackets, characterized by different wavenumbers and amplitudes, in a 1D non-magnetized plasma fluid model is considered, from first principles. The original plasma model, consisting of \kappa-distributed electrons evolving against a cold ion background, is reduced, by means of a multiple-scale perturbation method to a pair of asymmetric coupled nonlinear Schr\"odinger (CNLS) equations for the dynamics of the wavepacket envelopes.
  Exact analytical expressions are derived for the dispersion, self-modulation, and cross-modulation coefficients involved in the CNLS equations, as functions of the wavenumbers and the spectral index \kappa characterizing the electron profile. An analytical investigation of the modulational instability (MI) properties of this pair of wavepackets reveals that MI occurs in most parts of the parameter space.
  The instability windows and the corresponding growth rate are calculated in a number of case studies. Two-wave interaction favors MI by extending its range of occurrence and by enhancing its growth rate. Growth rate patterns obtained for different \kappa suggest that deviation from Maxwellian equilibrium, for low \kappa values, leads to enhanced MI of the interacting wave pair.
  To the best of our knowledge, the dynamics of two co-propagating wavepackets in a plasma described by a fluid model with \kappa-distributed electrons is investigated thoroughly with respect to their MI properties as a function of \kappa for the first time, in the framework of an asymmetric CNLS system. Although we have focused on electrostatic wavepacket propagation in non-Maxwellian plasma, the results are generic and may be used as basis to model energy localization in nonlinear optics, in hydrodynamics or in dispersive media with Kerr-type nonlinearities where MI is relevant.</description>

      <title>Facet formation in slow three-dimensional fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cracks develop various surface patterns as they propagate in three-dimensional (3D) materials. Facet formation in nominally tensile (mode-I) fracture emerge in the slow, non-inertial regime and oftentimes takes the form of surface steps. We show that the same phase-field framework that recently shed basic light on dynamic (inertial) tensile fracture in 3D, also gives rise to crack surface steps. Step formation is shown to be an intrinsically nonlinear phenomenon that involves two essential physical ingredients: finite-strength quenched disorder and a small, mesoscopic anti-plane shear (mode-III) loading component (on top of the dominant tensile, mode-I loading component). We quantify the interplay between disorder (both its strength and spatial correlation length) and mesoscopic mode I+III mixity in controlling step formation. Finally, we show that surface steps grow out of the small-scale, background surface roughness and are composed of two overlapping crack segments connected by a bridging crack, in agreement with experiments.</description>

      <title>Bright traveling breathers in media with long-range, nonconvex dispersion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09001v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence and properties of envelope solitary waves on a periodic, traveling wave background, called traveling breathers, are investigated numerically in representative nonlocal dispersive media. Using a fixed point computational scheme, a space-time boundary value problem for bright traveling breather solutions is solved for the weakly nonlinear Benjamin-Bona-Mahony equation, a nonlocal, regularized shallow water wave model, and the strongly nonlinear conduit equation, a nonlocal model of viscous core-annular flows. Curves of unit-mean traveling breather solutions within a three-dimensional parameter space are obtained. Resonance due to nonconvex, rational linear dispersion leads to a nonzero oscillatory background upon which traveling breathers propagate. These solutions exhibit a topological phase jump, so act as defects within the periodic background. For small amplitudes, traveling breathers are well-approximated by bright soliton solutions of the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with a negligibly small periodic background. These solutions are numerically continued into the large amplitude regime as elevation defects on cnoidal or cnoidal-like periodic traveling wave backgrounds. This study of bright traveling breathers provides insight into systems with nonconvex, nonlocal dispersion that occur in a variety of media such as internal oceanic waves subject to rotation and short, intense optical pulses.</description>

      <title>Weakly nonlinear analysis of Turing pattern dynamics on curved surfaces</title>

Abstract: Pattern dynamics on curved surfaces are ubiquitous. Although the effect of surface topography on pattern dynamics has gained much interest, there is a limited understanding of the roles of surface geometry and topology in pattern dynamics. Recently, we reported that a static pattern on a flat plane can become a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. By examining reaction-diffusion equations on axisymmetric surfaces, certain conditions for the onset of pattern propagation were determined. However, this analysis was limited by the assumption that the pattern propagates at a constant speed. Here, we investigate the pattern propagation driven by surface curvature using weakly nonlinear analysis, which enables a more comprehensive approach to the aforementioned problem. The analysis reveals consistent conditions of the pattern propagation similar to our previous results, and further predicts that rich dynamics other than pattern propagation, such as periodic and chaotic behaviors, can arise depending on the surface geometry. This study provides a new perspective on the relationship between surfaces and pattern dynamics and a basis for controlling pattern dynamics on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of neural fields with exponential temporal kernel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.06324</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.06324v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the standard neural field equation with an exponential temporal kernel. We analyze the time-independent (static) and time-dependent (dynamic) bifurcations of the equilibrium solution and the emerging spatiotemporal wave patterns. We show that an exponential temporal kernel does not allow static bifurcations such as saddle-node, pitchfork, and in particular, static Turing bifurcations. However, the exponential temporal kernel possesses the important property that it takes into account the finite memory of past activities of neurons, which Green's function does not. Through a dynamic bifurcation analysis, we give explicit bifurcation conditions. Hopf bifurcations lead to temporally non-constant, but spatially constant solutions, but Turing-Hopf bifurcations generate spatially and temporally non-constant solutions, in particular, traveling waves. Bifurcation parameters are the coefficient of the exponential temporal kernel, the transmission speed of neural signals, the time delay rate of synapses, and the ratio of excitatory to inhibitory synaptic weights.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics driven by surface curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Patterns on curved surfaces are ubiquitous, yet the influence of surface geometry on pattern dynamics remains elusive. We recently reported a new mechanism of pattern propagation in which a static pattern on a flat plane becomes a propagating pattern on a curved surface [Nishide and Ishihara, Phys. Rev. Lett. 2022]. Here, we address whether surface curvature can drive more complex pattern dynamics beyond propagation. By employing a combination of weakly nonlinear analysis and numerical simulation, we show that oscillatory and chaotic pattern dynamics can emerge by controlling the surface shapes. These findings highlight a new role of surface topography in pattern formation and dynamics.</description>
