      <title>Generating functions for irreversible Hamiltonian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The definition of conservative-irreversible functions is extended to smooth manifolds. The local representation of these functions is studied and reveals that not each conservative-irreversible function is given by the weighted product of almost Poisson brackets. The biquadratic functions given by conservative-irreversible functions are studied and reveal a possibility for an algebraic framework on arbitrary and in particular complex algebras.</description>

      <title>SU(2)-equivariant quantum channels: semiclassical analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study completely positive and trace-preserving equivariant maps between operators on irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We find asymptotic approximations of channels in the limit of large output representation and we compute traces of functions of channel outputs. Our main tool is quantization using coherent states. We provide quantitative error bounds for various semiclassical formulas satisfied by quantizations of functions on the sphere.</description>

      <title>Differential geometry using quaternions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper establishes the basis of the quaternionic differential geometry ($\mathbbm H$DG) initiated in a previous article. The usual concepts of curves and surfaces are generalized to quaternionic constraints, as well as the curvature and torsion concepts, differential forms, directional derivatives and the structural equations. The analogy between the quaternionic and the real geometries is obtained using a matrix representation of quaternions. The results evidences the quaternionic formalism as a suitable language to differential geometry that can be useful in various directions of future investigation.</description>

      <title>The Emergence of the Normal Distribution in Deterministic Chaotic Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Central Limit Theorem states that, in the limit of a large number of terms, an appropriately scaled sum of independent random variables yields another random variable whose probability distribution tends to a stable distribution. The condition of independence, however, only holds in real systems as an approximation. To extend the theorem to more general situations, previous studies have derived a version of the Central Limit Theorem that also holds for variables that are not independent. Here, we present numerical results that characterize how convergence is attained when the variables being summed are deterministically related to one another by the recurrent application of an ergodic mapping. In all the explored cases, the convergence to the limit distribution is slower than for random sampling. Yet, the speed at which convergence is attained varies substantially from system to system, and these variations imply differences in the way information about the deterministic nature of the dynamics is progressively lost as the number of summands increases. Some of the identified factors in shaping the convergence process are the strength of mixing induced by the mapping and the shape of the marginal distribution of each variable, most particularly, the presence of divergences or fat tails.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Smooth modules for affine Kac-Moody algebras have a prime importance for the quantum field theory as they correspond to the representations of the universal affine vertex algebras. But, very little is known about such modules beyond the category of positive energy representations. We construct a new class of smooth modules over affine Kac-Moody algebras. In a particular case, these modules are isomorphic to those induced from generalized Whittaker modules for Takiff Lie algebras. We establish the irreducibility criterion for constructed modules in the case of the affine sl(2) Lie algebra.</description>

Abstract: We prove that Jacobi and CMV matrices associated to generic continuous sampling functions have all gaps predicted by the Gap Labelling Theorem open. We also give a mechanism for generic gap opening for quasi-periodic analytic sampling functions in the subcritical region following from the analyticity of resonance tongue boundaries for both Jacobi and CMV matrices.</description>

      <title>Balanced two-type annihilation: mean-field asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider an interacting particle system where equal-sized populations of two types of particles move by random walk steps on a graph, the two types may have different speeds, and meetings of opposite-type particles result in annihilation. The key quantity of interest is the expected extinction time. Even for the mean-field setting of complete graphs, the correct order of magnitude was not previously known. Under essentially optimal assumptions on the starting configuration, we determine not only the order of magnitude but also the asymptotics: the expected extinction time on $K_{2n}$ is $(2+o(1))n\log n$, independently of the relative speeds of the two types.</description>

      <title>Geodesics for mixed quantum states via their geometric mean operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the geodesic between two mixed states of arbitrary dimension by means of their geometric mean operator. We utilize the fiber bundle approach by which the distance between two mixed state density operators $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ in the base space $M$ is given by the shortest distance in the (Hilbert Schmidt) bundle space $E$ of their purifications. The latter is well-known to be given by the Bures distance along the horizontal lift in $E$ of the geodesic between the $\rho_1$ and $\rho_2$ in $M$. The horizontal lift is that unique curve in $E$ that orthogonally traverses the fibers $F\subset E$ above the curve in $M$, and projects down onto it. We briefly review this formalism and show how it can be used to construct the intermediate mixed quantum states $\rho(s)$ along the base space geodesic parameterized by affine parameter $s$ between the initial $\rho_1$ and final $\rho_2$ states. We emphasize the role played by geometric mean operator $M(s) = \rho_1^{-1/2}\, \sqrt{\rho_1^{1/2}\rho(s)\rho_1^{1/2}}\,\rho_1^{-1/2}$, where the Uhlmann root fidelity between $\rho_1$ and $\rho(s)$ is given by $\sqrt{F}(\rho_1,\rho(s)) = Tr[M(s)\,\rho_1] = Tr[\sqrt{\rho_1^{1/2}\rho(s)\rho_1^{1/2}}]$, and $\rho(s) = M(s)\,\rho_1\,M(s)$. We give examples for the geodesic between the maximally mixed state and a pure state in arbitrary dimensions, as well as for the geodesic between Werner states $\rho(p) = (1-p) I/N + p\,|\Psi\rangle\langle \Psi|$ with $|\Psi\rangle = \{|GHZ\rangle, |W\rangle\}$ in dimension $N=2^3$. For the latter, we compare expressions in the limit $p\to1$ to the infinite number of possible geodesics between the orthogonal pure states $|GHZ\rangle$ and $|W\rangle$. Lastly, we compute the analytic form for the density matrices along the geodesic that connects two arbitrary endpoint qubit density matrices within the Bloch ball for dimension $N=2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a general framework for multi-type interacting particle systems on graphs, where particles move one at a time by random walk steps, different types may have different speeds, and may interact, possibly randomly, when they meet. We study the equilibrium time of the process, by which we mean the number of steps taken until no further interactions can occur. Under a rather general framework, we obtain high probability upper and lower bounds on the equilibrium time that match up to a constant factor and are of order $n\log n$ if there are order $n$ vertices and particles. We also obtain similar results for the balanced two-type annihilation model of chemical reactions; here, the balanced case (equal density of types) does not fit into our general framework and makes the analysis considerably more difficult. Our models do not admit any exact solution as for integrable systems or the duality approach available for some other particle systems, so we develop a variety of combinatorial tools for comparing processes in the absence of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>Thermal Area Law in Long-Range Interacting Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The area law of the bipartite information measure characterizes one of the most fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics. In thermal equilibrium, the area law for the mutual information universally holds at arbitrary temperatures as long as the systems have short-range interactions. In systems with power-law decaying interactions, $r^{-\alpha}$ ($r$: distance), conditions for the thermal area law are elusive. In this work, we aim to clarify the optimal condition $\alpha&gt; \alpha_c$ such that the thermal area law universally holds. A standard approach to considering the conditions is to focus on the magnitude of the boundary interaction between two subsystems. However, we find here that the thermal area law is more robust than this conventional argument suggests. We show the optimal threshold for the thermal area law by $\alpha_c= (D+1)/2$ ($D$: the spatial dimension of the lattice), assuming a power-law decay of the clustering for the bipartite correlations. Remarkably, this condition encompasses even the thermodynamically unstable regimes $\alpha &lt; D$. We verify this condition numerically, finding that it is qualitatively accurate for both integrable and non-integrable systems. Unconditional proof of the thermal area law is possible by developing the power-law clustering theorem for $\alpha &gt; D$ above a threshold temperature. Furthermore, the numerical calculation for the logarithmic negativity shows that the same criterion $\alpha &gt; (D+1)/2$ applies to the thermal area law for quantum entanglement.</description>

      <title>Einstein-Yang-Mills wormholes haunted by a phantom field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study wormhole spacetimes in the framework of the static spherically symmetric SU(2) Einstein-Yang-Mills theory coupled to a phantom scalar field. We show rigorously the existence of an infinite sequence of symmetric wormhole solutions, labelled by the number of zeros of the Yang-Mills potential. These solutions have previously been discovered numerically. Mathematically, the problem resembles the pure Einstein-Yang-Mills system for black hole initial conditions, which was well-studied in the 90s. The main difference in the present work is that the coupling to the phantom field adds a non-trivial degree of complexity to the analysis. After proving the existence of the symmetric wormhole solutions, we also present numerical evidence for the existence of asymmetric ones.</description>

      <title>The $\chi^2$-divergence and Mixing times of quantum Markov processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1005.2358</link>
      <description>arXiv:1005.2358v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce quantum versions of the $\chi^2$-divergence, provide a detailed analysis of their properties, and apply them in the investigation of mixing times of quantum Markov processes. An approach similar to the one presented in [1-3] for classical Markov chains is taken to bound the trace-distance from the steady state of a quantum processes. A strict spectral bound to the convergence rate can be given for time-discrete as well as for time-continuous quantum Markov processes. Furthermore the contractive behavior of the $\chi^2$-divergence under the action of a completely positive map is investigated and contrasted to the contraction of the trace norm. In this context we analyse different versions of quantum detailed balance and, finally, give a geometric conductance bound to the convergence rate for unital quantum Markov processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06081v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on systems of nonlinear second-order stochastic differential equations with multi-scales. The motivation for our study stems from mathematical physics and statistical mechanics, for examples, Langevin dynamics and stochastic acceleration in a random environment. Our effort is to carry out asymptotic analysis to establish large deviations principles. Our focus is on obtaining the desired results for systems under weaker conditions. When the fast-varying process is a diffusion, neither Lipschitz continuity nor linear growth needs to be assumed. Our approach is based on combinations of the intuition from Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation, and the methods initiated in [34] relying on the concepts of relatively large deviations compactness and the identification of rate functions. When the fast-varying process is under a general setup with no specified structure, the paper establishes the large deviations principle of the underlying system under the assumption on the local large deviations principles of the corresponding first-order system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10105v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove new results on the validity of the limiting amplitude principle (LAP) for the wave equation with nonconstant coefficients, not necessarily in divergence form. Under suitable assumptions on the coefficients and on the source term, we establish the LAP for space dimensions 2 and 3. This result is extended to one space dimension with an appropriate modification. We also quantify the LAP and thus provide estimates for the convergence of the time-domain solution to the frequency-domain solution. Our proofs are based on time-decay results of solutions of some auxiliary problems. The obtained results are illustrated numerically on radially symmetric problems in dimensions 1, 2 and 3.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical approach to form factors in the sinh-Gordon model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11933v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Form factors in the sinh-Gordon model are studied semiclassically for small values of the parameter $b\sim\hbar^{1/2}$ in the background of a radial classical solution, which describes a heavy exponential operator placed at the origin. For this purpose we use a generalization of the radial quantization scheme, well known for a massless boson field. We introduce and study new special functions which generalize the Bessel functions and have a nice interpretation in the Tracy-Widom theory of the Fredholm determinant solutions of the classical sinh-Gordon model. Form factors of the exponential operators in the leading order are completely determined by the classical solutions, while form factors of the descendant operators contain quantum corrections even in this approximation. The construction of descendant operators in two chiralities requires renormalizations similar to those encountered in the conformal perturbation theory.</description>

Denoting by $E^*(p)$ the (appropriately normalized) maximal energy in the limit of a large number of qubits $n$, we show that $E^*(p)$ approaches $\sqrt{2\log 6}$ as $p$ increases. This value is interpreted as the maximal energy of a much simpler so-called Random Energy Model, widely studied in the setting of classical spin glasses.
  Our most notable and (arguably) surprising result proves the existence of near-maximal energy states which are product states, and thus not entangled. Specifically, we prove that with high probability as $n\to\infty$, for any $E&lt;E^*(p)$ there exists a product state with energy $\geq E$ at sufficiently large constant $p$. Even more surprisingly, this remains true even when restricting to tensor products of Pauli eigenstates. Our approximations go beyond what is known from monogamy-of-entanglement style arguments -- the best of which, in this normalization, achieve approximation error growing with $n$. Our results not only challenge prevailing beliefs in physics that extremely low-temperature states of random local Hamiltonians should exhibit non-negligible entanglement, but they also imply that classical algorithms can be just as effective as quantum algorithms in optimizing Hamiltonians with large locality -- though performing such optimization is still likely a hard problem.
  Our results are robust with respect to the choice of the randomness (disorder) and apply to the case of sparse random Hamiltonian using Lindeberg's interpolation method. The proof of the main result is obtained by estimating the expected trace of the associated partition function, and then matching its asymptotics with the extremal energy of product states using the second moment method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article focuses on three main contributions. Firstly, we provide an in-depth overview of the nonlocal Lagrangian formalism. Secondly, we introduce an extended version of the second Noether's theorem tailored for nonlocal Lagrangians. Finally, we apply both the formalism and the extended theorem to the context of non-commutative U(1) gauge theory, including its Hamiltonian and quantization, showcasing their practical utility.</description>
