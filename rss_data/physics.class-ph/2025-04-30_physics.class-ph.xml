      <title>Acceleration of Convergence of Double Series for the Green's Function of the Helmholtz Equation in Polar Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-known expressions for the Green's functions for the Helmholtz equation in polar coordinates with Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions are transformed. The slowly converging double series describing these Green's functions are reduced by means of successive subtraction of several auxiliary functions to series that converge much more rapidly. A method is given for constructing the auxiliary functions (the first one is identical with the Green's function of the Laplace equation) in the form of single series and in the form of closed expressions. Formulas are presented for summing series of the Fourier-Bessel and Dini type; they are required to implement the two steps of the procedure for accelerating convergence. The effectiveness of the functions constructed is illustrated by the numerical solution of the problem of the dispersion properties of a slotted line with a coaxial circular cylindrical screen.</description>

      <title>Research on Non-Contact Resistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigated the phenomenon of non-contact resistance by inserting a non-magnetic metal rod into an induction coil to explore the response changes of an LRC circuit. We focused on analyzing the changes in inductance when non-ferromagnetic materials (such as H59 brass) were inserted into the coil and verified the impact of the copper rod on inductance through theoretical derivation and experimental validation. Based on Maxwell's equations, the magnetic field distribution within the copper rod was thoroughly derived, and the inductance and resistance values were experimentally measured. These results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Anti-localization of non-stationary quasi-waves in a $\beta$-FPUT chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a new general wave phenomenon, namely "the anti-localization of non-stationary linear waves", has been introduced and discussed. This is zeroing of the propagating component for a non-stationary wave-field near a defect in infinitely long wave-guides. The phenomenon is known to be observed in both continuum and discrete mechanical systems with a defect, provided that the frequency spectrum for the corresponding homogeneous system possesses a stop-band. In this paper, we show that the anti-localization is also quite common for nonlinear systems. To demonstrate this, we numerically solve several non-stationary problems for an infinite $\beta$-FPUT chain with a defect.</description>

      <title>The effect of finite duration sources on modes and generalization of the d'Alembert solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20302v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of dispersive waves governed by linear wave equations, where a finite duration source is applied. The resulting wave may be viewed as the superposition of modes before the source is turned on and after it is turned off. We consider the problem of relating the modes after the source term is turned off to the modes before the source term was turned on. We obtain explicit formulas in both the wavenumber and position representations. A number of special cases are considered. Using the methods presented, we obtain a generalization of the d'Alembert solution which applies to linear wave equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Cauchy Elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17090v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most theories and applications of elasticity rely on an energy function that depends on the strains from which the stresses can be derived. This is the traditional setting of Green elasticity, also known as hyper-elasticity. However, in its original form the theory of elasticity does not assume the existence of a strain-energy function. In this case, called Cauchy elasticity, stresses are directly related to the strains. Since the emergence of modern elasticity in the 1940s, research on Cauchy elasticity has been relatively limited. One possible reason is that for Cauchy materials, the net work performed by stress along a closed path in the strain space may be nonzero. Therefore, such materials may require access to both energy sources and sinks. This characteristic has led some mechanicians to question the viability of Cauchy elasticity as a physically plausible theory of elasticity. In this paper, motivated by its relevance to recent applications, such as the modeling of active solids, we revisit Cauchy elasticity in a modern form.</description>

      <title>Experimental Measurement of Non-Hermitian Left Eigenvectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The duality of left and right eigenvectors underpins the comprehensive understanding of many physical phenomena. In Hermitian systems, left and right eigenvectors are simply Hermitian-conjugate pairs. Non-Hermitian eigenstates in contrast, have left and right eigenvectors that are distinct from each other. However, despite the tremendous interest in non-Hermitian physics in recent years, the roles of non-Hermitian left eigenvectors (LEVs) are still inadequately explored-their physical consequences and observable effects remain elusive, so much so that LEVs seem largely like an object of primarily mathematical purpose. In this study, we present a method based on the non-Hermitian Green's function for directly retrieving both LEVs and REVs from experimentally measured steady-state responses. We validate the effectiveness of this approach in two separate acoustic experiments: one characterizes the non-Hermitian Berry phase, and the other measures extended topological modes. Our results not only unambiguously demonstrate observable effects related to non-Hermitian LEVs, but also highlight the under-appreciated role of LEVs in non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>
