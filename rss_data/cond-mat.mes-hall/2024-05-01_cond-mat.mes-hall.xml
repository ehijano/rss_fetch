      <title>Chirality-induced spin selectivity by variable-range hopping along DNA double helix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here present a variable-range hopping model to describe the chirality-induced spin selectivity along the DNA double helix. In this model, DNA is considered as a one-dimensional disordered system, where electrons are transported by chiral phonon-assisted hopping between localized states. Owing to the coupling between the electron spin and the vorticity of chiral phonons, electric toroidal monopole appears in the charge-to-spin conductances as a manifestation of true chirality. Our model quantitatively explains the temperature dependence of the spin polarization observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Chaos-Assisted Dynamical Tunneling in Flat Band Superwires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical investigations have revealed unconventional transport mechanisms within high Brilliouin zones of two-dimensional superlattices. Electrons can navigate along channels we call superwires, gently guided without brute force confinement. Such dynamical confinement is caused by weak superlattice deflections, markedly different from the static or energetic confinement observed in traditional wave guides or one-dimensional electron wires. The quantum properties of superwires give rise to elastic dynamical tunneling, linking disjoint regions of the corresponding classical phase space, and enabling the emergence of several parallel channels. This paper provides the underlying theory and mechanisms that facilitate dynamical tunneling assisted by chaos in periodic lattices. Moreover, we show that the mechanism of dynamical tunneling can be effectively conceptualized through the lens of a paraxial approximation. Our results further reveal that superwires predominantly exist within flat bands, emerging from eigenstates that represent linear combinations of conventional degenerate Bloch states. Finally, we quantify tunneling rates across various lattice configurations, and demonstrate the tunneling can be suppressed in a controlled fashion, illustrating potential implications in future nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Bilayer graphene in periodic and quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Starting from the effective Hamiltonian arising from the tight binding model, we study the behaviour of low-lying excitations for bilayer graphene placed in periodic external magnetic fields by using irreducible second order supersymmetry transformations. The coupled system of equations describing these excitations is reduced to a pair of periodic Schr\"odinger Hamiltonians intertwined by a second order differential operator. The direct implementation of more general second-order supersymmetry transformations allows to create nonsingular Schr\"odinger potentials with periodicity defects and bound states embedded in the forbidden bands, which turn out to be associated to quasiperiodic magnetic superlattices.</description>

      <title>Chiral magnon in ferromagnetic chiral crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically propose chiral magnon in ferromagnetic chiral crystals. We show that the crystal chirality is imprinted in orbital angular momentum of magnons which exhibits the opposite signs for opposite chiralities of the crystal. We also show that a finite magnon orbital angular momentum can be induced by a temperature gradient which is a magnonic analogue of the Edelstein effect.</description>

      <title>Length and torsion dependence of thermal conductivity in twisted graphene nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on the physical properties of materials at the nanoscale is crucial for the development of breakthrough nanotechnologies. One of the key properties to consider is the ability to conduct heat, i.e., its thermal conductivity. Graphene is a remarkable nanostructure with exceptional physical properties, including one of the highest thermal conductivities (TC) ever measured. Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) share most fundamental properties with graphene, with the added benefit of having a controllable electronic bandgap. One method to achieve such control is by twisting the GNR, which can tailor its electronic properties, as well as change their TC. Here, we revisit the dependence of the TC of twisted GNRs (TGNRs) on the number of applied turns to the GNR by calculating more precise and mathematically well defined geometric parameters related to the TGNR shape, namely, its twist and writhe. We show that the dependence of the TC on twist is not a simple function of the number of turns initially applied to a straight GNR. In fact, we show that the TC of TGNRs requires at least two parameters to be properly described. Our conclusions are supported by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the TC of suspended TGNRs prepared under different values of initially applied turns and different sizes of their suspended part. Among possible choices of parameter pairs, we show that TC can be appropriately described by the initial number of turns and the initial twist density of the TGNRs.</description>

      <title>Connecting physics to systems with modular spin-circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An emerging paradigm in modern electronics is that of CMOS + $\sf X$ requiring the integration of standard CMOS technology with novel materials and technologies denoted by $\sf X$. In this context, a crucial challenge is to develop accurate circuit models for $\sf X$ that are compatible with standard models for CMOS-based circuits and systems. In this perspective we present physics-based, experimentally benchmarked modular circuit models that can be used to evaluate a class of CMOS + $\sf X$ systems, where $\sf X$ denotes magnetic and spintronic materials and phenomena. This class of materials is particularly challenging because they go beyond conventional charge-based phenomena and involve the spin degree of freedom which involves non-trivial quantum effects. Starting from density matrices $-$ the central quantity in quantum transport $-$ using well-defined approximations, it is possible to obtain spin-circuits that generalize ordinary circuit theory to 4-component currents and voltages (1 for charge and 3 for spin). With step-by-step examples that progressively go higher in the computing stack, we illustrate how the spin-circuit approach can be used to start from the physics of magnetism and spintronics to enable accurate system-level evaluations. We believe the core approach can be extended to include other quantum degrees of freedom like valley and pseudospins starting from corresponding density matrices.</description>

      <title>Toroidic phase transitions in a direct-kagome artificial spin ice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferrotoroidicity, the fourth form of primary ferroic order, breaks both space and time inversion symmetry. So far, direct observation of ferrotoroidicity in natural materials remains elusive, which impedes the exploration of ferrotoroidic phase transitions. Here, we overcome the limitations of natural materials using an artificial nanomagnet system that can be characterized at the constituent level and at different effective temperatures. We design a nanomagnet array as to realize a direct-kagome spin ice. This artificial spin ice exhibits robust toroidal moments and a quasi-degenerate ground state with two distinct low-temperature toroidal phases: ferrotoroidicity and paratoroidicity. Using magnetic force microscopy and Monte Carlo simulation, we demonstrate a phase transition between ferrotoroidicity and paratoroidicity, along with a crossover to a non-toroidal paramagnetic phase. Our quasi-degenerate artificial spin ice in a direct-kagome structure provides a model system for the investigation of magnetic states and phase transitions that are inaccessible in natural materials.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic negative magnetoresistance from the chiral anomaly of multifold fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The chiral anomaly, a hallmark of chiral spin-1/2 Weyl fermions, is an imbalance between left- and right-moving particles that underpins both high and low energy phenomena, including particle decay and negative longitudinal magnetoresistance in Weyl semimetals. The discovery that chiral crystals can host higher-spin generalizations of Weyl quasiparticles without high-energy counterparts, known as multifold fermions, raises the fundamental question of whether the chiral anomaly is a more general phenomenon. Answering this question requires materials with chiral quasiparticles within a sizable energy window around the Fermi level, that are unaffected by trivial extrinsic effects such as current jetting. Here we report the chiral anomaly of multifold fermions in CoSi, which features multifold bands within about 0.85 eV around the Fermi level. By excluding current jetting through the squeezing test, we measure an intrinsic, longitudinal negative magnetoresistance. We develop the semiclassical theory of magnetotransport of multifold fermions that shows that the negative magnetoresistance originates in their chiral anomaly, despite a sizable and detrimental orbital magnetic moment contribution, previously unaccounted for. A concomitant nonlinear Hall effect supports the multifold-fermion origin of magnetotransport. Our work confirms the chiral anomaly of higher-spin generalizations of Weyl fermions, currently inaccessible outside the solid-state.</description>

      <title>Novel Topological Insulators with Hybrid-order Boundary States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of several classes of novel topological insulators (TIs) with hybrid-order boundary states generated from the first-order TIs with additional crystalline symmetries. Unlike the current studies on hybrid-order TIs where different-order topology arises from merging different-order TIs in various energy, these novel TIs exhibit a remarkable coexsitence of first-order gapless modes and higher-order Fermi-arc states, behaving as a hybrid between the first-order TIs and higher-order topological semimetals within a single bulk gap. Our findings establish a profound connection between these novel $d$-dimensional ($d$D) TIs and ($d-1$)D higher-order TIs (HOTIs), which can be understood as a result of stacking $(d-1)$D HOTIs to $d$D with $d=3,4$, revealing unconventional topological phase transitions by closing the gap in certain first-order boundaries rather than the bulk. The bulk-boundary correspondence between these higher-order Fermi-arcs and bulk topological invariants acossiated with additional crystallline symmetries is also demonstrated. We then discuss the conventional topological phase transitions from these novel TIs to nodal-line/nodal-surface semimetal phases, where the gapless phases host new kinds of topological responses. Meawhile, we present the corresponding topological semimetal phases by stacking these unique TIs. Finally, we discuss potential ways to realize these novel phases in synthetic and real materials, with a particular focus on the feasible implementation in optical lattices using ultracold atoms.</description>

      <title>Thermal conductivity reduction due to phonon geometrical scattering in nano-engineered epitaxial germanium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nano-engineering crystalline materials can be used to tailor their thermal properties. By adding new nanoscale phonon scattering centers and controlling their size, one can effectively decrease the phonon mean free path and hence the thermal conductivity of a fully crystalline material. In this letter, we use the 3$\omega$ method in the temperature range of 100-300 K to experimentally report on the more than threefold reduction of the thermal conductivity of an epitaxially-grown crystalline germanium thin film with embedded polydispersed crystalline \ch{Ge3Mn5} nano-inclusions with diameters ranging from 5 to 25~nm. A detailed analysis of the structure of the thin film coupled with Monte Carlo simulations of phonon transport highlight the role of the nano-inclusions volume fraction in the reduction of the phononic contribution to the thermal conductivity, in particular its temperature dependence, leading to a phonon mean free path that is set by geometrical constraints.</description>

      <title>Topology in a Su--Schrieffer--Heeger plasmonic crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the topology of the bands of a polaritonic crystal composed of graphene and of a metallic grating. We first derive a Kronig--Penney type of equation for the polaritonic bands as function of the Bloch wavevector and discuss the propagation of the surface plasmon polaritons on the polaritonic crystal using a transfer-matrix approach. Secondly, we reformulate the problem as a tight-binding model that resembles the Su--Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hamiltonian, one difference being that the hopping amplitudes are, in this case, energy dependent. In possession of the tight-binding equations it is a simple task to determine the topology of the bands. Similarly to the SSH model, we show that there is a tunable parameter that induces topological phase transitions from trivial to non-trivial. In our case, it is the distance $d$ between the graphene sheet and the metallic grating. We note that $d$ is a parameter that can be easily tuned experimentally simply by controlling the thickness of the spacer between the grating and the graphene sheet. It is then experimentally feasible to engineer devices with the required topological properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct, ultrafast excitation of polar phonons with electromagnetic radiation is a potent strategy for controlling the properties of a wide range of materials, particularly in the context of influencing their magnetic behavior. Here, we show that, contrary to common perception, the origin of phonon-induced magnetic activity does not stem from the motion of ions themselves; instead, it arises from the effect their motion exerts on the electron subsystem. Through the mechanism of electron-phonon coupling, a coherent state of circularly polarized phonons generates substantial non-Maxwellian fields that disrupt time reversal symmetry, effectively emulating the behavior of authentic magnetic fields. Notably, the effective field can reach magnitudes as high as 100 T, surpassing by several orders of magnitude the Maxwellian field resulting from the circular motion of the ions. Because the light-induced non-reciprocal fields depend on the square of the phonon displacements, the chirality the photons transferred to the ions plays no role in magnetophononics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Utilizing a series of Bott indices formulated through polynomials of position operators, we establish a comprehensive framework for characterizing topological zero-energy corner states in systems with chiral symmetry. Our framework covers systems with arbitrary shape, including topological phases that are not characterizable by previously proposed invariants such as multipole moments or multipole chiral numbers. A key feature of our framework is its ability to capture the real-space pattern of zero-energy corner states. We provide a rigorous analytical proof of its higher-order correspondence. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our theory, we examine several model systems with representative patterns of zero-energy corner states that previous frameworks fail to classify.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum control techniques play an important role in manipulating and harnessing the properties of different quantum systems, including isolated atoms. Here, we propose to achieve quantum control over a single on-surface atomic spin using Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry implemented with Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM). Specifically, we model how the application of time-dependent, non-resonant AC electric fields across the STM tip-surface gap makes it possible to achieve precise quantum state manipulation in an isolated Fe atom on a MgO/Ag(100) surface. We propose a protocol to combine Landau Zener tunneling with LZSM interferometry that permits one to measure the quantum spin tunneling of an individual Fe atom. The proposed experiments can be implemented with ESR-STM instrumentation, opening a new venue in the research of on-surface single spin control.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnets are materials which possess unique helical arrangements of magnetic moments, which give rise to nonreciprocal transport and fascinating physics phenomena. On the one hand, their exploration is guided by the prospects of unconventional signal processing, computation schemes and magnetic memory. On the other hand, progress in applications is hindered by the challenging materials synthesis, limited scalability and typically low critical temperature. Here, we report the creation and exploration of artificial chiral magnets (ACMs) at room temperature. By employing a mass production compatible deposition technology, we synthesize ACMs, which consist of helical Ni surfaces on central cylinders. Using optical microscopy, we reveal nonreciprocal magnon transport at GHz frequencies. It is controlled by programmable toroidal moments which result from the ACM's geometrical handedness and field-dependent spin chirality. We present materials-by-design rules which optimize the helically curved ferromagnets for 3D nonreciprocal transport at room temperature and zero magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Origin of Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Trilayer Graphene: Quasiparticle Pairing within the Inter-Valley Coherent Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) is observed in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) with an extremely low charge carrier densities, between the normal metal state and a probable inter-valley coherent (IVC) state. The measured coherence length in RTG is roughly two orders of magnitude shorter than the value predicted by a conventional BCS theory. To resolve these discrepancies, we propose that the RTG SC phase arises from the pairing of quasiparticles within the IVC phase. We illustrate the SC behavior using gapped Dirac cones with the chemical potential close to the conduction band's bottom and establish the Ginzburg-Landau theory. Our findings indicate that the mean-field transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{MF}$, is primarily determined by the density of states of quasiparticles within the IVC phase, and is more suppressed in comparison with the BCS relation. Interestingly, we discover that the coherence length behaves according to $\xi\sim 1/\sqrt{T_\mathrm{MF}}$. When the chemical potential lies within the band gap, the conventional coherence length becomes small, while the quantum metric contribution can diverge. Applying our approach to a microscopic model for RTG, our predictions align well with experimental data and effectively capture key measurable features of quantities such as the mean-field transition temperature $T_\mathrm{MF}$ and the coherence length $\xi$. Furthermore, we reveal that the quantum metric contribution, stemming from the multi-band properties of the IVC quasiparticles, plays a significant role in determining the coherence length around the transition regime from superconductivity to IVC. Lastly, experimental predictions are discussed on bebaviors of the upper critical field and coherence length at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A remarkable feature of topological superconductors is the emergence of Majorana fermions in electron systems. Whereas the emergent Majorana fermions share the self-anti-particle property with Majorana fermions in particle physics, they may have essentially different electromagnetic properties. In this paper, we argue the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors. We present a general theory of the electromagnetic response of spinful Majorana fermions in topological superconductors and clarify how the pairing symmetry is encoded in the electromagnetic response. As an application, we predict the sublattice-dependent dipole (Ising)-type magnetic response of corner Majorana fermions in iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>High-precision chemical quantum sensing in flowing monodisperse microdroplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on a novel flow-based method for high-precision chemical detection that integrates quantum sensing with droplet microfluidics. We deploy nanodiamond particles hosting fluorescent nitrogen vacancy defects as quantum sensors in flowing, monodisperse, picoliter-volume microdroplets containing analyte molecules. ND motion within these microcompartments facilitates close sensor-analyte interaction and mitigates particle heterogeneity. Microdroplet flow rates are rapid (upto 4cm/s) and with minimal drift. Pairing this controlled flow with microwave control of NV electronic spins, we introduce a new noise-suppressed mode of Optically Detected Magnetic Resonance that is sensitive to chemical analytes while resilient against experimental variations, achieving detection of analyte-induced signals at an unprecedented level of a few hundredths of a percent of the ND fluorescence. We demonstrate its application to detecting paramagnetic ions in droplets with simultaneously low limit-of-detection and low analyte volumes, in a manner significantly better than existing technologies. This is combined with exceptional measurement stability over &gt;103s and across hundreds of thousands of droplets, while utilizing minimal sensor volumes and incurring low ND costs (&lt;$0.70 for an hour of operation). Additionally, we demonstrate using these droplets as micro-confinement chambers by co-encapsulating ND quantum sensors with analytes, including single cells. This versatility suggests wide-ranging applications, like single-cell metabolomics and real-time intracellular measurements in bioreactors. Our work paves the way for portable, high-sensitivity, amplification-free, chemical assays with high throughput; introduces a new chemical imaging tool for probing chemical reactions in microenvironments; and establishes the foundation for developing movable, arrayed quantum sensors through droplet microfluidics.</description>

      <title>Electronic decoupling and hole-doping of graphene nanoribbons on metal substrates by chloride intercalation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19389v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) have a wide range of electronic properties that depend sensitively on their chemical structure. Several types of GNRs have been synthesized on metal surfaces through selective surface-catalyzed reactions. The resulting GNRs are adsorbed on the metal surface, which may lead to hybridization between the GNR orbitals and those of the substrate. This makes investigation of the intrinsic electronic properties of GNRs more difficult, and also rules out capacitive gating. Here we demonstrate the formation of a dielectric gold chloride adlayer that can intercalate underneath GNRs on the Au(111) surface. The intercalated gold chloride adlayer electronically decouples the GNRs from the metal and leads to a substantial hole doping of the GNRs. Our results introduce an easily accessible tool in the in situ characterization of GNRs grown on Au(111) that allows for exploration of their electronic properties in a heavily hole-doped regime.</description>

      <title>Composite antiferromagnetic and orbital order with altermagnetic properties at a cuprate/manganite interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures from complex oxides allow one to combine various electronic and magnetic orders as to induce new quantum states. A prominent example is the coupling between superconducting and magnetic orders in multilayers from high-Tc cuprates and manganites. A key role is played here by the interfacial CuO2 layer whose distinct properties remain to be fully understood. Here, we study with resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) the magnon excitations of this interfacial CuO2 layer. In particular, we show that the underlying antiferromagnetic exchange interaction at the interface is strongly suppressed to J ~ 70 meV, as compared to J ~ 130 meV for the CuO2 layers away from the interface. Moreover, we observe an anomalous momentum dependence of the intensity of the interfacial magnon mode and show that it suggests that the antiferromagnetic order is accompanied by a particular kind of orbital order that yields a so-called altermagnetic state. Such a two-dimensional altermagnet has recently been predicted to enable new spintronic applications and superconducting proximity effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss thermalization in a multimode quantum cavity under unitary evolution. According to general principles, an isolated system with quadratic couplings does not exhibit thermalization. However, we find that three-wave perturbation, typical for instance in superconducting Josephson systems, may lead to thermalization into a Bose-Einstein distribution of occupations of the modes. The temperature of this state is dictated by energy conservation in this closed system, and the thermal distribution is robust against weak disturbances. We discuss how our findings open up new avenues to experimentally probe fundamental assumptions of statistical physics in solid-state systems.</description>

      <title>Self-assembling of multilayered polymorphs with ion beams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymorphism contributes to the diversity of nature, so that even materials having identical chemical compositions exhibit variations in properties because of different lattice symmetries. Thus, if stacked together into multilayers, polymorphs may work as an alternative approach to the sequential deposition of layers with different chemical compositions. However, selective polymorph crystallization during conventional thin film synthesis is not trivial; e.g. opting for step-like changes of temperature and/or pressure correlated with switching from one polymorph to another during synthesis is tricky, since it may cause degradation of the structural quality. In the present work, applying the disorder-induced ordering approach we fabricated such multilayered polymorph structures using ion beams. We show that during ion irradiation of gallium oxide, the dynamic annealing of disorder may be tuned towards self-assembling of several polymorph interfaces, consistently with theoretical modelling. Specifically, we demonstrated multilayers with two polymorph interface repetitions obtained in one ion beam assisted fabrication step. Importantly, single crystal structure of the polymorphs was maintained in between interfaces exhibiting repeatable crystallographic relationships, correlating with optical cross-sectional maps. This data paves the way for enhancing functionalities in materials with not previously thought capabilities of ion beam technology.</description>

      <title>Electronic structure of the surface superconducting Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trigonal PtBi$_2$ is a layered semimetal without inversion symmetry, featuring 12 Weyl points in the vicinity of the Fermi energy. Its topological Fermi arcs were recently shown to superconduct at low temperatures where bulk superconductivity is absent. Here, we perform first-principles calculations to investigate in detail the bulk and surface electronic structure of PtBi$_2$, and obtain the spin texture as well as the momentum-dependent localization of the arcs. Motivated by the experimentally observed recovery of inversion symmetry under pressure or upon doping, we interpolate between the two structures and determine the energy and momentum dependence of the Weyl nodes. For deeper insights into the surface superconductivity of PtBi$_2$, we construct a symmetry-adapted effective four-band model that accurately reproduces the Weyl points of PtBi$_2$. We supplement this model with an analysis of the symmetry-allowed pairings between the Fermi arcs, which naturally mix spin-singlet and spin-triplet channels. Moreover, the presence of surface-only superconductivity facilitates an intrinsic superconductor-semimetal-superconductor Josephson junction, with the semimetallic phase sandwiched between the two superconducting surfaces. For a phase difference of $\pi$, zero-energy Andreev bound states develop between the two terminations.</description>

      <title>Tuning the coherent interaction of an electron qubit and a nuclear magnon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19679v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central spin qubit interacting coherently with an ensemble of proximal spins can be used to engineer entangled collective states or a multi-qubit register. Making full use of this many-body platform requires tuning the interaction between the central spin and its spin register. GaAs quantum dots offer a model realization of the central spin system where an electron qubit interacts with multiple ensembles of $\sim 10^{4}$ nuclear spins. In this work, we demonstrate tuning of the interaction between the electron qubit and the nuclear many-body system in a GaAs quantum dot. The homogeneity of the GaAs system allows us to perform high-precision and isotopically selective nuclear sideband spectroscopy, which reveals the single-nucleus electronic Knight field. Together with time-resolved spectroscopy of the nuclear field, this fully characterizes the electron-nuclear interaction for a priori control. An algorithmic feedback sequence selects the nuclear polarization precisely, which adjusts the electron-nuclear exchange interaction in situ via the electronic g-factor anisotropy. This allows us to tune directly the activation rate of a collective nuclear excitation (magnon) and the coherence time of the electron qubit. Our method is applicable to similar central-spin systems and enables the programmable tuning of coherent interactions in the many-body regime.</description>

Abstract: Quantum networks require quantum nodes with coherent optical interfaces and multiple stationary qubits. In terms of optical properties, semiconductor quantum dots are highly compelling, but their adoption as quantum nodes has been impaired by the lack of auxiliary qubits. Here, we demonstrate a functional quantum register in a semiconductor quantum dot leveraging the dense, always-present nuclear spin ensemble. We prepare 13,000 host nuclear spins into a single many-body dark state to operate as the register logic state $|0\rangle$. The logic state $|1\rangle$ is defined as a single nuclear magnon excitation, enabling controlled quantum-state transfer between the electron spin qubit and the nuclear magnonic register. Using 130-ns SWAP gates, we implement a full write-store-retrieve-readout protocol with 68.6(4)% raw overall fidelity and a storage time of 130(16) $\mu$s in the absence of dynamical decoupling. Our work establishes how many-body physics can add step-change functionality to quantum devices, in this case transforming quantum dots into multi-qubit quantum nodes with deterministic registers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03957v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find that, in the mesoscopic regime, modification of the material's surface can induce an extensive change of the material's magnetic moment. In other words, perturbation of order $N^2$ atoms on the surface of a 3-dimensional solid can change the magnetic moment proportionally to $N^3$. When the solid's surface is perturbed, it triggers two changes in the magnetization. One arises from variations of the electron wavefunction and energy, while the other arises from a modification in the kinetic angular momentum operator. In the macroscopic regime of our model, these two bulk effects cancel each other, resulting in no impact of the surface perturbation on the magnetization - consistent with prior work. In the mesoscopic regime, we find a departure from this behavior, as the cancelation of two terms is not complete.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junction arrays are a promising platform for analog quantum simulations. Their controllable and non-sinusoidal energy/phase relation opens the path to implement nontrivial interactions and study the emergence of exotic quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose the analysis of an array of hybrid Josephson junctions defining a 2-leg ladder geometry for the quantum simulation of the tricritical Ising phase transition. This transition provides the paradigmatic example of minimal conformal models beyond Ising criticality and its excitations are intimately related with Fibonacci non-Abelian anyons and topological order in two dimensions. We study this superconducting system and its thermodynamic phases based on bosonization and matrix-product-states techniques. Its effective continuous description in terms of a three-frequency sine-Gordon quantum field theory suggests the presence of the targeted tricritical point and the numerical simulations confirm this picture. Our results indicate which experimental observables can be adopted in realistic devices to probe the physics and the phase transitions of the model. Additionally, our proposal provides a useful one-dimensional building block to design exotic topological order in two-dimensional scalable Josephson junction arrays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In cosmology, the axion is a hypothetical particle that is currently considered as candidate for dark matter. In condensed matter, a counterpart of the axion (the "axion quasiparticle") has been predicted to emerge in magnetoelectric insulators with fluctuating magnetic order and in charge-ordered Weyl semimetals. To date, both the cosmological and condensed-matter axions remain experimentally elusive or unconfirmed. Here, we show theoretically that ordinary lattice vibrations can form an axion quasiparticle in Dirac insulators with broken time- and space-inversion symmetries, even in the absence of magnetic fluctuations. The physical manifestation of the phononic axion is a magnetic-field-induced phonon effective charge, which can be probed in optical spectroscopy. By replacing magnetic fluctuations with lattice vibrations, our theory widens the scope for the observability of the axion quasiparticle in condensed matter.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the study of topologically non-trivial structures in one-dimensional models has been dominated by the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger model due to its simplicity in design and its ability to support edge states with robustness to disorder in couplings, protected by chiral and inversion symmetry. Here, we present a novel study on a zigzag quasi-one-dimensional model, which supports topologically protected edge states without relying on conventional symmetries. Our model utilises next-neighbour couplings to mediate edge states and is simultaneously resilient to dissipation, couplings and on-site energy disorders. In order to understand the topological properties of this model, we introduce a novel way to demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence of the edge states and construct a topological invariant that returns quantized values. Our study sheds light on the possibility of constructing topological phases in new ways, even in the absence of conventional symmetries, and opens up new avenues for research in this field. In addition, we demonstrate a possible photonic realization of these models with the help of an orbital-induced synthetic flux.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07533v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the twist angle on the proximity spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in graphene/NbSe$_2$ heterostructures from first principles. The low-energy Dirac bands of several different commensurate twisted supercells are fitted to a model Hamiltonian, allowing us to study the twist-angle dependency of the SOC in detail. We predict that the magnitude of the Rashba SOC can triple, when going from $\Theta=0^\circ$ to $\Theta=30^\circ$ twist angle. Furthermore, at a twist angle of $\Theta\approx23^\circ$ the in-plane spin texture acquires a large radial component, corresponding to a Rashba angle of up to $\Phi=25^\circ$. The twist-angle dependence of the extracted proximity SOC is explained by analyzing the orbital decomposition of the Dirac states to reveal with which NbSe$_2$ bands they hybridize strongest. Finally, we employ a Kubo formula to evaluate the efficiency of conventional and unconventional charge-to-spin conversion in the studied heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Experimental set-up for thermal measurements at the nanoscale using an SThM probe with niobium nitride thermometer</title>

Abstract: Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) has become an important measurement tool for characterizing the thermal properties of materials at the nanometer scale. This technique requires a SThM probe that combines an Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) probe and a very sensitive resistive thermometry; the thermometer being located at the apex of the probe tip allows the mapping of temperature or thermal properties of nanostructured materials with very high spatial resolution. The high interest of the SThM technique in the field of thermal nanoscience currently suffers from a low temperature sensitivity despite its high spatial resolution. To address this challenge, we developed a high vacuum-based AFM system hosting a highly sensitive niobium nitride (NbN) SThM probe to demonstrate its unique performance. As a proof of concept, we utilized this custom-built system to carry out thermal measurements using the 3$\omega$ method. By measuring the $V_{3\omega}$ voltage on the NbN resistive thermometer in vacuum conditions we were able to determine the SThM probe's thermal conductance and thermal time constant. The performance of the probe is demonstrated by doing thermal measurements in-contact with a sapphire sample.</description>

      <title>Dark versus blocking states in electronic transport: a Lee-Yang zero analysis of full counting statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic transport through nanostructures can be suppressed by coherent population trapping, in which quantum coherence leads to a dark state that decouples from the drain electrode. Finite transport, then, relies on decoherence of the dark state. An alternative scenario for reduced transport is weak coupling of a state, referred to as a blocking state, to the drain. This raises the question of whether and how these two scenarios can be distinguished in the transport features. For the example of electron transport through a carbon nanotube, we identify regimes, in which this distinction is possible by analyzing the full counting statistics in terms of Lee-Yang zeros and factorial cumulants.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity from On-Chip Metallization on 2D Topological Chalcogenides</title>

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a versatile class of quantum materials of interest to various fields including, e.g., nanoelectronics, optical devices, and topological and correlated quantum matter. Tailoring the electronic properties of TMDs is essential to their applications in many directions. Here, we report that a highly controllable and uniform on-chip 2D metallization process converts a class of atomically thin TMDs into robust superconductors, a property belonging to none of the starting materials. As examples, we demonstrate the introduction of superconductivity into a class of 2D air-sensitive topological TMDs, including monolayers of Td-WTe2, 1T'-MoTe2 and 2H-MoTe2, as well as their natural and twisted bilayers, metalized with an ultrathin layer of Palladium. This class of TMDs are known to exhibit intriguing topological phases ranging from topological insulator, Weyl semimetal to fractional Chern insulator. The unique, high-quality two-dimensional metallization process is based on our recent findings of the long-distance, non-Fickian in-plane mass transport and chemistry in 2D that occur at relatively low temperatures and in devices fully encapsulated with inert insulating layers. Highly compatible with existing nanofabrication techniques for van der Waals (vdW) stacks, our results offer a route to designing and engineering superconductivity and topological phases in a class of correlated 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Inelastic decay from integrability</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.15542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hallmark of integrable systems is the purely elastic scattering of their excitations. Such systems possess an extensive number of locally conserved charges, leading to the conservation of the number of scattered excitations, as well as their set of individual momenta. In this work, we show that inelastic decay can nevertheless be observed in circuit QED realizations of integrable boundary models. We consider the scattering of microwave photons off impurities in superconducting circuits implementing the boundary sine-Gordon and Kondo models, which are both integrable. We show that not only inelastic decay is possible for the microwave photons, in spite of integrability, and thanks to a nonlinear relation between them and the elastically-scattered excitations, but also that integrability in fact provides powerful analytical tools allowing to obtain exact expressions for response functions describing the inelastic decay. Using the framework of form factors, we calculate the total inelastic decay rate and elastic phase shift of the microwave photons, extracted from a 2-point response function. We then go beyond linear response and obtain the exact energy-resolved inelastic decay spectrum, using a novel method to evaluate form factor expansions of 3-point response functions, which could prove useful in other applications of integrable quantum field theories. We relate our results to several recent photon splitting experiments, and in particular to recent experimental data that provides evidence for the elusive Schmid-Bulgadaev dissipative quantum phase transition.</description>

      <title>Axions and Superfluidity in Weyl Semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective field theory (EFT) for dynamical axions in Weyl semimetals (WSMs) is presented. A pseudoscalar axion excitation is predicted in WSMs at sufficiently low temperatures, independently of the strength of the Weyl fermion self-coupling. For strong fermion self-coupling the axion is the gapless Goldstone boson of chiral $U(1)^{\text{ch}}$ spontaneous symmetry breaking. For weak fermion self-coupling an axion is also generated at non-zero chiral density for Weyl nodes displaced in energy, as a gapless collective mode of correlated fermion pair excitations of the Fermi surface. This is an explicit example of the extension of Goldstone's theorem to symmetry breaking by the axial anomaly itself. In both cases the axion is a chiral density wave or phason mode of the superfluid state of the WSM, and the Weyl fermions form a chiral condensate $\langle\bar{\psi}\psi\rangle$ at low temperatures. In the presence of an applied magnetic field the axion mode becomes gapped, in analogy to the Anderson-Higgs mechanism in a superconductor. 't Hooft anomaly matching from ultraviolet to infrared scales is directly verified in the EFT approach. WSMs thus provide an interesting quantum system in which superfluid, non-Fermi liquid behavior, and a dynamical axion are predicted to follow directly from the axial anomaly in a consistent EFT that may be tested experimentally.</description>

      <title>Metasurface of strongly coupled excitons and nanoplasmonic arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09037v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces allow to manipulate light at the nanoscale. Integrating metasurfaces with transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers provides additional functionality to ultrathin optics, including tunable optical properties with enhanced light-matter interactions. In this work, we demonstrate the realization of a polaritonic metasurface utilizing the sizable light-matter coupling of excitons in monolayer WSe2 and the collective lattice resonances of nanoplasmonic gold arrays. To this end, we developed a novel fabrication method to integrate gold nanodisk arrays in hexagonal boron nitride and thus simultaneously ensure spectrally narrow exciton transitions and their immediate proximity to the near-field of array surface lattice resonances. In the regime of strong light-matter coupling, the resulting van der Waals metasurface exhibits all key characteristics of lattice polaritons, with a directional and linearly-polarized far-field emission profile dictated by the underlying nanoplasmonic lattice. Our work can be straightforwardly adapted to other lattice geometries, establishing structured van der Waals metasurfaces as means to engineer polaritonic lattices.</description>
