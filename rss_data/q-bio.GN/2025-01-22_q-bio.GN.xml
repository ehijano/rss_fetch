      <title>CoverM: Read alignment statistics for metagenomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genome-centric analysis of metagenomic samples is a powerful method for understanding the function of microbial communities. Calculating read coverage is a central part of analysis, enabling differential coverage binning for recovery of genomes and estimation of microbial community composition. Coverage is determined by processing read alignments to reference sequences of either contigs or genomes. Per-reference coverage is typically calculated in an ad-hoc manner, with each software package providing its own implementation and specific definition of coverage. Here we present a unified software package CoverM which calculates several coverage statistics for contigs and genomes in an ergonomic and flexible manner. It uses 'Mosdepth arrays' for computational efficiency and avoids unnecessary I/O overhead by calculating coverage statistics from streamed read alignment results. CoverM is free software available at https://github.com/wwood/coverm. CoverM is implemented in Rust, with Python (https://github.com/apcamargo/pycoverm) and Julia (https://github.com/JuliaBinaryWrappers/CoverM_jll.jl) interfaces.</description>

      <title>Genomic Analysis of Date Palm Fruit Size Traits and Identification of Candidate Genes through GWAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The commercial value of economically significant fruits, including date palm fruit (dates), is influenced by various factors, such as biochemical composition and morphological features like size, shape, and visual appearance, which are key determinants of their quality and market value. Dates are typically consumed at the dry stage (Tamar), during which they exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics, such as color, length, weight, and skin appearance. Understanding the genetic basis of these traits is crucial for improving crop quality and breeding new cultivars. In this study, we integrated a genome dataset from highly diverse date cultivars with phenotypes of dry fruit such as length, width, area, and weight, identifying multiple significant genetic loci (SNPs) associated with these traits. We also identified candidate genes located near the associated SNPs that are involved in biological processes such as cell differentiation, proliferation, growth, and the regulation of signalling pathways for growth regulators like auxin and abscisic acid, as observed in other plants. Gene expression analysis reveals that many of these genes are highly expressed in the early stage of fruit development when the fruit attains its maximum size and weight. These findings will enhance our understanding of genetic determinants of fruit size particularly at the commercially important Tamar stage.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Representations of scRNA-seq Data for Improved Clustering with Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data is often conducted through network projections such as coexpression networks, primarily due to the abundant availability of network analysis tools for downstream tasks. However, this approach has several limitations: loss of higher-order information, inefficient data representation caused by converting a sparse dataset to a fully connected network, and overestimation of coexpression due to zero-inflation. To address these limitations, we propose conceptualizing scRNA-seq expression data as hypergraphs, which are generalized graphs in which the hyperedges can connect more than two vertices. In the context of scRNA-seq data, the hypergraph nodes represent cells and the edges represent genes. Each hyperedge connects all cells where its corresponding gene is actively expressed and records the expression of the gene across different cells. This hypergraph conceptualization enables us to explore multi-way relationships beyond the pairwise interactions in coexpression networks without loss of information. We propose two novel clustering methods: (1) the Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (DIPHW) and (2) the Coexpression and Memory-Integrated Dual-Importance Preference Hypergraph Walk (CoMem-DIPHW). They outperform established methods on both simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets. The improvement brought by our proposed methods is especially significant when data modularity is weak. Furthermore, CoMem-DIPHW incorporates the gene coexpression network, cell coexpression network, and the cell-gene expression hypergraph from the single-cell abundance counts data altogether for embedding computation. This approach accounts for both the local level information from single-cell level gene expression and the global level information from the pairwise similarity in the two coexpression networks.</description>

      <title>Timestamp calibration for time-series single cell RNA-seq expression data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Timestamp automatic annotation (TAA) is a crucial procedure for analyzing time-series ScRNA-seq data, as they unveil dynamic biological developments and cell regeneration process. However, current TAA methods heavily rely on manual timestamps, often overlooking their reliability. This oversight can significantly degrade the performance of timestamp automatic annotation due to noisy timestamps. Nevertheless, the current approach for addressing this issue tends to select less critical cleaned samples for timestamp calibration. To tackle this challenge, we have developed a novel timestamp calibration model called ScPace for handling noisy labeled time-series ScRNA-seq data. This approach incorporates a latent variable indicator within a base classifier instead of probability sampling to detect noisy samples effectively. To validate our proposed method, we conducted experiments on both simulated and real time-series ScRNA-seq datasets. Cross-validation experiments with different artificial mislabeling rates demonstrate that ScPace outperforms previous approaches. Furthermore, after calibrating the timestamps of the original time-series ScRNA-seq data using our method, we performed supervised pseudotime analysis, revealing that ScPace enhances its performance significantly. These findings suggest that ScPace is an effective tool for timestamp calibration by enabling reclassification and deletion of detected noisy labeled samples while maintaining robustness across diverse ranges of time-series ScRNA-seq datasets.

      <title>On the Coverage Required for Diploid Genome Assembly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Repeat content and heterozygosity rate of the target genome are crucial factors in determining the ability to generate a complete telomere-to-telomere assembly. The mathematical relationship between the required coverage and read length for the purpose of unique reconstruction remains unexplored for diploid genomes. We investigate the information-theoretic conditions that the given set of sequencing reads must satisfy to achieve the complete reconstruction of the true sequence of a diploid genome. We also analyze the standard greedy and de-Bruijn graph-based assembly algorithms. Our results show that the coverage and read length requirements of the assembly algorithms are considerably higher than the lower bound because both algorithms require the double repeats in the genome to be bridged. Finally, we derive the necessary conditions for the overlap graph-based assembly paradigm.</description>
