      <title>Random approximation of convex bodies in Hausdorff metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there is extensive literature on approximation, deterministic as well as random, of general convex bodies $K$ in the symmetric difference metric, or other metrics arising from intrinsic volumes, very little is known for corresponding random results in the Hausdorff distance when the approximant $K_n$ is given by the convex hull of $n$ independent random points chosen uniformly on the boundary or in the interior of $K$. When $K$ is a polygon and the points are chosen on its boundary, we determine the exact limiting behavior of the expected Hausdorff distance between a polygon as $n\to\infty$. From this we derive the behavior of the asymptotic constant for a regular polygon in the number of vertices.</description>

Abstract: The goal of this note is to demonstrate how existing results can be adapted to establish the following result: A locally metric measure homogeneous $\mathrm{RCD}(K,N)$ space is isometric to, after multiplying a positive constant to the reference measure, a smooth Riemannian manifold with the Riemannian volume measure.</description>

      <title>Oberwolfach Report: Scalar Curvature Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although scalar curvature is the simplest curvature invariant, our understanding of scalar curvature has not matured to the same level as Ricci or sectional curvature. Despite this fact, many rigidity phenomenon have been established which give some of the strongest insights into scalar curvature. Important examples include Geroch's conjecture, the positive mass theorem, and Llarull's theorem. In order to further understand scalar curvature we ask corresponding geometric stability questions, where the hypotheses of the rigidity phenomenon are relaxed, and one would like to show that Riemannian manifolds which satisfy the relaxed conditions are close to the rigid objects in some topology. In this note we will survey what is known for scalar curvature stability, discuss what the questions are in this area, and introduce important tools which have been useful so far.</description>

      <title>Transformation of $p$-gradient flows to $p'$-gradient flows in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explicitly construct parameter transformations between gradient flows in metric spaces, called curves of maximal slope, having different exponents when the associated function satisfies a suitable convexity condition. These transformations induce the uniqueness of gradient flows for all exponents under a natural assumption which is satisfied in many examples. We also prove the regularizing effects of gradient flows. To establish these results, we directly deal with gradient flows instead of using variational discrete approximations which are often used in the study of gradient flows.</description>

      <title>The Blaschke rolling theorem in Riemannian manifolds of bounded curvature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the classical Blaschke Rolling Theorem to convex domains in Riemannian manifolds of bounded sectional curvature and arbitrary dimension. Our results are sharp and, in this sharp form, are new even in the model spaces of constant curvature.</description>

      <title>Mixed volumes of zonoids and the absolute value of the Grassmannian (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zonoids are Hausdorff limits of zonotopes, while zonotopes are convex polytopes defined as the Minkowski sums of finitely many segments. We present a combinatorial framework that links the study of mixed volumes of zonoids (a topic that has applications in algebraic combinatorics) with the study of the absolute value of the Grassmannian, defined as the image of the Grassmannian under the coordinate-wise absolute value map. We use polyhedral computations to derive new families of inequalities for n zonoids in dimension d, when (n,d)=(6,2) and (6,3). Unlike the classical geometric inequalities, originating from the Brunn-Minkowski and Aleksandrov-Fenchel inequalities, the inequalities we produce have the special feature of being Minkowski linear in each of the n zonoids they involve.</description>

      <title>Convex bodies of constant width with exponential illumination number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.10418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that there exist convex bodies of constant width in $\mathbb{E}^n$ with illumination number at least $(\cos(\pi/14)+o(1))^{-n}$, answering a question by G. Kalai. Furthermore, we prove the existence of finite sets of diameter $1$ in $\mathbb{E}^n$ which cannot be covered by $(2/\sqrt{3}+o(1))^{n}$ balls of diameter $1$, improving a result by J. Bourgain and J. Lindenstrauss.</description>

      <title>Remarks on soft ball packings in dimensions 2 and 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study translative arrangements of centrally symmetric convex domains in the plane (resp., of congruent balls in the Euclidean $3$-space) that neither pack nor cover. We define their soft density depending on a soft parameter and prove that the largest soft density for soft translative packings of a centrally symmetric convex domain with $3$-fold rotational symmetry and given soft parameter is obtained for a proper soft lattice packing. Furthermore, we show that among the soft lattice packings of congruent soft balls with given soft parameter the soft density is locally maximal for the corresponding face centered cubic (FCC) lattice.</description>

Abstract: We establish a monotonicity-type property of volume of central hyperplane sections of the 1-symmetric convex bodies, with applications to chessboard cutting. We parallel this for projections with a new convexity-type property for Rademacher sums.</description>

      <title>Global Hyperbolicity through the Eyes of the Null Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No Hopf-Rinow Theorem is possible in Lorentzian Geometry. Nonetheless, we prove that a spacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if it is metrically complete with respect to the null distance of a time function. Our approach is based on the observation that null distances behave particularly well for weak temporal functions in terms of regularity and causality. Specifically, we also show that the null distances of Cauchy temporal functions and regular cosmological time functions encode causality globally.</description>

      <title>Examples of Ricci limit spaces with infinite holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00619v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 3$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} $, and $(X,h)$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth complete Riemannian manifold with ${\rm Ric}_h &gt; \lambda $.
  In this paper, we construct, for each given $\epsilon &gt;0$, a sequence of $(n+2)$-dimensional manifolds $(M_{i} ,g_i ) \stackrel{GH}{\longrightarrow} (X_\epsilon ,d_\epsilon ) $ with ${\rm Ric}_{g_i} &gt; \lambda $, such that $d_{GH} (X,X_\epsilon ) \leq \epsilon $, and $X_\epsilon $ is homeomorphic to the space obtained by removing an infinite number of balls from $X$. Hence $X_\epsilon $ has dense boundary with an infinite number of connected components. Moreover, $X_\epsilon $ has no open subset which is topologically a manifold. This generalizes Hupp-Naber-Wang's result (arxiv: 2308.03909) from $4$-dimensional case to the general case of dimension $n\geq 3$.
  Our construction differs from that of Hupp-Naber-Wang. In their approach, Hupp-Naber-Wang considered doing an infinite number of blow-ups on the local complex surface structure of $X$, thus relying on the $4$-dimensional condition. However, our method involves removing an infinite number of balls from $X$, allowing us to construct in the general case of dimensions greater than or equal to $3$. As a corollary, we provide a solution to an open problem posed by Naber in the $3$-dimensional case.</description>
