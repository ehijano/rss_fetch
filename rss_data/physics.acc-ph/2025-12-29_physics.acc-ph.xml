      <title>Proposal for energy modulation to demodulation in seeded free-electron lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser manipulation plays a critical role in precisely tailoring relativistic electron beams through energy modulation, enabling the generation of coherent, intense, and ultrashort radiation in accelerator-based light sources such as synchrotron radiation facilities and free-electron lasers (FELs). However, laser-induced energy modulation inevitably degrades electron beam quality by increasing energy spread. In this paper, a straightforward yet practical implementation method for verifying the electron beam demodulation process in seeded FELs is proposed. The method employs a dedicated demodulation undulator system, referred to as a demodulator, equipped with a phase shifter. Both one-dimensional analytical models and three-dimensional simulations demonstrate that introducing a $\pi$ phase shift in the demodulator enables simultaneous energy modulation and demodulation using only a single seed laser. Under optimized conditions with weak initial modulation, simulation results indicate that the energy modulation can be substantially reduced or nearly eliminated. With increasing laser intensity, the modulation amplitude is significantly suppressed by more than an order of magnitude, effectively mitigating energy spread degradation. The residual energy modulation can be characterized using complementary diagnostic techniques: the coherent undulator radiation method combined with the dispersion scan method. The proposed method is expected to enable precise control over electron beam energy modulation, potentially facilitating the development of high-repetition-rate, fully coherent X-ray sources with improved electron beam quality preservation.</description>

      <title>A Capacitor Model of the Helical Deflector: Revisiting Shamaev's Proposal and the Textbook Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06651</link>

Abstract: An RF helical deflector is a type of electron and ion optics device that applies a time-dependent rotating transverse electric or magnetic field by means of time-dependent RF voltage applied on two opposite conducting helical structures (wires, ribbons or other) to deflect charged particles (a single, bunch or beam) in a circular or spiral path. It is a perspective indirect timing system being concurrent for reaching picosecond time resolution, and have promise being excellent candidate for high precision time-of-flight detection. As a timing system, it converts the temporal structure of an electron beam into a spatial pattern -- particularly, an ellipse in the case of a single-frequency RF voltage and continuous electron pencil beam.
  I propose a capacitor model of an RF helical deflector and compare it with the existing textbook model \cite{ZhigarevBook, Gevorgian2015}, interpret them and provide understanding of them. Furthermore, I analyze the latter, finding analytical formulas for the applied electric field, ellipse sizes (semi-axes) and rotation angle, lengths of the ellipse line, corresponding to the duration of electron pencil bunches or beams. The present article touches the topics of getting circle on resonance limit and of deflection sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Isotope Production in Muon-Catalyzed-Fusion Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20951v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Producing valuable isotopes with high-flux high-energy neutrons generated by muon-catalyzed fusion ($\mu$CF) reactions could substantially improve the economic prospects for muon-catalyzed fusion. Because no external heating is required for $\mu$CF, heat flux constraints are significantly relaxed compared with fusion systems requiring external heating. This could allow $\mu$CF to attain much higher neutron flux without breaching material heat flux limits. If muon production rates can be increased, $\mu$CF systems employing transmutation could be viable well before energy breakeven is possible. For $\mu$CF systems transmuting valuable isotopes, the required number of catalyzed fusion events per muon and muon energy generation cost can be relaxed by several orders of magnitude relative to electricity-generating systems, making $\mu$CF an attractive high-flux neutron source. We show an example $\mu$CF system with a 10 gram ${}^{226}\mathrm{Ra}$ feedstock and a steady-state muon rate of $10^{12}$ muons / second - roughly half a kilowatt of fusion power - could produce 20 mg of ${}^{225}\mathrm{Ac}$ per year - comparable to 400 times global supply in 2024. As higher muon rate sources become available, many other radioisotope transmutation pathways become viable. These findings motivate the accelerated development of $\mu$CF systems for neutron-driven isotope production far before net energy generation is possible.</description>
