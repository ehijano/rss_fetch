      <title>mmSnap: Bayesian One-Shot Fusion in a Self-Calibrated mmWave Radar Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present mmSnap, a collaborative RF sensing framework using multiple radar nodes, and demonstrate its feasibility and efficacy using commercially available mmWave MIMO radars. Collaborative fusion requires network calibration, or estimates of the relative poses (positions and orientations) of the sensors. We experimentally validate a self-calibration algorithm developed in our prior work, which estimates relative poses in closed form by least squares matching of target tracks within the common field of view (FoV). We then develop and demonstrate a Bayesian framework for one-shot fusion of measurements from multiple calibrated nodes, which yields instantaneous estimates of position and velocity vectors that match smoothed estimates from multi-frame tracking. Our experiments, conducted outdoors with two radar nodes tracking a moving human target, validate the core assumptions required to develop a broader set of capabilities for networked sensing with opportunistically deployed nodes.</description>

      <title>WirelessAgent: Large Language Model Agents for Intelligent Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of wireless networks presents unprecedented challenges in managing complex and dynamic systems. Existing methods are increasingly facing fundamental limitations in addressing these challenges. In this paper, we introduce WirelessAgent, a novel framework that harnesses large language models (LLMs) to create autonomous AI agents for diverse wireless network tasks. This framework integrates four core modules that mirror human cognitive processes: perception, memory, planning, and action. To implement it, we provide a basic usage based on agentic workflows and the LangGraph architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of WirelessAgent through a comprehensive case study on network slicing. The numerical results show that WirelessAgent achieves $44.4\%$ higher bandwidth utilization than the \emph{Prompt-based} method, while performing only $4.3\%$ below the \emph{Rule-based optimality}. Notably, WirelessAgent delivers near-optimal network throughput across diverse network scenarios. These underscore the framework's potential for intelligent and autonomous resource management in future wireless networks.

      <title>Impact of Insufficient CP on Sensing Performance in OFDM-ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) is widely considered a leading waveform candidate for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G networks. However, the cyclic prefix (CP) used to mitigate multipath effects in communication systems also limits the maximum sensing range. Target echoes arriving beyond the CP length cause inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI), which degrade the mainlobe level and raise sidelobe levels in the range-Doppler map (RDM). This paper presents a unified analytical framework to characterize the ISI and ICI caused by an insufficient CP length in multi-target scenarios. For the first time, we derive closed-form expressions for the second-order moments of the RDM under both matched filtering (MF) and reciprocal filtering (RF) processing with insufficient CP length. These expressions quantify the effects of CP length, symbol constellation, and inter-target interference (ITI) on the mainlobe and sidelobe levels. Based on these results, we further derive explicit formulas for the peak sidelobe level ratio (PSLR) and integrated sidelobe level ratio (ISLR) of the RDM, revealing a fundamental trade-off between noise amplification in RF and ITI in MF. Numerical results validate our theoretical derivations and illustrate the critical impact of insufficient CP length on sensing performance in OFDM-ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>One Target, Many Views: Multi-User Fusion for Collaborative Uplink ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel pilot-free multi-user uplink framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in mm-wave networks, where single-antenna users transmit orthogonal frequency division multiplexing signals without dedicated pilots. The base station exploits the spatial and velocity diversities of users to simultaneously decode messages and detect targets, transforming user transmissions into a powerful sensing tool. Each user's signal, structured by a known codebook, propagates through a sparse multi-path channel with shared moving targets and user-specific scatterers. Notably, common targets induce distinct delay-Doppler-angle signatures, while stationary scatterers cluster in parameter space. We formulate the joint multi-path parameter estimation and data decoding as a 3D super-resolution problem, extracting delays, Doppler shifts, and angles-of-arrival via atomic norm minimization, efficiently solved using semidefinite programming. A core innovation is multiuser fusion, where diverse user observations are collaboratively combined to enhance sensing and decoding. This approach improves robustness and integrates multi-user perspectives into a unified estimation framework, enabling high-resolution sensing and reliable communication. Numerical results show that the proposed framework significantly enhances both target estimation and communication performance, highlighting its potential for next-generation ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Multi-Beam Radar with Full Range Resolution exploiting Space-Code Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional monostatic radar systems typically exhibit a trade-off between long-range target detection achieved through narrow beams and short-range wide-area surveillance employing broad beams. Realizing both functionalities within a single system, enabling simultaneous surveillance and long-range target localization, poses a significant challenge. This paper presents a novel signal model and an all-digital frequency domain radar architecture leveraging first-of-its-kind space-code beamforming technique to achieve ubiquitous radar coverage. We show that the range-angle map can be estimated for all targets at full range-resolution for all beams compared to existing subcarrier based beamforming radars.</description>

      <title>Bridging the Gap via Data-Aided Sensing: Can Bistatic ISAC Converge to Genie Performance?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate data-aided iterative sensing in bistatic OFDM ISAC systems, focusing on scenarios with co-located sensing and communication receivers. To enhance target detection beyond pilot-only sensing methods, we propose a multi-stage bistatic OFDM receiver, performing iterative sensing and data demodulation to progressively refine ISAC channel and data estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed data-aided scheme significantly outperforms pilot-only benchmarks, particularly in multi-target scenarios, substantially narrowing the performance gap compared to a genie-aided system with perfect data knowledge. Moreover, the proposed approach considerably expands the bistatic ISAC trade-off region, closely approaching the probability of detection-achievable rate boundary established by its genie-aided counterpart.</description>

      <title>Network-Level ISAC Design: State-of-the-Art, Challenges, and Opportunities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) deployment is to provide coordinated sensing and communication services at an unprecedented scale. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of network-level ISAC systems, an emerging paradigm that significantly extends the capabilities of link-level ISAC through distributed cooperation. We first examine recent advancements in network-level ISAC architectures, emphasizing various cooperation schemes and distributed system designs. The sensing and communication (S\&amp;C) performance is analyzed with respect to interference management and cooperative S\&amp;C, offering new insights into the design principles necessary for large-scale networked ISAC deployments. In addition, distributed signaling strategies across different levels of cooperation are reviewed, focusing on key performance metrics such as sensing accuracy and communication quality-of-service (QoS). Next, we explore the key challenges for practical deployment where the critical role of synchronization is also discussed, highlighting advanced over-the-air synchronization techniques specifically tailored for bi-static and distributed ISAC systems. Finally, open challenges and future research directions in network-level ISAC design are identified. The findings and discussions aim to serve as a foundational guideline for advancing scalable, high-performance, and resilient distributed ISAC systems in next-generation wireless networks.</description>

      <title>Electronic Nose for Agricultural Grain Pest Detection, Identification, and Monitoring: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biotic pest attacks and infestations are major causes of stored grain losses, leading to significant food and economic losses. Conventional, manual, sampling-based pest recognition methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, costly, require expertise, and may not even detect hidden infestations. In recent years, the electronic nose (e-nose) approach has emerged as a potential alternative for agricultural grain pest recognition and monitoring. An e-nose mimics human olfactory systems by integrating a sensor array, data acquisition, and analysis for recognizing grain pests by analyzing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted by grain and pests. However, well-documented, curated, and synthesized literature on the use of e-nose technology for grain pest detection is lacking. Therefore, this systematic literature review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art e-nose technology for agricultural grain pest monitoring. The review examines employed sensor technology, targeted pest species type, grain medium, data processing, and pattern recognition techniques. An e-nose is a promising tool that offers a rapid, low-cost, non-destructive solution for detecting, identifying, and monitoring grain pests, including microscopic and hidden insects, with good accuracy. We identified the factors that influence the e-nose performance, which include pest species, storage duration, temperature, moisture content, and pest density. The major challenges include sensor array optimization or selection, large data processing, poor repeatability, and comparability among measurements. An inexpensive and portable e-nose has the potential to help stakeholders and storage managers take timely and data-driven informed actions or decisions to reduce overall food and economic losses.</description>

      <title>Cram\'er-Rao Bounds for Integrated Sensing and Communications in Pinching-Antenna Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pinching-antenna systems (PASs) have recently emerged as a flexible, cost-effective route to large-scale antenna deployments envisioned for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). This paper establishes the fundamental sensing limits of a bistatic PAS link by deriving closed-form Cram\'er-Rao lower bounds for the joint estimation of range and direction when a target is illuminated by pinching antennas placed along a dielectric waveguide and observed by a uniform linear array receiver. By rigorously preserving the amplitude and phase variations of each pinching antenna, as well as exploiting their non-uniform deployment, we gain valuable insights into the performance gain of PASs over conventional antenna arrays. Numerical results validate that the PAS-based ISAC can achieve centimeter-level ranging and sub-degree angular resolution with significantly fewer hardware resources than conventional uniform linear arrays. The derived bounds provide practical design guidelines for next-generation PAS-enabled ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>SeLR: Sparsity-enhanced Lagrangian Relaxation for Computation Offloading at the Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel computational approach for offloading sensor data processing tasks to servers in edge networks for better accuracy and makespan. A task is assigned with one of several offloading options, each comprises a server, a route for uploading data to the server, and a service profile that specifies the performance and resource consumption at the server and in the network. This offline offloading and routing problem is formulated as mixed integer programming (MIP), which is non-convex and HP-hard due to the discrete decision variables associated to the offloading options. The novelty of our approach is to transform this non-convex problem into iterative convex optimization by relaxing integer decision variables into continuous space, combining primal-dual optimization for penalizing constraint violations and reweighted $L_1$-minimization for promoting solution sparsity, which achieves better convergence through a smoother path in a continuous search space. Compared to existing greedy heuristics, our approach can achieve a better Pareto frontier in accuracy and latency, scales better to larger problem instances, and can achieve a 7.72--9.17$\times$ reduction in computational overhead of scheduling compared to the optimal solver in hierarchically organized edge networks with 300 nodes and 50--100 tasks.</description>

      <title>Deep Autoencoder-Based Constellation Design in Multiple Access Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multiple access channels (MAC), multiple users share a transmission medium to communicate with a common receiver. Traditional constellations like quadrature amplitude modulation are optimized for point-to-point systems and lack mechanisms to mitigate inter-user interference, leading to suboptimal performance in MAC environments. To address this, we propose a novel framework for constellation design in MAC that employs deep autoencoder (DAE)-based communication systems. This approach intelligently creates flexible constellations aware of inter-user interference, reducing symbol error rate and enhancing the constellation-constrained sum capacity of the channel. Comparisons against analytically derived constellations demonstrate that DAE-designed constellations consistently perform best or equal to the best across various system parameters. Furthermore, we apply the DAE to scenarios where no analytical solutions have been developed, such as with more than two users, demonstrating the adaptability of the model.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Neural Network-Driven Sparse Field Discretization Method for Near-Field Acoustic Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the Physics-Informed Neural Network-driven Sparse Field Discretization method (PINN-SFD), a novel self-supervised, physics-informed deep learning approach for addressing the Near-Field Acoustic Holography (NAH) problem. Unlike existing deep learning methods for NAH, which are predominantly supervised by large datasets, our approach does not require a training phase and it is physics-informed. The wave propagation field is discretized into sparse regions, a process referred to as field discretization, which includes a series of set of source planes, to address the inverse problem. Our method employs the discretized Kirchhoff-Helmholtz integral as the wave propagation model. By incorporating virtual planes, additional constraints are enforced near the actual sound source, improving the reconstruction process. Optimization is carried out using Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), where physics-based constraints are integrated into the loss functions to account for both direct (from equivalent source plane to hologram plane) and additional (from virtual planes to hologram plane) wave propagation paths. Additionally, sparsity is enforced on the velocity of the equivalent sources. Our comprehensive validation across various rectangular and violin top plates, covering a wide range of vibrational modes, demonstrates that PINN-SFD consistently outperforms the conventional Compressive-Equivalent Source Method (C-ESM), particularly in terms of reconstruction accuracy for complex vibrational patterns. Significantly, this method demonstrates reduced sensitivity to regularization parameters compared to C-ESM.</description>

      <title>A Self-Supervised Transformer for Unusable Shared Bike Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of bike-sharing systems (BSS) has greatly improved urban "last-mile" connectivity, yet large-scale deployments face escalating operational challenges, particularly in detecting faulty bikes. Existing detection approaches either rely on static model-based thresholds that overlook dynamic spatiotemporal (ST) usage patterns or employ supervised learning methods that struggle with label scarcity and class imbalance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel Self-Supervised Transformer (SSTransformer) framework for automatically detecting unusable shared bikes, leveraging ST features extracted from GPS trajectories and trip records. The model incorporates a self-supervised pre-training strategy to enhance its feature extraction capabilities, followed by fine-tuning for efficient status recognition. In the pre-training phase, the Transformer encoder learns generalized representations of bike movement via a self-supervised objective; in the fine-tuning phase, the encoder is adapted to a downstream binary classification task. Comprehensive experiments on a real-world dataset of 10,730 bikes (1,870 unusable, 8,860 normal) from Chengdu, China, demonstrate that SSTransformer significantly outperforms traditional machine learning, ensemble learning, and deep learning baselines, achieving the best accuracy (97.81%), precision (0.8889), and F1-score (0.9358). This work highlights the effectiveness of self-supervised Transformer on ST data for capturing complex anomalies in BSS, paving the way toward more reliable and scalable maintenance solutions for shared mobility.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Static IRS: 3D Shaped Beamforming for Area Coverage Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a promising paradigm to reconfigure the wireless environment for enhanced communication coverage and quality. However, to compensate for the double pathloss effect, massive IRS elements are required, raising concerns on the scalability of cost and complexity. This paper introduces a new architecture of quasi-static IRS (QS-IRS), which tunes element phases via mechanical adjustment or manually re-arranging the array topology. QS-IRS relies on massive production/assembly of purely passive elements only, and thus is suitable for ultra low-cost and large-scale deployment to enhance long-term coverage. To achieve this end, an IRS-aided area coverage problem is formulated, which explicitly considers the element radiation pattern (ERP), with the newly introduced shape masks for the mainlobe, and the sidelobe constraints to reduce energy leakage. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm based on the difference-of-convex (DC) and successive convex approximation (SCA) procedure is proposed, which achieves shaped beamforming with power gains close to that of the joint optimization algorithm, but with significantly reduced computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Realizing Fully-Connected Layers Over the Air via Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By leveraging the waveform superposition property of the multiple access channel, over-the-air computation (AirComp) enables the execution of digital computations through analog means in the wireless domain, leading to faster processing and reduced latency. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to implement a neural network (NN) consisting of digital fully connected (FC) layers using physically reconfigurable hardware. Specifically, we investigate reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to emulate the functionality of a NN for over-the-air inference. In this setup, both the RIS and the transceiver are jointly configured to manipulate the ambient wireless propagation environment, effectively reproducing the adjustable weights of a digital FC layer. We refer to this new computational paradigm as \textit{AirFC}. We formulate an imitation error minimization problem between the effective channel created by RIS and a target FC layer by jointly optimizing over-the-air parameters. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, an extremely low-complexity alternating optimization algorithm is proposed, where semi-closed-form/closed-form solutions for all optimization variables are derived. Simulation results show that the RIS-assisted MIMO-based AirFC can achieve competitive classification accuracy. Furthermore, it is also shown that a multi-RIS configuration significantly outperforms a single-RIS setup, particularly in line-of-sight (LoS)-dominated channels.</description>

      <title>EnviKal-Loc: Sub-10m Indoor LoRaWAN Localization using an Environmental-Aware Path Loss and Adaptive RSSI Smoothing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LoRaWAN technology's extensive coverage positions it as a strong contender for large-scale IoT deployments. However, achieving sub-10 m accuracy in indoor localization remains challenging due to complex environmental conditions, multipath fading, and transient obstructions. This paper proposes a lightweight but robust approach combining adaptive filtering with an extended log-distance, multi-wall path loss and shadowing (PLS) model. Our methodology augments conventional models with critical LoRaWAN parameters (received signal strength indicator (RSSI), frequency, and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)) and dynamic environmental indicators (temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, particulate matter, and barometric pressure). An adaptive Kalman filter reduces RSSI fluctuations, isolating persistent trends from momentary noise. Using a six-month dataset of 1,328,334 field measurements, we evaluate three models: the baseline COST 231 multi-wall model (MWM), the baseline model augmented with environmental parameters (MWM-EP), and a forward-only adaptive Kalman-filtered RSSI version of the latter (MWM-EP-KF). Results confirm that the MWM-EP-KF achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 5.81 m, outperforming both the MWM-EP (10.56 m) and the baseline MWM framework (17.98 m). Environmental augmentation reduces systematic errors by 41.22%, while Kalman filtering significantly enhances robustness under high RSSI volatility by 42.63%, on average across all devices. These findings present an interpretable, efficient solution for precise indoor LoRaWAN localization in dynamically changing environments.</description>

      <title>Spectral Efficiency Analysis of Near-Field Holographic MIMO over Ricean Fading Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the denser distribution of antenna elements, stronger mutual coupling effects would kick in among antenna elements, which would eventually affect the communication performance. Meanwhile, as the holographic array usually has large physical size, the possibility of near-field communication increases. This paper investigates a near-field multi-user downlink HMIMO system and characterizes the spectral efficiency (SE) under the mutual coupling effect over Ricean fading channels. Both perfect and imperfect channel state information (CSI) scenarios are considered. (i) For the perfect CSI case, the mutual coupling and radiation efficiency model are first established. Then, the closed-form SE is derived under maximum ratio transmission (MRT). By comparing the SE between the cases with and without mutual coupling, it is unveiled that the system SE with mutual coupling might outperform that without mutual coupling in the low transmit power regime for a given aperture size. Moreover, it is also unveiled that the inter-user interference cannot be eliminated unless the physical size of the array increases to infinity. Fortunately, the additional distance term in the near-field channel can be exploited for the inter-user interference mitigation, especially for the worst case, where the users' angular positions overlap to a great extent. (ii) For the imperfect CSI case, the channel estimation error is considered for the derivation of the closed-form SE under MRT. It shows that in the low transmit power regime, the system SE can be enhanced by increasing the pilot power and the antenna element density, the latter of which will lead to severe mutual coupling. In the high transmit power regime, increasing the pilot power has a limited effect on improving the system SE. However, increasing the antenna element density remains highly beneficial for enhancing the system SE.</description>

      <title>Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based Multi-Group Multicast Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01190v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based multi-group multicast communication system is investigated. An integral-based CAPA multi-group multicast beamforming design is formulated for the maximization of the system energy efficiency (EE), subject to a minimum multicast SE constraint of each user group and a total transmit power constraint. To address this non-econvex fractional programming problem, the Dinkelbach's method is employed. Within the Dinkelbach's framework, the non-convex group-wise multicast spectral efficiency (SE) constraint is first equivalently transformed into a tractable form with auxiliary variables. Then, an efficient block coordinate descent (BCD)-based algorithm is developed to solve the reformulated problem. The CAPA beamforming design subproblem can be optimally solved via the Lagrangian dual method and the calculus of variations (CoV) theory. It reveals that the optimal CAPA beamformer should be a combination of all the groups' user channels. To further reduce the computational complexity, a low-complexity zero-forcing (ZF)-based approach is proposed. The closed-form ZF CAPA beamformer is derived using each group's most representative user channel to mitigate the inter-group interference while ensuring the intra-group multicast performance. Then, the beamforming design subproblem in the BCD-based algorithm becomes a convex power allocation subproblem, which can be efficiently solved. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the CAPA can significantly improve the EE compared to conventional spatially discrete arrays (SPDAs); 2) due to the enhanced spatial resolutions, increasing the aperture size of CAPA is not always beneficial for EE enhancement in multicast scenarios; and 3) wider user distributions of each group cause a significant EE degradation of CAPA compared to SPDA.</description>

      <title>Enabling Training-Free Semantic Communication Systems with Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01209v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for next-generation wireless systems. Empowered by advanced artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, SemCom has achieved significant improvements in transmission quality and efficiency. However, existing SemCom systems either rely on training over large datasets and specific channel conditions or suffer from performance degradation under channel noise when operating in a training-free manner. To address these issues, we explore the use of generative diffusion models (GDMs) as training-free SemCom systems. Specifically, we design a semantic encoding and decoding method based on the inversion and sampling process of the denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM), which introduces a two-stage forward diffusion process, split between the transmitter and receiver to enhance robustness against channel noise. Moreover, we optimize sampling steps to compensate for the increased noise level caused by channel noise. We also conduct a brief analysis to provide insights about this design. Simulations on the Kodak dataset validate that the proposed system outperforms the existing baseline SemCom systems across various metrics.</description>

Abstract: While UE-centric cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) provides high and uniform throughput performance under the assumption of a uniform propagation environment modeled by the log-distance path loss channel model, the performance under a realistic urban propagation environment is not yet fully addressed. In this paper we conduct the first comparative performance study of CF-mMIMO under both the widely assumed log-distance channel model and the realistic urban propagation environment obtained via raytracing using real 3D city layouts and practical AP locations. Our results show that with the raytracing channel model, CF-mMIMO cannot achieve as high and uniform throughput performance as observed with the log-distance channel model, putting into question the attractiveness in practice of CF-mMIMO for real urban deployments.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Spectra and their Unbiased Estimation in the GPU-accelerated SignalSnap Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of time-dependent data poses a fundamental challenge in many fields of science and engineering. While concepts for higher-order spectral analysis like Brillinger's polyspectra for stationary processes have long been introduced, their applications have been limited probably due to high computational cost and complexity of implementation. Here we discuss the theoretical background of estimating polyspectra with our open-source GPU-accelerated SignaSnap library and highlight its advantages over previous implementations: (i) The calculation of spectra is unprecedentedly based on unbiased and consistent estimators that suppress the appearance of false structures in fourth-order spectra. (ii) SignalSnap implements cross-correlation spectra for up to four channels. (iii) The spectral estimates of SignalSnap have a clear relation to Brillinger's definition of ideal spectra of continuous stochastic processes in terms of amplitude and spectral resolution. (iv) SignalSnap estimates the variance of each spectral value. We show how polyspectra reveal, e.g., the correlations between different channels or the breaking of time-inversion symmetry and discuss how quasi-polyspectra uncover the non-stationarity of signals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has emerged as a transformative technology with immense potential to reshape the sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication network. By utilizing advanced algorithms for feature extraction and pattern recognition, DL provides unprecedented capabilities in optimizing the network efficiency and performance, particularly in physical layer communications. Although DL technologies present the great potential, they also face significant challenges related to the robustness, which are expected to intensify in the complex and demanding 6G environment. Specifically, current DL models typically exhibit substantial performance degradation in dynamic environments with time-varying channels, interference of noise and different scenarios, which affect their effectiveness in diverse real-world applications. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of strategies and approaches for robust DL-based methods in physical layer communications. First we introduce the key challenges that current DL models face. Then we delve into a detailed examination of DL approaches specifically tailored to enhance robustness in 6G, which are classified into data-driven and model-driven strategies. Finally, we verify the effectiveness of these methods by case studies and outline future research directions.</description>

      <title>Contactless pulse rate assessment: Results and insights for application in driving simulator</title>

Abstract: Camera-based monitoring of Pulse Rate (PR) enables continuous and unobtrusive assessment of driver's state, allowing estimation of fatigue or stress that could impact traffic safety. Commonly used wearable Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, while effective, suffer from motion artifacts and user discomfort. This study explores the feasibility of non-contact PR assessment using facial video recordings captured by a Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) camera in a driving simulation environment. The proposed approach detects subtle skin color variations due to blood flow and compares extracted PR values against reference measurements from a wearable wristband Empatica E4. We evaluate the impact of Eulerian Video Magnification (EVM) on signal quality and assess statistical differences in PR between age groups. Data obtained from 80 recordings from 64 healthy subjects covering a PR range of 45-160 bpm are analyzed, and signal extraction accuracy is quantified using metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE). Results show that EVM slightly improves PR estimation accuracy, reducing MAE from 6.48 bpm to 5.04 bpm and RMSE from 7.84 bpm to 6.38 bpm. A statistically significant difference is found between older and younger groups with both video-based and ground truth evaluation procedures. Additionally, we discuss Empatica E4 bias and its potential impact on the overall assessment of contact measurements. Altogether the findings demonstrate the feasibility of camera-based PR monitoring in dynamic environments and its potential integration into driving simulators for real-time physiological assessment.</description>

      <title>Timely Tracking of a Wiener Process With Single Bit Quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of timely tracking of a Wiener process via an energy-conserving sensor by utilizing a single bit quantization strategy under periodic sampling. Contrary to conventional single bit quantizers which only utilize the transmitted bit to convey information, in our codebook, we use an additional `$\emptyset$' symbol to encode the event of \emph{not transmitting}. Thus, our quantization functions are composed of three decision regions as opposed to the conventional two regions. First, we propose an optimum quantization method in which the optimum quantization functions are obtained by tracking the distributions of the quantization error. However, this method requires a high computational cost and might not be applicable for energy-conserving sensors. Thus, we propose two additional low complexity methods. In the last-bit aware method, three predefined quantization functions are available to both devices, and they switch the quantization function based on the last transmitted bit. With the Gaussian approximation method, we calculate a single quantization function by assuming that the quantization error can be approximated as Gaussian. While previous methods require a constant delay assumption, this method also works for random delay. We observe that all three methods perform similarly in terms of mean-squared error and transmission cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayes' rule has enabled innumerable powerful algorithms of statistical signal processing and statistical machine learning. However, when model misspecifications exist in prior and/or data distributions, the direct application of Bayes' rule is questionable. Philosophically, the key is to balance the relative importance between prior and data distributions when calculating posterior distributions: if prior distributions are overly conservative (i.e., exceedingly spread), we upweight the prior belief; if prior distributions are overly opportunistic (i.e., exceedingly concentrated), we downweight the prior belief. The same operation also applies to data distributions. This paper studies a generalized Bayes' rule, called uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule, to technically realize the above philosophy, thus combating the model uncertainties in prior and/or data distributions. Applications of the uncertainty-aware Bayes' rule on classification and estimation are discussed: In particular, the uncertainty-aware Bayes classifier, the uncertainty-aware Kalman filter, the uncertainty-aware particle filter, and the uncertainty-aware interactive-multiple-model filter are suggested and experimentally validated.</description>

      <title>Towards Practical Deep Schedulers for Allocating Cellular Radio Resources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning methods are often suggested to address wireless network functions, such as radio packet scheduling. However, a feasible 3GPP-compliant scheduler capable of delivering fair throughput across users, while keeping a low computational complexity for 5G and beyond is still missing. To address this, we first take a critical look at previous deep scheduler efforts. Secondly, we enhance State-of-the-Art (SoTA) deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms and adapt them to train our deep scheduler. In particular, we propose novel training techniques for Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and a new Distributional Soft Actor-Critic Discrete (DSACD) algorithm, which outperformed other tested variants. These improvements were achieved while maintaining minimal actor network complexity, making them suitable for real-time computing environments. Additionally, the entropy learning in SACD was fine-tuned to accommodate resource allocation action spaces of varying sizes. Our proposed deep schedulers exhibited strong generalization across different bandwidths, number of MU-MIMO layers, and traffic models. Ultimately, we show that our pre-trained deep schedulers outperform their heuristic rivals in realistic and standard-compliant 5G system-level simulations.</description>

Beyond Sionna's native capabilities, we implement and benchmark additional RIS optimization algorithms based on channel estimation, enabling an evaluation of RIS strategies under various deployment conditions. Coverage maps for RIS-assisted communication systems are generated through the integration of Sionna's RT simulations. Moreover, real-world experimentation underscores the necessity of validating algorithms in near-realistic simulation environments, as minor variations in measurement setups can significantly affect performance.</description>

In the realm of 6G, cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, featuring distributed base stations equipped with a large number of antennas, present an abundant source of angle-of-arrival (AOA) information that could be exploited for positioning applications. In this paper we leverage this AOA information at the base stations using the multiple signal classification (MUSIC) algorithm, in conjunction with received signal strength (RSS) for positioning through Gaussian process regression (GPR). An AOA fingerprint database is constructed by capturing the angle data from multiple locations across the network area and is combined with RSS data from the same locations to form a hybrid fingerprint which is then used to train a GPR model employing a squared exponential kernel. The trained regression model is subsequently utilized to estimate the location of a user equipment. Simulations demonstrate that the GPR model with hybrid input achieves better positioning accuracy than traditional GPR models utilizing RSS-only and AOA-only inputs.</description>

Abstract: Oil spill incidents pose severe threats to marine ecosystems and coastal environments, necessitating rapid detection and monitoring capabilities to mitigate environmental damage. In this paper, we demonstrate how artificial intelligence, despite the inherent high computational and memory requirements, can be efficiently integrated into marine pollution monitoring systems. More precisely, we propose a drone-based smart monitoring system leveraging a compressed deep learning U-Net architecture for oil spill detection and thickness estimation. Compared to the standard U-Net architecture, the number of convolution blocks and channels per block are modified. The new model is then trained on synthetic radar data to accurately predict thick oil slick thickness up to 10 mm. Results show that our optimized Tiny U-Net achieves superior performance with an Intersection over Union (IoU) metric of approximately 79%, while simultaneously reducing the model size by a factor of $\sim$269x compared to the state-of-the-art. This significant model compression enables efficient edge computing deployment on field-programmable gate array (FPGA) hardware integrated directly into the drone platform. Hardware implementation demonstrates near real-time thickness estimation capabilities with a run-time power consumption of approximately 2.2 watts. Our findings highlight the increasing potential of smart monitoring technologies and efficient edge computing for operational characterization in marine environments.</description>

      <title>Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces for Multiuser Downlink Beamforming in the Wave Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02687</link>

Abstract: Intelligent metasurface has recently emerged as a promising technology that enables the customization of wireless environments by harnessing large numbers of low-cost reconfigurable scattering elements. However, prior studies have predominantly focused on single-layer metasurfaces, which have limitations in terms of wave-domain processing capabilities due to practical hardware limitations. In contrast, this paper introduces a novel stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) design. Specifically, we investigate the integration of SIM into the downlink of a multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) communication system, where an SIM, consisting of a multilayer metasurface structure, is deployed at the base station (BS) to facilitate transmit beamforming in the electromagnetic wave domain. This eliminates the need for conventional digital beamforming and high-resolution digital-to-analog converters at the BS. To this end, an optimization problem is formulated to maximize the sum rate of all user equipments by jointly optimizing the transmit power allocation at the BS and the wave-based beamforming at the SIM, subject to constraints on the transmit power budget and discrete phase shifts. Furthermore, we propose a computationally efficient algorithm for solving the formulated joint optimization problem and elaborate on the potential benefits of employing SIM in wireless networks. Numerical results are illustrated to corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed SIM-enabled wave-based beamforming design and to evaluate the performance improvement achieved by the proposed algorithm compared to various benchmark schemes. It is demonstrated that considering the same number of transmit antennas, the proposed SIM-based system achieves about 200\% improvement in terms of sum rate compared to conventional MISO systems.

Abstract: The rapid growth of wireless communications has created a significant demand for high throughput, seamless connectivity, and extremely low latency. To meet these goals, a novel technology -- stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIMs) -- has been developed to perform signal processing by directly utilizing electromagnetic waves, thus achieving incredibly fast computing speed while reducing hardware requirements. In this article, we provide an overview of SIM technology, including its underlying hardware, benefits, and exciting applications in wireless communications. Specifically, we examine the utilization of SIMs in realizing transmit beamforming and semantic encoding in the wave domain. Additionally, channel estimation in SIM-aided communication systems is discussed. Finally, we highlight potential research opportunities and identify key challenges for deploying SIMs in wireless networks to motivate future research.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Joint Target Sensing and Proactive Eavesdropping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{\'{e}}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>AI-based CSI Feedback with Digital Twins: Real-World Validation and Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) has shown great potential for enhancing channel state information (CSI) feedback in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems, a subject currently under study by the 3GPP standards body. Digital twins (DTs) have emerged as an effective means to generate site-specific datasets for training DL-based CSI feedback models. However, most existing studies rely solely on simulations, leaving the effectiveness of DTs in reducing DL training costs yet to be validated through realistic experimental setups. This paper addresses this gap by establishing a real-world (RW) environment and corresponding virtual channels using ray tracing with replicated 3D models and accurate antenna properties. We evaluate whether models trained in DT environments can effectively operate in RW scenarios and quantify the benefits of online learning (OL) for performance enhancement. Results show that a dedicated DT remains essential even with OL to achieve satisfactory performance in RW scenarios.</description>
