      <title>Confinement inhibits surficial attachment and induces collective behaviors in bacterial colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bacterial colonies are a well-known example of living active matter, exhibiting collective behaviors such as nematic alignment and collective motion that play an important role in the spread of microbial infections. While the underlying mechanics of these behaviors have been described in model systems, many open questions remain about how microbial self-organization adapts to the variety of different environments bacteria encounter in natural and clinical settings. Here, using novel imaging and computational analysis techniques, the effects of confinement to 2D on the collective behaviors of pathogenic bacteria are described. Biofilm-forming Pseudomonas aeruginosa are grown on different substrates, either open to the surrounding fluid or confined to a single monolayer between two surfaces. Orientational ordering in the colony, cell morphologies, and trajectories are measured using single-cell segmentation and tracking. Surprisingly, confinement inhibits permanent attachment and induces twitching motility, giving rise to multiple coexisting collective behaviors. This effect is shown to be independent of the confining material and the presence of liquid medium. The nematic alignment and degree of correlation in the cells' trajectories determines how effectively bacteria can invade the space between two surfaces and the 3D structure of the colony after several days. Confinement causes the formation of dynamic cell layers driven by collective motion as well as collective verticalization leading to the formation of densely packed crystalline structures exhibiting long-range order. These results demonstrate the remarkable breadth of collective behaviors exhibited by bacteria in different environments, which must be considered to better understand bacterial colonization of surfaces.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stress Disrupts Symbiotic Fluid Dynamics in Bobtail Squid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of thermal stress on beneficial symbiosis, in the face of rapid climate change, remains poorly understood. We investigate this using the model system, Euprymna scolopes, the Hawaiian Bobtail Squid, and its bioluminescent symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, which enables the squid to camouflage itself through counter-illumination. Successful colonisation of the squid by V. fischeri must occur hours after hatching and is mediated by fluid flow due to respiration within the squid mantle cavity. To study this process, we develop a mathematical model using the Method of Regularised Stokeslets to simulate the flow and resulting bacterial trajectories within the squid. We explore how thermal stress, mediated by physiological changes in respiration, ciliary dynamics, and internal geometry, affects this early colonisation by analysing the time bacteria spend in regions crucial to the establishment of symbiosis in these simulations. A variance-based sensitivity analysis of physiologically relevant parameters on these metrics demonstrates that changes in the breath cycle significantly impact and reduce the time bacteria spend in the critical zone within the squid, hindering colonisation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Hemodynamic Effects of Ventricular Fibrillation using a Verified Computational Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ventricular Fibrillation (VF) is a malignant cardiac arrhythmia and the leading cause of sudden cardiac death, characterized by disorganized, high-frequency ventricular activity that results in the rapid loss of coordinated pump function and circulatory collapse. While the clinical manifestations of VF are well established, the multiscale mechanisms linking cellular electrophysiology to whole-organ mechanical failure remain challenging to study experimentally. Computational modeling therefore provides a critical platform for mechanistic investigation.
  This work presents a hierarchical computational study of VF beginning with the implementation and verification of a closed-loop, lumped-parameter (0D) hemodynamic model of the cardiovascular system. The verified model is used to quantify the global circulatory consequences of a prescribed VF state, demonstrating a 62.4% reduction in cardiac output and highlighting the dominant role of impaired ventricular filling and contractile failure. Recognizing the limitations of prescribing arrhythmia dynamics, we then propose a pathway toward an integrated, multiscale framework coupling the 0D hemodynamic core with models of cardiac electrophysiology and autonomic regulation to enable simulation of emergent arrhythmogenic behavior and reflex responses. Finally, we introduce an interactive simulator derived from the verified 0D model, designed to support education, hypothesis testing, and future integration of multiscale components. This work establishes a mechanistic baseline and software foundation for next-generation computational studies of VF and cardiovascular control.</description>

      <title>Diversity in emergent cell locomotion from the coupling cytosolic and cortical Marangoni flows with reaction-diffusion dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cell migration is a fundamental process underlying the survival and function of both unicellular and multicellular organisms. Crawling motility in eukaryotic cells arises from cyclic protrusion and retraction driven by the cytoskeleton, whose organization is regulated by reaction-diffusion (RD) dynamics of Rho GTPases between the cytosol and the cortex. These dynamics generate spatial membrane patterning and establish front-rear polarity through the coupling of biochemical signalling and mechanical feedback. We develop a cross-scale mean-field framework that integrates RD signalling with cytosolic and cortical hydrodynamics to capture emergent cellular locomotion. Our model reproduces diverse experimentally observed shape and motility phenotypes with small parameter changes, indicating that these behaviours correspond to self-organized limit cycles. Phase-space analysis reveals that coupling to both cytosolic flow and spatially varying surface tension is essential to recover the full spectrum of motility modes, providing a theoretical foundation for understanding amoeboid migration.</description>

      <title>Optimal Undulatory Swimming with Constrained Deformation and Actuation Intervals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In nature, many unicellular organisms are able to swim with the help of beating filaments, where local energy input leads to cooperative undulatory beating motion. Here, we investigate by employing reinforcement learning how undulatory microswimmers modeled as a discretized bead-bend-spring filament actuated by torques which are constrained locally. We show that the competition between actively applied torques and intrinsic bending stiffness leads to various optimal beating patterns characterized by distinct frequencies, amplitudes, and wavelengths. Interestingly, the optimum solutions depend on the action interval, i.e.\ the time scale how fast the microswimmer can \rev{change the applied torques} based on its internal state. We show that optimized stiffness- and action-interval-dependent beating is realized by bang-bang solutions of the applied torques with distinct optimum time-periodicity and phase shift between consecutive joints, which we analyze in detail by a systematic study of possible bang-bang wave solution patterns of applied torques. Our work not only sheds light on how efficient beating patterns of biological microswimmers can emerge based on internal and local constraints, but also offers actuation policies for potential artificial elastic microswimmers.</description>

      <title>New avenues for characterizing individual mineralized collagen fibrils with transmission electron microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bone serves as a remarkable example of nature's architectured material with its unique blend of strength and toughness, all at a lightweight design. Given the hierarchical nature of these materials, it is essential to understand the governing mechanisms and organization of its constituents across length scales for bio-inspired structural design. Despite recent advances in transmission electron miscoscopy (TEM) that have allowed us to witness the fascinating arrangement of bone at micro- down to the nano-scale, we are still missing the details about the structural organization and mechanical properties of the main building blocks of bone - mineralized collagen fibrils (MCFs). Here, we propose a novel approach for extracting individual MCFs from nature's model material via a dropcasting procedure. By isolating the MCFs onto TEM-compatible substrates, we visualized the arrangement of organic and mineral phases within the individual MCFs at the nanoscale. Using a 4D-STEM approach, the orientation of individual mineral crystals within the MCFs was examined. Furthermore, we conducted first-of-its-kind in situ tensile experiments, revealing exceptional tensile strains of at least 8%, demonstrating the intricate relationship between structural organization and the mechanical behavior of MCFs. The capabilities of TEM allow us to resolve MCF organization and composition down to the nanoscale level. This new knowledge of the ultrastructure of the bone-building blocks and the proposed sample extraction and in situ mechanical testing opens up new avenues for research into nature's inspired material design.</description>

      <title>Twin Supercoil Domain couples the dynamics of molecular motors and plectonemes during bacterial DNA transcription and replication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The genomic DNA of most bacteria is significantly underwound, which constrains the DNA molecule to adopt a branched plectoneme geometry. Moreover, biological functions like replication and transcription require that the two DNA strands be transiently opened, which generates waves of positive (respectively, negative) supercoiling downstream (respectively, upstream) of the molecular motor, a feature known as Twin Supercoiled Domain (TSD). In this work, we used coarse-grained modeling and Brownian Dynamics simulations to investigate the interactions between a TSD and the plectonemes of bacterial DNA. Simulations indicate that the slithering dynamics of short plasmids is not significantly affected by a TSD. In contrast, the TSD potently stimulates the spontaneous displacement modes (diffusion and growth/shrinkage) of the plectonemes of longer DNA molecules. This results in the motor trailing a growing plectoneme behind itself if it translocates more slowly than the maximum slithering speed of plectonemes. In contrast, if the motor translocates more rapidly than this limit, then quasi immobile plectonemes nucleate almost periodically upstream of the motor, grow up to several kbp, detach from the motor, shrink and disappear. The effect of an eventual static bend imposed by the motor and of topological barriers was also investigated.</description>

      <title>Information bounds the robustness of self-organized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembled systems, from synthetic nanostructures to developing organisms, are composed of fluctuating units capable of forming robust functional structures despite noise. In this Letter we ask: are there fundamental bounds on the robustness of self-organized nano-systems? By viewing self-organization as noisy encoding, we prove that the positional information capacity of short-range classical systems with discrete states obeys a bound reminiscent of area laws for quantum information. This universal bound can be saturated by fine-tuning transport coefficients. When long-range correlations are present, global constraints reduce the need for fine-tuning by providing effective integral feedback. Our work identifies bio-mimetic principles for the self-assembly of synthetic nanosystems and rationalizes, on purely information-theoretic grounds, why scale separation and hierarchical structures are common motifs in biology.</description>

      <title>Thermo-responsive closing and reopening artificial Venus Flytrap utilizing shape memory elastomers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01346v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite their often perceived static and slow nature, some plants can move faster than the blink of an eye. The rapid snap closure motion of the Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) has long captivated the interest of researchers and engineers alike, serving as a model for plant-inspired soft machines and robots. The translation of the fast snapping closure has inspired the development of various artificial Venus flytrap (AVF) systems. However, translating both the closing and reopening motion of D. muscipula into an autonomous plant inspired soft machine has yet to be achieved. In this study, we present an AVF that autonomously closes and reopens, utilizing novel thermo-responsive UV-curable shape memory materials for soft robotic systems. The life-sized thermo-responsive AVF exhibits closing and reopening motions triggered in a naturally occurring temperature range. The doubly curved trap lobes, built from shape memory polymers, close at 38{\deg}C, while reopening initiates around 45{\deg}C, employing shape memory elastomer strips as antagonistic actuators to facilitate lobe reopening. This work represents the first demonstration of thermo-responsive closing and reopening in an AVF with programmed sequential motion in response to increasing temperature. This approach marks the next step toward autonomously bidirectional moving soft machines/robots.</description>

      <title>Geometry-driven jets underlie dispersal of plants and fungi by raindrops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of droplets on concave surfaces is poorly understood, although it is relevant to a mode of dispersal that has evolved independently in several species of plants and fungi. This mode relies on splash-cups, specialized organs that use raindrops to disperse reproductive units away from the parent organism. We investigated the impact of droplets on conical cavities that mimic splash-cups and we found that such impact may lead to the formation of two types of jets, which appear essential for dispersal in nature. We built a minimal kinematic model that explains jet formation, involving the motion of fluid particles along geodesics (shortest paths) on the cone surface and we predicted cone angles that optimize jet formation, consistent with the geometries of natural splash-cups</description>

      <title>Automatic Forward Model Parameterization with Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18532v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To quantify how well theoretical predictions of structural ensembles agree with experimental measurements, we depend on the accuracy of forward models. These models are computational frameworks that generate observable quantities from molecular configurations based on empirical relationships linking specific molecular properties to experimental measurements. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with ensemble-averaged experimental observations, even when such observations are sparse and/or noisy. This is achieved by sampling the posterior distribution of conformational populations under experimental restraints as well as sampling the posterior distribution of uncertainties due to random and systematic error. In this study, we enhance the algorithm for the refinement of empirical forward model (FM) parameters. We introduce and evaluate two novel methods for optimizing FM parameters. The first method treats FM parameters as nuisance parameters, integrating over them in the full posterior distribution. The second method employs variational minimization of a quantity called the BICePs score that reports the free energy of `turning on` the experimental restraints. This technique, coupled with improved likelihood functions for handling experimental outliers, facilitates force field validation and optimization, as illustrated in recent studies (Raddi et al. 2023, 2024). Using this approach, we refine parameters that modulate the Karplus relation, crucial for accurate predictions of J-coupling constants based on dihedral angles between interacting nuclei. We validate this approach first with a toy model system, and then for human ubiquitin, predicting six sets of Karplus parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework naturally generalizes optimization to any differentiable forward model...</description>

      <title>Monitoring microplastics in live reef-building corals with microscopic laser particles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20014v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Micro- and nanoplastics pose a growing threat to marine organisms, such as reef-building corals. Yet, our understanding of microplastic uptake, interaction with coral tissue, and incorporation into coral skeletons remains limited, mainly due to the invasiveness of existing methods for detecting microplastics. Here, we exploit optical resonances in polymer spheres to transform microplastic particles into microscopic lasers. The bright, distinctive, and stable spectral signatures emitted by the microscopic laser particles function as optical barcodes, allowing extended tracking of microplastics transport through optically opaque coral tissue. Simultaneously, the lasers provide real-time sensing of dynamic changes at the microplastic surface with nanoscale resolution. Using confocal hyperspectral imaging, we establish the technical and analytical framework to capture coral anatomy and combine tracking and surface sensing into an integrated, non-invasive approach. With this, we explore the transport and internalization of individual microplastics in live corals, opening new avenues for understanding their ecological impact.</description>

      <title>Genesis of Horizontal Membrane Electric Field by Bilayer-Embedded Electrodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For over a century, the electric field of biological membranes has been regarded as a one-dimensional entity, defined exclusively by the component normal to the bilayer (E_VERT). Here, we challenge this conventional view by developing a device that generates a horizontal membrane electric field (E_HORZ) within a synthetic lipid bilayer. The device consists of micrometer-scale electrodes embedded between bilayer leaflets, allowing the steady generation of E_HORZ. Applied E_HORZ selectively and reversibly accelerated the slow inactivation of a voltage-gated potassium channel. Physical considerations revealed that E_HORZ is generated from spatially inhomogeneous membrane potential, thus occurring ubiquitously in physiological processes, such as at the wavefront of an action potential. Our E_HORZ system enables experimental access to three-dimensional membrane electric fields, mimicking hitherto overlooked physiological membrane electric activities.</description>

Abstract: Accurate force fields are essential for reliable molecular simulations. These models are refined against quantum mechanical calculations and experimental measurements, which are subject to random and systematic errors. Bayesian Inference of Conformational Populations (BICePs) is a reweighting algorithm that reconciles simulated ensembles with sparse or noisy observables by sampling the full posterior distribution of conformational populations and experimental uncertainty. In this method, a metric called the BICePs score is used to perform model selection, by calculating the free energy of "turning on" the conformational populations under experimental restraints. This approach, when used with improved likelihood functions to deal with experimental outliers, can be used for force field validation (Raddi et al. 2025). Here, we extend the BICePs approach to perform automated force field refinement while simultaneously sampling the full distribution of uncertainties, using a variational method to minimize the BICePs score. To demonstrate the utility of this method, we refine multiple interaction parameters for a 12-mer HP lattice model using ensemble-averaged distance measurements as restraints. To illustrate the resilience of BICePs in the presence of unknown random and systematic errors, we assess the performance of our algorithm through repeated optimizations and under various extents of experimental error. Our results suggest that variational optimization of the BICePs score is a promising direction for robust and automatic parameterization of molecular potentials.</description>

      <title>Active Turbulence in Shear Thinning Fluid</title>

Abstract: The study of active matter system has critical importance in revealing the physical essence of biological collective behavior. Dense bacterial suspension - a typical biological active matter, exhibits a wide range of phenomenons, among which bacterial turbulence has received extensive interest in recent years. This seemingly chaotic motion is widely studied in Newtonian fluid. However, studies based on complex fluids have predominantly focused on viscoelastic effects, leaving the role of shear-thinning viscosity largely unexplored despite its prevalence in natural bacterial environments like mucus and gastric fluids. Here, we experimentally employed Ficoll and Methocel polymers to study the impacts of various viscosities by Newtonian fluid and shear-thinning effects by Non-Newtonian fluids on bacterial turbulence. We analyzed various physical properties, including energy, enstrophy, etc., and observed that the shear-thinning effect is significantly suppressed in high-concentration bacterial suspensions. While the ordered arrangement of polymer chains under shear flow leads to the microscopic anisotropic viscosity, the suppression is largely attributed to the disruption of polymer chains caused by strong inter bacterial interactions in dense suspensions. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted experiments at a lower bacterial concentration and verified the findings using theoretical calculations based on the modified Resistive Force Theory.</description>

      <title>Excitonic Coupling and Photon Antibunching in Venus Yellow Fluorescent Protein Dimers: A Lindblad Master Equation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14233v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong excitonic coupling and photon antibunching (AB) have been observed together in Venus yellow fluorescent protein dimers and currently lack a cohesive theoretical explanation. In 2019, Kim et al. demonstrated Davydov splitting in circular dichroism spectra, revealing strong J-like coupling, while antibunched fluorescence emission was confirmed by combined antibunching--fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (AB/FCS fingerprinting). To investigate the implications of this coexistence, Venus dimer population dynamics are modeled within a Lindblad master equation framework, testing its ability to cope with typical FP time and energy values. Simulations predict multiple-femtosecond (fs) decoherence, yielding bright/dark state mixtures consistent with antibunched fluorescence emission at room temperature. Thus, excitonic coupling and photon AB are reconciled without invoking long-lived quantum coherence. However, clear violations of several approximation validity conditions appear imminent, calling for careful modifications to choices of standard system and bath definitions and parameter values.</description>
