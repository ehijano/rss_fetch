      <title>Using thermodynamics to learn gravitational wave physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black holes are some of the most interesting objects in the universe. While they first arise in the complicated behavior of general relativity, the physical laws ruling their behavior are surprisingly simple. For example, one of the core facts about black holes is that their area never decreases, much alike the entropy in thermodynamics. In this note directed at introductory physics students and their instructors, we use this similarity to understand properties of black hole physics using standard techniques from an undergraduate course in thermal physics. We explore the never-decreasing nature of black hole area to obtain bounds on the energy emitted in a black hole merger (a calculation originally done by Hawking). We show how this allows us to think of black holes in manners very similar to heat engines, and how these ideas have been used in modern gravitational wave observatories to test general relativity. This allows a research-level topic to be discussed in introductory physics lectures.</description>

      <title>Quantum Cosmology, Decoherence, and the Emergence of Classical Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the emergence of classical cosmological spacetimes in quantum cosmology by computing the reduced density matrix for long-wavelength curvature perturbations. Starting from standard Hartle--Hawking and tunneling boundary conditions, we emphasize that semiclassical WKB structure and inflationary squeezing do not by themselves yield classicality. Tracing over unobserved degrees of freedom and using the influence functional formalism, we derive the decoherence functional for superhorizon curvature modes during inflation. For a light massive environmental scalar field in the Bunch--Davies vacuum, we obtain an explicit noise kernel and show how a nonzero mass regulates the infrared behavior. We then evaluate decoherence under horizon-based and EFT-motivated coarse grainings, finding efficient suppression of interference between macroscopically distinct perturbation histories in both cases. The analysis clarifies the distinct roles of boundary conditions (branch amplitudes) and decoherence (classical branch selection) and yields an emergent cosmological arrow of time through environment-induced entanglement.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-Violating Wormhole Optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study massless spin-1 field propagation in a static, circularly symmetric $(2+1)$-dimensional wormhole with spatial Lorentz-violating anisotropy characterized by the throat radius $a$ and deformation parameter $\eta$. The geometry is horizon-free, geodesically complete, and asymptotically flat, with negative Gaussian curvature localized near the throat. Using the fully covariant vector boson formalism and covariant Maxwell theory, we derive an exact Schr\"odinger-type radial equation with a curvature-induced effective potential. Recasting the dynamics in Helmholtz form yields an effective refractive-index profile, showing that the wormhole acts as an inhomogeneous optical medium with position-dependent refractive index and frequency-dependent confinement, where low-frequency modes are strongly trapped while high-frequency modes propagate almost freely. A differential-geometric correspondence with helicoidal surfaces is established via $1/[a^2(1-\eta)] \leftrightarrow w^2$, demonstrating that Lorentz-violation-induced curvature is mathematically equivalent to curvature generated by geometric twist and linking the model to twisted graphene nanoribbons as analog-gravity platforms. These results provide a geometric framework for curvature-driven localization, dispersion, and anisotropic wave propagation in topologically nontrivial $(2+1)$-dimensional backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Beam tube boundary effects in stray light modeling of long Fabry-Perot arm cavities for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope will operate 10-40 km Fabry-Perot arm cavities inside vacuum beam tubes. FFT-based paraxial tools treat propagation in free space and therefore do not explicitly enforce beam tube boundary conditions. We introduce a waveguide-like mode description of the optical field that incorporates an imposed beam tube boundary condition and enables an independent benchmark of free-space FFT tools We derive the associated modal-mixing matrices for mirrors and baffles, including a closed-form series for axisymmetric circular apertures. We quantify the strain-equivalent couplings from baffle miscentering and from a localized near-wall tube defect, and show that they are suppressed as baffle density increases. In the relevant regime of densely baffled cavities and small perturbations, beam tube boundary effects are subdominant, which supports the continued use of FFT-based codes to guide the design of 3G detectors.</description>

      <title>Natural Emergence of LCDM Cosmology within General Relativity from Two Alternative Frameworks Without Fine-Tuning and Coincidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, by revisiting the quantum interpretation of the cosmological constant, we introduce its formal representation within standard General Relativity. Examining its behavior in a Friedmann-Robertson-Walker spacetime reveals a mechanism in which the symmetry between energy and momentum is dynamically broken. Applying this concept naturally leads to the derivation of the familiar LCDM model, while simultaneously alleviating both the fine-tuning and coincidence problems. Comparison of the ground-state energy behavior in the Friedmann equations with a dust matter field further indicates that large-scale matter exhibits the same symmetry-breaking behavior. Remarkably, due to this broken symmetry, the interactions between local regions of matter in the large-scale structure generate effective pressure, driving late-time acceleration and reproducing the LCDM expansion history without invoking exotic fields or negative-pressure components. This framework provides a self-consistent realization of LCDM within General Relativity, emerging entirely from the intrinsic dynamics of standard matter without fine-tuning and coincidence problems.</description>

      <title>Kiselev black strings in $f(R,T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate exact black string solutions in the context of $f(R,T)$ gravity. Adopting the specific form $f(R,T) = R + 2\chi T$, we consider an anisotropic Kiselev fluid as the matter content and obtain static cylindrical solutions, which are then extended to the rotating case through a suitable coordinate transformation. The influence of the quintessence state parameter $w_q$ and the matter--geometry coupling constant $\chi$ on the geometry is analyzed. We examine the weak, null, and strong energy conditions, identifying the regions in the parameter space where they are satisfied. Furthermore, we apply the Hamilton--Jacobi method to study the tunneling of scalar particles across the event horizon and derive the corresponding Hawking temperature. The thermodynamic stability of the solutions is investigated by computing the heat capacity, and the conditions for phase transitions are discussed. The results provide a characterization of black strings in $f(R,T)$ gravity surrounded by quintessence, highlighting the combined effects of anisotropic matter and modified gravity on their physical properties.</description>

      <title>Breathing Black Hole Shadows in Modified Gravity (MOG)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the dynamic phenomenological signatures of a Schwarzschild-MOG black hole shadow perturbed by passing gravitational waves. By perturbing the Hamilton-Jacobi equation for photon null geodesics, we demonstrate that the unique field content of MOG breaks the observational degeneracy with standard General Relativity. We mathematically prove two distinct, time-dependent signatures. First, the massless MOG scalar field induces a volumetric ``breathing mode'' polarization, causing the total apparent area of the shadow to rhythmically expand and contract. Second, the massive MOG vector field undergoes quantum vacuum dispersion, arriving at the observer with a predictable time delay. This delayed massive wave sources secondary longitudinal metric perturbations that manifest as a sudden, asymmetric translational wobble of the shadow on the celestial screen. These dynamic geometric shifts offer a robust observational template for next-generation interferometry to strictly test the existence of massive force carriers and scalar fields in gravity.</description>

      <title>Energy Layers and Quasi-Superradiant Heat Engines of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine Schwarzschild black holes within the framework of gravitational thermodynamics, introducing an ``energy layer'' picture for black-hole mass-energy and exploring a possible energy-extraction mechanism termed ``quasi-superradiance.'' Building on the standard relations for Hawking temperature and Bekenstein--Hawking entropy, we formalize energy layers via quasi-local radial energy accounting (e.g.\ integrating an effective local energy density over spherical shells) and connect this bookkeeping to the free energy $\FHelm=M-\TH \SBH$. We then extend the entropy correction ansatz with explicit series inversion and derive higher-order expansions for $\TH(M)$ and $\FHelm(M)$, including logarithmic and inverse-mass terms. To enhance mathematical transparency, we add intermediate derivations, lemma/theorem statements, and appendices. The quasi-superradiant mechanism is framed as a Carnot-like thought experiment powered by the Tolman temperature gradient between the near-horizon region and infinity; we show that the generalized second law enforces the Carnot bound and yields integrated maximum-work inequalities. Throughout, we stress that the proposal is heuristic and intended as a consistency-checked framework for discussion rather than a claim of definitive new physics.</description>

      <title>Energy Extraction from Rotating Charged Black Holes in Kalb-Ramond Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive study of energy extraction via the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism from rotating charged black holes in the context of Kalb-Ramond (KR) gravity. We systematically investigate the influence of various parameters on the energy extraction process, comparing the results in two distinct regions: the circular orbit region and the plunging region. {The results reveal that the Lorentz-violating parameter has a significant impact on energy extraction, affecting not only the parameter space where energy extraction is possible, but also the energy extraction power and efficiency.} It is found that the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region can offer a promising avenue for constraining KR gravity. In contrast, although energy extraction from the plunging region remains feasible even for black holes with relatively low spins and takes place nearer to the event horizon, its sensitivity to the Lorentz-violating parameter is significantly reduced. Overall, the Comisso-Asenjo magnetic reconnection mechanism can serve as a probe of the KR field, particularly through the energy extraction process in the circular orbit region.</description>

      <title>Direction-of-arrival estimation of a gravitational wave by correlations between quadrupole moments of pulsar timings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of a gravitational wave (GW) signal from pulsar timing array observations? The present paper addresses the inverse problem, for which we consider quadrupole moments of pulsar timings due to GWs from a dominant isolated source such as a binary of supermassive black holes over an isotropic stochastic background. Correlations between the quadrupole moments are discussed, where the correlations between pulsar pairs over the full sky are taken into account. The correlations turn out to be in the form of a three-dimensional traceless matrix with rank 2 that can be closely related with a projection tensor for the GW. Thereby, we demonstrate that the rank-2 matrix allows to estimate the DOA of the GW. In expectation of the forthcoming Square Kilometer Array, angular resolutions as well as DOA estimation errors are also examined.</description>

      <title>GW070605: An Undisclosed Binary Neutron Star Hardware Injection in LIGO's Fifth Science Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The authors wished to document the sensitivity improvement that has been contributed to the GW detection rate by detection algorithm research and development efforts, and set about re-analyzing S5 and S6 to determine the sensitive time-volumes of a modern pipeline and compare them to that of analysis algorithms of the day. To our surprise, this effort led to the discovery of GW070605, what at first appeared to be a previously unreported high significance binary neutron star merger at a time when only the Livingston detector (L1) was operating -- data that could not have been analyzed and a signal that could not have been discovered previously because the algorithms of the day required coincidence between two or more detectors. GW070605's end time occurs in LIGO's L1 detector at 2007-06-05 18:37:02 UTC, and is estimated to be a merger with component masses of 1.82$M_\odot$ and 1.24$M_\odot$. The GstLAL detection algorithm estimates that noise processes produce false positives at least as significant as GW070605 at a rate of $8.6\times10^{-10}$ per year. Disappointingly, subsequent investigations revealed the presence of a previously undocumented hardware injection in the L1 detector's Y arm end test mass' excitation channel, whose time and properties match that of GW070605. The injection does not appear in the Gravitational Wave Open Science Center list of hardware injections. We determined that while there is no sensitivity improvement between GstLAL and previous algorithms at the null-result threshold, there is marked improvement at above null-result thresholds; specifically, an approximately 55-times detection rate increase from initial-era algorithms at a FAR threshold of 1 per 7000 years.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Past-geodesically-complete cosmologies are thought to require either contraction, or an asymptotically static past. We introduce a third possibility: Einstein-frame time can dynamically attain a local minimum. This time-reversal is caused by phantom Chaplygin gas, whose acoustic cone defines a `causal-frame' geometry that is geodesically-complete. While gravity experiences time-reversal, the Chaplygin gas always evolves forward in time, realizing a transient mismatch in thermodynamic arrows of time. Time-reversal affects the scale-factor, enforcing a non-singular bounce in causal frame that is robust against any additional matter.</description>

      <title>Hotspot Images from Magnetic Reconnection Processes in the plunging Region of a Kerr Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the hotspot imaging method, this paper investigates the motion trajectory of plasma in the plunging region before and after the Comisso-Asenjo mechanism. Following a brief review of the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region of a Kerr black hole, we introduce the hotspot model and imaging method. Based on numerical simulations, we separately study the hotspot images in the plunging region without magnetic reconnection, with magnetic reconnection, and when the escape condition is not met. We also compare these with hotspot images in the circular orbit region. The results show that for hotspot images without magnetic reconnection, if the plasma follow plunging orbits, the flare intensity gradually decreases, whereas if they follow circular orbits, the flare intensity remains nearly constant. Additionally, we find that in the plunging region, the signal for energy extraction is weaker compared to that in the circular orbit region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.21865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analytic model of force-free electromagnetic jet launched from a disk-fed rotating black hole. The jet solution is obtained through a systematic construction from previously developed methods. The resulting physical jet solution exhibits an asymptotically parabolic structure and is parametrized by the location of localized current concentration and sign reversal in the disk. We find, however, that the jet properties show negligible dependence on the disk parameter. The black hole jet captures the basic feature of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism for energy extraction and jet formation.</description>

      <title>Exact Spinning Morris-Thorne Wormhole: Causal Structure, Shadows, and Multipole Moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct an exact spinning generalisation of the Morris-Thorne traversable wormhole supported by an anisotropic fluid. Within the Teo wormhole ansatz with unit lapse and Morris-Thorne shape function, we solve analytically for the frame-dragging function and obtain a two-parameter family of asymptotically flat solutions labelled by the throat radius $r_0$ and total angular momentum $J$. Curvature scalars and stress-energy components are given in closed form, showing a regular throat, equatorial reflection symmetry, and violations of all standard energy conditions, as required for traversable wormholes. We analyse the causal structure and show that, despite the presence of an ergoregion for sufficiently large $|J|$, the coordinate time defines a global temporal function, so the spacetime is stably causal and free of closed timelike curves. The optical appearance is studied via photon trajectories. The resulting shadows are smaller than Kerr's and depend on the wormhole shape. Finally, we compute the Geroch-Hansen multipole moments and find a massless but spinning configuration with distinctive higher multipoles that encode the throat scale.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Evolution of Primordial Black Holes to near-extremality in EFTs of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for dark matter candidates includes primordial black holes (PBHs) as possible constituents. Recent studies show that some PBHs can survive to the present epoch by gaining angular momentum through Hawking radiating photons and becoming extremal before complete evaporation. While this provides a plausible model in a two-derivative theory of gravity, additional issues arise in EFT-corrected theories of gravity. In such theories, a rapidly spinning black hole can lead to extremely high tidal forces on a near-horizon observer, with possible observational consequences. In this work, by modeling Hawking radiation as a biased random walk within an EFT of gravity, we show that nearly the same fraction of PBHs survives as in GR. We argue that the resultant near horizon tidal effects should be detectable in future gravitational-wave observables.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the propagation of a constant speed gaussian scalar field wave-packet (GWP) in Minkowski space, showing that the energy conditions are violated for superluminal speed. We then apply the effective speed approach to the GWP propagation, deriving the corresponding effective metric, effective Lagrangian and effective stress-energy tensor, showing that the null, weak and strong energy conditions are satisfied.</description>

      <title>Beyond Gaussian Assumptions: A new robust statistical framework for gravitational-wave data analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many traditional algorithms applied in gravitational-wave astronomy rely on the assumption of Gaussian noise, a condition not always met. To meet this need, this study extends a robust statistical framework, advancing previous work on heavy-tailed likelihoods, that adapts the hyperbolic likelihood method for full frequency domain applications. The framework is designed to maintain high performance under ideal conditions while improving robustness against non-Gaussian noise and outliers in real-world data. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through two key case studies. The first case study analyzes a massive black hole binary merger in simulated Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) data with Gaussian noise, showing that the extended hyperbolic likelihood method performs comparably to the more commonly used Whittle likelihood. The second case study examines a stellar-mass black hole binary merger using real ground-based gravitational-wave data containing non-Gaussian noise or overlapping signals, where our framework exhibits increased robustness and yields more accurate parameter estimations. Our results show that the hyperbolic likelihood better captures the true noise distribution, providing a flexible and physically motivated alternative for GW data analysis across current and future detectors.</description>

      <title>Imprints of non-commutativity on charged black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents a comprehensive investigation of the gravitational phenomena that correspond to a non-commutative (NC) charged black hole, by incorporating NC geometry through a Moyal twist. We derive the deformed metric up to the second order of the NC parameter, utilizing the Seiberg-Witten map for the Reissner-Nordstrom black hole. We explore how non-commutativity modifies key thermodynamic properties, such as the Hawking temperature and heat capacity, and the existence of a remnant mass at the final stage of evaporation. Additionally, the study of Hawking radiation for bosonic and fermionic particles is discussed. Applying a perturbative method, scalar quasinormal modes are analyzed numerically. Furthermore, null geodesics and photon sphere stability are explored via curvature and topological methods. The shadow radius and deflection angle are computed to understand observational signatures. Lensing observables are compared to Event Horizon Telescope observations to provide probable constraints on the non-commutativity parameter. This study bridges theoretical predictions with astrophysical observations, offering insights into quantum gravity effects on black hole physics.</description>

      <title>Choice of Quantum Vacuum for Inflation Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the modifications to inflationary observables that arise when adopting an $\alpha$-vacuum instead of the standard Bunch--Davies vacuum for quantum fluctuations during inflation. Within the Starobinsky inflationary model, we compute and compare the scalar spectral index, its running, and the running of the running arising from different choices of the initial vacuum state. We further examine the energy scales associated with $\alpha$-vacua and argue that, for any number of extra spatial dimensions, the relevant scale can be truncated at the Hubble scale, $\sim$$\mathcal{O}(10^{13})\,\mathrm{GeV}$, without conflict with current Cavendish-type experimental bounds on sub-millimeter gravity ($\sim$$250\,\mu\mathrm{m}$). Our analysis demonstrates that the $\alpha$-vacuum is subject to stringent constraints as a viable de~Sitter-invariant alternative to the Euclidean (Bunch--Davies) vacuum, with the corrections that it induces in the inflationary observables being strongly limited by the latest Planck data.</description>

      <title>Static Dark Fluid Thin Shells in Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetimes: Stability and Black Hole Shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and radial stability of static, spherically symmetric thin shells separating two Schwarzschild--de Sitter spacetimes with parameters $(m_\pm,\Lambda_\pm)$. Using the Israel junction formalism and a linear barotropic equation of state $p = \lambda(\sigma - \sigma_1)c^2$, we decouple the sound speed $c_s^2 = \lambda c^2$ from the equilibrium equation-of-state parameter $w_0 \equiv p_0 / (\sigma_0 c^2)$ and derive the effective potential governing radial dynamics. For observationally motivated parameters, stable configurations with $\sigma_0&gt;0$ and $0&lt;\lambda\leq1$ exist only when $m_+/m_- &gt; 1$. Three distinct stability windows emerge, when $\lambda=1$: $-3/7 \lesssim w_0 \lesssim 1/2$ for $\Lambda_+ = \Lambda_-$, $-2/3 \lesssim w_0 \lesssim 1/2$ for $\Lambda_+ &gt; \Lambda_-$ and $0 \lesssim w_0 \lesssim 1$ for $\Lambda_+ &lt; \Lambda_-$. Positive-pressure shells ($w_0&gt;0$) reside near the photon sphere, whereas negative-pressure shells ($w_0&lt;0$) extend outward, reaching either the cosmological horizon or the static radius. Stability relies on the variation of $w(\sigma)$ with the surface energy density. Negative pressure (tension) stabilizes the system because the tension increases during expansion. Conversely, positive pressure stabilizes the system because the pressure increases during contraction. Finally, a static, stable, dark, fluid thin shell acts as a gravitational refractive layer that enlarges the black hole's shadow for a distant, static observer outside the shell. The effect depends on the shell radius $R_0$, the background parameters $(m_{\pm}, \Lambda_{\pm})$, and the equation-of-state. Dark fluid shells can be considered as theoretical toy models that illustrate qualitative effects. Future high-resolution black hole shadow observations could, in principle, use such models to explore how different equations of state might influence observable signatures.</description>

      <title>Low-Mass Neutron Stars and Effective Phase Transitions from a Hybrid Van der Waals-Polytropic Equation of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study phase-transition-like behavior in neutron stars using a simplified, piecewise equation of state that couples a modified van der Waals-type core to a polytropic crust. The model remains analytically tractable while allowing for nonlinear density dependence. We impose thermodynamic and causal consistency conditions and determine the critical densities at which the curvature of the pressure-energy density relation changes. In the non-relativistic limit, the generalized Lane-Emden equations describe a smooth core-crust transition layer. We integrate the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations across different $(\tau_1,\sigma_1)$ regimes, where these parameters encode thermal and interaction effects in the core. The resulting mass-radius sequences yield low neutron star masses $(0.99-2.05)M_{\odot}$, and the chemical potential exhibits the characteristic signatures of phase-transition behavior at densities well above the matching point. Our results show that analytic EOS models can reproduce the key phenomenology of phase transitions and provide a controlled framework for exploring low-mass neutron star configurations.</description>

      <title>Lorentz-boosted diffusion: initial value formulation and exact solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the diffusion equation, when treated as a stand-alone partial differential equation, exhibits exponential instabilities in boosted frames, which render the corresponding initial-value problem ill-posed. Recently, however, it was shown that Fick-type diffusion arises as the exact hydrodynamic sector of relativistic Fokker-Planck kinetic theory. In this work, we exploit this kinetic embedding to formulate a modified initial-value problem for one-dimensional Lorentz-boosted diffusion. We show that the resulting dynamics are well posed both forward and backward in time, provided the boosted density profiles admit a kinetic-theory realization. Such profiles form a space of band-limited functions, within which the evolution can be expressed as a discrete superposition of spatially sampled initial data, weighted by a Shannon-Whittaker-type Green function defined on the full Minkowski plane. The Green function is obtained in closed analytic form.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically (un)safe scattering amplitudes from scratch: a deep dive into the IR jungle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute leading order quantum gravity contributions to a simple scalar scattering amplitude in Asymptotic Safety. Our model admits an analytic treatment so that several subtleties can be analysed. We find that (i) the existence of an asymptotically safe renormalisation group fixed point alone does not imply the boundedness of scattering amplitudes, (ii) gravitational logarithms can dominate the infrared regime of massless theories, (iii) a derivative expansion of the effective action fails quantitatively to predict the correct Wilson coefficients in massless theories, and (iv) standard renormalisation group improvement techniques fail qualitatively to describe the momentum dependence of correlation functions. Only momentum-dependent computations can resolve these issues. For theories that include massive fields, the derivative expansion can work effectively in most cases, but it can still fail for classically marginal couplings, and purely gravitational couplings. We also speculate about an effective realisation of the no-global-symmetries conjecture in Asymptotic Safety.</description>

      <title>Lepton asymmetry leading to baryogenesis by primordial black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Baryogenesis remains an unresolved problem in cosmology, with existing mechanisms facing significant caveats. We show that the effects of primordial black holes (PBHs) on neutrinos produce the lepton asymmetry $\sim 10^{-10}$ which subsequently produces the baryon asymmetry. We consider the Dirac Lagrangian in curved spacetime in local coordinates exhibiting Hermitian pseudo-vector and non-Hermitian vector terms. These terms lead to energy splitting between weakly interacting neutrinos and antineutrinos, resulting in their unequal number densities and hence a lepton asymmetry. While the non-Hermitian effect leads to a non-conserved total probability of neutrinos, the leptogenesis due to gravitational effects of a PBH could be significant until the nucleosynthesis era. This in turn produces baryon asymmetry from the symmetry of lepton and baryon numbers via the sphaleron process in the electro-weak era. We show that in the most conservative scenario, the PBHs of mass $\sim 10^{12}$ g and spin $\sim 0.01$ produce the observed baryogenesis at temperature 130 GeV, when such PBHs are available abundantly. However, massive PBHs also could produce the observed asymmetry, assuming the non/anti-Hermitian vector couplings for neutrino and anti-neutrino get canceled from the Lagrangian, leading the system to be Hermitian.</description>

      <title>On the Kalb-Ramond field with non-minimal coupling to gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a massive Kalb-Ramond field with a general non-minimal coupling to gravity. We first study the theory in flat space-time, taking into account the non-linearities. We show that the coupling with the Ricci scalar gives rise to the strong coupling of the two transverse pseudo-vector degrees of freedom, which are absent in the massless theory. We then show that if the theory is instead coupled to the Ricci tensor or the Riemann tensor, the two tensor modes become strongly coupled in addition to the transverse pseudo-vector modes. We then extend our analysis to homogeneous and isotropic space-time, with vanishing background value of the Kalb-Ramond field. We show that in this case, the couplings with the Ricci and Riemann tensor give rise to the runaway instability. Finally, we discuss the inclusion of the disformal coupling as a possible resolution to this unnatural behavior.</description>

      <title>Linear Perturbations and Multi-Probe Diagnostics in Dark-Sector Selective $f(R,T_{\chi})$ Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a dark-sector selective trace-coupled extension of gravity in which the matter--curvature coupling depends exclusively on the trace of the dark-matter energy--momentum tensor, $T_{\chi}$, defined from a canonical dark-matter field $\chi$. This construction provides a microphysically specified trace sector, removes the usual matter-Lagrangian ambiguity of $f(R,T)$-type models, and preserves minimal coupling of visible matter by design. We derive the full field equations, the exact dark-sector exchange structure, and the linear scalar-perturbation system in gauge-ready form. In the sub-horizon regime, we derive effective modified-gravity functions governing structure growth and light deflection, and show that the model generically produces correlated, scale- and time-dependent departures from General Relativity in growth and lensing observables. Building on this structure, we formulate a perturbation-focused multi-probe framework based on redshift-space distortions, weak lensing, and CMB lensing, explicitly targeting degeneracy breaking beyond background-expansion tests. The analysis establishes the action-level and perturbation-level foundations of the model and provides a conservative, reproducible framework for translated linear-regime constraints within a dark-sector selective modified-gravity setting.</description>

      <title>Dynamical 4-D Gauss-Bonnet action from matter-graviton interactions in a curved background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Glavan-Lin proposal for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity introduces a singular dimensional scaling to bypass Lovelock's theorem, though its fundamental origin remains debated. In this work, we demonstrate that this specific dimension-dependent scaling naturally emerges from the one-loop self-energy corrections of gravitons. By employing real-space techniques to evaluate graviton interactions with minimally coupled scalar and electromagnetic fields in a de Sitter background, we show that the $1/(D-4)$ pole universally generates a dynamical Gauss-Bonnet term. This confirms that the scaling is not an ad-hoc classical limit but a necessary consequence of quantum field-theoretic renormalization. Furthermore, canceling the remaining divergences strictly requires the inclusion of quadratic curvature counterterms, specifically Weyl-squared and $R^2$ invariants. We discuss the implications of this in the early-Universe and consequences in strong gravity regime.</description>

      <title>Holographic CFT Phase Transitions and Criticality for Einstein-Maxwell-Power-Yang-Mills AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the thermodynamic phase structure for Anti-de Sitter black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-power-Yang-Mills gravity, reformulated through holographic duality as an ensemble problem in the dual conformal field theory (CFT). By deriving an extended first law where the central charge \(C\) is a thermodynamic variable, we systematically explore both canonical and mixed ensembles. In the canonical ensemble with fixed charges, we identify a van der Waals-like phase transition between small and large black holes, marked by a characteristic swallowtail structure and coexistence curves with a negative slope. In contrast, within the mixed ensemble of fixed electric potential, the system exhibits a Hawking-Page transition between confined and deconfined phases of the boundary CFT. Our key finding is the suppressive role of the non-Abelian Yang-Mills charge \(\tilde{q}\): increasing \(\tilde{q}\) lowers both the minimum and the Hawking-Page transition temperatures, significantly narrowing the stability window of the confined phase. These results, supported by detailed numerical analysis, reveal a rich, ensemble-dependent phase landscape and establish the non-linear Yang-Mills sector as a critical controller of confinement physics in strongly coupled holographic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22153v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What are gauge-invariant local observables in a subregion in quantum gravity? How does one even define such a subregion non-perturbatively? We study these questions in JT gravity. One can define a subregion by specifying the value of the dilaton at the boundary of the region. We study conformal matter correlators in such a subregion. There is a gravitational constraint associated with York time evolution within the causal diamond of the subregion. This constraint can be leveraged to construct gauge-invariant observables in quantum gravity, using a crossed product construction. The extrinsic curvature of Cauchy slices acts as the physical clock. This is a simple example of how gauge-invariant observables can be obtained by dressing to features of a spacetime (or other fields), without the need for introducing an external observer. The entropy associated with this algebra of observables is not an area, or any boundary term. We show that gravitational constraints only give boundary formulas for entropy when gauging isometric diffeomorphisms. York time flow is merely a conformal isometry, not an actual isometry, and thus leads to bulk contributions to entropy. We repeat our construction for Milne-type closed Big-Bang universes, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.22170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Assuming that dark matter is an ultralight pseudoscalar particle which couples to electromagnetism like an axion (an ALP), we demonstrate that the coupling of the cosmological magnetic field produced by the ALP field oscillations to the primordial dark matter fluctuations yields a spectrum of gauge field fluctuations which can produce a sufficient flux of Lyman-Werner photons to enable the Direct Collapse Black Hole formation scenario. The induced flux is consistent with the bounds on the excess flux of radio photons from ARCADE2 and EDGES measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1305.6977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Einstein$-$Cartan$-$Sciama$-$Kibble theory of gravity naturally extends general relativity to include quantum-mechanical, intrinsic angular momentum of matter by equipping spacetime with torsion. Using the Einstein energy$-$momentum pseudotensor for the gravitational field in this theory, we show that the energy and momentum of the closed Universe are equal to zero. Since the positive energy from mass and motion of the observed matter in the Universe exceeds in magnitude the negative energy from gravity, the Universe must contain another form of matter whose energy is negative. This form, which cannot be composed from particles, might be the observed dark matter.</description>

      <title>Short-distance thermal phase structure of charged black holes in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05820v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Glavan and Lin's proposal of an effective four-dimensional Einstein--Gauss--Bonnet (4D-EGB) gravity framework yields predictions that differ from general relativity in some regimes. A range of black hole studies have offered insights into the dynamical and phenomenological aspects of this effective theory of gravity. In this work, the thermodynamics of a charged 4D-EGB black hole with Gauss--Bonnet (GB) coupling $\alpha$, characterized by mass $M$ and charge $Q$ in the non-extremal regime $M&gt;\sqrt{Q^2+\alpha}$ is investigated by combining a non-perturbative, quantum-gravity-inspired exponential correction to the entropy (quantified by $\eta$) with information-geometric diagnostics. Within a canonical ensemble (fixed $Q$) paradigm, thermodynamic stability regions and phase-transition-like features are identified as the black hole size tends toward extremality due to Hawking evaporation. The Ruppeiner metric is then constructed on the $(M,Q)$ state space and the associated thermodynamic curvature is evaluated to characterize the effective interaction signatures and its relation to critical behavior. In addition, an effective quantum-work quantity, defined from the free-energy landscape using Jarzynski equality, is evaluated as an additional probe of short-distance, near-extremal behavior. The results indicate that departures from the general-relativistic behavior are negligible for large black holes but can become relevant at small horizon scales. Specifically, on short-distance scales, the combined influence of $\alpha$ and $\eta$ can modify stability of the extremal black hole geometry and remnants within this thermodynamic model.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics Positivity Bound from 3-Form Black Holes and Inflation with Higher-Derivative Corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between the thermodynamics positivity bounds and slow-roll inflation within a framework governed by a 3-form gauge field. Starting from classical considerations, we derive an upper bound on the mass of extremal charged black holes in dS spacetime which constrains the admissible parameter space. To incorporate quantum gravity effects, we introduce higher-derivative corrections to the 3-form action and obtain additional bounds on these terms, ensuring consistency with swampland criteria. We further analyze these corrections from a thermodynamic perspective, confirming that the Wald entropy remains compatible with the classical extremality bound. Extending this setup to cosmological inflation, we examine the scalar dual of the 3-form in both large-field and small-field regimes. In the large-field limit, the potential acquires a Higgs-like structure that supports slow-roll inflation. In contrast, the small-field limit leads to an effective potential with an AdS minimum, rendering it inconsistent with the dS swampland constraints. Notably, we find that thermodynamic consistency can impose constraints more stringent than those derived from inflationary dynamics alone. These results underscore the utility of swampland-inspired principles in shaping viable models of early universe cosmology.</description>

      <title>Bright ring features and polarization structures in Kerr-Sen black hole images illuminated by radiatively inefficient accretion flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03857v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using general relativistic radiative transfer (GRRT) simulations, we investigate the bright ring features and polarization structures in images of the Kerr-Sen black hole associated with Sgr A*, as illuminated by 230 GHz thermal synchrotron emission from radiatively inefficient accretion flows (RIAF). Our findings reveal that an increase in the dilaton parameter leads to a shrinking of the bright ring, accompanied by enhancements in both its width and brightness. As the disk thickness grows, the bright ring's diameter and width both decrease. The brightness enhancement induced by the disk thickness is less prominent than that driven by the dilaton parameter. Comparing with the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observational data of SgrA*, we present the allowed ranges of black hole parameters, and find that effects of the disk thickness on the allowed parameter space are stronger than those of the observer's inclination. Furthermore, we analyze the coefficient $\beta_2$, associated with the two-fold rotational symmetry of the electric vector position angles (EVPA), to probe the polarization structure of the black hole images, and reveal that effects of the disk thickness on $\beta_2$ are much weaker than those from the dilaton parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.09270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the cosmological dynamics and predictions in the theory of warped massive gravity. This set-up postulates a five-dimensional ghost-free massive graviton with a brane-localized four-dimensional massive gravity potential, and has the virtue of raising the strong-coupling scale of the 4D theory. We identify two classes of models that lead to decoupled equations for the scale factor on the brane: one characterized by a particular choice of boundary conditions for the St\"uckelberg fields and one characterized by a special tuning between the coefficients of the 5D and 4D potentials. In the first case, we find interesting solutions including a cosmological bounce without the need of exotic matter. The second case leads to a modified Friedmann equation, and comparison with data shows the potential of the model to alleviate the Hubble tension.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of a neutron star near naked singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal disruption of a neutron star (NS) near a black hole (BH), and for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, near a naked singularity (NaS). For a BH with a mass greater than about $10 M_{\odot}$, the tidal disruption of NS should occur within the event horizon, and hence neither can the stellar material escape nor a distant observer observe the disruption. Since NaS does not have an event horizon, a significant portion of the NS's material can escape, and the tidal disruption can be observed by a distant observer. One could identify such an event from the observed emission from the disrupted NS's material and the decay of the light curve of the disruption event. The escape of a significant fraction of the NS's material may also have implications for the heavy elements in the universe. Moreover, observing such an event can be useful for confirming a NaS, probing its spacetime, and studying the motion of matter in such a geometry. This may help constrain the NS parameters and equation of state models. As a first step in this direction, we calculate here the tidal disruption radius and other parameters for a specific type (Joshi-Malafarina-Narayan type 1) of NaS and compare our results with observations.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the prospects for detecting a parity-violating gravitational-wave background (GWB) with third-generation ground-based detector networks. We focus on a network consisting of one Einstein Telescope (ET) and two Cosmic Explorer (CE) detectors. In our analysis we vary the ET design, detector orientations, and arm lengths to assess the impact of geometry and scale on detection capabilities. We find that, among the configurations studied, networks with a $15$ km triangular ET design provide the strongest parity-violation constraining power, followed by networks with an L-shaped ET design, while networks with $10$ km triangular ET configurations are the least sensitive. Under current bounds, ET alone cannot confidently detect parity violation.</description>

      <title>Constants of motion in gravitational self-force theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synergies between self-force theory and other approaches to the gravitational two-body problem have traditionally relied on calculations of gauge-invariant observables as functions of orbital frequencies. However, in self-force theory one can also define a complete set of constants of motion: energy, azimuthal angular momentum, and radial and polar actions. Here we outline how directly utilizing these constants allows for more straightforward comparisons and hybridizations across the parameter space, as well as more streamlined waveform generation through flux-balance laws. Restricting to the case of nonspinning binaries and first order in self-force, we compute the constants of motion and the corrections to fundamental frequencies numerically as well as analytically (to 9PN in a post-Newtonian expansion), establishing consistency with the highest-order (4PN) results available from post-Newtonian theory. We also apply the results to identify the perturbed locations of special curves in the parameter space: circular orbits and the separatrix between bound and plunging orbits.</description>

      <title>Balance flux laws beyond general relativity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07091v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Balance flux laws of asymptotic symmetries in general relativity provide fully non-perturbative constraint equations on gravitational strain. They have proven useful for constructing numerical gravitational waveforms and for characterizing gravitational memory. As the precision of current and future detectors continues to improve, such constraints become increasingly important for high-precision tests of gravity, including searches for deviations from general relativity. This motivates a systematic understanding of analogous balance laws in theories beyond general relativity. In this work, we investigate the existence and structure of flux laws at null infinity in diffeomorphism-invariant extensions of general relativity. Our analysis is based on the covariant phase space formalism and the definition of conserved quantities, as presented by Wald and Zoupas. For a particularly relevant class of Horndeski theories, we derive a general expression for the flux and formulate the corresponding balance equation via the associated non-conserved charges. We cross-check our general results by comparing them with previous studies of Brans-Dicke gravity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the employed methods extend straightforwardly to a broader class of diffeomorphism-invariant theories. The null part of the resulting flux laws associated with null memory is compared with and validated against the alternative derivation based on the Isaacson approach to gravitational radiation. Beyond the specific results obtained, this work is intended to serve as a practical guide for computing balance laws in generic diffeomorphism-invariant theories of gravity and paves the way for an in-depth comparison between the Isaacson approach and the covariant phase space formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15830v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we approach certain black hole issues, including remnants, by providing a statistical description based on the weak gravity conjecture in the swampland program. Inspired by the Pauli exclusion principle in the context of the Fermi sphere, we derive an inequality which can be exploited to verify the instability manifestation of non-supersymmetric four dimensional black holes via a characteristic function. For several species, we show that this function is in agreement with the weak gravity swampland conjecture. Then, we deal with the cutoff issue as an interval estimation problem by putting an upper bound on the black hole mass scale matching with certain results reported in the literature. Using the developed formalism for the proposed instability scenarios, we provide a suppression mechanism to the remnant production rate. Furthermore, we reconsider the stability study of the Reissner-Nordstrom black holes. Among others, we show that the proposed instabilities prohibit naked singularity behaviors</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction on the Straight-Line Motion of a Point Charge accelerated by a constant applied Electric Field in an Electromagnetic Bopp-Land\'e-Thomas-Podolsky vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08799v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem of standard Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges is pathological, standing in contrast to Bopp--Land\'e--Thomas--Podolsky (BLTP) electrodynamics where it is in fact well-defined and calculable, as reported in a previous publication. To demonstrate the viability of BLTP electrodynamics, we consider the BLTP analogue of the radiation reaction of a classical point charge accelerated from rest by a static homogeneous capacitor plate field, and calculate it up to $O(\varkappa^4)$ in a formal expansion about $\varkappa=0$ in powers of $\varkappa$, Bopp's reciprocal length, a new electrodynamics parameter introduced by BLTP theory. In a paper by Carley and Kiessling (arXiv:2303.01720 [physics.class-ph]) the radiation-reaction corrections to test-particle motion were explicitly computed to $O(\varkappa^3)$, the first non-vanishing order. In this article a crucial question regarding this ``small-$\varkappa$'' expansion, raised by Carley and Kiessling, is answered as follows: The motions computed with terms $O(\varkappa^3)$ included are mathematically accurate approximations to {physically reasonable} solutions of the actual BLTP initial value problem for short times $t$, viz. when $\varkappa c t \ll 1$, where $c$ is the speed of light in vacuo, but their unphysical behavior over {much} longer times does not accurately approximate the actual BLTP solutions even when the dimensionless parameter $\varkappa e^2 / |m_b| c^2 \ll 1$, where $e$ is the elementary charge and $m_b$ the bare rest mass of the electron. This has the important implication that BLTP electrodynamics remains a viable contender for an accurate classical electrodynamics with point charges that does not suffer from the infinite self-interaction problems of textbook Lorentz electrodynamics with point charges.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.</description>

      <title>From Dark Radiation to Dark Energy: Unified Cosmological Evolution in K-essence Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.25088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of Unified Dark Matter (UDM) models based on generalized K-essence, where a single scalar field with non-canonical kinetic terms accounts for dark radiation, dark matter, and dark energy. Starting from the purely kinetic Lagrangian proposed by Scherrer (2004), we extend the analysis to quadratic and exponential scalar potentials and explore their phenomenology. All models are implemented in a modified version of \texttt{Hi\_CLASS} and confronted with data from \textit{Planck} 2018, DESI DR1, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The scenarios reproduce the full sequence of cosmic epochs: an early radiation-like phase, a matter-dominated era, and late-time accelerated expansion. The new models predict slightly higher values of the Hubble constant compared to $\Lambda$CDM, thereby partially alleviating the respective tensions from $\sim 4.4 \sigma$ to $\sim 3.4 \sigma$. The quadratic potential requires an ultralight mass that makes it effectively indistinguishable from the Scherrer solution. Overall, generalized K-essence provides a minimal and observationally viable realization of UDM, offering a unified description of the dark sector with distinctive signatures in both early- and late-time cosmology.</description>

      <title>On Gauge-Invariant Entire-Function Regulators and UV Finiteness in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory</title>

Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>Probing a minimal dark gauge sector via microlensing of compact dark objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00701v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal Dark Standard Model (DSM) consisting of a single spin-0 particle with dark $U(1)$ gauge symmetry, and completely decoupled from the visible sector. Characterized only by the scalar mass $\mu$ and the dark charge $q$, this framework naturally gives rise to a rich phenomenology, including stable solitonic configurations that behave as dark "mini-MACHOs". We numerically build and evolve these gauged scalar-field solitons, derive their mass-radius relations, and identify a critical charge beyond which no gravitationally bound configurations exist. By combining these results with microlensing surveys that exclude compact objects heavier than the asteroid-mass scale ($M\lesssim 10^{-11}M_\odot$), we obtain the constraint $\mu\gtrsim 10\,\rm eV$ for viable configurations, depending on $q$. Our results represent a step forward in showing that purely gravitational observations can constrain the internal parameters of a dark gauge sector, and provide a framework for exploring broader DSM scenarios through future probes such as gravitational wave detections.</description>

      <title>Highest-weight truncation, graded EFT structure, and renormalization of black hole Love numbers</title>

Abstract: The static tidal Love numbers of four-dimensional black holes vanish identically, unlike their nontrivial dynamical response at finite frequency. Recent work has provided three complementary descriptions of this phenomenon: an emergent $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ organization of static near-zone perturbations, a graded logarithmic and multi-zeta structure in Shell Effective Field Theory (Shell EFT), and an on-shell matching framework based on gravitational Raman scattering with renormalization group (RG) running. We show that these features arise from a common near-zone truncation mechanism. For a massless scalar field, horizon regularity selects a unique static solution forming a highest-weight-type representation, truncating the hypergeometric solution to a finite polynomial and eliminating the independent decaying branch at large radius. This excludes a static Wilson coefficient in the effective theory. We demonstrate that the same truncation operates in the static Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations for four-dimensional Schwarzschild black holes. Analytic continuation of the horizon-regular solution to small frequency via the Coulomb-hypergeometric or Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalisms preserves this truncation as an anchoring condition for the renormalized angular momentum parameter. The resulting low-frequency expansion is controlled by Gamma and hypergeometric functions, generating a graded algebra of logarithms and odd Riemann zeta values. Within this structure no invariant of negative weight exists in the static sector, so the vanishing of the static Love number follows as a structural consequence. This explains the ``zero-sum'' rule of Shell EFT and why the self-induced RG flow in gravitational Raman scattering cannot generate a static invariant.</description>

      <title>Is Quadratic Gravity ghost free because the ghost is only virtual?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.20047</link>

Abstract: In \cite{salvio} a prescription for calculating the correlation functions in Quadratic Gravity \cite{stelle1}-\cite{stelle2} was presented. This procedure does not enter in conflict with unitarity The Gauss-Ostrogradsky method for higher order theories defines two momentum densities $P_1$ and $P_2$ and two coordinate densities $Q_1$ and $Q_2$, one pair is standard, the other ghost like. The approach in \cite{salvio} involves the continuation $P_2\to i P_2$ and $Q_2\to i Q_2$ of the ghost variables. In the present work, following \cite{yomismo}, the LSZ rules are derived, but with a formalism adapted to full quartic or higher order theories. The hypothesis for quantization are that $[Q_1, Q_2]=\text{"gauge terms"}$, $[P_1, P_2]=\text{"gauge terms"}$ and $[P_1, Q_1]=iI+\text{"gauge terms"}$. This alone leads to the conclusion that $[P_2, Q_2]=-iI+\text{"gauge terms"}$, therefore this last pair of variables is ghost like. The graviton contains a massless mode, which is the standard graviton, plus two massive modes with masses $m_2$ and $m_3$. The third mode is usually interpreted as a ghost in the literature \cite{stelle2}. Here it is shown that, even after making the continuation $P_2\to i P_2$ and $Q_2\to i Q_2$, the creation and annihilation operators for this mode commute, the third mode does not appear as a free wave. This does not invalidate the model. The effective action $\Gamma$ can be calculated following \cite{stelle1}, and can be constrained by the Slavnov-Taylor identities \cite{Slavnov}-\cite{Taylor}, and the scattering rules may be worked out consequently.</description>
