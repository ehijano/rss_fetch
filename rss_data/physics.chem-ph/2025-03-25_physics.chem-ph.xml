      <title>An atomistic approach for modeling of polarizability and Raman scattering of water clusters and liquid water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a framework for atomistic modeling of electronic polarizability to predict the Raman spectra of hydrogen-bonded clusters and liquids from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The total polarizability of the system is assumed to arise from contributions of both the monomer unit and intermolecular interactions. The generalized bond-polarizability model (GBPM), inspired by the classic bond-polarizability model, effectively describes the electronic polarizability of a monomer. To account for the electronic polarizability arising from intermolecular interactions, we use a basis set of rapidly decaying functions of interatomic distances. We apply this model to calculate the electronic polarizability and Raman spectra of water clusters ((H2O)r, r = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) and liquid water. The computational results are compared with the results of quantum-mechanical calculations for clusters and to experimental data for the liquid. It is demonstrated that this simple and physically motivated model, which relies on a small number of parameters, performs well for clusters at both low and high temperatures, capturing strong anharmonic effects. Moreover, its high transferability suggests its applicability to other water clusters. These results suggest that a hierarchical approach based on the Jacob's ladder of increasingly sophisticated and accurate atomistic polarizability models incorporating additional effects can be used for efficient modeling of Raman spectra from MD simulations of clusters, liquids and solids.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Chemical Reactions in Rarefied Gas Flows by the Kinetic Fokker-Planck Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for modeling chemical reactions within the particle-based Fokker-Planck framework for gas flow simulations which conserves mass, momentum, and energy while retaining the performance advantages of the Fokker-Planck approach over the Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method in areas of high density. We show an application of the approach to recombination and exchange reactions, discuss verification results, and demonstrate performance advantages when compared to DSMC for applications in low Knudsen number regimes. The developed method can be applied to simulation of flows in the continuum and transitional regimes, as well as to multi-scale coupled Fokker-Planck-DSMC simulations.</description>

      <title>Long-term excitation energy transfer predicted by a modified convolutional neural networks in the FMO complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17430v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In machine learning (ML), the risk of recursive strategies overfitting historical data has driven the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in simulating quantum dissipative dynamics. In this work, we propose an efficient CNNs scheme incorporating novel redundant time-functions to predict 100 picosecond (ps) excitation energy transfer (EET) in Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complexes, in which the original time $t$ is normalized by mapping it to the [0, 1] range, allowing different functions focus on distinct time intervals, thereby effectively capturing the multi-timescale characteristics of EET dynamics. This method simplifies optimization and enhances learning efficiency, and demonstrate the superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency of our approach in predicting quantum dissipative dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multistate Density Functional Theory for Local and Charge-Transfer Tripdoublet States from Triplet-Free Radical Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between excited states of a closed-shell chromophore and a nearby free radical species gives rise to spin-coupled doublet states, namely singdoublet and tripdoublet, as well as a quartet state. This coupling facilitates transitions that are otherwise spin-forbidden, thereby enhancing intersystem crossing and influencing luminescence and non-radiative decay pathways. In this chapter, we explore these interactions using multistate density functional theory (MSDFT). By employing a minimal active space (MAS) comprising just ten determinant configurations, MSDFT effectively captures local and charge-transfer excitations with inclusion of correlation effects. MSDFT extends the Hohenberg-Kohn density functional theory from the ground state to encompass all electronic states, underscoring the potential for developing computationally efficient methods to study excited states. Numerical results demonstrate that MSDFT accurately reproduces both qualitative trends and quantitative excited-state energies, in accord with previous studies using extended multistate complete-active-space second-order perturbation theory (XMS-CASPT2). The work explores energy changes along a reaction path from the D_0/D_1 minimum energy crossing intersection to the D_2/D_3 crossing in the exciplex formed by 10-methylphenothiazine and a dicarboximide electron acceptor linked to the stable free radical 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO).</description>

      <title>Benchmark Dataset for Pore-Scale CO2-Water Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately capturing the complex interaction between CO2 and water in porous media at the pore scale is essential for various geoscience applications, including carbon capture and storage (CCS). We introduce a comprehensive dataset generated from high-fidelity numerical simulations to capture the intricate interaction between CO2 and water at the pore scale. The dataset consists of 624 2D samples, each of size 512x512 with a resolution of 35 {\mu}m, covering 100 time steps under a constant CO2 injection rate. It includes various levels of heterogeneity, represented by different grain sizes with random variation in spacing, offering a robust testbed for developing predictive models. This dataset provides high-resolution temporal and spatial information crucial for benchmarking machine learning models.</description>

      <title>Surface-enhanced Raman scattering and density functional theory study of selected-lanthanide-citrate complexes (lanthanide: La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we combined the surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) with density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the SERS spectra of lanthanide (Ln)-citrate complexes (Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, and Gd) under 488, 532, and 660 nm laser excitations. Detailed vibrational analysis and peak assignments were performed based on SERS spectra simulated using an optimized DFT setting, in which small-core effective core potentials (ECPs) in the def2-tzvpd basis set were replaced by large-core ECPs. Characteristic SERS peaks appeared at 1065, 1315, and 1485 cm-1 were assigned to the {\gamma}(CH2)+v(C-O{\ldots}Ln), vsym(COO-)+{\gamma}(CH2), and vasym(COO-)+{\gamma}(CH2) vibrational bands, respectively. SERS intensity ratios were obtained by normalizing the peak intensity I near 1065 or 1485 cm-1 to that near 1315 cm-1. I1065/I1315 depended solely on the type of Ln3+ ion and was independent of the excitation wavelength. In contrast, I1485/I1315 increased with decreasing excitation wavelength, indicating additional enhancement by charge-transfer. Additionally, as the number of unpaired 4f electrons increased, Ln3+ in the coordination region attracted oxygen negative charges more strongly, reducing the electric dipole moment of the C-O bond and altering its symmetry.</description>

      <title>Predicting performance-related properties of refrigerant based on tailored small-molecule functional group contribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As current group contribution (GC) methods are mostly proposed for a wide size-range of molecules, applying them to property prediction of small refrigerant molecules could lead to unacceptable errors. In this sense, for the design of novel refrigerants and refrigeration systems, tailoring GC-based models specifically fitted to refrigerant molecules is of great interest. In this work, databases of potential refrigerant molecules are first collected, focusing on five key properties related to the operational efficiency of refrigeration systems, namely normal boiling point, critical temperature, critical pressure, enthalpy of vaporization, and acentric factor. Based on tailored small-molecule groups, the GC method is combined with machine learning (ML) to model these performance-related properties. Following the development of GC-ML models, their performance is analyzed to highlight the potential group-to-property contributions. Additionally, the refrigerant property databases are extended internally and externally, based on which examples are presented to highlight the significance of the developed models.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials with Global Charge Redistribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) provide a computationally efficient alternative to quantum mechanical simulations for predicting material properties. Message-passing graph neural networks, commonly used in these MLIPs, rely on local descriptor-based symmetry functions to model atomic interactions. However, such local descriptor-based approaches struggle with systems exhibiting long-range interactions, charge transfer, and compositional heterogeneity. In this work, we develop a new equivariant MLIP incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions through explicit treatment of electronic degrees of freedom, specifically global charge distribution within the system. This is achieved using a charge equilibration scheme based on predicted atomic electronegativities. We systematically evaluate our model across a range of benchmark periodic and non-periodic datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both short-range equivariant and long-range invariant MLIPs in energy and force predictions. Our approach enables more accurate and efficient simulations of systems with long-range interactions and charge heterogeneity, expanding the applicability of MLIPs in computational materials science.</description>

      <title>Ionic Liquid Molecular Dynamics Simulation with Machine Learning Force Fields: DPMD and MACE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning force fields (MLFFs) are gaining attention as an alternative to classical force fields (FFs) by using deep learning models trained on density functional theory (DFT) data to improve interatomic potential accuracy. In this study, we develop and apply MLFFs for ionic liquids (ILs), specifically PYR14BF4 and LiTFSI/PYR14TFSI, using two different MLFF frameworks: DeePMD (DPMD) and MACE. We find that high-quality training datasets are crucial, especially including both equilibrated (EQ) and non-equilibrated (nEQ) structures, to build reliable MLFFs. Both DPMD and MACE MLFFs show good accuracy in force and energy predictions, but MACE performs better in predicting IL density and diffusion. We also analyze molecular configurations from our trained MACE MLFF and notice differences compared to pre-trained MACE models like MPA-0 and OMAT-0. Our results suggest that careful dataset preparation and fine-tuning are necessary to obtain reliable MLFF-based MD simulations for ILs.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the relaxation dynamics of Uracil: insights from time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a study of the electronic and nuclear relaxation dynamics of the photoexcited RNA base uracil in the gas phase, using time-resolved core level photoelectron spectroscopy together with high level calculations. The dynamics was investigated by trajectory surface-hopping calculations, and the core ionization energies were calculated for geometries sampled from these. The molecule was excited by a UV laser and dynamics was probed on the oxygen, nitrogen and carbon site by core electron spectroscopy. Assuming a particular model, we find that the initially excited $S_2(\pi\pi^*)$ state of uracil decays with a time constant of 17 $\pm$ 4 fs to the ground state directly, or to the $S_1(n\pi^*)$ state via internal conversion. We find no evidence that the $S_1(n\pi^*)$ state decays to the ground state by internal conversion; instead it decays to triplet states with a time constant of 1.6 $\pm$ 0.4 ps. Oscillations of the $S_1(n\pi^*)$ state O 1s intensity as a function of time correlate with those of calculated C4=O8 and C5=C6 bond lengths, which undergo a sudden expansion following the initial $\pi \to \pi^*$ excitation. We also observe oscillations in the mean energy of the main line (core ionized ionic state), which we tentatively assign to dynamics of the hot ground state. Our calculations support our interpretation of the data, and provide detailed insight into the relaxation processes of uracil.</description>

      <title>Faster Heat Transfer Clarifies the Unexpected Twist in the Simultaneous Freezing of Hot versus Cold Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water exhibits many unique properties compared to other liquids, with some of these explained and others remaining enigmatic. Among them, it was proposed and extensively debated that hot water would freeze faster than cold. Numerous studies have demonstrated the difficulty of successfully elucidating this effect, making explanations surrounding this phenomenon highly controversial. Here, we demonstrate that when two cups filled with cold and hot water are introduced simultaneously in a freezer saturated with ice-nucleating agents, the hot sample freezes faster and to a greater depth than the cold sample, particularly when the initial temperature difference is high. On the other hand, against some previous beliefs, the time to onset of crystallization is always and logically retarded for hotter samples. In these conditions, where supercooling is eliminated, and temperature recording is perfectly controlled, robust experiments follow the same trend, whether hot versus room temperature samples or RT versus cold samples are tested. Differences in heat transfer are proposed and simulated to explain such divergence in freezing time in compliance with Newton law. These results resolve the mystery surrounding the experimental Mpemba effect without questioning the burgeoning research on related effects.</description>

      <title>Convolutional neural network approach to ion Coulomb crystal image analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) methodology to analyse fluorescence images of calcium-ion Coulomb crystals in the gas phase. A transfer-learning approach is adopted using the publicly available RESNET50 model. It is demonstrated that by training the neural network on around 500,000 simulated images, we are able to determine ion-numbers not only for a verification set of 100,000 simulated images, but also for experimental calcium-ion images from two different laboratories using a wide range of ion-trap parameters. Absolute ion numbers in the crystal were determined for the experimental data with a percentage error of approximately 10%. This analysis can be performed in a few seconds for an individual crystal image, and therefore the method enables the objective, and efficient, analysis of such images in real time, thereby facilitating time-dependent kinetic measurements on ion-molecule chemistry. The approach adopted also shows promising performance for identifying Ca+ ion numbers in images of mixed-species crystals.</description>

      <title>Quantum ATK Analysis and Detection of Toxic Gases Nitrogen Oxide using Pristine, Defective, and Doped Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While doping and defects are often considered detrimental to material performance, at the nanoscale, modifications are needed to create novel properties beneficial for device applications. In this work, we focus on optimizing graphene as a gas sensor for detecting toxic gases such as nitrogen oxide (NO). The study explores the effects of doping graphene sheets with transition metals (Cu, Au, Pt) and introducing a single vacancy (SV) defect at the center of the sheet. Pristine, defected, and doped graphene sheets are systematically analyzed as potential sensing materials for NO gas detection. The investigation includes the design of graphene-based devices and the evaluation of their electrical I-V characteristics under different configurations. The sensing mechanism is examined through parameters such as electronic properties, charge transfer, adsorption energy, electrical characteristics (I-V), sensitivity, and the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach. The results indicate that defected graphene demonstrates superior gas adsorption performance, with an adsorption energy of 8.316 eV and a sensitivity of 51.1%, outperforming both pristine and doped graphene. These findings establish defected graphene as a promising candidate for NO gas sensing applications, while doped graphene shows moderate sensing potential.</description>

      <title>Stereological 3D modeling of nano-scale catalyst particles using TEM projections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17437v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catalysis, particularly heterogeneous catalysis, is crucial in the chemical industry and energy storage. Approximately 80% of all chemical products produced by heterogeneous catalysis are produced by solid catalysts, which are essential for the synthesizing of ammonia, methanol, and hydrocarbons. Despite extensive use, challenges in catalyst development remain, including enhancing selectivity, stability, and activity. These effective properties are influenced by the nanoscale morphology of the catalysts, whereby the size of the nanoparticles is only one key descriptor. To investigate the relationship between nanoparticle morphology and catalytic performance, a comprehensive 3D analysis of nano-scale catalyst particles is necessary. However, traditional imaging techniques for a representative recording of this size range, such as transmission electron microscopy (TEM), are mostly limited to 2D. Thus, in the present paper, a stochastic 3D model is developed for a data-driven analysis of the nanostructure of catalyst particles. The calibration of this model is achieved using 2D TEM data from two different length scales, allowing for a statistically representative 3D modeling of catalyst particles. Furthermore, digital twins of catalyst particles can be drawn for the stochastic 3D model for virtual materials testing, enhancing the understanding of the relationship between catalyst nanostructure and performance.</description>

      <title>Enzyme as Maxwell's Demon: Steady-state Deviation from Chemical Equilibrium by Enhanced Enzyme Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17584v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enzymes are known to increase their diffusion coefficient when catalyzing reactions, a phenomenon termed enhanced enzyme diffusion (EED). While EED has been shown to bias the spatial distribution of enzymes, its effects on reaction outcomes remain unclear. Here, we show that EED can deviate the steady-state concentrations of reactants away from chemical equilibrium. This deviation results from biasing the reaction probability using information about the preceding reaction obtained via EED. Our results imply that various enzymes can act as Maxwell's demon, reducing entropy using information.</description>

      <title>Individual and cooperative superexchange enhancement in cuprates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is now widely accepted that the antiferromagnetic coupling within high temperature superconductors strongly exhibits a profound correlation with the upper limit of superconducting transition temperature these materials can reach. Thus, accurately calculating the positive and negative mechanisms that influence magnetic coupling in specific materials is crucial for the exploration of superconductivity at higher temperatures. Nevertheless, it is notoriously difficult to establish a complete description of electron correlations employing ab initio theories because of the large number of orbitals involved. In this study, we tackle the challenge of achieving high-level ab initio wave function theory calculations, which allow an explicit treatment of electron correlations associated with a large number of high-energy orbitals. We elucidate the atomic-shell-wise contributions to the superexchange coupling in the lanthanum cuprate, including individual effects of high-energy orbitals (Cu 4d, 5d, 4f, 5p) and cooperative effects between the core and these high-energy orbitals. Specifically, the prominent contributions from Cu 4d, 5d, 4f and 5p give rise to a rich collection of previously unexamined superexchange channels. We propose a p-d-f model to universally account for the contributions of high-energy orbitals at copper sites. Our calculations and physical rationalizations offer a more robust theoretical foundation for investigating cuprate-type high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>Review of the Electrochemical Double Layer Theory and Its Applications in Battery Electrode Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interface plays a critical role in electrochemical systems, driving the development of various theories to investigate properties at nanoscale and microscale levels, including the electrictrochemical double layer (EDL) theory and continuum theory. However, the application of EDL theory within the realm of battery electrode materials has not been clearly defined according to material type. The diverse range of materials and their intricate interactions with interface theories often lead to misunderstandings. This review meticulously outlines the origins and principles of the EDL theory. Additionally, it categorizes battery electrode materials into two main groups: semiconductors and conductors. A comprehensive examination is presented on the implementation of EDL and other interface theories, accompanied by a comparative evaluation of the fundamental models and experiments described. The review also explores the potential advancements of EDL and other interface theories, as well as their application in electrode materials. This exhaustive review serves as an invaluable resource for scholars in electrochemistry and materials science, aiding in their understanding of interface theories, their scope of applicability, and the integration of these theories with practical experimental approaches.</description>

      <title>Generalized spheroidal wave equation for real and complex valued parameters. An algorithm based on the analytic derivatives for the eigenvalues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18280v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach for computations of eigenvalues of the generalized spheroidal wave equations. The novelty of the present method is in the use of the analytical derivatives of the eigenvalues to minimize losses in accuracy. The derivatives are constructed {in the form of three-term recurrent relations} within the method of continued fractions associated with the corresponding spheroidal wave equation. Very accurate results for the eigenvalues are obtained for a wide range of the parameters of the problem. As an illustrative example, the electronic energies and the separation constants are computed for various electronic states and geometries of selected ($\rm{H}_2^{+}$, $\rm{HeH}^{2+}$, and $\rm{BH}^{5+}$) quasimolecular systems. We also presented the solutions of the eigenvalues for complex parameters of the generalized spheroidal wave equations. The agreement between the obtained results and the results of other authors is discussed.</description>

      <title>In-vivo real-time 13C-MRSI without polarizer on site: across cities transportable hyperpolarization using UV-induced labile radicals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hyperpolarized 13C Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (HP 13C-MRSI) has the potential to greatly improve diagnostic radiology thanks to its unique capability to detect, noninvasively, a wide range of diseases entailing aberrant metabolism. Nevertheless, it struggles to enter everyday clinical practice as an alternative and/or complement to Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Because of the minute-long hyperpolarization lifetime of the MR HP contrast agents, one of the reasons is, differently from PET, the need and financial burden to have the polarizing machine on site and, as close as possible to the MR scanner. In this work, we show that dDNP samples prepared with UV-induced labile radicals can bridge the technical gap with PET and provide MRI facilities with hours-long relaxing HP contrast agents. As a demonstration, we show the first across cities HP 13C-MRSI experiment in vivo and on a clinical scanner for a perfusion/angiography ([1-13C]HP001) and a metabolic ([U-13C, d7]glucose) contrast agent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12232v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predicting future physical behavior from limited theoretical simulation data is an emerging research paradigm driven by the integration of artificial intelligence and quantum physics. In this work, charge transport (CT) behavior was predicted over extended time scales using a deep learning model-the long short-term memory (LSTM) network with an error-threshold training method-in the photosystem II reaction center (PSII-RC). Theoretical simulation data within 8 fs were used to train the modified LSTM network, yielding distinct predictions with differences on the order of $10^{-4}$ over prolonged periods compared to the training set collection time. The results highlight the potential of LSTM to uncover the underlying physics governing CT beyond conventional quantum physical methods. These findings warrant further investigation to fully explore the scope and efficacy of LSTM in advancing our understanding of photosynthesis at the molecular scale.</description>

      <title>Fast and flexible long-range models for atomistic machine learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03281v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most atomistic machine learning (ML) models rely on a locality ansatz, and decompose the energy into a sum of short-ranged, atom-centered contributions. This leads to clear limitations when trying to describe problems that are dominated by long-range physical effects - most notably electrostatics. Many approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, but efforts to make them efficient and widely available are hampered by the need to incorporate an ad hoc implementation of methods to treat long-range interactions. We develop a framework aiming to bring some of the established algorithms to evaluate non-bonded interactions - including Ewald summation, classical particle-mesh Ewald (PME), and particle-particle/particle-mesh (P3M) Ewald - into atomistic ML. We provide a reference implementation for pyTorch as well as an experimental one for JAX. Beyond Coulomb and more general long-range potentials, we introduce purified descriptors which disregard the immediate neighborhood of each atom, and are more suitable for general long-ranged ML applications. Our implementations are fast, feature-rich, and modular: They provide an accurate evaluation of physical long-range forces that can be used in the construction of (semi)empirical baseline potentials; they exploit the availability of automatic differentiation to seamlessly combine long-range models with conventional, local ML schemes; and they are sufficiently flexible to implement more complex architectures that use physical interactions as building blocks. We benchmark and demonstrate our torch-pme and jax-pme libraries to perform molecular dynamics simulations, to train ML potentials, and to evaluate long-range equivariant descriptors of atomic structures.</description>

      <title>Wavepacket and Reduced-Density Approaches for High-Dimensional Quantum Dynamics: Application to the Nonlinear Spectroscopy of Asymmetrical Light-Harvesting Building Blocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitation-energy transfer (EET) and relaxation in an optically excited building block of poly(phenylene ethynylene) (PPE) dendrimers are simulated using wavepackets with the multilayer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH) method and reduced-density matrices with the hierachical equations of motion (HEOM) approach. The dynamics of the ultrafast electronic funneling between the first two excited electronic states in the asymmetrically meta-substituted PPE oligomer with two rings on one branch and three rings on the other side, with a shared ring in between, is treated with 93-dimensional ab initio vibronic-coupling Hamiltonian (VCH) models, either linear or with bilinear and quadratic terms. The linear VCH model is also used to calibrate an open quantum system that falls in a computationally demanding non-perturbative non-Markovian regime. The linear-response absorption and emission spectra are simulated with both the ML-MCTDH and HEOM methods. The latter is further used to explore the nonlinear regime towards two-dimensional (2D) spectroscopy. We illustrate how a minimal VCH model with the two main active bright states and the impulsive-pulse limit in third-order response theory may provide at lower cost polarization-sensitive time-resolved signals that monitor the early EET dynamics. We also confirm the essential role played by the high-frequency acetylenic and quinoidal vibrational modes.</description>

      <title>Constructing and explaining machine learning models for chemistry: example of the exploration and design of boron-based Lewis acids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01576v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of machine learning (ML) into chemistry offers transformative potential in the design of molecules with targeted properties. However, the focus has often been on creating highly efficient predictive models, sometimes at the expense of interpretability. In this study, we leverage explainable AI techniques to explore the rational design of boron-based Lewis acids, which play a pivotal role in organic reactions due to their electron-ccepting properties. Using Fluoride Ion Affinity as a proxy for Lewis acidity, we developed interpretable ML models based on chemically meaningful descriptors, including ab initio computed features and substituent-based parameters derived from the Hammett linear free-energy relationship. By constraining the chemical space to well-defined molecular scaffolds, we achieved highly accurate predictions (mean absolute error &lt; 6 kJ/mol), surpassing conventional black-box deep learning models in low-data regimes. Interpretability analyses of the models shed light on the origin of Lewis acidity in these compounds and identified actionable levers to modulate it through the nature and positioning of substituents on the molecular scaffold. This work bridges ML and chemist's way of thinking, demonstrating how explainable models can inspire molecular design and enhance scientific understanding of chemical reactivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Force field-based molecular dynamics simulations are customarily carried out by constraining internal degrees of freedom. The de facto state-of-the-art algorithms for this purpose, SHAKE, LINCS and P-LINCS, converge slowly, impeding high-accuracy calculations and limiting the realism of simulations. Furthermore, LINCS and P-LINCS cannot handle general angular constraints, which restricts increasing the time step.
  In this paper, we introduce ILVES, a set of parallel algorithms that converge so rapidly that it is now practical to solve bond length and associated angular constraint equations as accurately as the hardware will allow. We have integrated our work into Gromacs and our analysis demonstrates that, in most cases, our software is superior to the state-of-the-art. We anticipate that ILVES will allow for an increase in the time step, thus accelerating contemporary calculations by a factor of at least 2. This will allow the scientific community to increase the range of phenomena that can therefore be simulated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of excitons that conjugated polymers can support at any one time underpins their optoelectronic performance in light emitting diodes and as laser gain media, as it sets a natural limit on exciton density. Here we have measured the time-resolved photon statistics of single chains of polyfluorene to extract the absolute number of independent emitting sites present and its time dependence. We find that after 100 ps each chain can only support 1 or 2 independent excitons, and that even at the earliest times this number rises only to 4, suggesting a high degree of electronic coupling between chromophores that facilitates efficient exciton-exciton annihilation. In circumstances where a low density of low-energy sites is present, annihilation between them still dominates. The results indicate that achieving high exciton densities in conjugated polymers is difficult, and in applications where it is desirable new strategies should be devised to control exciton-exciton annihilation.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao bound and absolute sensitivity in chemical reaction networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical reaction networks (CRN) comprise an important class of models to understand biological functions such as cellular information processing, the robustness and control of metabolic pathways, circadian rhythms, and many more. However, any CRN describing a certain function does not act in isolation but is a part of a much larger network and as such is constantly subject to external changes. In [Shinar, Alon, and Feinberg. "Sensitivity and robustness in chemical reaction networks." SIAM J App Math (2009): 977-998.], the responses of CRN to changes in the linear conserved quantities, called sensitivities, were studied in and the question of how to construct absolute, i.e., basis-independent, sensitivities was raised. In this article, by applying information geometric methods, such a construction is provided. The idea is to track how concentration changes in a particular chemical propagate to changes of all concentrations within a steady state. This is encoded in the matrix of absolute sensitivities. As the main technical tool, a multivariate Cramer-Rao bound for CRN is proven, which is based on the the analogy between quasi-thermostatic steady states and the exponential family of probability distributions. This leads to a linear algebraic characterization of the matrix of absolute sensitivities for quasi-thermostatic CRN. As an example, the core module of the IDHKP-IDH glyoxylate bypass regulation system is analyzed analytically and numerically by extensive random sampling of the concentration space. The experimentally known findings for the robustness of the IDH enzyme are confirmed and a hidden symmetry at the level of distributions is revealed, providing a blueprint for the analysis of the robustness properties of CRNs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS) is a powerful tool to evaluate the structure of multi-component systems by decomposing scattering intensities $I$ measured with different scattering contrasts into partial scattering functions $S$ of self- and cross-correlations between components. The measured $I$ contains a measurement error, $\Delta I$, and $\Delta I$ results in an uncertainty of partial scattering functions, $\Delta S$. However, the error propagation from $\Delta I$ to $\Delta S$ has not been quantitatively clarified. In this work, we have established deterministic and statistical approaches to determine $\Delta S$ from $\Delta I$. We have applied the two methods to (i) computational data of a core-shell sphere and experimental CV-SANS data of (ii) clay/polyethylene glycol (PEG) aqueous solutions and (iii) polyrotaxane solutions, and have successfully estimated the errors of \(S\). The quantitative error estimation of \(S\) offers us a strategy to optimize the combination of scattering contrasts to minimize error propagation.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the spectral properties of the Steklov problem for the modified Helmholtz equation $(p-\Delta) u = 0$ in the exterior of a compact set, for which the positive parameter $p$ ensures exponential decay of the Steklov eigenfunctions at infinity. We obtain the small-$p$ asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions and discuss their features for different space dimensions. These results find immediate applications to the theory of stochastic processes and unveil the long-time asymptotic behavior of probability densities of various first-passage times in exterior domains. Theoretical results are validated by solving the exterior Steklov problem by a finite-element method with a transparent boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Stochastic density functional theory for ions in a polar solvent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the theoretical description of electrical noise and fluctuation-induced effects in electrolytes has gained a renewed interest, enabled by stochastic field theories like stochastic density functional theory (SDFT). Such models, however, treat solvents implicitly, ignoring their generally polar nature. In the present study, starting from microscopic principles, we derive a fully explicit SDFT theory that applies to ions in a polar solvent. These equations are solved to compute observables like dynamic charge structure factors and dielectric susceptibilities. We unveil the relative importance of the different contributions (solvent, ions, cross terms) to the dynamics of electrolytes, which are key to understand the couplings between ions and the fluctuations of their microscopic environment.</description>

      <title>Non-Markovian Effects in Quantum Rate Calculations of Hydrogen Diffusion with Electronic Friction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15014v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of incorporating non-Markovian electronic friction effects in quantum-mechanical approximations of dynamical observables. A generalized Langevin equation (GLE) is formulated for ring-polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD) rate calculations, which combines electronic friction with a description of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) for adsorbates on metal surfaces. An efficient propagation algorithm is introduced that captures both the spatial dependence of friction strength and non-Markovian frictional memory. This framework is applied to a model of hydrogen diffusing on Cu(111) derived from ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations, revealing significant alterations in rate constants and tunnelling crossover temperatures due to non-Markovian effects. Our findings explain why previous classical molecular dynamics simulations with Markovian friction showed unexpectedly good agreement with experiment, highlighting the critical role of non-Markovian effects in first-principles atomistic simulations.</description>

      <title>Instrumental distortions in quantum optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02198v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum optimal control methods, such as gradient ascent pulse engineering (GRAPE), are used for precise manipulation of quantum states. Many of those methods were pioneered in magnetic resonance spectroscopy where instrumental distortions are often negligible. However, that is not the case elsewhere: the usual jumble of cables, resonators, modulators, splitters, amplifiers, and filters can and would distort control signals. Those distortions may be non-linear, their inverse functions may be ill-defined and unstable; they may even vary from one day to the next, and across the sample. Here we introduce the response-aware gradient ascent pulse engineering (RAW-GRAPE) framework, which accounts for any cascade of differentiable distortions within the GRAPE optimisation loop, does not require filter function inversion, and produces control sequences that are resilient to user-specified distortion cascades with user-specified parameter ensembles. The framework is implemented into the optimal control module supplied with versions 2.10 and later of the open-source Spinach library; the user needs to provide function handles returning the actions by the distortions and, optionally, parameter ensembles for those actions.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>
