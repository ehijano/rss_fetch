      <title>Real-Time Go-Around Prediction: A case study of JFK airport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the long-short-term memory model (LSTM) to predict the real-time go-around probability as an arrival flight is approaching JFK airport and within 10 nm of the landing runway threshold. We further develop methods to examine the causes to go-around occurrences both from a global view and an individual flight perspective. According to our results, in-trail spacing, and simultaneous runway operation appear to be the top factors that contribute to overall go-around occurrences. We then integrate these pre-trained models and analyses with real-time data streaming, and finally develop a demo web-based user interface that integrates the different components designed previously into a real-time tool that can eventually be used by flight crews and other line personnel to identify situations in which there is a high risk of a go-around.</description>

      <title>The statistical and dynamic modeling of the first part of the 2013-2014 Euromaidan protests in Ukraine: The Revolution of Dignity and preceding times</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ukraine's tug-of-war between Russia and the West has had significant and lasting consequences for the country. In 2013, Viktor Yanukovych, the Ukrainian president aligned with Russia, opted against signing an association agreement with the European Union. This agreement aimed to facilitate trade and travel between the EU and Ukraine. This decision sparked widespread protests that coalesced in Kyiv's Maidan Square, eventually becoming known as the Euromaidan protests. In this study, we analyze the protest data from 2013, sourced from Ukraine's Center for Social and Labor Research. Despite the dataset's limitations and occasional inconsistencies, we demonstrate the extraction of valuable insights and the construction of a descriptive model from such data. Our investigation reveals a pre-existing state of self-excitation within the system even before the onset of the Euromaidan protests. This self-excitation intensified during the Euromaidan protests. A statistical analysis indicates that the government's utilization of force correlates with increased future protests, exacerbating rather than quelling the protest movement. Furthermore, we introduce the implementation of Hawkes process models to comprehend the spatiotemporal dynamics of the protest activity. Our findings highlight that, while protest activities spread across the entire country, the driving force behind the dynamics of these protests was the level of activity in Kyiv. Furthermore, in contrast to prior research that emphasized geographical proximity as a key predictor of event propagation, our study illustrates that the political alignment among oblasts, which are the distinct municipalities comprising Ukraine, had a more profound impact than mere geographic distance. This underscores the significance of social and cultural factors in molding the trajectory of political movements.</description>

      <title>Detecting and Mitigating Bias in Algorithms Used to Disseminate Information in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social connections are a conduit through which individuals communicate, information propagates, and diseases spread. Identifying individuals that are more likely to adopt ideas or technologies and spread them to others is essential in order to develop effective information campaigns, fight epidemics, and to maximize the reach of limited resources. Consequently a lot of work has focused on identifying sets of influencers. Here we show that seeding information using these influence maximization methods, only benefits connected and central individuals, consistently leaving the most vulnerable behind. Our results highlights troublesome outcomes of influence maximization algorithms: they do not disseminate information in an equitable manner threatening to create an increasingly unequal society. To overcome this issue we devise a simple, multi-objective algorithm, which maximises both influence and information equity. Our work demonstrates how to find fairer influencer sets, highlighting that in our search for maximizing information, we do not need to compromise on information equality.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric games on networks: mapping to Ising models and bounded rationality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of coordination and consensus in an agent population. Considering agents endowed with bounded rationality, we study asymmetric coordination games using a mapping to random field Ising models. In doing so, we investigate the relationship between group coordination and agent rationality. Analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the proposed model lead to novel insight into opinion dynamics. For instance, we find that bounded rationality and preference intensity can determine a series of possible scenarios with different levels of opinion polarization. To conclude, we deem our investigation opens a new avenue for studying game dynamics through methods of statistical physics.</description>
