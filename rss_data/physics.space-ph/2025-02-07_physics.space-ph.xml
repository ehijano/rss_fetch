      <title>Cosmology on the Generalized Proca Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis employs the dynamical systems approach to explore two cosmological models: an anisotropic dark energy scenario in a Bianchi-I background and the Generalized SU(2) Proca (GSU2P) theory in a flat FLRW background. In the first case, a numerical framework is developed to analyze the interaction between a scalar tachyon field and a vector field, identifying parameter regions that allow anisotropic accelerated attractors. The second case examines the viability of GSU2P as a driver of inflation and late-time acceleration. Our analysis reveals fundamental limitations, including the absence of stable attractors and smooth cosmological transitions, ultimately ruling out the model as a complete description of the Universe's expansion. This work highlights the effectiveness of dynamical systems techniques in assessing alternative cosmological scenarios and underscores the need for refined theoretical frameworks aligned with observational constraints.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous existence of the ocsillations, counterstreaming flows and mass injections in solar quiescent prominences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar prominences are very spectacular structures embedded in the tenuous and hot solar corona. The counterstreaming flows, a common feature in solar quiescent prominences, have been discovered for more than twenty years. However, the mechanism driving the counterstreaming flows is still elusive. To unveil the nature of this phenomenon, we analyzed the data of a quiescent prominence observed by the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamical Observatory (SDO). It is found that there is a distinct longitudinal oscillation of prominence plasma along the higher part of the prominence spine in H$\alpha$ observations. The oscillation period is approximately 83 minutes and the amplitude is about 32 Mm. The counterstreaming flows are dominant in the middle part of the prominence spine. The velocities of the counterstreaming flows range from about 4 km s$^{-1}$ to 11 km s$^{-1}$. Moreover, the intermittent mass flows with the upward plumes from the top of the bubbles and tornado-like barbs are observed to be injected into the lower part of the prominence spine from the lower atmosphere. The velocities of these injected mass flows range from about 3 km s$^{-1}$ to 30 km s$^{-1}$. Some injected mass flows exhibit redshifted Doppler signals, while others exhibit blueshifted signals. Based on these high resolution observations, it is found that different parts of the prominence spine exhibit the different dynamic characteristics. These results further advance the understanding of the ubiquitous counterstreaming flows in solar quiescent prominences.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Reconnection in a Compact Magnetic Dome: Peculiar Emissions and High-velocity Plasma Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection at small spatial scales is a fundamental driver of energy release and plasma dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere. We present novel observations of a brightening in an active region, captured in high-resolution data from the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST) using the Visible Broadband Imager (VBI) and the Visible Spectro-Polarimeter (ViSP). The event exhibits Ellerman bomb-like morphology in the H$\beta$ filter, associated with flux cancellation between a small negative polarity patch adjacent to opposite-polarity plage. Additionally, it displays a distinct annular emission pattern in Ca II K, hot jet-like structures containing Alfv\'enic plasma flows, and cooler surges. We employ multi-line, non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) inversions of the spectropolarimetric data to infer the stratification of the physical parameters of the atmosphere. Furthermore, we use the photospheric vector magnetogram inferred from the ViSP spectra as a boundary condition for nonlinear force-free field extrapolations, revealing the three-dimensional distribution of squashing factors. We find significant enhancements in temperature, velocity, and microturbulence confined to the upper photosphere and low chromosphere. Our findings provide observational evidence of low-altitude magnetic reconnection along quasi-separatrix layers in a compact fan-spine-type configuration, highlighting the complex interplay between magnetic topology, energy release, and plasma flows. Finally, we discuss the potential role of nonthermal particles in the distinct emissions at different wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Alfv\'en pulse at chromospheric footpoints of magnetic loops and generation of the super-Dreicer electric field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06463v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A self-similar solution of the linearised magnetohydrodynamic equations describing the propagation of the Alfv\'en pulse in an axially symmetric magnetic tube of variable diameter is obtained. The electric field component induced by the non-linear Alfv\'en wave and directed along the tube surface, i.e., accelerating particles along the magnetic field, is determined on the basis of the perturbation theory and specified to the case of a magnetic flux tube homogeneous over its cross section. For the chromospheric tubes, whose configuration is given by the barometric law of plasma pressure decrease, the conditions for achieving the super-Dreicer electric field limit necessary to drive the accelerated high-energy electrons into the coronal part of the loop are established.</description>

      <title>Radial evolution of a density structure within a solar wind magnetic sector boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on a radial alignment between Parker Solar Probe (PSP) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) on the 29$^{\text{th}}$ of April 2021 (during a solar minimum), when the two spacecraft were respectively located at $\sim 0.075$ and $\sim 0.9$~au from the Sun. A previous study of this alignment allowed the identification of the same density enhancement (with a time scale of $\sim$1.5~h), and substructures ($\sim$20-30~min timescale), passing first by PSP, and then SolO after a $\sim 138$~h propagation time in the inner heliosphere. We show here that this structure belongs to the large scale heliospheric magnetic sector boundary. In this region, the density is dominated by radial gradients, whereas the magnetic field reversal is consistent with longitudinal gradients in the Carrington reference frame. We estimate the density structure radial size to remain of the order L$_R \sim 10^6$~km, while its longitudinal and latitudinal sizes, are estimated to expand from L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^4$-$10^5$~km in the high solar corona, to L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^5$-$10^6$~km at PSP, and L$_{\varphi, \theta} \sim 10^6$-$10^7$~km at SolO. This implies a strong evolution of the structure's aspect ratio during the propagation, due to the plasma's nearly spherical expansion. The structure's shape is therefore inferred to evolve from elongated in the radial direction at $\sim$2-3 solar radii (high corona), to sizes of nearly the same order in all directions at PSP, and then becoming elongated in the directions transverse to the radial at SolO. Measurements are not concordant with local reconnection of open solar wind field lines, so we propose that the structure has been generated through interchange reconnection near the tip of a coronal streamer.</description>

      <title>Small-scale inhomogeneity effects on coherent solar radio emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent radio emission mechanism of solar radio bursts is one of the most complicated and controversial topics in solar physics. To clarify the mechanism(s) of different types of solar radio bursts, (radio) wave excitation by energetic electrons in homogeneous plasmas has been widely studied via particle-in-cell (PIC) code numerical simulations. The solar corona is, however, inhomogeneous over almost all spatial scales. Inhomogeneities of the plasma could influence the emission properties of solar radio bursts. In this paper, we, hence, investigate effects of inhomogeneity (in the magnetic field, plasma density and temperature) of plasmas in the solar corona on radio wave emission by ring-beam distributed energetic electrons utilizing 2.5-dimensional PIC simulations. Both the beam and electron cyclotron maser (ECM) instabilities could be triggered with the presence of the energetic ring-beam electrons. The resultant spectrum of the excited electromagnetic waves presents a zebra-stripe pattern in the frequency space. The inhomogeneous density or temperature in plasmas influences the frequency bandwidth and location of these excited waves. Our results can, hence, help to diagnose the plasma properties at the emission sites of solar radio bursts. Applications of our results to the solar radio bursts with zebra-stripe pattern are discussed.</description>
