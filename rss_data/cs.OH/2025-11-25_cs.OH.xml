      <title>Bunny Hops and Blockchain Stops: Cross-Chain MEV Detection With N-Hops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This student paper introduces a novel methodology for the detection and analysis of multihop cross-chain arbitrage opportunities, wherein multihop denotes arbitrage sequences involving more than two transactional steps across distinct blockchain networks, executed using sequence-dependent strategies. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset comprising over 2.4 billion transactions recorded between September 2023 and August 2024 (encompassing 12 blockchain platforms and 45 cross-chain bridges) we design and implement an algorithm capable of identifying, sequence-dependent arbitrage paths spanning multiple ecosystems. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that such arbitrage opportunities are exceedingly infrequent, underscoring the inherent challenges associated with multihop execution in cross-chain environments.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of mass-spring networks from high-level code descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural nonlinearity can be harnessed to program complex functionalities in robotic devices. However, it remains a challenge to design nonlinear systems that will accomplish a specific, desired task. The responses that we typically describe as intelligent -- such a robot navigating a maze -- require a large number of degrees of freedom and cannot be captured by traditional optimization objective functions. In this work, we explore a code-based synthesis approach to design mass-spring systems with embodied intelligence. The approach starts from a source code, written in a \emph{mechanical description language}, that details the system boundary, sensor and actuator locations, and desired behavior. A synthesizer software then automatically generates a mass-spring network that performs the described function from the source code description. We exemplify this methodology by designing mass-spring systems realizing a maze-navigating robot and a programmable lock. Remarkably, mechanical description languages can be combined with large-language models, to translate a natural-language description of a task into a functional device.</description>

      <title>Fast Resource Management Algorithm for Passive Surveillance Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Passive surveillance systems (PSS) detect and track objects that emit electromagnetic signals from hundreds of kilometers away. These systems have a limited number of receivers and can only observe a fraction of the frequencies of interest simultaneously. To improve its behavior, we propose the ResourceTune algorithm, which iteratively constructs optimized schedules to determine which frequencies each receiver should observe at a given time step. The algorithm's main component is the optimization of receiver configurations using a left-right heuristic combined with linear programming. Our approach is unique because, unlike others, we focus on optimizing available resources and observed frequencies, which was never done before. We experimentally compared the proposed algorithm with a greedy and the state-of-the-art method for construction of PSS schedules. In most of the considered scenarios, ResourceTune outperformed both algorithms, and in the most extreme case, its objective value was more than 2.7 times better than the values reached by other methods.</description>
