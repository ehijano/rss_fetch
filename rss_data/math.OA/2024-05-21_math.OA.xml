      <title>Operator systems, contextuality and non-locality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an operator system, universal for the probabilistic models of a contextuality scenario, and identify its maximal C*-cover as the right C*-algebra of a canonical ternary ring of operators, arising from a hypergraph version of stochastic operator matrices. We study dilating contextuality scenarios, which have the property that each positive operator representation thereof admits a dilation to a projective representation on a larger Hilbert space, and characterise them via the equality of the aforementioned universal operator system and the operator system arising from the canonical generators of the respective hypergraph C*-algebra. We characterise the no-signalling probabilistic models over a pair of contextuality scenarios of different types, which arise from either the positive operator representations or from the projective representations of these scenarios, in terms of states on operator system tensor products. Generalising the notion of a synchronous no-signalling correlation to the hypergraph framework, we define coherent probabilistic models associated with a given contextuality scenario and characterise various classes thereof via different types of traces of the hypergraph C*-algebra, associated with the scenario. We establish several equivalent formulations of the Connes Embedding Problem in terms of no-signalling probabilistic models and hypergraph operator systems.</description>

      <title>Toeplitz algebra and Symbol map via Berezin transform on $H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$ be the Toeplitz algebra, that is, the $C^*$-algebra generated by the set $\{T_{\phi} : \phi\in L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})\}$. Douglas's theorem on symbol map states that there exists a $C^*$-algebra homomorphism from $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$ onto $L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T})$ such that $T_{\phi}\mapsto \phi$ and the kernel of the homomorphism coincides with commutator ideal in $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}))$. In this paper, we use the Berezin transform to study results akin to Douglas's theorem for operators on the Hardy space $H^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ over the open unit polydisc $\mathbb{D}^n$ for $n\geq 1$. We further obtain a class of bigger $C^*$-algebras than the Toeplitz algebra $\mathscr{T}(L^{\infty}(\mathbb{T}^n))$ for which the analog of symbol map still holds true.</description>

      <title>A new variant of weighted Hermite-Hadamard inequalities and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we focus on establishing a new variant of Hermite-Hadamard type inequalities for operator convex maps using an appropriate probability measure. To underline the usefulness of these inequalities, we investigate some refinements of some well-known operator inequalities, as well as the definition of new weighted operator means.</description>

      <title>Persistence approximation property for $L^p$ operator algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.12262v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the persistence approximation property for quantitative $K$-theory of filtered $L^p$ operator algebras. Moreover, we define quantitative assembly maps for $L^p$ operator algebras when $p\in [1,\infty)$. Finally, in the case of $L^{p}$ crossed products and $L^{p}$ Roe algebras, we find sufficient conditions for the persistence approximation property. This allows us to give some applications involving the $L^{p}$ (coarse) Baum-Connes conjecture.</description>

      <title>Quantum Automorphism Groups of Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum automorphism group for hypergraphs, which turns out to generalize the quantum automorphism group of Bichon for classical graphs. Further, we show that our quantum automorphism group acts on hypergraph C*-algebras as recently defined. In particular, this action generalizes the one on graph C*-algebras by Schmidt-Weber in 2018.</description>

      <title>Nuclearity of Hypergraph C*-Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We partially characterize nuclearity for the recently introduced class of hypergraph C*-algebras using a tailor-made hypergraph minor relation. The latter is generated by certain operations on hypergraphs which resemble the moves on directed graphs used by Eilers, Restorff, Ruiz and S{\o}rensen to classify unital graph C*-algebras. In particular, we obtain a new proof of the fact that every graph C*-algebra associated to a finite graph is nuclear.</description>

      <title>Algebraic groups in non-commutative probability theory revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.02585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.02585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The role of coalgebras as well as algebraic groups in non-commutative probability has long been advocated by the school of von Waldenfels and Sch\"urmann. Another algebraic approach was introduced more recently, based on shuffle and pre-Lie calculus, and results in another construction of groups of characters encoding the behaviour of states. Comparing the two, the first approach, recast recently in a general categorical language by Manzel and Sch\"urmann, can be seen as largely driven by the theory of universal products, whereas the second construction builds on Hopf algebras and a suitable algebraization of the combinatorics of noncrossing set partitions. Although both address the same phenomena, moving between the two viewpoints is not obvious. We present here an attempt to unify the two approaches by making explicit the Hopf algebraic connections between them. Our presentation, although relying largely on classical ideas as well as results closely related to Manzel and Sch\"urmann's aforementioned work, is nevertheless original on several points and fills a gap in the non-commutative probability literature. In particular, we systematically use the language and techniques of algebraic groups together with shuffle group techniques to prove that two notions of algebraic groups naturally associated with free, respectively Boolean and monotone, probability theories identify. We also obtain explicit formulas for various Hopf algebraic structures and detail arguments that had been left implicit in the literature.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>
