      <title>A Unified Framework of Bond-Associated Peridynamic Material Correspondence Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for bond-associated peridynamic material correspondence models that were proposed to inherently address the issue of material instability or existence of zero-energy modes in the conventional correspondence formulation. The conventional formulation is well-known for having the issue of material instability due to the non-unique mapping between bond force density state and nonlocal deformation gradient. Several bond-associated models that employ bond-level deformation gradients address this issue in a very effectively and inherent manner. Although different approaches were taken to formulate bond-level deformation gradient so the bond-associated quantities can be captured more accurately, a detailed study finds a unified systematic framework exists for these models. It is the purpose of this paper to consolidate these approaches by providing a unified and systematic framework for bond-associated peridynamic correspondence models. Based on all the bond-associated deformation gradients proposed in the literature, a unified bond-associated deformation gradient is formulated. Assuming energy equivalence with the local continuum mechanics theory, the unified bond force density state is derived using the Fr\'echet derivative. Additionally, the properties of the formulated unified framework including linear momentum balance, angular momentum balance, and objectivity are thoroughly examined. This work serves as a valuable reference for the further development and application of bond-associated correspondence formulations in peridynamics.</description>

      <title>A versatile machine learning workflow for high-throughput analysis of supported metal catalyst particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient characterization of nanoparticles (NPs), particularly regarding particle size distribution, is essential for advancing our understanding of their structure-property relationships and facilitating their design for various applications. In this study, we introduce a novel two-stage artificial intelligence (AI)-driven workflow for NP analysis that leverages prompt engineering techniques from state-of-the-art single-stage object detection and large-scale vision transformer (ViT) architectures. This methodology was applied to transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning TEM (STEM) images of heterogeneous catalysts, enabling high-resolution, high-throughput analysis of particle size distributions for supported metal catalysts. The model's performance in detecting and segmenting NPs was validated across diverse heterogeneous catalyst systems, including various metals (Cu, Ru, Pt, and PtCo), supports (silica ($\text{SiO}_2$), $\gamma$-alumina ($\gamma$-$\text{Al}_2\text{O}_3$), and carbon black), and particle diameter size distributions with means and standard deviations of 2.9 $\pm$ 1.1 nm, 1.6 $\pm$ 0.2 nm, 9.7 $\pm$ 4.6 nm, and 4 $\pm$ 1.0 nm. Additionally, the proposed machine learning (ML) approach successfully detects and segments overlapping NPs anchored on non-uniform catalytic support materials, providing critical insights into their spatial arrangements and interactions. Our AI-assisted NP analysis workflow demonstrates robust generalization across diverse datasets and can be readily applied to similar NP segmentation tasks without requiring costly model retraining.</description>

      <title>Off-stoichiometry engineering of the electrical and optical properties of SrNbO$_3$ by oxide molecular beam epitaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The highly conducting and transparent inorganic perovskites SrBO$_3$ with V, Nb, Mo, and their mixtures at the B-site have recently attracted the attention of the oxide electronics community as novel alternative transparent conducting oxides. For different applications from solar cells to transparent electronics, it is desirable to tune the optical transmission window in the ultraviolet (UV), visible and infrared (IR) range. The conventional approach is substitutional design at the A- and/or B-site. Here, we suggest a method by engineering the off-stoichiometry of the perovskite, opening new pathways to broaden the range of applications without adding additional elements. For oxide molecular beam epitaxy grown SrNbO$_3$ on GdScO$_3$ substrates, we show that controlled Sr deficiency shifts the plasma edge from about 2 eV in the visible range into the near-infrared region, 1.37 eV (similar to stoichiometric SrVO$_3$). Here, epitaxial growth allows going beyond the limitations of phase stability set by thermodynamics. The suggested approach opens a new design toolbox by including controlled vacancy sites as quasi-substitutional virtual elements.</description>

      <title>Designing Hydrogen Permeation Barriers in Titanium Aluminium Nitride through First Principles Density Functional Theory Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates hydrogen permeation in titanium aluminium nitride (TiAlN) using ab initio density functional theory (DFT) for cubic and hexagonal crystal structures. Despite the significance of hydrogen barriers, the potential of TiAlN has not been fully explored. We analyzed site specificity, temperature-dependent insertion, and atomic hydrogen migration path energies. Our research highlights the decisive role of crystallographic structure over chemical composition in designing materials resistant to hydrogen absorption. However, once absorbed, hydrogen diffusion is governed by the local chemical environment. Specifically, hydrogen migration through an Al-N plane requires more energy than through Ti-N, which affects the overall diffusion process. We found hydrogen absorption is highly endothermic, with insertion energies from 50 to 320 kJ/mol of hydrogen atom, indicating low uptake probability at ambient conditions. Higher temperatures further increase the energy required, making absorption less favourable. We also identified substantial energy barriers for hydrogen migration, particularly in the hexagonal structure, with peaks up to 276 kJ/mol, indicating a very low probability of migration. These findings underscore the exceptional resistance of TiAlN to hydrogen permeation, making it a promising candidate for high-pressure applications such as hydrogen storage and nuclear reactors.</description>

      <title>Phonon coherence and minimum thermal conductivity in disordered superlattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon coherence elucidates the propagation and interaction of phonon quantum states within superlattice, unveiling the wave-like nature and collective behaviors of phonons. Taking MoSe$_2$/WSe$_2$ lateral heterostructures as a model system, we demonstrate that the intricate interplay between wave-like and particle-like phonons, previously observed in perfect superlattice only, also occurs in disordered superlattice. By employing molecular dynamics simulation based on a highly accurate and efficient machine-learned potential constructed herein, we observe a non-monotonic dependence of the lattice thermal conductivity on the interface density in both perfect and disordered superlattice, with a global minimum occurring at relatively higher interface density for disordered superlattice. The counter-intuitive phonon coherence contribution can be characterized by the lagged self-similarity of the structural sequences in the disordered superlattice. Our findings extend the realm of coherent phonon transport from perfect superlattice to more general structures, which offers more flexibility in tuning thermal transport in superlattices.</description>

      <title>Effect of Annealing on Flexoelectricity in Hafnium Oxide (HfO2)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity is universal in all dielectrics, effective at high temperatures, and a promising transduction technique for nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). However, as flexoelectricity is still in its early stages, many aspects require further investigation. Understanding how flexoelectricity depends on material parameters like crystallographic phase and how temperature might affect it, is important for selecting and optimizing the right material for technological applications. This work studies the influence of high-temperature annealing (and the consequent crystallization) in the flexoelectricity of hafnium oxide (HfO2), a material with significant technological relevance. We measure the flexoelectric coefficient for amorphous (not annealed) and annealed (slightly crystalline) phases of HfO2, with samples annealed in nitrogen or oxygen atmospheres. Our results indicate that the amorphous phase of HfO2 exhibits the highest flexoelectric coefficient (105 $\pm$ 10 pC/m), while annealed samples show a significant decrease, with the lowest value in nitrogen-annealed samples (26 $\pm$ 4 pC/m). Samples annealed in an oxygen atmosphere improve flexoelectric properties (54 $\pm$ 6 pC/m) compared to those annealed in nitrogen. Using cross-sectional imaging, X-ray diffraction, resonance frequency characterization, and relative permittivity measurements, we find that annealing promotes crystallization into the tetragonal phase and increases internal stress within the HfO2 layer, while most other parameters remain constant. We attribute the differences in flexoelectricity from the annealed samples to the quantity of oxygen vacancies in hafnium oxide. These oxygen vacancies in hafnium oxide seem to negatively affect the flexoelectric coefficient. This finding can be applied to optimize materials to enhance their flexoelectric properties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of mechanical properties such as the Young's modulus provides an important means to compare classical molecular dynamics simulations with materials. In this respect, ultra-thin materials hold several challenges: their volume is ambiguous, and different methods to determine a stress-strain relation deliver different result in particular for disordered systems. Using the example of carbon nanomembranes we show that stress-strain simulations following experimental setups deliver correct results if adjusted carefully.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Accelerated Simulation of Atomic Transport in Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce LiFlow, a generative framework to accelerate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for crystalline materials that formulates the task as conditional generation of atomic displacements. The model uses flow matching, with a Propagator submodel to generate atomic displacements and a Corrector to locally correct unphysical geometries, and incorporates an adaptive prior based on the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution to account for chemical and thermal conditions. We benchmark LiFlow on a dataset comprising 25-ps trajectories of lithium diffusion across 4,186 solid-state electrolyte (SSE) candidates at four temperatures. The model obtains a consistent Spearman rank correlation of 0.7-0.8 for lithium mean squared displacement (MSD) predictions on unseen compositions. Furthermore, LiFlow generalizes from short training trajectories to larger supercells and longer simulations while maintaining high accuracy. With speed-ups of up to 600,000$\times$ compared to first-principles methods, LiFlow enables scalable simulations at significantly larger length and time scales.</description>

      <title>The Chemistry of Spinel Ferrite Nanoparticle Nucleation, Crystallization, and Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01527v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleation, crystallization, and growth mechanisms of MnFe2O4, CoFe2O4, NiFe2O4, and ZnFe2O4 nanocrystallites prepared from coprecipitated transition metal (TM) hydroxide precursors treated at sub-, near-, and supercritical hydrothermal conditions have been studied by in situ X-ray total scattering (TS) with pair distribution function (PDF) analysis, and in situ synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) with Rietveld analysis. The in situ TS experiments were carried out on 0.6 M TM hydroxide precursors prepared from aqueous metal chloride solutions using 24.5% NH4OH as the precipitating base. The PDF analysis reveals equivalent nucleation processes for the four spinel ferrite compounds under the studied hydrothermal conditions, where the TMs form edge-sharing octahedrally coordinated hydroxide units (monomers/dimers and in some cases trimers) in the aqueous precursor, which upon hydrothermal treatment nucleate through linking by tetrahedrally coordinated TMs. The in situ PXRD experiments were carried out on 1.2 M TM hydroxide precursors prepared from aqueous metal nitrate solutions using 16 M NaOH as the precipitating base. The crystallization and growth of the nanocrystallites were found to progress via different processes depending on the specific TMs and synthesis temperatures. The PXRD data show that MnFe2O4 and CoFe2O4 nanocrystallites rapidly grow (typically &lt;1 min) to equilibrium sizes of 20-25 nm and 10-12 nm, respectively, regardless of applied temperature in the 170-420 C range, indicating limited possibility of targeted size control. However, varying the reaction time (0-30 min) and temperature (150-400 C) allows different sizes to be obtained for NiFe2O4 (3-30 nm) and ZnFe2O4 (3-12 nm) nanocrystallites.</description>

      <title>Disorder-resilient transition of helical to conical ground states in M$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, M=Cr,Mn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of chiral helical magnetism (CHM) in Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ and the stabilization of a chiral soliton lattice (CSL) has attracted considerable interest in view of their potential technological applications. However, there is an ongoing debate regarding whether the sister compound, Mn$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$, which shares the same crystal structure, exhibits similar nontrivial properties which rely on the stabilization of the lack of inversion symmetry at the magnetic ion. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation of the magnetically ordered states of both compounds, using $^{53}$Cr, $^{55}$Mn and $^{93}$Nb nuclear magnetic resonance. Our results, supported by density functional calculations, detect in a high-quality single crystal of Cr$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$ all the signatures of the monoaxial CHM in a magnetic field, identifying it as a textbook NMR case. The detailed understanding of this prototypic behavior provides a reference for Mn$_{1/3}$NbS$_2$. Despite the much larger density of specific defects in this second single crystal, we confirm the presence of a CHM phase in the Mn compound, characterized by a very large critical field for the forced ferromagnetic phase ($\approx 5$ T for H$\parallel\hat c$).</description>

      <title>A method for the automatic generation of a minimal basis set of structural templates for material phase-space exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method for predicting binary phase diagrams through the automatic construction of a minimal basis set of representative templates. The core assumption is that any materials space can be divided into a small number of regions with similar chemical tendencies and bonding properties, and that a minimal set of templates can efficiently represent the key chemical trends across the different regions. By combining data-driven techniques with ab-initio crystal structure prediction, we can efficiently partition the materials space and construct templates reflecting variations in chemical behavior. Preliminary results demonstrate that our method predicts binary convex hulls with accuracy comparable to resource-intensive EA searches, while achieving a significant reduction in computational time (by a factor of 25). The method can be extended to ternary and multinary systems, enabling efficient high-throughput exploration and mapping of complex material spaces. By providing a transformative solution for high-throughput materials discovery, our approach paves the way for uncovering advanced quantum materials and accelerating in silico design.</description>

      <title>Accessing Numerical Energy Hessians with Graph Neural Network Potentials and Their Application in Heterogeneous Catalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Access to the potential energy Hessian enables determination of the Gibbs free energy, and certain approaches to transition state search and optimization. Here, we demonstrate that off-the-shelf pretrained Open Catalyst Project (OCP) machine learned potentials (MLPs) determine the Hessian with great success (58 cm$^{-1}$ mean absolute error (MAE)) for intermediates adsorbed to heterogeneous catalyst surfaces. This enables the use of OCP models for the aforementioned applications. The top performing model, with a simple offset correction, gives good estimations of the vibrational entropy contribution to the Gibbs free energy with an MAE of 0.042 eV at 300 K. The ability to leverage models to capture the translational entropy was also explored. It was determined that 94% of randomly sampled systems had a translational entropy greater than 0.1 eV at 300 K. This underscores the need to go beyond the harmonic approximation to consider the entropy introduced by adsorbate translation, which increases with temperature. Lastly, we used MLP determined Hessian information for transition state search and found we were able to reduce the number of unconverged systems by 65% to 93% overall convergence, improving on the baseline established by CatTSunami.</description>

      <title>Neel vector dependent orbital Hall effect in altermagnetic RuO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Orbital Hall effect in the altermagnetic RuO2 is theoretically investigated. Transport calculations using the Kubo formula with a first-principles tight-binding model present a significant orbital Hall conductivity depending on the direction of the Neel vector. An pertuabative analysis explaines the mechanism by two roles of the spin-orbit interaction: converting the spin current into the parallelly polarized orbital current; recovering the orbital angular momentum anisotropically under the orthorhombic ligand field on the Ru sites. From an application perspective, this effect provides a promising method of generating orbital currents polarizing to arbitrary directions, realising an orbital source offering both controllability and efficiency.</description>

The magnetic ordering temperature decreases with increasing FeV concentration, $x$, which can be ascribed to decreased ferromagnetic coupling strength between the magnetic atoms. The strong magnetoelastic coupling in these alloys results in large values of the isothermal entropy change ($\Delta S_M$); $15.7$ J/kgK, at $2$ T magnetic field for the $x = 0$ alloy. $\Delta S_M$ decreases with increasing $x$. Results from M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy reveal that the average hyperfine field (in the ferromagnetic state) and average center shift (in the paramagnetic state) have the same decreasing trend as $\Delta S_M$. The thermal hysteresis ($\Delta T_{hyst}$) of the magnetic phase transition decreases with increasing $x$, while the mechanical stability of the alloys improves due to the reduced lattice volume change across the magnetoelastic phase transition. The adiabatic temperature change $\Delta T_{ad}$, which highly depends on $\Delta T_{hyst}$, is $1.7$ K at $1.9$ T applied field for the $x = 0.02$ alloy.</description>

      <title>Topologically-enhanced exciton transport</title>

Abstract: Excitons dominate the optoelectronic response of many materials. Depending on the timescale and host material, excitons can exhibit free diffusion, phonon-limited diffusion, or polaronic diffusion, and exciton transport often limits the efficiency of optoelectronic devices such as solar cells or photodetectors. We demonstrate that topological excitons exhibit enhanced diffusion in all transport regimes. Appealing to notions of quantum geometry, we find that topological excitons are generically larger and more dispersive than their trivial counterparts, promoting their diffusion. We apply this general theory to a range of organic polyacene semiconductors, and show that exciton transport increases four-fold when topological excitons are present. We also propose that non-uniform electric fields can be used to directly probe the quantum metric of excitons, providing an experimental window into a basic geometric feature of quantum states. Our results provide a new avenue to enhance exciton transport and reveal that the mathematical ideas of topology and quantum geometry can be important ingredients in designing next-generation optoelectronic technologies.</description>

      <title>Angularly Selective Enhanced Vortex Screening in Extremely Layered Superconductors with Tilted Columnar Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on two mechanisms of angularly selective enhanced screening in the solid vortex phase of extremely layered superconductors with tilted columnar defects (CDs). We study Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$ samples with different densities of CD tilted 45$^{\circ}$ from the $c$-axis, and conduct local ac Hall magnetometry measurements, probing the sustainable current of the vortex system. We reveal two types of maxima in sustainable current for particular directions, detected as dips in the magnetic transmittivity of the vortex system. First, for a smaller number of vortices than of defects, an enhancement of screening is detected at an angular location $\Theta^{1}_{\rm dip}$$\sim$45$^{\circ}$ for $H$ applied close to the direction of CD. For a larger number of vortices than of CD, $\Theta^{1}_{\rm dip}$ decreases towards the $ab$-plane direction upon warming. Second, a pair of additional dips in transmittivity are detected at angles $\Theta^{2}_{dip}$ closer to, and quite symmetric with, the $ab$-plane. These two types of angularly selective enhanced screening reveal the effective pinning by tilted CD even for the composite vortex lattices nucleated in tilted fields in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat-band in twisted graphene bilayer has garnered widespread attention, and whether flat-bands can be realized in carbon monolayer is an interesting topic worth exploring in condensed matter physics. In this work, we demonstrate that, based on the theory of compact localized states, a series of two-dimensional carbon allotropes with flat-bands can be achieved. Two of them named as 191-8-66-C-r567x-1 and 191-10-90-C-r567x-1 are confirmed to be dynamically stable carbon phases with isolated or weakly overlapped flat-bands at the Fermi-level. The maximum Fermi velocities of the flat-band electrons are evaluated to be 1x10^4 m/s and 0.786x10^4 m/s, both of which are lower than the Fermi velocity of the flat-band electrons in magic-angle graphene (4x10^4 m/s). Furthermore, 191-8-66-C-r567x-1 has been confirmed to be a flat-band related magnetic half-metal with a magnetic moment of 1.854 miuB per cell, while 191-10-90-C-r567x-1 is a flat-band related magnetic normal metal with a magnetic moment of 1.663 miuB per cell. These results not only show that flat-bands can be constructed in carbon monolayer, but also indicate the potential for achieving non-metallic magnetic materials with light elements based on flat-band theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate theoretical modeling approaches and develop practical computational simulation methods for investigating the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of fluid interfaces with passive and active immersed particles. Our approaches capture phenomena taking into account thermal and dissipative energy exchanges, hydrodynamic coupling, and correlated spontaneous fluctuations. Our methods allow for modeling non-uniform time-varying temperature fields, fluid momentum fields, and their impacts on particle drift-diffusion dynamics. We show how practical stochastic numerical methods can be developed for these systems by performing analysis to factor operators analytically to obtain efficient algorithms for generating the fluctuating fields. We demonstrate our methods in a few simulation studies showing how they can be used to capture particle heating of the interface and the roles of thermal gradients on hydrodynamic fluctuations. The methods developed provide modeling and simulation approaches that can be used for further investigations of non-equilibrium phenomena in active soft materials, complex fluids, and biophysical systems.</description>

      <title>First-principles computational methods for quantum defects in two-dimensional materials: A perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum defects are atomic defects in materials that provide resources to construct quantum information devices such as single-photon emitters (SPEs) and spin qubits. Recently, two-dimensional (2D) materials gained prominence as a host of quantum defects with many attractive features derived from their atomically thin and layered material formfactor. In this perspective, we discuss first-principles computational methods and challenges to predict the spin and electronic properties of quantum defects in 2D materials. We focus on the open quantum system nature of the defects and their interaction with external parameters such as electric field, magnetic field, and lattice strain. We also discuss how such prediction and understanding can be used to guide experimental studies, ranging from defect identification to tuning of their spin and optical properties. This perspective provides significant insights into the interplay between the defect, the host material, and the environment, which will be essential in the pursuit of ideal two-dimensional quantum defect platforms.</description>

      <title>Terahertz harmonic generation across the Mott insulator-metal transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate terahertz (THz) harmonic generation across the Mott insulator-metal transition in rare-earth nickelates (RNiO$_3$, R = rare-earth atom). The THz harmonic generation is observed in all the three different phases with distinct behaviors: the intensity of harmonics increases upon cooling in both the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulating and high-temperature paramagnetic (PM) metallic phases, while this trend is reversed in the intermediate PM insulating phase. Using single- and two-band Hubbard models, we find different dominant origins of THz harmonics in different phases: strong spin-charge and orbital-charge couplings in the AFM insulating phase, intraband currents from renormalized quasi-particles with frequency-dependent scattering rate in the PM metallic phase, and the reduction of the charge carrier density due to the opening of the Mott gap in the PM insulating phase. Our study offers strategies for efficient THz harmonic generation from Mott and other strongly correlated systems and insights into the fundamental physics of complex materials.</description>

Abstract: Graphene is being increasingly used as an interesting transducer membrane in micro- and nanoelectromechanical systems (MEMS and NEMS, respectively) due to its atomical thickness, extremely high carrier mobility, high mechanical strength and piezoresistive electromechanical transductions. NEMS devices based on graphene feature increased sensitivity, reduced size, and new functionalities. In this review, we discuss the merits of graphene as a functional material for MEMS and NEMS, the related properties of graphene, the transduction mechanisms of graphene MEMS and NEMS, typical transfer methods for integrating graphene with MEMS substrates, methods for fabricating suspended graphene, and graphene patterning and electrical contact. Consequently, we provide an overview of devices based on suspended and nonsuspended graphene structures. Finally, we discuss the potential and challenges of applications of graphene in MEMS and NEMS. Owing to its unique features, graphene is a promising material for emerging MEMS, NEMS and sensor applications.</description>

      <title>Four ribbons of double-layer graphene suspending masses for NEMS applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene ribbons with a suspended proof mass for nanomechanical systems have been rarely studied. Here, we report three types of nanomechanical devices consisting of graphene ribbons (two ribbons, four ribbons-cross and four ribbons-parallel) with suspended Si proof masses and studied their mechanical properties. The resonance frequencies and built-in stresses of three types of devices ranged from tens of kHz to hundreds of kHz, and from 82.61 MPa to 545.73 MPa, respectively, both of which decrease with the increase of the size of proof mass. The devices with four graphene ribbons featured higher resonance frequencies and spring constants, but lower built-in stresses than two ribbon devices under otherwise identical conditions. The Young's modulus and fracture strain of double-layer graphene were measured to be 0.34 TPa and 1.13% respectively, by using the experimental data and finite element analysis (FEA) simulations. Our studies would lay the foundation for understanding of mechanical properties of graphene ribbons with a suspended proof mass and their potential applications in nanoelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Humidity Sensing Properties of Different Atomic Layers of Graphene on SiO2/Si Substrate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graphene has the great potential to be used for humidity sensing due to ultrahigh surface area and conductivity. However, the impact of different atomic layers of graphene on SiO2/Si substrate on the humidity sensing have not been studied yet. In this paper, we fabricated three types of humidity sensors on SiO2/Si substrate based on one to three atomic layers of graphene, in which the sensing areas of graphene are 75 {\mu}m * 72 {\mu}m and 45 {\mu}m * 72 {\mu}m, respectively. We studied the impact of both the number of atomic layers of graphene and the sensing areas of graphene on the responsivity and response/recovery time of the prepared graphene-based humidity sensors. We found the relative resistance change of the prepared devices decreased with the increase of number of atomic layers of graphene under the same change of relative humidity. Further, devices based on tri-layer graphene showed the fastest response/recovery time while devices based on double-layer graphene showed the slowest response/recovery time. Finally, we chose the devices based on double-layer graphene that have relatively good responsivity and stability for application in respiration monitoring and contact-free finger monitoring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the energy per particle of normal liquid ${}^3$He in the temperature range $0.15-2$ K using Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations, leveraging a recently proposed method to overcome the sign problem -- a long-standing challenge in many-body fermionic simulations. This approach is based on introducing a parameter $\xi$ into the partition function, which allows a generalization from bosons ($\xi=1$) to fermions ($\xi=-1$). By simulating systems with $\xi \geq 0$, where the sign problem is absent, one can then extrapolate to the fermionic case at $\xi = -1$. Guided by an independent particle model that uncovers non-analytic behavior due to the superfluid transition, which is moderated by finite-size effects, we develop a tailored extrapolation strategy for liquid ${}^3$He that departs from the extrapolation schemes shown to be accurate in those cases were quantum degeneracy effects are weak, and enables accurate results in the presence of Bose--Einstein Condensation and superfluidity for $\xi &gt; 0$. Our approach extends the previously proposed framework and yields energy per particle values in excellent agreement with experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-crystalline ferroelectric (FE) perovskites show a large electrocaloric effect at electric field-induced phase transitions, promising for solid-state cooling technologies. However, paraelectric-FE transition temperatures are often too high for practical applications, and lower transitions are underrepresented in literature. Particularly, the role of thermal hysteresis and electric field direction on the caloric response is critical, especially for polycrystalline materials, but not yet fully understood. Using ab initio-based coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we show how transition temperatures depend on the direction of the applied field. Also, we reveal that the choice of electric field direction can reduce thermal hysteresis and can adjust the temperature ranges where large and reversible caloric responses occur. Furthermore, we propose a phenomenological descriptor for the qualitative changes in transition temperature with field direction. This descriptor is valid for both BaTiO3 and PbTiO3, even though both materials show different microscopic electric field coupling. Finally, we identify favorable temperature and texturing conditions for large and reversible caloric responses in polycrystals.</description>

      <title>Covariant Jacobi-Legendre expansion for total energy calculations within the projector-augmented-wave formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learning models can be trained to predict the converged electron charge density of a density functional theory (DFT) calculation. In general, the value of the density at a given point in space is invariant under global translations and rotations having that point as a centre. Hence, one can construct locally invariant machine-learning density predictors. However, the widely used projector augmented wave (PAW) implementation of DFT requires the evaluation of the one-center augmentation contributions, that are not rotationally invariant. Building on our recently proposed Jacobi-Legendre charge-density scheme, we construct a covariant Jacobi-Legendre model capable of predicting the local occupancies needed to compose the augmentation charge density. Our formalism is then applied to the prediction of the energy barrier for the 1H-to-1T phase transition of two-dimensional MoS$_2$. With extremely modest training, the model is capable of performing a non-self-consistent nudged elastic band calculation at virtually the same accuracy as a fully DFT-converged one, thus saving thousands of self-consistent DFT steps. Furthermore, at variance with machine-learning force fields, the charge density is here available for any nudged elastic band image, so that we can trace the evolution of the electronic structure across the phase transition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04655v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating high magnetic fields requires materials with not only high electric conductivity, but also good strength properties in order to withstand the necessarily strong Lorentz forces. A number of bi-metal composites, most notably Cu/Nb, are considered to be good candidates for this purpose. Here, we generalize our previous work on Cu/Nb in order to predict, from theory, the dependence of electric conductivity on the microstructure and volume fraction of the less conductive component for a number of other bi-metal composites. Together with information on strength properties (taken from previous literature), the conductivity information we provide in this work can help to identify new promising candidate materials (such as Cu/Nb, Cu/Ag, Cu/W, ...) for magnet applications with the highest achievable field strengths.</description>

Abstract: Proximity coupling of ferromagnetic insulator EuS to the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has been proposed to break time-reversal symmetry near the surface of Bi$_2$Se$_3$, introducing an energy gap or a tilt in the surface Dirac cone. As an inverse proximity effect, strong spin-orbit coupling available in the topological surface states can enhance the Curie temperature of ferromagnetism in EuS largely beyond its bulk value, and also generate a magnetic anisotropy. This can result in a canting of the magnetic moment of Eu ions in a plane perpendicular to the interface. Here, we investigate theoretically electronic transport properties arising from the Bi$_2$Se$_3$/EuS interfaces in the planar Hall geometry. Our analysis, based on a realistic model Hamiltonian and a semi-classical formalism for the Boltzmann transport equation, reveals distinct intriguing features of anisotropic planar Hall conductivity, depending on different scenarios for the canting of the Eu moments: fixed Eu moment canting, and freely-orientable Eu moment in response to the external in-plane magnetic field. The anisotropy in the planar Hall conductivity arises from the asymmetric Berry curvature of the gapped topological surface states. We also explore topological Hall effect of the Dirac surface states, coupled to a skyrmion crystal which can emerge in the EuS due to the interplay of ferromagnetic Heisenberg exchange, interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and perpendicular alignment of the Eu moment. Our study provides new impetus for probing complex interplay between magnetic exchange interactions and topological surface states via anisotropic planar Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Selecting Alternative Metals for Advanced Interconnects</title>

Abstract: Interconnect resistance and reliability have emerged as critical factors limiting the performance of advanced CMOS circuits. With the slowdown of transistor scaling, interconnect scaling has become the primary driver of continued circuit miniaturization. The associated scaling challenges for interconnects are expected to further intensify in future CMOS technology nodes. As interconnect dimensions approach the 10 nm scale, the limitations of conventional Cu dual-damascene metallization are becoming increasingly difficult to overcome, spurring over a decade of focused research into alternative metallization schemes. The selection of alternative metals is a highly complex process, requiring consideration of multiple criteria, including resistivity at reduced dimensions, reliability, thermal performance, process technology readiness, and sustainability. This tutorial introduces the fundamental criteria for benchmarking and selecting alternative metals and reviews the current state of the art in this field. It covers materials nearing adoption in high-volume manufacturing, materials currently under active research, and potential future directions for fundamental study. While early alternatives to Cu metallization have recently been introduced in commercial CMOS devices, the search for the optimal interconnect metal remains ongoing.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the ODMR Signal of Organic Molecular Qubits</title>

Abstract: In the fields of quantum information science and sensing, electron spins are often purified into a specific polarisation through an optical-spin interface, a process known as optically-detected magnetic resonance (ODMR). Diamond-NV centres and transition metals are both excellent platforms for these so-called colour centres, while metal-free molecular analogues are also gaining popularity for their extended polarisation lifetimes, milder environmental impacts, and reduced costs. In our earlier attempt at designing such organic high-spin $\pi$-diradicals, we proposed to spin-polarise by shelving triplet $M_{S}=\pm1$ populations as singlets. This was recently verified by experiments albeit with low ODMR contrasts of &lt;1% at temperatures above 5 K. In this work, we propose to improve the ODMR signal by moving singlet populations back into the triplet $M_{S}=0$ sublevel, designing a true carbon-based molecular analogue to the NV centre. To achieve both spin channels in $\pi$-diradicals, we leverage on weaker spin-orbit couplings beyond the nearest-neighbour approximation, made possible by careful control of orbital nodal structures and group-theoretical considerations. These analyses are further confirmed by ab initio calculations of a realistic trityl-based radical dimer. Microkinetic analyses point towards high ODMR contrasts of around 30% under experimentally-feasible conditions, a stark improvement from previous works. Finally, in our quest towards ground-state optically-addressable molecular spin qubits, we exemplify how our symmetry-based design avoids Zeeman-induced singlet-triplet mixings during electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) experiments, setting the scene for realising electron spin qubit gates.</description>

      <title>Element-specific, non-destructive profiling of layered heterostructures</title>

Abstract: Fabrication of semiconductor heterostructures is now so precise that metrology has become a key challenge for progress in science and applications. It is now relatively straightforward to characterize classic III-V and group IV heterostructures consisting of slabs of different semiconductor alloys with thicknesses of $\sim$5 nm and greater using sophisticated tools such as X-ray diffraction, high energy X-ray photoemission spectroscopy, and secondary ion mass spectrometry. However, profiling thin layers with nm or sub-nm thickness, e.g. atomically thin dopant layers ($\delta$-layers), of impurities required for modulation doping and spin-based quantum and classical information technologies is more challenging.
  Here, we present theory and experiment showing how resonant-contrast X-ray reflectometry meets this challenge. The technique takes advantage of the change in the scattering factor of atoms as their core level resonances are scanned by varying the X-ray energy. We demonstrate the capability of the resulting element-selective, non-destructive profilometry for single arsenic $\delta$-layers within silicon, and show that the sub-nm electronic thickness of the $\delta$-layers corresponds to sub-nm chemical thickness. In combination with X-ray fluorescence imaging, this enables non-destructive three-dimensional characterization of nano-structured quantum devices. Due to the strong resonances at soft X-ray wavelengths, the technique is also ideally suited to characterize layered quantum materials, such as cuprates or the topical infinite-layer nickelates.</description>
