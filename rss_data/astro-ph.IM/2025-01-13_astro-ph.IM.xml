      <title>More than a void? The detection and characterization of cavities in a simulated galaxy's interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium of galaxies is filled with holes, bubbles, and shells, typically interpreted as remnants of stellar evolution. There is growing interest in the study of their properties to investigate stellar and supernova feedback. So far, the detection of cavities in observational and numerical data is mostly done visually and, hence, is prone to biases. Therefore, we present an automated, objective method for discovering cavities in particle simulations, with demonstrations using hydrodynamical simulations of a dwarf galaxy. The suggested technique extracts holes based on the persistent homology of particle positions and identifies tight boundary points around each. With a synthetic ground-truth analysis, we investigate the relationship between data density and the detection radius, demonstrating that higher data density also allows for the robust detection of smaller cavities. By tracking the boundary points, we can measure the shape and physical properties of the cavity, such as its temperature. In this contribution, we detect 808 holes in 21 simulation snapshots. We classified the holes into supernova-blown bubbles and cavities unrelated to stellar feedback activity based on their temperature profile and expansion behaviour during the 100 million years covered by the simulation snapshots analysed for this work. Surprisingly, less than 40% of the detected cavities can unequivocally be linked to stellar evolution. Moreover, about 36% of the cavities are contracting, while 59% are expanding. The rest do not change for a few million years. Clearly, it is erroneous to interpret observational data based on the premise that all cavities are supernova-related and expanding. This study reveals that supernova-driven bubbles typically exhibit smaller diameters, larger expansion velocities, and lower kinetic ages (with a maximum of 220 million years) compared to other cavities.</description>

      <title>Mind the gaps: improved methods for the detection of periodicities in unevenly-sampled data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of periodic signals in irregularly-sampled time series is a problem commonly encountered in astronomy. Traditional tools used for periodic searches, such as the periodogram, have poorly defined statistical properties under irregular sampling, which complicate inferring the underlying aperiodic variability used for hypothesis testing. The problem is exacerbated in the presence of stochastic variability, which can be easily mistaken by genuine periodic behaviour, particularly in the case of poorly sampled lightcurves. Here we present a method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) modelling for period searches and characterization, specifically developed to overcome these problems. We argue that in cases of irregularly-sampled time series, GPs offer an appealing alternative to traditional periodograms, because the known distribution of the data (correlated Gaussian) allows a well-defined likelihood to be constructed. We exploit this property and draw from existing statistical methods to perform traditional likelihood ratio tests for an additional, (quasi-)periodic component, using the aperiodic variability inferred from the data as the null hypothesis. Inferring the noise from the data allows the method to be fully generalizable, with the only condition that the data can be described as a Gaussian process. We demonstrate the method by applying it to a variety of objects showing varying levels of noise and data quality. Limitations of the method are discussed and a package implementing the proposed methodology is made publicly available.</description>

      <title>The LSPE-Strip Pointing Reconstruction and Star Tracker</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to describe the Pointing Reconstruction Model (PRM) and the prototype Star Tracker, which will be mounted on LSPE-Strip, a microwave Q- and W-band CMB telescope planned for installation at the "Observatorio del Teide" in Tenerife. The PRM integrates information on the instantaneous attitude provided by the telescope control system to determine the actual pointing direction and focal plane orientation of the telescope. It accounts for various non-idealities in the telescope setup, represented by eight configuration angles, which will be calibrated using the Star Tracker. Following the derivation of the PRM formalism and its implementation, we investigate the pointing errors caused by incorrect calibration of these configuration angles to validate the required 1 arcminute maximum systematic pointing error for the LSPE-Strip survey. This paper also describes the main structure and operations of the Star Tracker and presents the results of a campaign of actual sky observations conducted with a prototype. The results demonstrate a Star Tracker RMS accuracy of approximately 3 arcseconds, while systematic errors remain below 10 arcseconds. Based on these results, we analyzed the problem of reconstructing the PRM configuration angles. Two methods for intercalibrating the Star Tracker's pointing direction with respect to the focal plane's pointing direction were examined: (1) observations of planets and (2) observations of a drone carrying both an optical beacon and a radio beacon. In the first case, an intercalibration accuracy between 1/3 arcminute and 1 arcminute is achievable. In the second case, the expected intercalibration accuracy ranges from 0.25 arcminute to 1 arcminute.</description>

      <title>Optical frequency comb integration in radio telescopes: advancing signal generation and phase calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) enables high-angular-resolution observations in astronomy and geodesy by synthesizing a virtual telescope with baselines spanning hundreds to thousands of kilometres. Achieving high instrumental phase stability in VLBI relies on the generation of high-quality, atomic-referenced RF local oscillator (LO) and RF-comb signals for the effective downconversion of celestial RF signals and precise phase calibration, respectively. As observing frequencies move into higher ranges with wider bandwidth, conventional electronic methods face significant challenges in maintaining the quality of these signals. Here, we demonstrate that an optical frequency comb (OFC) can be used as a versatile tool to generate and distribute low-noise and atomic-referenced RF-comb and RF-LO signals in the VLBI telescope. Hydrogen maser-stabilized optical pulses are transmitted over a timing-stabilized fibre link from the observatory building to the VLBI receiver system at the telescope, where photodetection converts them into the required RF-comb and RF-LO signals. In VLBI test observation, we successfully detected VLBI fringes and extracted the RF-combs characteristics in a format suitable for VLBI instrumental phase calibration. These results highlight the high potential of OFC-based technology for enhancing next-generation broadband VLBI measurements, advancing astrophysical research and facilitating intercontinental clock comparison.</description>

      <title>BASSET: Bandpass-Adaptive Single-pulse SEarch Toolkit -- Optimized Sub-Band Pulse Search Strategies for Faint Narrow-Band FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existing single-pulse search algorithms for fast radio bursts (FRBs) do not adequately consider the frequency bandpass pattern of the pulse, rendering them incomplete for the relatively narrow-spectrum detection of pulses. We present a new search algorithm for narrow-band pulses to update the existing standard pipeline, Bandpass-Adaptive Single-pulse SEarch Toolkit (BASSET). The BASSET employs a time-frequency correlation analysis to identify and remove the noise involved by the zero-detection frequency band, thereby enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the pulses. The BASSET algorithm was implemented on the FAST real dataset of FRB 20190520B, resulting in the discovery of additional 79 pulses through reprocessing. The new detection doubles the number of pulses compared to the previously known 75 pulses, bringing the total number of pulses to 154. In conjunction with the pulse calibration and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulated injection experiments, this work updates the quantified parameter space of the detection rate. Moreover, a parallel-accelerated version of the BASSET code was provided and evaluated through simulation. BASSET has the capacity of enhancing the detection sensitivity and the SNR of the narrow-band pulses from the existing pipeline, offering high performance and flexible applicability. BASSET not only enhances the completeness of the low-energy narrow-band pulse detection in a more robust mode, but also has the potential to further elucidate the FRB luminosity function at a wider energy scale.</description>

      <title>Fast Multi-tone Phase Calibration Signal Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses a fast algorithm for analyzing the phases of a multi-tone phase calibration signal. The multi-tone method is superior to its single-tone counterpart. The PCal signal is a wide-band frequency comb derived from an ultra-stable frequency standard which is then coupled into the input stage of the radio astronomy receiver chain. The frequency comb allows to determine the signal delay, frequency response and phase shifts induced by the radio telescope instrumentation. The instrumentation delay is one of the several delay components that have to be compensated for in multi-telescope aperture synthesis. The frequency response also helps to monitor the instrumentation. To extract the information from the digitized baseband output of the receiver chain calls for fast numerical methods. A simple fast algorithm is presented in this paper. Two implementations are provided. One is based on precomputed look-up tables. The other is based on fast digital sinewave generators. Both lend themselves to parallel software processing on multi-core and SIMD-capable platforms as well as processing with FPGA gateware. We present optimized reference implementations for Intel/AMD, IBM Cell and nVidia GPU platforms.</description>

      <title>AstronomyCalc: A python toolkit for teaching Astronomical Calculations and Data Analysis methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding astrophysical and cosmological processes can be challenging due to their complexity and lack of intuitive analogies. To address this, we present \texttt{AstronomyCalc}, a Python package specifically designed to aid university-level teaching by integrating theoretical physics with practical astronomical data analysis methods. The package enables students to solve key cosmological calculations, such as the Friedmann equations, and explore various models while visualizing how parameter variations affect cosmic dynamics. It includes tools for generating synthetic astronomical data, such as Type Ia supernova measurements, and supports analysis of publicly available datasets, including Pantheon+ and the SPARC galaxy database. Simplified implementations of advanced algorithms, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chains, allow students to engage with data analysis techniques used in contemporary research. Additionally, \texttt{AstronomyCalc} will be consistently updated with more tools and user-friendly Jupyter notebooks, making it a continually evolving educational resource for developing conceptual understanding and practical skills in astrophysics and cosmology.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency study of sub-parsec jets with the Event Horizon Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2017 observing campaign of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) delivered the first very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) images at the observing frequency of 230 GHz, leading to a number of unique studies on black holes and relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei (AGN). In total, eighteen sources were observed: the main science targets, Sgr A* and M87 along with various calibrators. We investigated the morphology of the sixteen AGN in the EHT 2017 data set, focusing on the properties of the VLBI cores: size, flux density, and brightness temperature. We studied their dependence on the observing frequency in order to compare it with the Blandford-K\"onigl (BK) jet model. We modeled the source structure of seven AGN in the EHT 2017 data set using linearly polarized circular Gaussian components and collected results for the other nine AGN from dedicated EHT publications, complemented by lower frequency data in the 2-86 GHz range. Then, we studied the dependences of the VLBI core flux density, size, and brightness temperature on the frequency measured in the AGN host frame. We compared the observations with the BK jet model and estimated the magnetic field strength dependence on the distance from the central black hole. Our results indicate a deviation from the standard BK model, particularly in the decrease of the brightness temperature with the observing frequency. Either bulk acceleration of the jet material, energy transfer from the magnetic field to the particles, or both are required to explain the observations.</description>

      <title>The MeerKAT Fornax Survey IV. A close look at the cluster physics through the densest rotation measure grid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) mid precursor MeerKAT, we acquired broadband spectro-polarimetric data in the context of the MeerKAT Fornax Survey to study the Fornax cluster's magnetic fields in detail by building the densest rotation measure (RM) grid to date. Here, we present the survey, the analysis, and a discussion of the RM grid properties. We analyzed a circular region centered on the Fornax cluster center with a radius of $\sim1.4^\circ$; that is, $\rm\sim 0.73 R_{vir}$. The mosaics have a resolution of 13arcsec and cover the frequencies between 900\,MHz and 1.4\,GHz, reaching an average noise of 16$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in total intensity and 3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ in the Q and U Stokes images. With these data, we detected 508 polarized sources over an area of $\sim$6.35 deg$^2$ corresponding to a density of $\sim$80 polarized sources/deg$^2$. This is the densest RM grid ever built. Of the polarized sources, five are cluster sources. Excluding the cluster sources, we built the Euclidean-normalized differential source counts in polarization and we went a factor of ten deeper than previous surveys. We tentatively detect for the first time an increment in the differential source counts at low polarized flux densities; that is, $\sim$9\,$\mu$Jy at 1.4\,GHz. The average degree of polarization of about 3--4\% suggests that the sub$-\mu$Jansky population is not dominated by star-forming galaxies, typically showing a degree of polarization lower than 1\%. The majority of the polarized sources are Faraday simple; in other words, their polarization plane rotates linearly with the wavelength squared. The RM shows the typical decrement going from the center to the outskirts of the Fornax cluster. However, interesting features are observed both in the RM grid and in the RM radial profiles across different directions. A combination of the ...</description>

      <title>Space-based Ultra-High Energy Cosmic-Ray Experiments</title>

Abstract: Space-based experiments, either orbiting the Earth or from scientific balloon altitudes, measure high-energy cosmic rays by measuring from above the atmosphere the optical and radio signals generated by extensive air showers (EAS). These experiments are designed to have a large field-of-view (FoV) for observing EAS which translates to monitoring the atmosphere over a large, $\sim 10^6$ km$^2$ area on the ground. Ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs, $E_{CR} &gt; ~\sim 1$ EeV) are measured by using the isotropic near-UV air fluorescence signal to finely sample the EAS development and to efficiently use the atmosphere as a vast calorimeter. At UHE, these immense EAS particle cascades have sufficient charged particle content to generate the relatively dim fluorescence light that propagates to the space-based instrument. Additionally, the beamed Cherenkov light and geomagnetic radio emission from EAS arrive with $&gt; ~\sim 10$ ns impulse and are measured at small angles away from the cosmic ray trajectories. In particular for optical Cherenkov measurements, the energy thresholds can be $&gt; ~\sim 1$ PeV, i.e. for very-high energy cosmic rays (VHECRs). ...
  In this chapter, the nature of observing the UHECR-induced shower development from orbiting and balloon-borne experiments is detailed, both for missions that have been flown and those currently in development. This will be accomplished by discussing experimental performance in terms of measuring the UHECR spectrum, UHECR nuclear composition, and UHECR arrival direction. The ability for these experiments to also perform VHECR and VHE and UHE cosmic neutrino measurements will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>Development of SQUID Array Amplifiers for the LiteBIRD CMB Satellite</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LiteBIRD is an upcoming JAXA-led mission that aims to measure primordial gravitational waves in the B-mode polarization of the cosmic microwave background. It is set to launch in 2032. The LiteBIRD detector array consists of around 5000 TES detectors which are read out using digital frequency multiplexing over a bandwidth of 1-6 MHz. The multiplexing factor ranges from 58x to 68x. We are presently developing single-stage SQUID array amplifiers for LiteBIRD readout. Due to the reduced complexity and cost, and greater heritage from ground-based experiments such as the South Pole Telescope and Simons Array, single-stage SQUID array amplification is preferable for the first-stage amplification, as long as it can meet the requirements. The LiteBIRD single-stage SQUID Array is required to have high transimpedance amplification while maintaining a low input inductance and low dynamic resistance. In addition, the input-referred current noise must be very low, and the power dissipation must remain below about 100 nW. These requirements have non-trivial interactions. To maximize performance within these requirements we have performed lumped-element SQUID simulation. We find that by optimizing SQUID internal damping elements and inductive loading, good single-stage SQUID array performance can be obtained for LiteBIRD, including significant engineering margin.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Cell-based Coadds and Metadetection Weak Lensing Shape Catalogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Metadetection weak lensing galaxy shape catalogue from the six-year Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) imaging data. This dataset is the final release from DES, spanning 4422 deg$^2$ of the southern sky. We describe how the catalogue was constructed, including the two new major processing steps, cell-based image coaddition and shear measurements with Metadetection. The DES Y6 Metadetection weak lensing shape catalogue consists of 151,922,791 galaxies detected over riz bands, with an effective number density of $n_{\rm eff}$ =8.22 galaxies per arcmin$^2$ and shape noise of $\sigma_e$ = 0.29. We carry out a suite of validation tests on the catalogue, including testing for PSF leakage, testing for the impact of PSF modeling errors, and testing the correlation of the shear measurements with galaxy, PSF, and survey properties. In addition to demonstrating that our catalogue is robust for weak lensing science, we use the DES Y6 image simulation suite (Mau, Becker et al. 2025) to estimate the overall multiplicative shear bias of our shear measurement pipeline. We find no detectable multiplicative bias at the roughly half-percent level, with m = (3.4 $\pm$ 6.1) x $10^{-3}$, at 3$\sigma$ uncertainty. This is the first time both cell-based coaddition and Metadetection algorithms are applied to observational data, paving the way to the Stage-IV weak lensing surveys.</description>

      <title>Dark Energy Survey Year 6 Results: Point-Spread Function Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the point-spread function (PSF) modeling for weak lensing shear measurement using the full six years of the Dark Energy Survey (DES Y6) data. We review the PSF estimation procedure using the PIFF (PSFs In the Full FOV) software package and describe the key improvements made to PIFF and modeling diagnostics since the DES year three (Y3) analysis: (i) use of external Gaia and infrared photometry catalogs to ensure higher purity of the stellar sample used for model fitting, (ii) addition of color-dependent PSF modeling, the first for any weak lensing analysis, and (iii) inclusion of model diagnostics inspecting fourth-order moments, which can bias weak lensing measurements to a similar degree as second-order modeling errors. Through a comprehensive set of diagnostic tests, we demonstrate the improved accuracy of the Y6 models evident in significantly smaller systematic errors than those of the Y3 analysis, in which all $g$ band data were excluded due to insufficiently accurate PSF models. For the Y6 weak lensing analysis, we include $g$ band photometry data in addition to the $riz$ bands, providing a fourth band for photometric redshift estimation. Looking forward to the next generation of wide-field surveys, we describe several ongoing improvements to PIFF, which will be the default PSF modeling software for weak lensing analyses for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>Estimating variability power spectra of active galaxies from irregular time series</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is their random variations in brightness across the whole emission spectrum, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Studying the nature and origin of these fluctuations is critical to characterising the underlying variability process of the accretion flow that powers AGN. Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power spectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over temporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum increases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The commonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when applied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability. Several time-domain methods exist to infer the power spectral shape in the case of irregular sampling but they suffer from biases which can be difficult to mitigate, or are computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a method infer the shape of broad-band power spectra for irregular time series, using a Gaussian process regression method scalable to large datasets. The power spectrum is modelled as a power-law model with one or two bends with flexible slopes. The method is fully Bayesian and we demonstrate its utility using simulated light curves. Finally, Ark 564, a well-known variable Seyfert 1 galaxy, is used as a test case and we find consistent results with the literature using independent X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Swift. We provide publicly available, documented and tested implementations in Python and Julia.</description>

      <title>An ultra-fast intensity interferometry instrument. On-sky demonstration utilizing hybrid single photon counting detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intensity interferometry is a reemerging astronomical technique for performing high angular resolution studies at visible wavelengths, benefiting immensely from the recent improvements in (single) photon detection instrumentation. We aim to develop an ultra-fast, single photon counting and highly stable intensity interferometry instrument for 1m class optical telescopes. The instrument is supposed to record on sky the expected stellar photon rates and reach the temporal coherence times as measured in the laboratory. In addition, all components, especially the photon detection hardware, of the instrument should be easily upgradeable with custom hardware currently being developed. The collimated telescope output is spectrally filtered via an ultra narrow band pass of 2nm at a central wavelength of 405nm. We use hybrid photon detectors (HPDs) for single photon detection and a constant fraction discriminator (CFD) for signal conditioning. A time to digital converter (TDC) is used for time stamping. The combination of HPDs and CFDs is optimized for large active area and high timing resolution. We successfully measured photon bunching of three bright A-type stars -Vega, Altair and Deneb at the 1.04m Omicron telescope of C2PU (Centre P\'edagogique Plan\`ete Univers) at the Calern Observatory in the south of France. In all cases the observed coherence time fits well to both the pre-calculated expectations as well as the values measured in preceding laboratory tests. We obtained the previously estimated photon count rates at the telescope and achieved highly stable coupling of the star light to the detectors. Utilizing a new class of large area single photon detectors based on multichannel plate amplification, high resolution spatial intensity interferometry experiments are within reach at 1m diameter class telescopes within one night of observation time for bright stars.</description>

      <title>A measurement of atmospheric circular polarization with POLARBEAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18154v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At millimeter wavelengths, the atmospheric emission is circularly polarized owing to the Zeeman splitting of molecular oxygen by the Earth's magnetic field. We report a measurement of the signal in the 150 GHz band using 3 years of observational data with the \textsc{Polarbear} project. Non-idealities of a continuously rotating half-wave plate (HWP) partially convert circularly polarized light to linearly polarized light. While \textsc{Polarbear} detectors are sensitive to linear polarization, this effect makes them sensitive to circular polarization. Although this was not the intended use, we utilized this conversion to measure circular polarization. We reconstruct the azimuthal gradient of the circular polarization signal and measure its dependency from the scanning direction and the detector bandpass. We compare the signal with a simulation based on atmospheric emission theory, the detector bandpass, and the HWP leakage spectrum model. We find the ratio of the observed azimuthal slope to the simulated slope is $0.92 \pm 0.01\rm{(stat)} \pm 0.07\rm{(sys)}$. This ratio corresponds to a brightness temperature of $3.8\,\mathrm{m K}$ at the effective band center of $121.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$ and bandwidth of $3.5\,\mathrm{GHz}$ estimated from representative detector bandpass and the spectrum of Zeeman emission. This result validates our understanding of the instrument and reinforces the feasibility of measuring the circular polarization using the imperfection of continuously rotating HWP. Continuously rotating HWP is popular in ongoing and future cosmic microwave background experiments to modulate the polarized signal. This work shows a method for signal extraction and leakage subtraction that can help measuring circular polarization in such experiments.</description>

Abstract: We present Vela, an efficient, modular, easy-to-use Bayesian pulsar timing and noise analysis package written in Julia. Vela provides an independent, efficient, and parallelized implementation of the full non-linear pulsar timing and noise model along with a Python binding named pyvela. One-time operations such as data file input, clock corrections, and solar system ephemeris computations are performed by pyvela with the help of the PINT pulsar timing package. Its reliability is ensured via careful design utilizing Julia's type system, strict version control, and an exhaustive test suite. This paper describes the design and usage of Vela focusing on the narrowband paradigm.</description>

      <title>Communication Constellation Design of Minimum Number of Satellites with Continuous Coverage and Inter-Satellite Link</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent advancement in research on distributed space systems that operate a large number of satellites as a single system urges the need for the investigation of satellite constellations. Communication constellations can be used to construct global or regional communication networks using inter-satellite and ground-to-satellite links. This study examines two challenges of communication constellations: continuous coverage and inter-satellite link connectivity. The bounded Voronoi diagram and APC decomposition are presented as continuous coverage analysis methods. For continuity analysis of the inter-satellite link, the relative motion between adjacent orbital planes is used to derive analytic solutions. The Walker-Delta constellation and common ground-track constellation design methods are introduced as examples to verify the analysis methods. The common ground-track constellations are classified into quasi-symmetric and optimal constellations. The optimal common ground-track constellation is optimized using the BILP algorithm. The simulation results compare the performance of the communication constellations according to various design methods.</description>

      <title>The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument on the Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched on September 02, 2023. SUIT continuously provides, near-simultaneous full-disk and region-of-interest images of the Sun, slicing through the photosphere and chromosphere and covering a field of view up to 1.5 solar radii. For this purpose, SUIT uses 11 filters tuned at different wavelengths in the 200{--}400~nm range, including the Mg~{\sc ii} h~and~k and Ca~{\sc ii}~H spectral lines. The observations made by SUIT help us understand the magnetic coupling of the lower and middle solar atmosphere. In addition, for the first time, it allows the measurements of spatially resolved solar broad-band radiation in the near and mid ultraviolet, which will help constrain the variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance in a wavelength range that is central for the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere. This paper discusses the details of the instrument and data products.</description>

      <title>Detectability of Emission from Exoplanet Outflows Calculated by pyTPCI, a New 1D Radiation-Hydrodynamic Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoevaporation in exoplanet atmospheres is thought to contribute to the shaping of the small planet radius valley. Escaping atmospheres have been detected in transmission across a variety of exoplanet types, from hot Jupiters to mini-Neptunes. However, no work has yet considered whether outflows might also be detectable in emission. We introduce pyTPCI, a new, open-source self-consistent 1D radiative-hydrodynamics code that is an improved version of The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface. We use pyTPCI to model seven exoplanets (HD 189733b, HD 209458b, WASP-69b, WASP-107b, TOI-1430b, TOI-560b, and HAT-P-32b) at varying metallicities and compute their emission spectra to investigate their detectability across a variety of spectral lines. We calculate the eclipse depths and signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) of these lines for a 10m class telescope with a high-resolution spectrograph, taking into account appropriate line broadening mechanisms. We show that the most detectable spectral lines tend to be the 589 nm Na I doublet and the 1083 nm metastable helium triplet. Halpha and Mg I 457 nm are moderately strong for some planets at some metallicities, but they are almost always optically thin, so some of their emission may not be from the outflow. The planet with the highest-flux, highest-eclipse-depth, and highest-SNR lines is HD 189733b, with a Na I eclipse depth of 410 ppm and SNR of 2.4 per eclipse, and a He* eclipse depth of 170 ppm and SNR of 1.3. These signals would be marginally detectable with Keck if 3-10 eclipses were observed, assuming (over-optimistically) photon limited observations.</description>
