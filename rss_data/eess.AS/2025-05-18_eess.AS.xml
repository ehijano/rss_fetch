      <title>SongEval: A Benchmark Dataset for Song Aesthetics Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aesthetics serve as an implicit and important criterion in song generation tasks that reflect human perception beyond objective metrics. However, evaluating the aesthetics of generated songs remains a fundamental challenge, as the appreciation of music is highly subjective. Existing evaluation metrics, such as embedding-based distances, are limited in reflecting the subjective and perceptual aspects that define musical appeal. To address this issue, we introduce SongEval, the first open-source, large-scale benchmark dataset for evaluating the aesthetics of full-length songs. SongEval includes over 2,399 songs in full length, summing up to more than 140 hours, with aesthetic ratings from 16 professional annotators with musical backgrounds. Each song is evaluated across five key dimensions: overall coherence, memorability, naturalness of vocal breathing and phrasing, clarity of song structure, and overall musicality. The dataset covers both English and Chinese songs, spanning nine mainstream genres. Moreover, to assess the effectiveness of song aesthetic evaluation, we conduct experiments using SongEval to predict aesthetic scores and demonstrate better performance than existing objective evaluation metrics in predicting human-perceived musical quality.</description>

      <title>Anti-aliasing of neural distortion effects via model fine tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have become ubiquitous with guitar distortion effects modelling in recent years. Despite their ability to yield perceptually convincing models, they are susceptible to frequency aliasing when driven by high frequency and high gain inputs. Nonlinear activation functions create both the desired harmonic distortion and unwanted aliasing distortion as the bandwidth of the signal is expanded beyond the Nyquist frequency. Here, we present a method for reducing aliasing in neural models via a teacher-student fine tuning approach, where the teacher is a pre-trained model with its weights frozen, and the student is a copy of this with learnable parameters. The student is fine-tuned against an aliasing-free dataset generated by passing sinusoids through the original model and removing non-harmonic components from the output spectra. Our results show that this method significantly suppresses aliasing for both long-short-term-memory networks (LSTM) and temporal convolutional networks (TCN). In the majority of our case studies, the reduction in aliasing was greater than that achieved by two times oversampling. One side-effect of the proposed method is that harmonic distortion components are also affected. This adverse effect was found to be model-dependent, with the LSTM models giving the best balance between anti-aliasing and preserving the perceived similarity to an analog reference device.</description>

      <title>LipDiffuser: Lip-to-Speech Generation with Conditional Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present LipDiffuser, a conditional diffusion model for lip-to-speech generation synthesizing natural and intelligible speech directly from silent video recordings. Our approach leverages the magnitude-preserving ablated diffusion model (MP-ADM) architecture as a denoiser model. To effectively condition the model, we incorporate visual features using magnitude-preserving feature-wise linear modulation (MP-FiLM) alongside speaker embeddings. A neural vocoder then reconstructs the speech waveform from the generated mel-spectrograms. Evaluations on LRS3 and TCD-TIMIT demonstrate that LipDiffuser outperforms existing lip-to-speech baselines in perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity, while remaining competitive in downstream automatic speech recognition (ASR). These findings are also supported by a formal listening experiment. Extensive ablation studies and cross-dataset evaluation confirm the effectiveness and generalization capabilities of our approach.</description>

      <title>NeoLightning: A Modern Reimagination of Gesture-Based Sound Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces NeoLightning, a modern reinterpretation of the Buchla Lightning. NeoLightning preserves the innovative spirit of Don Buchla's "Buchla Lightning" (introduced in the 1990s) while making its gesture-based interaction accessible to contemporary users. While the original Buchla Lightning and many other historical instruments were groundbreaking in their time, they are now largely unsupported, limiting user interaction to indirect experiences. To address this, NeoLightning leverages MediaPipe for deep learning-based gesture recognition and employs Max/MSP and Processing for real-time multimedia processing. The redesigned system offers precise, low-latency gesture recognition and immersive 3D interaction. By merging the creative spirit of the original Lightning with modern advancements, NeoLightning redefines gesture-based musical interaction, expanding possibilities for expressive performance and interactive sound design.</description>

      <title>Multi-Stage Speaker Diarization for Noisy Classrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Speaker diarization, the process of identifying "who spoke when" in audio recordings, is essential for understanding classroom dynamics. However, classroom settings present distinct challenges, including poor recording quality, high levels of background noise, overlapping speech, and the difficulty of accurately capturing children's voices. This study investigates the effectiveness of multi-stage diarization models using Nvidia's NeMo diarization pipeline. We assess the impact of denoising on diarization accuracy and compare various voice activity detection (VAD) models, including self-supervised transformer-based frame-wise VAD models. We also explore a hybrid VAD approach that integrates Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) word-level timestamps with frame-level VAD predictions. We conduct experiments using two datasets from English speaking classrooms to separate teacher vs. student speech and to separate all speakers. Our results show that denoising significantly improves the Diarization Error Rate (DER) by reducing the rate of missed speech. Additionally, training on both denoised and noisy datasets leads to substantial performance gains in noisy conditions. The hybrid VAD model leads to further improvements in speech detection, achieving a DER as low as 17% in teacher-student experiments and 45% in all-speaker experiments. However, we also identified trade-offs between voice activity detection and speaker confusion. Overall, our study highlights the effectiveness of multi-stage diarization models and integrating ASR-based information for enhancing speaker diarization in noisy classroom environments.</description>

      <title>BanglaFake: Constructing and Evaluating a Specialized Bengali Deepfake Audio Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deepfake audio detection is challenging for low-resource languages like Bengali due to limited datasets and subtle acoustic features. To address this, we introduce BangalFake, a Bengali Deepfake Audio Dataset with 12,260 real and 13,260 deepfake utterances. Synthetic speech is generated using SOTA Text-to-Speech (TTS) models, ensuring high naturalness and quality. We evaluate the dataset through both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Mean Opinion Score (MOS) from 30 native speakers shows Robust-MOS of 3.40 (naturalness) and 4.01 (intelligibility). t-SNE visualization of MFCCs highlights real vs. fake differentiation challenges. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for advancing deepfake detection in Bengali, addressing the limitations of low-resource language research.</description>

      <title>Survey of End-to-End Multi-Speaker Automatic Speech Recognition for Monaural Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monaural multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) remains challenging due to data scarcity and the intrinsic difficulty of recognizing and attributing words to individual speakers, particularly in overlapping speech. Recent advances have driven the shift from cascade systems to end-to-end (E2E) architectures, which reduce error propagation and better exploit the synergy between speech content and speaker identity. Despite rapid progress in E2E multi-speaker ASR, the field lacks a comprehensive review of recent developments. This survey provides a systematic taxonomy of E2E neural approaches for multi-speaker ASR, highlighting recent advances and comparative analysis. Specifically, we analyze: (1) architectural paradigms (SIMO vs.~SISO) for pre-segmented audio, analyzing their distinct characteristics and trade-offs; (2) recent architectural and algorithmic improvements based on these two paradigms; (3) extensions to long-form speech, including segmentation strategy and speaker-consistent hypothesis stitching. Further, we (4) evaluate and compare methods across standard benchmarks. We conclude with a discussion of open challenges and future research directions towards building robust and scalable multi-speaker ASR.</description>

      <title>Classifying Shelf Life Quality of Pineapples by Combining Audio and Visual Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the shelf life quality of pineapples using non-destructive methods is a crucial step to reduce waste and increase income. In this paper, a multimodal and multiview classification model was constructed to classify pineapples into four quality levels based on audio and visual characteristics. For research purposes, we compiled and released the PQC500 dataset consisting of 500 pineapples with two modalities: one was tapping pineapples to record sounds by multiple microphones and the other was taking pictures by multiple cameras at different locations, providing multimodal and multi-view audiovisual features. We modified the contrastive audiovisual masked autoencoder to train the cross-modal-based classification model by abundant combinations of audio and visual pairs. In addition, we proposed to sample a compact size of training data for efficient computation. The experiments were evaluated under various data and model configurations, and the results demonstrated that the proposed cross-modal model trained using audio-major sampling can yield 84% accuracy, outperforming the unimodal models of only audio and only visual by 6% and 18%, respectively.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{A}LLM4ADD$: Unlocking the Capabilities of Audio Large Language Models for Audio Deepfake Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio deepfake detection (ADD) has grown increasingly important due to the rise of high-fidelity audio generative models and their potential for misuse. Given that audio large language models (ALLMs) have made significant progress in various audio processing tasks, a heuristic question arises: Can ALLMs be leveraged to solve ADD?. In this paper, we first conduct a comprehensive zero-shot evaluation of ALLMs on ADD, revealing their ineffectiveness in detecting fake audio. To enhance their performance, we propose $\mathcal{A}LLM4ADD$, an ALLM-driven framework for ADD. Specifically, we reformulate ADD task as an audio question answering problem, prompting the model with the question: "Is this audio fake or real?". We then perform supervised fine-tuning to enable the ALLM to assess the authenticity of query audio. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that our ALLM-based method can achieve superior performance in fake audio detection, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. As a pioneering study, we anticipate that this work will inspire the research community to leverage ALLMs to develop more effective ADD systems.</description>

      <title>Audio Turing Test: Benchmarking the Human-likeness of Large Language Model-based Text-to-Speech Systems in Chinese</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved text-to-speech (TTS) systems, enhancing control over speech style, naturalness, and emotional expression, which brings TTS Systems closer to human-level performance. Although the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains the standard for TTS System evaluation, it suffers from subjectivity, environmental inconsistencies, and limited interpretability. Existing evaluation datasets also lack a multi-dimensional design, often neglecting factors such as speaking styles, context diversity, and trap utterances, which is particularly evident in Chinese TTS evaluation. To address these challenges, we introduce the Audio Turing Test (ATT), a multi-dimensional Chinese corpus dataset ATT-Corpus paired with a simple, Turing-Test-inspired evaluation protocol. Instead of relying on complex MOS scales or direct model comparisons, ATT asks evaluators to judge whether a voice sounds human. This simplification reduces rating bias and improves evaluation robustness. To further support rapid model development, we also finetune Qwen2-Audio-Instruct with human judgment data as Auto-ATT for automatic evaluation. Experimental results show that ATT effectively differentiates models across specific capability dimensions using its multi-dimensional design. Auto-ATT also demonstrates strong alignment with human evaluations, confirming its value as a fast and reliable assessment tool. The white-box ATT-Corpus and Auto-ATT can be found in ATT Hugging Face Collection (https://huggingface.co/collections/meituan/audio-turing-test-682446320368164faeaf38a4).</description>

      <title>Seeing Sound, Hearing Sight: Uncovering Modality Bias and Conflict of AI models in Sound Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Imagine hearing a dog bark and turning toward the sound only to see a parked car, while the real, silent dog sits elsewhere. Such sensory conflicts test perception, yet humans reliably resolve them by prioritizing sound over misleading visuals. Despite advances in multimodal AI integrating vision and audio, little is known about how these systems handle cross-modal conflicts or whether they favor one modality. In this study, we systematically examine modality bias and conflict resolution in AI sound localization. We assess leading multimodal models and benchmark them against human performance in psychophysics experiments across six audiovisual conditions, including congruent, conflicting, and absent cues. Humans consistently outperform AI, demonstrating superior resilience to conflicting or missing visuals by relying on auditory information. In contrast, AI models often default to visual input, degrading performance to near chance levels. To address this, we finetune a state-of-the-art model using a stereo audio-image dataset generated via 3D simulations. Even with limited training data, the refined model surpasses existing benchmarks. Notably, it also mirrors human-like horizontal localization bias favoring left-right precision-likely due to the stereo audio structure reflecting human ear placement. These findings underscore how sensory input quality and system architecture shape multimodal representation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Improving Inference-Time Optimisation for Vocal Effects Style Transfer with a Gaussian Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Style Transfer with Inference-Time Optimisation (ST-ITO) is a recent approach for transferring the applied effects of a reference audio to a raw audio track. It optimises the effect parameters to minimise the distance between the style embeddings of the processed audio and the reference. However, this method treats all possible configurations equally and relies solely on the embedding space, which can lead to unrealistic or biased results. We address this pitfall by introducing a Gaussian prior derived from a vocal preset dataset, DiffVox, over the parameter space. The resulting optimisation is equivalent to maximum-a-posteriori estimation. Evaluations on vocal effects transfer on the MedleyDB dataset show significant improvements across metrics compared to baselines, including a blind audio effects estimator, nearest-neighbour approaches, and uncalibrated ST-ITO. The proposed calibration reduces parameter mean squared error by up to 33% and matches the reference style better. Subjective evaluations with 16 participants confirm our method's superiority, especially in limited data regimes. This work demonstrates how incorporating prior knowledge in inference time enhances audio effects transfer, paving the way for more effective and realistic audio processing systems.</description>

      <title>LegoSLM: Connecting LLM with Speech Encoder using CTC Posteriors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, large-scale pre-trained speech encoders and Large Language Models (LLMs) have been released, which show state-of-the-art performance on a range of spoken language processing tasks including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). To effectively combine both models for better performance, continuous speech prompts, and ASR error correction have been adopted. However, these methods are prone to suboptimal performance or are inflexible. In this paper, we propose a new paradigm, LegoSLM, that bridges speech encoders and LLMs using the ASR posterior matrices. The speech encoder is trained to generate Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) posteriors over the LLM vocabulary, which are used to reconstruct pseudo-audio embeddings by computing a weighted sum of the LLM input embeddings. These embeddings are concatenated with text embeddings in the LLM input space. Using the well-performing USM and Gemma models as an example, we demonstrate that our proposed LegoSLM method yields good performance on both ASR and speech translation tasks. By connecting USM with Gemma models, we can get an average of 49% WERR over the USM-CTC baseline on 8 MLS testsets. The trained model also exhibits modularity in a range of settings -- after fine-tuning the Gemma model weights, the speech encoder can be switched and combined with the LLM in a zero-shot fashion. Additionally, we propose to control the decode-time influence of the USM and LLM using a softmax temperature, which shows effectiveness in domain adaptation.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Approaches to Vocal Register Classification in Contemporary Male Pop Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.11378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For singers of all experience levels, one of the most daunting challenges in learning technical repertoire is navigating placement and vocal register in and around the passagio (passage between chest voice and head voice registers). Particularly in pop music, where a single artist may use a variety of timbre's and textures to achieve a desired quality, it can be difficult to identify what vocal register within the vocal range a singer is using. This paper presents two methods for classifying vocal registers in an audio signal of male pop music through the analysis of textural features of mel-spectrogram images. Additionally, we will discuss the practical integration of these models for vocal analysis tools, and introduce a concurrently developed software called AVRA which stands for Automatic Vocal Register Analysis. Our proposed methods achieved consistent classification of vocal register through both Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, which supports the promise of more robust classification possibilities across more voice types and genres of singing.</description>

      <title>SupertonicTTS: Towards Highly Scalable and Efficient Text-to-Speech System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel text-to-speech (TTS) system, namely SupertonicTTS, for improved scalability and efficiency in speech synthesis. SupertonicTTS comprises three components: a speech autoencoder for continuous latent representation, a text-to-latent module leveraging flow-matching for text-to-latent mapping, and an utterance-level duration predictor. To enable a lightweight architecture, we employ a low-dimensional latent space, temporal compression of latents, and ConvNeXt blocks. We further simplify the TTS pipeline by operating directly on raw character-level text and employing cross-attention for text-speech alignment, thus eliminating the need for grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) modules and external aligners. In addition, we introduce context-sharing batch expansion that accelerates loss convergence and stabilizes text-speech alignment. Experimental results demonstrate that SupertonicTTS achieves competitive performance while significantly reducing architectural complexity and computational overhead compared to contemporary TTS models. Audio samples demonstrating the capabilities of SupertonicTTS are available at: https://supertonictts.github.io/.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Speech Data in Reducing Toxicity Detection Bias</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text toxicity detection systems exhibit significant biases, producing disproportionate rates of false positives on samples mentioning demographic groups. But what about toxicity detection in speech? To investigate the extent to which text-based biases are mitigated by speech-based systems, we produce a set of high-quality group annotations for the multilingual MuTox dataset, and then leverage these annotations to systematically compare speech- and text-based toxicity classifiers. Our findings indicate that access to speech data during inference supports reduced bias against group mentions, particularly for ambiguous and disagreement-inducing samples. Our results also suggest that improving classifiers, rather than transcription pipelines, is more helpful for reducing group bias. We publicly release our annotations and provide recommendations for future toxicity dataset construction.</description>

      <title>ImprovNet -- Generating Controllable Musical Improvisations with Iterative Corruption Refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04522v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite deep learning's remarkable advances in style transfer across various domains, generating controllable performance-level musical style transfer for complete symbolically represented musical works remains a challenging area of research. Much of this is owed to limited datasets, especially for genres such as jazz, and the lack of unified models that can handle multiple music generation tasks. This paper presents ImprovNet, a transformer-based architecture that generates expressive and controllable musical improvisations through a self-supervised corruption-refinement training strategy. The improvisational style transfer is aimed at making meaningful modifications to one or more musical elements - melody, harmony or rhythm of the original composition with respect to the target genre. ImprovNet unifies multiple capabilities within a single model: it can perform cross-genre and intra-genre improvisations, harmonize melodies with genre-specific styles, and execute short prompt continuation and infilling tasks. The model's iterative generation framework allows users to control the degree of style transfer and structural similarity to the original composition. Objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate ImprovNet's effectiveness in generating musically coherent improvisations while maintaining structural relationships with the original pieces. The model outperforms Anticipatory Music Transformer in short continuation and infilling tasks and successfully achieves recognizable genre conversion, with 79\% of participants correctly identifying jazz-style improvisations of classical pieces.

      <title>Supervised contrastive learning from weakly-labeled audio segments for musical version matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16936v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Detecting musical versions (different renditions of the same piece) is a challenging task with important applications. Because of the ground truth nature, existing approaches match musical versions at the track level (e.g., whole song). However, most applications require to match them at the segment level (e.g., 20s chunks). In addition, existing approaches resort to classification and triplet losses, disregarding more recent losses that could bring meaningful improvements. In this paper, we propose a method to learn from weakly annotated segments, together with a contrastive loss variant that outperforms well-studied alternatives. The former is based on pairwise segment distance reductions, while the latter modifies an existing loss following decoupling, hyper-parameter, and geometric considerations. With these two elements, we do not only achieve state-of-the-art results in the standard track-level evaluation, but we also obtain a breakthrough performance in a segment-level evaluation. We believe that, due to the generality of the challenges addressed here, the proposed methods may find utility in domains beyond audio or musical version matching.</description>
