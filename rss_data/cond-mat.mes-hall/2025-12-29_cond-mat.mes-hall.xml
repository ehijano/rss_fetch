      <title>Orbitally tuned composite-fermion metal-to-superfluid transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective interaction between composite fermions, set entirely by the Coulomb potential and the underlying electronic Landau level orbitals, can stabilize exotic fractional quantum Hall states. In particular, half-filled Landau levels with different orbital character can host either metallic or paired phases of composite fermions. Here, we leverage experimental control over the orbital composition to realize a composite-fermion pairing transition in the first excited Landau level of bilayer graphene. Transport measurements at filling factors v = 9/2 and 11/2 reveal conductive states giving way to well-developed plateaus with increasing displacement fields. These states are insensitive to an in-plane magnetic field, indicating single-component ground states and thus pointing at non-Abelian orders. Our numerical study, based on displacement-field-dependent Landau-level wavefunctions, supports the orbital origin of the pairing transition and suggests Moore-Read or anti-Pfaffian ground states.</description>

      <title>Giant universal conductance fluctuations in the antiferromagnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic magnetic topological insulators can host quantum states with quantized magneto-electric responses, such as the axion and Chern insulators states evidenced in ultra-thin MnBi2Te4 films. Yet, whereas quantization is investigated thoroughly, transport properties related to the phase of charge carriers remains unexplored. Here, we study quantum coherent transport in mesoscopic Hall bars fabricated from thick exfoliated MnBi2Te4 flakes, and reveal the longest phase-coherence length ever observed in a mesoscopic magnet (about 500nm at 1K), associated to 2D topological surface states. In the fully-coherent regime, significant non-local contributions to quantum interference up to the micron scale lead to giant-amplitude universal conductance fluctuations (about 20e2/h). In the self-averaging regime, the statistical properties of conductance fluctuations confirm the 2D nature of quantum interference and different dephasing mechanisms are identified, as due to either magnetism or magnetic flux through coherent loops. Remarkably, the weak decoherence in magnetic topological insulator nanostructures show their potential to realize novel quantum spin interferometers based on dephasing by local magnetic textures at liquid-helium temperatures.</description>

      <title>Higher-order exceptional ring semimetal with real hinge states in phononic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian topological phase, with the novel concepts such as exceptional points and skin effect, has opened up a new paradigm beyond Hermitian topological physics. Exceptional ring semimetal, featured by a stable ring of exceptional points in three dimensions, exhibits first-order topological properties, including topological surface states and surface-dependent skin effect. Nevertheless, despite extensive research on Hermitian higher-order insulators and semimetals, higher-order exceptional ring semimetal is just emerging. Here, we report the first realization of a higher-order Weyl exceptional ring semimetal in a three-dimensional lossy phononic crystal. The non-Hermitian higher-order topology reflects in the topological hinge states and hinge-dependent skin effect. Counterintuitively, the topological hinge states maintain purely real energy even under a high loss level, ensuring robust hinge-state propagation. Our findings evidence the non-Hermitian higher-order bulk-boundary correspondence of exceptional ring semimetal, and may pave the way to non-Hermitian functional acoustic devices.</description>

      <title>Entangled Moire Chern Insulator in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphene-based moire superlattices exhibit novel quantum phenomena driven by pronounced interactions, leading to topological corrected states like orbital Chern insulators exhibiting quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE). Typically, intrinsic Chern insulators are stabilized at odd moir\'e fillings, as even fillings often result in valley-balanced, topologically trivial states at zero magnetic field. In our work, we report the observation of an intrinsic Chern insulator with C = 1 state at moire filling v = 2 in rhombohedral octalayer graphene (R8G)/hBN moire superlattice. Observing such Chern insulators in particular with C = 1 at v = 2 is intriguing, as each moir\'e band carries Chern number C = 1 or -1. We further demonstrate such a state can originate from the entanglement between the low-energy moire flat bands and high-energy remote bands according to the Hartree-Fock calculation. Our findings extend the known topological phase diagram of rhombohedral multilayer graphene (RMG) moire systems and establish this platform as highly promising for investigating strong electron correlations and multiband hybridized transport.</description>

      <title>Fractionalization and Entanglement of High Chern Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of fractional Chern insulators opens up the possibility of exploring fractionally charged excitations and anyonic statistics in the absence of a magnetic field. One of the central questions is whether lattice-based systems can give rise to radically new states, distinct from those observed in traditional fractional quantum Hall systems. In this work, we investigate a new type of moire flat band system composed of Bernal bilayer graphene and rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. First, we discover an unprecedented richness of states with high Chern numbers. At v = 1 moire filling, we observe Chern insulators with Chern numbers C = 4 and 3. Flanking v = 3 state, we observe a series of Chern insulators from C = 2 to C = 7. All of these states exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. Remarkably, we observe an exotic fractional Chern insulator with C = 7/3 around v = 2/3 which is beyond all known fractional Chern insulators described by either the Jain sequence as or current high Chern theory. Our work expands the understanding of fractionally charged excitations beyond the Landau level basis and offers a new moir\'e platform for exploring anyons.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Chaos in the Interface Growth of Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that topological insulators exhibit an intrinsic interfacial instability that amplifies small interface fluctuations, resulting in chaotic behavior during interface growth. This mechanism is fundamentally different from conventional interfacial instabilities in crystal growth that are driven by external non-uniformities such as surface diffusion, and instead arises from intrinsic electronic properties of topological materials. We find that the boundary states of topological insulators have a pronounced impact on the surface stiffness, which quantifies how strongly a surface resists changes in its shape or orientation. While trivial insulators possess positive stiffness that smooths out surface roughness, topological insulators exhibit negative stiffness that amplifies small shape fluctuations. We derive an effective equation of the interface growth with this negative stiffness and demonstrate that the interface dynamics is governed by the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, a prototypical nonlinear equation exhibiting spatiotemporal chaos.</description>

      <title>Proximity-Induced Spin-Orbit Torque in Graphene on a Trigonal CrSBr Monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles and quantum transport study of proximity-induced spin-orbit torque (SOT) in graphene on a trigonal CrSBr monolayer. Density functional theory combined with nonequilibrium Green's function calculations shows that the CrSBr substrate induces spin polarization and a sizable exchange splitting in the graphene Dirac states. The resulting current-driven spin density in graphene generates a self-SOT on the Dirac electrons. The proximity-induced exchange field breaks time-reversal symmetry and gives rise to a purely odd SOT component, while the even contribution vanishes. The torque magnitude exhibits a strong angular dependence with phase shifts arising from the noncollinearity between the CrSBr magnetization and the induced magnetic moments in graphene. Monte Carlo simulations based on the calculated exchange parameters predict a Curie temperature of approximately 304 K, confirming the robustness of ferromagnetism in the trigonal CrSBr monolayer. These results identify graphene/CrSBr heterostructures as a promising platform for room-temperature two-dimensional spintronics.</description>

      <title>Non-Hermitian topological devices with Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-terminal topological devices are a new generation of electronic devices with quantized properties robust against imperfections. In magnetic topological insulators, dissipationless edge states give functional devices in zero magnetic field, of interest for quantum metrology (resistance standard) or topological electronics (Chern networks). Here we show that a new generation of simple quantum circuits (disk, ring) with non-Hermitian topology, based on the interconnection of 1D Chern states in the quantum anomalous Hall regime, can have a much stronger quantization of their invariant than that of the Chern invariant itself, when measured in a non-metrology grade setup - that is, in industry-relevant conditions. Remarkably, the chirality-related topological skin effect is realized without the need of a magnetic field or an electrical gate, with a record degree of localization for a quantum Hall device. This new type of topological quantum devices based on magnets, with an exponential response that can be switched at small magnetic fields (about 200mT), can operate at liquid-Helium temperature with a good quantization and have some potential as cryogenic sensors for applications in high-precision impedance or magnetic field measurements.</description>

      <title>High-Temperature Quantum Oscillations of a Non-equilibrium Non-Fermi Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A periodically driven Fermi gas coupled to a simple boson bath reaches a non-equilibrium steady-state occupation with sharp non-analyticities at certain momenta. Here, we demonstrate that these non-analyticities behave as emergent Fermi surfaces by showing that they give rise to quantum oscillations of observables with a period controlled by the effective Fermi surface area enclosed by these non-analyticities. However, these oscillations have several striking differences with standard equilibrium quantum oscillations. For example, they remain non-analytic at finite temperatures, their amplitude can survive up to extremely high temperatures comparable to the frequency of the drive, and they can display non-monotonic temperature dependence completely at odds with standard Lifshits-Kosevich behavior.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling and defect-induced transport modulation in twisted bilayer graphene superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum tunneling of charge carriers through a periodic superlattice in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with rectangular potential barriers, including the presence of a defect, using a low-energy continuum model. Transmission probabilities are numerically analyzed depending on the parameters of the problem, highlighting the roles of twist angle, number of barriers, barrier geometry, and the presence of a defect barrier within the superlattice. Our numerical results reveal that transmission is highly sensitive to these parameters: reducing the twist angle changes the number, depth, and position of transmission gaps and resonance peaks. The presence of defect affects the transmission, leading to the appearance of tunneling states inside transmission gaps with energy position can be tuned by the well width. At low incident energy, the transmission for normally incident electrons is perfect or nearly perfect, independent of the twist angle and the number of barriers. However, at large incident energy, the transmission becomes distinctly anisotropic, reflecting the separation of Dirac cones induced by twist angle variations. The presence of defects, particularly at smaller twist angles, provides additional control of tunneling behavior, allowing complete suppression of Klein tunneling under certain conditions. These findings extend the established understanding of miniband transport in periodic graphene systems and open new possibilities for twist-tunable nanoelectronic and quantum devices.</description>

      <title>A Cohomological Framework for Topological Phases from Momentum-Space Crystallographic Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crystallographic groups are conventionally studied in real space to characterize crystal symmetries. Recent work has recognized that when these symmetries are realized projectively, momentum space inherently accommodates nonsymmorphic symmetries, thereby evoking the concept of \textit{momentum-space crystallographic groups} (MCGs). Here, we reveal that the cohomology of MCGs encodes fundamental data of crystalline topological band structures. Specifically, the collection of second cohomology groups, $H^2(\Gamma_F,\mathbb{Z})$, for all MCGs $\Gamma_F$, provides an exhaustive classification of Abelian crystalline topological insulators, serving as an effective approximation to the full crystalline topological classification. Meanwhile, the third cohomology groups $H^3(\Gamma_F,\mathbb{Z})$ across all MCGs exhaustively classify all possible twistings of point-group actions on the Brillouin torus, essential data for twisted equivariant K-theory. Furthermore, we establish the isomorphism $H^{n+1}(\Gamma_F,\mathbb{Z})\cong H^n\big(\Gamma_F,\operatorname{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))\big)$ for $ n\ge 1$, where $\operatorname{\mathcal{F}}(\mathbb{R}^d_F,U(1))$ denotes the space of continuous $U(1)$-valued functions on the $d$D momentum space $\mathbb{R}^d_F$. The case $n=1$ yields a complete set of topological invariants formulated in purely algebraic terms, which differs fundamentally from the conventional formulation in terms of differential forms. The case $n=2$, analogously, provides a fully algebraic description for all such twistings. Thus, the cohomological theory of MCGs serves as a key technical framework for analyzing crystalline topological phases within the general setting of projective symmetry.</description>

      <title>Creation of domain-wall skyrmions in chiral magnets with Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics and demagnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absorption of an isolated bulk magnetic skyrmion into an empty domain wall in a chiral ferromagnetic system is studied using the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with and without the demagnetization effect taken into account. The full phase diagram of creation versus repulsion or annihilation is mapped out in case of both Bloch-type and N\'eel-type DMI, with and without demagnetization. Finally, the unstable domain wall, realizable with a setup of several external magnets, contains the theoretical possibility of producing a 1-dimensional version of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, which in turn can create a number of skyrmion-anti-skyrmion pairs engulfed in the domain wall: We denote them domain-wall-skyrmion-anti-domain-wall-skyrmion pairs.</description>

      <title>Local Sources of Phase Curvature and Rigidity in Finite Quantum Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finite coherent quantum systems exhibit a nontrivial response to local sources of phase curvature, which cannot be reduced to conventional forces, disorder-induced localization, or simple gap opening. Here we show that, in finite fermionic rings, a localized symmetry-breaking perturbation acts as a source of phase curvature in the many-body Hilbert space, inducing an anomalous breakdown of global phase rigidity. Starting from a Hubbard-Peierls description, we derive an effective field-theoretic functional in which the inverse local susceptibility defines a phase-rigidity scale controlled by system size and electronic correlations. This rigidity quantifies the resistance of a coherent many-body state to geometric deformation of its phase structure, rather than to energetic localization. We demonstrate that interactions enhance phase rigidity in finite systems, counter to naive expectations based on single-particle localization, and that rigidity loss may occur without a direct correspondence to gap formation. Molecular pi-electron rings and mesoscopic quantum circuits provide experimentally accessible realizations of this regime, establishing a direct connection between local phase curvature, geometric rigidity, and coherence-driven phenomena across finite quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Topological constraints on the electronic band structure of hexagonal lattice in a magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of projective lattice symmetry on electronic band structures has attracted significant attention in recent years, particularly in light of growing experimental studies of two-dimensional hexagonal materials in magnetic fields. Yet, most theoretical work to date has focused on the square lattice due to its relative simplicity. In this work, we investigate the role of projective lattice symmetry in a hexagonal lattice with rational magnetic flux, emphasizing the resulting topological constraints on the electronic band structure. We show that, at pi flux, the symmetry in the hexagonal lattice enforces novel Dirac band touchings at E not equal to zero, and for general rational flux it constrains the number of Dirac points at E = 0. We further analyze the symmetry-imposed constraints on the Chern numbers of both isolated gapped bands and band multiplets connected by Dirac-point touchings. Our results demonstrate that these constraints in the hexagonal lattice differ substantially from those in the square lattice.</description>

Abstract: Terahertz (THz) technology shows great potential in 6G communications and imaging, but faces challenges related to detector sensitivity, noise, and cryogenic operation. Here, we integrate interferometric enhancement of absorption (IEA) from a metal reflection layer with a graphene plasmon polariton atomic cavity (PPAC)-based photodetector. The hybrid configuration enhances the in-plane electric field and improves the plasmon-induced thermal gradient. Numerical simulations and photoresponse measurements were employed to systematically investigate the influence of a metal reflective layer on the photothermoelectric behavior of the device, which reveals the IEA design significantly boosts the THz absorption rate in graphene nanostructures and promotes asymmetry in the lateral diffusion of hot carriers. Compared with the bare device, the responsivity of the device is enhanced by approximately 30-folds, while maintaining a response time below 130 microseconds. We further demonstrate the potential of the device to distinguish concealed liquids, advancing high-responsivity, room-temperature, and compact terahertz imaging technology.</description>

      <title>Ferroelectricity in magnon Bose-Einstein condensate: non-reciprocal superfluidity, exceptional points and Majorana bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a ferroelectric instability of a magnon Bose-Einstein condensate, mediated by its interaction with an electric field through a geometric Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase. A distinct feature of the system is the positive feedback loop in which an electric field induces magnon orbital motion via the AC phase, generating electric polarization that in turn enhances the original field. Based on bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) mean-field theory, we show that this feedback drives a spontaneous ferroelectric transition in the magnon superfluid, accompanied by a persistent magnon supercurrent. In the resulting ferroelectric phase, the quasiparticle excitation spectrum becomes nonreciprocal, reflecting spontaneous breaking of spatial inversion symmetry. At the critical point of the transition, the bosonic BdG Hamiltonian exhibits coalescence of both eigenvalues and eigenvectors, forming an exceptional point. The corresponding eigenvector is an equally weighted superposition of bosonic quasiparticle and quasihole states and is invariant under particle-hole transformation, allowing it to be interpreted as a bosonic analog of a Majorana fermion.</description>

      <title>Criticality as a Universal Thermodynamic Requirement for Perfect Intrinsic Superconducting Diodes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting diodes promise dissipation-less rectification, yet intrinsic platforms invariably have very low efficiencies. We reveal a fundamental thermodynamic origin of this behavior that is independent of microscopic details. Denoting $\epsilon = I_c^-/I_c^+$, where $I_c^\pm$ are critical current magnitudes in opposite directions with $I_c^+&gt;I_c^-$ by convention, we show that $\epsilon=0$ is impossible without fine-tuning, while $\epsilon\to0$ can occur but only upon tuning to a critical point \emph{within} the superconducting state. Away from such internal instabilities, using general Landau theory, we derive a lower bound on $\epsilon$ that limits intrinsic diode performance. We illustrate these ideas in a minimal superconductor-Ising model, where the strong nonreciprocity can be seen explicitly. In particular, if the internal transition is continuous, we show that the scaling of $\epsilon$ near the transition is locked to known critical exponents.</description>

      <title>Kondo Effect in Nonreciprocal Response</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral magnetic states give rise to rich phenomena, from the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear electrical current to multiferroics and magnetochiral dichroism. Most of the studies on electrical transport so far have focused on the cases where the magnetic moments are well approximated by classical local moments. Here, we reveal that the coexistence of quantum fluctuations and chiral spin correlations gives rise to a $\log(T)$ temperature dependence in the electrical magnetochiral effect, a nonreciprocal response. Using the Green's function method and a scattering theory approach, we show that the $\log(T)$ temperature dependence occurs through a scattering process similar to that of the Kondo effect. The electrical magnetochiral effect is sensitive to the sign of vector spin chirality and the magnetic field. The results demonstrate that local spin correlations and quantum fluctuations cooperatively induce nontrivial properties in transport phenomena.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Search for Topological Protection in Open Quantum Hardware: The Dissipative Mixed Hodge Module Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Standard spectroscopic protocols model the dynamics of open quantum systems as a superposition of isolated, exponentially decaying eigenmodes. This paradigm fails fundamentally at Exceptional Points, where the eigenbasis collapses and the response becomes dominated by non-diagonalizable Jordan blocks. We resolve this ambiguity by introducing a geometric framework based on \textit{Dissipative Mixed Hodge Modules} (DMHM). By replacing the scalar linewidth with a topological \textit{Weight Filtration}, we derive ``Weight Filtered Spectroscopy'' (WFS)--a protocol that spatially separates decay channels based on the nilpotency rank of the Liouvillian. We demonstrate that WFS acts as a dissipative x-ray, quantifying dissipative leakage in molecular polaritons and certifying topological isolation in Non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm rings. This establishes that topological protection persists as an algebraic invariant even when the spectral gap is closed.</description>

      <title>Defect Engineering for Stabilizing Magnetic and Topological Properties in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: MnBi2Te4 is a versatile platform for exploring diverse topological quantum states, yet its potential is hampered by intrinsic antisite defects. While Sb substitution has been employed to tune the Fermi level towards the charge neutral point, it exacerbates the formation of Mn-Sb antisite defects. Here, we address this challenge by combining first-principles calculations with strategic synthesis to systematically investigate and control antisite defects in Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4. Our calculations reveal that increasing antisite defect density progressively destroys the field-forced magnetic Weyl state, eventually driving the system into a trivial magnetic insulator. Motivated by these findings, we develop an optimized chemical vapor transport method, yielding high-quality Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 crystals with significantly reduced antisite defect density. The emergence of strong Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in the forced ferromagnetic state and a pronounced anomalous Hall effect near charge neutrality, with opposite signs for n- and p-type samples, confirms the type-II Weyl semimetal nature. These findings underscore the critical role of antisite defects in determining the magnetic and topological properties of Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 and establish defect engineering via optimized synthesis as a crucial strategy for realizing its exotic magnetic topological states.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Thermoelectric Properties of Group III-Nitride Biphenylene Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After the synthesis of the carbon biphenylene network (C-BPN), research has increasingly focused on adapting elements from other groups of the periodic table to this lattice structure. In this study, the direction-dependent electronic, thermal, and thermoelectric (TE) properties of semiconducting group-III (group-III = B, Al, Ga, In) nitride biphenylene networks are investigated using the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism in combination with first-principles calculations. Phonon spectra and force field molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to asses the dynamically and thermally stable structures. At room temperature, the lowest phonon thermal conductance values are obtained for InN-BPN, with $\kappa_{\mathrm{ph}}$ = 0.12 nW/K/nm and $\kappa_{\mathrm{ph}}$ = 0.21 nW/K/nm along the armchair and zigzag directions, respectively. The nearly dispersionless valence-band region between the $\Gamma$--$X$ symmetry points causes a sharp increase in the $p$-type electronic transmission, which significantly enhances the $p$-type thermoelectric figure of merit, $zT$. Among the investigated group-III nitride BPNs, InN-BPN exhibits the best performance, with a $p$-type $zT$ value of 2.33 in the zigzag direction at 800 K.</description>

Abstract: The spectral localizer, introduced by Loring in 2015 and Loring and Schulz-Baldes in 2017, is a method to compute the (infinite volume) topological invariant of a quantum Hamiltonian on $\ZZ^d$, as the signature of the (finite) localizer matrix. We present a direct and elementary spectral-theoretic proof treating the $d=1$ and $d=2$ cases on an almost equal footing. Moreover, we re-interpret the localizer as a higher-dimensional topological insulator via the bulk-edge correspondence.</description>

      <title>Chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by interplay of anisotropic exchange interactions in honeycomb ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A variety of distinct anisotropic exchange interactions commonly exist in one magnetic material due to complex crystal, magnetic and orbital symmetries. Here we investigate the effects of multiple anisotropic exchange interactions on topological magnon in a honeycomb ferromagnet, and find a chirality-selective topological magnon phase transition induced by a complicated interplay of Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction (DMI) and pseudo-dipolar interaction (PDI), accompanied by the bulk gap close and reopen with chiral inversion. Moreover, this novel topological phase transition involves band inversion at high symmetry points $K$ and $K'$, which can be regarded as a pseudo-orbital reversal, i.e. magnon valley degree of freedom, implying a new manipulation corresponding to a sign change of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. Indeed, it can be realized in 4$d$ or 5$d$ correlated materials with both spin-orbit coupling and orbital localized states, such as iridates and ruthenates, etc. This novel regulation may have potential applications on magnon devices and topological magnonics.</description>

      <title>Necessary conditions for spin-resolved Josephson diode effect across strongly spin-polarized magnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a set of necessary conditions for the appearance of charge and spin Josephson diode effects across strongly spin-polarized inhomogeneous magnetic materials (FM) placed between two spin-singlet superconductors. Noncoplanarity of the FM's spin texture gives rise to quantum geometric phases, $\Delta\varphi'$, that enter the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR) similarly to the superconducting phase difference, resulting in charge and spin Josephson diode effects. Our study shows that such effects appear if the CPR possesses no phase-inversion center, achieved under the following conditions. First, noncoplanarity of the spin texture is necessary to break the spatial inversion symmetry. Second, both spin bands have to contribute to the transport, i.e., the effect is absent in half-metallic junctions. Third, different band-specific densities of states are required, and this condition is ensured by the strong spin polarization of the FM. Finally, higher harmonics in the CPR are necessary, i.e., the effect is absent in the tunneling limit. However, even in this case, the CPR must not have a phase-inversion center, which is ensured by the restriction of the quantum geometric phase to values $\Delta\varphi'\neq k\pi/2, k\in\mathbb{Z}$. We formulate a minimal phenomenological model that incorporates all these points, qualitatively illustrating our theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We commence our study with review of dispersion interactions in electrolytes. We then reflect on how background media change atom-atom excited-state systems. To highlight the impact of nonlocal media, such as salt solutions, we predict that a new contribution to the resonance interaction energy emerges in a form $\propto e^{-\kappa_{\rm D} \rho}/\rho$. Here $\kappa_{\rm D}$ is the Debye length and $\rho$ is the distance between the atoms. This contribution vanishes at zero temperature, where a new term proportional to $1/\rho^4$ (similar to free space) occurs. This new term is dampened by the electrolyte at large distances, causing it to decrease much faster, proportional to $1/\rho^7$. The long-range electrolyte-induced resonance interaction at finite temperature may, in addition to the dominating van der Waals attraction (which goes as $1/\rho^6$), take part in the molecular formation of biological fluids.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in the van der Waals ferromagnet CrTe2 engineered by Nb doping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and controlling spin dynamics in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets is essential for their application in magnonics and hybrid quantum platforms. Here, we investigate the spin dynamics of the vdW ferromagnet 1T-CrTe_{2} and demonstrate their systematic tunability via niobium (Nb) substitution in Cr_{1-x}Nb_{x}Te_{2}(x=0-0.2). Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy reveals that Nb doping enables wide-band tuning of the resonance frequency from 40 GHz down to the few-GHz regime, accompanied by a moderate increase in the Gilbert damping constant from ~0.066 to ~0.14, while preserving robust room-temperature ferromagnetism. Complementary magnetometry shows a concurrent reduction of the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization with increasing Nb content. Density functional theory calculations attribute the observed spin-dynamic trends to Nb-induced modifications of magnetic anisotropy and magnetic exchange interactions. Furthermore, CrTe_{2} flakes (~100nm thick) exhibit lower resonance frequencies than bulk crystals, consistent with thickness-dependent magnetic anisotropy. These results establish Nb-doped CrTe_{2} as a tunable vdW ferromagnet with controllable spin dynamics, extending its functionality from spintronics to broadband magnonics and quantum magnonics.</description>

Abstract: The recent discovery of altermagnets, which exhibit spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics beyond the limits of ferromagnets, antiferromagnets, and spin orbit coupled systems. We investigate spin selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two dimensional d-wave altermagnet, and identify a universal mechanism for achieving perfect spin polarization. The mechanism is dictated by Fermi surface geometry: closed Fermi surfaces in weak altermagnets yield partial and oscillatory spin filtering, whereas open Fermi surfaces in strong altermagnets intrinsically enforce fully spin polarized conductance. Exploiting these distinct transport regimes, we propose all electrical spin filter and spin valve architectures, where resonant tunneling produces highly spin polarized conductance tunable by gate voltage and interface transparency. Altermagnets with open Fermi surfaces further support gate reversible perfect spin polarization that remains robust against interface scattering, disorder, and temperature. We also demonstrate an electrically controlled spin valve that reproduces the functionality of magnetic tunnel junctions without magnetic fields or relativistic mechanisms. d-wave altermagnets with open Fermi surfaces thus provide a promising platform for low dissipation, scalable, and magnetic field free spintronic devices with potential for integration into next generation quantum and CMOS compatible technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, one can observe a renewed interest in coupling of spin waves (magnons) and collective charge oscillations (plasmons), especially in two-dimensional systems. Several mechanisms of the magnon-plasmon hybridization in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems have been proposed. Here, we consider another mechanism of magnon-plasmon hybridization, which is based on the linear magnetoelectric interaction. As a specific system we consider a monolayer of vanadium-based diselenide with perpendicular easy-axis magnetic anisotropy and Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction. The derived parameter of magnon-plasmon coupling is proportional to the magnetoelectric constant. Assuming for this constant an adequate experimental value, we calculate dispersion relations of the hybridized magnon-plasmon mods. Moreover, we also show that an external electric field normal to the layer (due to a gate voltage) can be used as a tool to tune the magnon modes and this way also hybridized magnon-plasmon coupling. A specific case of magnon-plasmon coupling based on tuning Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction is also considered.</description>

      <title>On the relationship between noise squeezing and Rabi oscillations in active quantum dot ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Squeezed light is usually generated using passive nonlinear materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also offer nonlinearities but they differ in that they add amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). Squeezing to below the vacuum level has been demonstrated in a semiconductor laser, and gain saturation in SOAs can likewise reduce photon-number fluctuations to, and in some cases below, the vacuum limit. Here, we demonstrate that Rabi oscillations in room-temperature quantum-dot SOAs, induced by short resonant pulses, cause cyclical noise modification that repeat with every change of 2pi in pulse area, corresponding to a fourfold increase in excitation pulse energy. Homodyne measurements reveal in those cases elliptical Wigner functions corresponding to squeezed thermal states and in certain regimes, the state is squeezed to below the vacuum level. At other pulse areas, the Wigner functions are circular representing thermal coherent states. This periodic behavior persists over two orders of magnitude in input pulse energy, spanning several 2pi cycles. Under specific bias and excitation conditions, we further observe a non-Gaussian Wigner function featuring two bright lobes. Although its precise nature remains unresolved, this structure may be consistent with a Schrodinger cat - like state whose accompanying negativity is suppressed due to an approximately 10 dB optical output loss. Notably, the emergence of this non-Gaussian state is itself periodic in excitation pulse energy.</description>

      <title>Frequency Domain Berry Curvature Effect on Time Refraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.12893v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that there exist frequency domain Berry curvature in the wave function of photons in dispersive optical systems. This property arises from the frequency dispersion of its dielectric function, which makes Maxwell equations a non-standard eigenvalue equation, with the eigenvalue (frequency) appearing inside the operator itself. We study this new Berry curvature effect on time refraction of magnetoplasmon-polariton as an example. It can induce deflection in the trajectory of a photon and make the ray swing.</description>

      <title>Proper Theory of Magnon Orbital Angular Momentum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The orbital motion of chargeless bosons, unlike that of electrons, does not generate a magnetic moment and thus cannot directly interact with magnetic fields. Utilizing the Aharonov-Casher effect and perturbation theory, we formulate a proper theory for the magnon orbital angular momentum (OAM) at finite temperatures, explicitly identifying both self-rotation and topological contributions, analogous to the electronic counterpart but with correct bosonic statistics. Comparing with previous studies on magnon OAM, the magnon spin Nernst effect can only be correctly reproduced using the proper theory for magnon OAM. In a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice, we show that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction induces a large magnon OAM in both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic ground states. Our formulation provides a foundation for studying orbital dynamics of chargeless bosons with intrinsic spin.</description>

      <title>Model for charge carrier spectra in topological semimetals of the TaAs family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a four-band model describing the electron energy spectra near the Weyl points in the topological semimetals of the TaAs family (TaAs, TaP, NbAs, NbP). This model takes into account the fact that these Weyl points result from the band-contact lines which would exist in the mirror-reflection planes of these materials if the spin-orbit interaction were absent in them. Within this model, we obtain conditions for the existence of the Weyl points, determine their positions in the Brillouin zone, and derive the explicit formula for dispersion of the bands along the straight line connecting the two close Weyl points with opposite topological charges. Using NbP as an example, the values of the parameters defining the model spectrum are found. The obtained results show that for the semimetals of the TaAs family, the charge-carriers spectrum in the vicinity of the two close Weyl points can be analyzed without complex band-structure calculations.</description>

      <title>Link of the Zitterbewegung with the spin conductivity and the spin-textures of multiband systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.14867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Zitterbewegung phenomenon in multiband electronic systems is known to be subtly related to the charge conductivity, Berry curvature and the Chern number. Here we show that some spin-dependent properties as the optical spin conductivity, and intrinsic spin Hall conductivity are also entangled with the Zitterbewegung amplitudes. We also show that in multiband Dirac-type Hamiltonians, a direct link between the Zitterbewegung and the spin textures and spin transition amplitudes can be established. The later allow us to discern the presence or not of the Zitterbewegung oscillations by simply analyzing the spin or pseudo-spin textures. We provide examples of the applicability of our approach for Hamiltonian models that show the suppression of specific Zitterbewegung oscillations.</description>

      <title>Many-Body Non-Hermitian Skin Effect with Exact Steady States in the Dissipative Quantum Link Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a dissipative lattice gauge model that exhibits the many-body version of the non-Hermitian skin effect. The dissipative couplings between dynamical gauge fields on the lattice links and the surrounding environment generate chiral motions of particles residing on lattice sites. Despite the complexity arising from many-body interactions, the local gauge symmetry enables the exact construction of a steady state that displays the many-body non-Hermitian skin effect. Furthermore, our approach can be generalized to realize a new type of many-body non-Hermitian skin effect, dubbed the hierarchical skin effect, where different subsystem degrees of freedom exhibit boundary accumulation of multiple moments at different orders. Our findings can be readily observed by engineering dissipation in state-of-the-art lattice gauge simulators.</description>

      <title>Fluctuation theorems with optical tweezers: theory and practice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems, such as the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks relation, are effective tools connecting non-equilibrium work statistics and equilibrium free energy differences. However, detailed hands-on, reproducible protocols for implementing and analyzing these relations in real experiments remain scarce. This tutorial provides an end-to-end workflow for measuring, validating, and applying fluctuation theorems using a single-beam optical tweezers setup. It introduces the foundational ideas and consolidates practical calibration (PSD-based trap stiffness and position sensitivity), protocol design (forward/reverse finite-time drives over multiple amplitudes and durations), and robust estimators for free-energy difference and dissipated work, highlighting finite-sampling and rare-event effects. We demonstrate the procedures using an extensive set of measured trajectories under different conditions and provide openly accessible datasets and Python code, enabling new researchers or educators to reproduce the results with minimal effort. Beyond pedagogical validation, we discuss how these recipes translate to broader soft-matter and mesoscopic contexts. By combining user-friendly instruments with clear and transparent analysis, this work promotes the education and reliable adoption of stochastic thermodynamic methods in the curricula of physics and chemistry, as well as among emerging research teams.</description>

Abstract: Cold atoms can adsorb to a surface with the emission of a single phonon when the binding energy is sufficiently small. The effects of phonon damping and adsorbent size on the adsorption rate in this quantum regime are studied using the multimode Rabi model. It is demonstrated that the adsorption rate can be either enhanced or suppressed relative to the Fermi golden rule rate, in analogy to cavity effects in the spontaneous emission rate in QED. A mesoscopic-sized adsorbent behaves as an acoustic cavity that enhances the adsorption rate when tuned to the adsorption transition frequency and suppresses the rate when detuned. This acoustic cavity effect occurs in the regime where the frequency spacing between vibrational modes exceeds the phonon linewidth.</description>

      <title>Topological two-body interaction obstructing trivial ground states: an indicator of fractional Chern insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23956v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for candidate materials for fractional Chern insulators (FCIs) has mainly focused on the topological and geometrical structures of single-particle Chern bands. However, there are inherent limitations in approaches that neglect interaction effects, highlighting the need for complementary methods. In this work, we discuss how the Chern number defined for the effective interaction projected onto a Chern band is related to the stabilization of FCIs. Specifically, by formulating both the effective interaction and the two-particle problem using a common matrix, we establish a connection between the two-particle band structure and the effective interaction. This formulation allows us to characterize the effective interaction through the topology of the two-particle band. To investigate the relationship between topological effective interactions and FCIs, we perform numerical calculations primarily based on exact diagonalization. We find a notable correlation between the fact that the dominant two-particle bands carry a unit Chern number and the realization of a robust FCI at the filling fraction $\nu = 1/3$. This result is consistent with the presumed correspondence between pseudopotentials in the fractional quantum Hall effect and the two-particle band structure. From another perspective, our findings suggest that the topology inherent in the interaction itself can obstruct trivial ground states. We also discuss this in the context of scattering channels. Extending such topological two-body interactions could pave the way for realizing exotic states beyond FCIs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optical selection rules dictate symmetry-allowed/forbidden transitions, playing a decisive role in engineering exciton quantum states and designing optoelectronic devices. While both the real (quantum metric) and imaginary (Berry curvature) parts of quantum geometry contribute to optical transitions, the conventional theory of optical selection rules in solids incorporates only Berry curvature. Here, we propose quantum metric-based optical selection rules. We unveil a universal quantum metric-oscillator strength correspondence for linear polarization of light and establish valley-contrasted optical selection rules that lock orthogonal linear polarizations to distinct valleys. Tight-binding and first-principles calculations confirm our theory in two models (altermagnet and Kane-Mele) and monolayer $d$-wave altermagnet $\mathrm{V_2SeSO}$. This work provides a quantum metric paradigm for valley-based spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Digital-Alloy Bragg Mirrors in High-Q Microcavities for Polariton Lasing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.03203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an approach to the molecular-beam epitaxy of high-Q planar GaAs-based microcavities in which the AlGaAs high-index layers of the distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) are replaced by short-period GaAs/AlAs superlattices (digital alloys) with similar optical properties. This design enables a significant reduction of interface roughness, precise control of the quarter-wavelength optical thickness and the effective Al content, suppression of the propagation of structural defects, and efficient tuning of intrinsic absorption at the polariton emission wavelength via optimization of the superlattice parameters.
  Using this approach, we fabricate a microcavity with a low polariton-lasing threshold of approximately 570 W/cm$^2$ and a high experimental quality factor of about 5.4 x $10^4$. This value exceeds by almost a factor of two the theoretical estimate obtained within an equivalent ternary-alloy model. We demonstrate that accurate modeling of the stop-band characteristics and the Q factor requires incorporating the modified electronic density of states in the superlattice, including quantum-confinement and excitonic effects.</description>

      <title>The Arf-Brown-Kervaire invariant on a lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11424v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a lattice formulation of the Arf-Brown-Kervaire (ABK) invariant which takes values in $\mathbb{Z}_8$. Compared to the standard $\mathbb{Z}$-valued index, the ABK invariant is more involved in that it arises in Majorana fermion partition functions with reflection symmetry on two-dimensional non-orientable manifolds, and its definition contains an infinite sum over Dirac eigenvalues that requires proper regularization. We employ the massive Wilson Dirac operator, with and without domain-walls, on standard two-dimensional square lattices, and use its Pfaffian for the definition. Twisted boundary conditions and cross-caps, which reverse the orientation, are introduced to realize nontrivial topologies equipped with nontrivial $\mathrm{Pin}^{-}$ structures of Majorana fermions. We verify numerically (and partly analytically) that our formulation on a torus, Klein bottle, real projective plane (as well as its triple connected sum), and two types of M\"obius strip reproduces the known values in continuum theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the surface density of states in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-spin-singlet $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems ($p$-wave unconventional magnetic superconductors), by using the effective $p$-wave unconventional magnet model [B. Brekke, et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 236703 (2024)]. Owing to the noncollinear spin structure along the $x$-direction, the quasiparticle energy dispersion has the spin-triplet $p_x$-wave energy gap structure, and then zero-energy flat bands emerge at the [100] edge. Analyzing the pair amplitude at the [100] edge, odd-frequency spin-triplet even-parity pairing is induced in the presence of zero-energy flat bands, while even-frequency spin-singlet even-parity remains. We also demonstrate the Josephson current in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnet-conventional $s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems. By the cooperation of spin-singlet $s$-wave pair potential and the $p$-wave unconventional magnetic order, the current phase relation shows the $\varphi$-junction in the high-transparency but also the temperature dependence of the Josephson current caused by the coupling of the spin-singlet even-parity pairings in the low-transparency limit, even though $p$-wave superconductivity is mainly realized both in the bulk and at the edge. Our calculations provide the possible superconducting phenomena and transport properties in $p$-wave unconventional magnet-$s$-wave superconductor hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>A voltage-responsive strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin network with emergent dynamics for computing</title>

Abstract: Emergent behavior, which arises from local interactions between simple elements, is pervasive in nature. It underlies the energy-efficient computing in our brains. However, realizing such dynamics in artificial materials, particularly under low-energy stimuli, remains a fundamental challenge. While dipole-dipole interactions are typically suppressed in magnetic storage, here we harness and amplify them to construct a strongly dipolar-coupled network of SmCo5 macrospins at wafer scale, which can exhibit intrinsic interaction-driven collective dynamics in response to voltage pulses. The network combines three essential ingredients: strong dipolar coupling by large single-domain macrospin, giant voltage control of coercivity over nearly 1000-fold, and disordered network topology with frustrated Ising-like energy landscape. When stimulated by 1 V pulses, the network enters a regime where interaction-driven magnetic behaviors emerge, including spontaneous demagnetization, greatly enhanced magnetization modulation, reversible freeze and resume evolution and stochastic convergence toward low-energy magnetic configurations. All these behaviors are completely absent at the single-nanomagnet level. Furthermore, by constructing micromagnetic models of the strongly dipolar-coupled macrospin networks, we show that the resulting nonlinear, high-dimensional collective dynamics, intrinsic to strongly-interacting systems, can enable accurate chaotic Mackey-Glass prediction and multiclass drone-signal classification. Our work establishes the voltage-responsive strongly-coupled SmCo5 network as a mesoscopic platform for probing emergent magnetic dynamics previously inaccessible under ambient conditions. It also suggests a fundamental distinct route towards scalable, low-voltage computing, one rooted in native physical interaction-driven collective dynamics at the network level.</description>
