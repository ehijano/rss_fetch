      <title>Two-Stage Prony-Based Estimation of Fractional Delay and Doppler Shifts in OTFS Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the estimation of fractional delay and Doppler shifts in multipath channels that cause doubly selective fading-an essential task for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in high-mobility environments. Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation enables simple and robust channel compensation under such conditions. However, fractional delay and Doppler components introduce inter-path interference, degrading estimation accuracy. We propose a two-stage estimation method based on Prony's technique using OTFS pilot signals with M subchannels and N pilot repetitions. In the first stage, Doppler frequencies are estimated by jointly solving M coupled Prony equations, exploiting the periodicity of the pilot signal. In the second stage, delays are estimated by applying the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and Prony's method to each Doppler component obtained in the first stage. The proposed method can accurately estimate up to N-1 delay-Doppler parameters under noiseless conditions. In noisy environments, conventional information criteria such as AIC and BIC yield suboptimal performance; thus, a heuristic model order selection is adopted. Numerical simulations confirm that the proposed method achieves high estimation accuracy, highlighting its potential for future ISAC frameworks.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Role of Operating Conditions for Learning-based Multi-condition Fault Diagnosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-condition fault diagnosis is prevalent in industrial systems and presents substantial challenges for conventional diagnostic approaches. The discrepancy in data distributions across different operating conditions degrades model performance when a model trained under one condition is applied to others. With the recent advancements in deep learning, transfer learning has been introduced to the fault diagnosis field as a paradigm for addressing multi-condition fault diagnosis. Among these methods, domain generalization approaches can handle complex scenarios by extracting condition-invariant fault features. Although many studies have considered fault diagnosis in specific multi-condition scenarios, the extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. However, the extent to which operating conditions affect fault information has been scarcely studied, which is crucial. When operating conditions have a significant impact on fault features, directly applying domain generalization methods may lead the model to learn condition-specific information, thereby reducing its overall generalization ability. This paper investigates the performance of existing end-to-end domain generalization methods under varying conditions, specifically in variable-speed and variable-load scenarios, using multiple experiments on a real-world gearbox. Additionally, a two-stage diagnostic framework is proposed, aiming to improve fault diagnosis performance under scenarios with significant operating condition impacts. By incorporating a domain-generalized encoder with a retraining strategy, the framework is able to extract condition-invariant fault features while simultaneously alleviating potential overfitting to the source domain. Several experiments on a real-world gearbox dataset are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Based Near-Field Localization in Mixed LoS/NLoS Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conventional MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC) algorithm is effective for angle-of-arrival estimation in the far-field and can be extended for full source localization in the near-field. However, it suffers from high computational complexity, which becomes especially prohibitive in near-field scenarios due to the need for exhaustive 3D grid searches. This paper presents a machine learning-based approach for 3D localization of near-field sources in mixed line-of-sight (LoS)/non-LoS scenarios. A convolutional neural network (CNN) learns the mapping between the eigenvectors of the received signal's covariance matrix at the anchor node and the sources' 3D locations. The detailed description of the proposed CNN model is provided. The effectiveness and time efficiency of the proposed CNN-based localization approach is corroborated via numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Near-Field Propagation and Spatial Non-Stationarity Channel Model for 6-24 GHz (FR3) Extremely Large-Scale MIMO: Adopted by 3GPP for 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next generation cellular deployments are expected to exploit the 6-24 GHz frequency range 3 (FR3) and extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) to enable ultra-high data rates and reliability. However, the significantly enlarged antenna apertures and higher carrier frequencies render the far-field and spatial stationarity assumptions in the existing 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) channel models invalid, giving rise to new features such as near-field propagation and spatial non-stationarity (SNS). Despite extensive prior research, incorporating these new features within the standardized channel modeling framework remains an open issue. To address this, this paper presents a channel modeling framework for XL-MIMO systems that incorporates both near-field and SNS features, adopted by 3GPP. For the near-field propagation feature, the framework models the distances from the base station (BS) and user equipment to the spherical-wave sources associated with clusters. These distances are used to characterize element-wise variations of path parameters, such as nonlinear changes in phase and angle. To capture the effect of SNS at the BS side, a stochastic-based approach is proposed to model SNS caused by incomplete scattering, by establishing power attenuation factors from visibility probability and visibility region to characterize antenna element-wise path power variation. In addition, a physical blocker-based approach is introduced to model SNS effects caused by partial blockage. Finally, a simulation framework for near-field and SNS is developed within the structure of the existing 3GPP channel model. Performance evaluations demonstrate that the near-field model captures higher channel capacity potential compared to the far-field model. Coupling loss results indicate that SNS leads to more pronounced propagation fading relative to the spatial stationary model.</description>

      <title>ISAC Network Planning: Sensing Coverage Analysis and 3-D BS Deployment Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks strive to deliver both high-precision target localization and high-throughput data services across the entire coverage area. In this work, we examine the fundamental trade-off between sensing and communication from the perspective of base station (BS) deployment. Furthermore, we conceive a design that simultaneously maximizes the target localization coverage, while guaranteeing the desired communication performance. In contrast to existing schemes optimized for a single target, an effective network-level approach has to ensure consistent localization accuracy throughout the entire service area. While employing time-of-flight (ToF) based localization, we first analyze the deployment problem from a localization-performance coverage perspective, aiming for minimizing the area Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (A-CRLB) to ensure uniformly high positioning accuracy across the service area. We prove that for a fixed number of BSs, uniformly scaling the service area by a factor \kappa increases the optimal A-CRLB in proportion to \kappa^{2\beta}, where \beta is the BS-to-target pathloss exponent. Based on this, we derive an approximate scaling law that links the achievable A-CRLB across the area of interest to the dimensionality of the sensing area. We also show that cooperative BSs extends the coverage but yields marginal A-CRLB improvement as the dimensionality of the sensing area grows.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Bistatic ISAC Systems for Low-Altitude Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The burgeoning low-altitude economy (LAE) necessitates integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems capable of high-accuracy multi-target localization and velocity estimation under hardware and coverage constraints inherent in conventional ISAC architectures. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a cooperative bistatic ISAC framework within MIMO-OFDM cellular networks, enabling robust sensing services for LAE applications through standardized 5G New Radio (NR) infrastructure. We first develop a low-complexity parameter extraction algorithm employing CANDECOMP/PARAFAC (CP) tensor decomposition, which exploits the inherent Vandermonde structure in delay-related factor matrices to efficiently recover bistatic ranges, Doppler velocities, and angles-of-arrival (AoA) from multi-dimensional received signal tensors. To resolve data association ambiguity across distributed transmitter-receiver pairs and mitigate erroneous estimates, we further design a robust fusion scheme based on the minimum spanning tree (MST) method, enabling joint 3D position and velocity reconstruction. Comprehensive simulation results validate the framework's superiority in computational efficiency and sensing performance for low-altitude scenarios.</description>

      <title>Coherent Track-Before-Detect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately tracking an unknown and time-varying number of objects in complex environments is a significant challenge but a fundamental capability in a variety of applications, including applied ocean sciences, surveillance, autonomous driving, and wireless communications. Conventional Bayesian multiobject tracking (MOT) methods typically employ a detect-then-track (DTT) approach, where a frontend detector preprocesses raw sensor data to extract measurements for MOT. The irreversible nature of this preprocessing step can discard valuable object-related information, particularly impairing the ability to resolve weak or closely spaced objects. The track-before-detect (TBD) paradigm offers an alternative by operating directly on sensor data. However, existing TBD approaches introduce simplifications to facilitate the development of inference methods, such as assuming known signal amplitudes or conditional independence between sensor measurements given object states. These assumptions can lead to suboptimal performance and limit the applicability of the resulting TBD methods in realistic scenarios.
  This paper introduces coherent TBD based on a comprehensive signal model for sensor data. The new model accounts for sensor data correlations and amplitude fluctuations, enabling the accurate representation of the physics of the data-generating process in TBD. Coherent TBD is suitable for a wide range of problems in active and passive radar, active and passive sonar, as well as integrated sensing and communication systems. Based on a factor graph representation of the new measurement model, a scalable belief propagation (BP) method is developed to perform efficient Bayesian inference. Experimental results, performed with both synthetic and real data, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art conventional MOT methods.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Visual Image Based User Association and Beamforming Using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an approach that leverages multimodal data by integrating visual images with radio frequency (RF) pilots to optimize user association and beamforming in a downlink wireless cellular network under a max-min fairness criterion. Traditional methods typically optimize wireless system parameters based on channel state information (CSI). However, obtaining accurate CSI requires extensive pilot transmissions, which lead to increased overhead and latency. Moreover, the optimization of user association and beamforming is a discrete and non-convex optimization problem, which is challenging to solve analytically. In this paper, we propose to incorporate visual camera data in addition to the RF pilots to perform the joint optimization of user association and beamforming. The visual image data helps enhance channel awareness, thereby reducing the dependency on extensive pilot transmissions for system optimization. We employ a learning-based approach based on using first a detection neural network that estimates user locations from images, and subsequently two graph neural networks (GNNs) that extract features for system optimization based on the location information and the received pilots, respectively. Then, a multimodal GNN is constructed to integrate the features for the joint optimization user association and beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior performance, while having low computational complexity and being interpretable and generalizable, making it an effective solution as compared to traditional methods based only on RF pilots.</description>

      <title>LLM-Integrated Digital Twins for Hierarchical Resource Allocation in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation (NextG) wireless networks are expected to require intelligent, scalable, and context-aware radio resource management (RRM) to support ultra-dense deployments, diverse service requirements, and dynamic network conditions. Digital twins (DTs) offer a powerful tool for network management by creating high-fidelity virtual replicas that model real-time network behavior, while large language models (LLMs) enhance decision-making through their advanced generalization and contextual reasoning capabilities. This article proposes LLM-driven DTs for network optimization (LLM-DTNet), a hierarchical framework that integrates multi-layer DT architectures with LLM-based orchestration to enable adaptive, real-time RRM in heterogeneous NextG networks. We present the fundamentals and design considerations of LLM-DTNet while discussing its effectiveness in proactive and situation-aware network management across terrestrial and non-terrestrial applications. Furthermore, we highlight key challenges, including scalable DT modeling, secure LLM-DT integration, energy-efficient implementations, and multimodal data processing, shaping future advancements in NextG intelligent wireless networks.</description>

      <title>ARSAR-Net: Adaptively Regularized SAR Imaging Network via Non-matrix-inversion ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep unfolding networks have constituted an emerging method for synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging. However, baseline unfolding networks, when unfolded from the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), lack generalization capability across scenes as the regularizers are empirically designed. In this study, we introduce a learnable regularizer to the unfolding network and create an adaptively regularized SAR imaging network (ARSAR-Net), which pursues generalization capability across scenes, including varying sparsity levels and heterogeneous scenes with offshore ships, islands, urban areas, and mountainous terrain. In practice, the vanilla ARSAR-Net suffers from inherent structural limitations in 2D signal processing, primarily due to its reliance on matrix inversion. To conquer this challenge, we introduce the non-matrix-inversion ADMM algorithm, which replaces inefficient matrix inversion with efficient linear approximations. Extensive validation through simulated and real-data experiments (including GF-3 satellite echoes) demonstrates ARSAR-Net's triple advantage: (1) 50\% faster imaging speed compared to existing unfolding networks, (2) up to 2.0 dB PSNR improvement in imaging quality, and (3) enhanced adaptability to complex heterogeneous scenes. These advancements establish a new paradigm for computationally efficient and generalizable SAR imaging systems.</description>

      <title>Generative Diffusion Receivers: Achieving Pilot-Efficient MIMO-OFDM Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-orthogonal frequency division multiplex (OFDM) receivers. Traditional wireless receivers have relied on mathematical modeling and Bayesian inference, achieving remarkable success in most areas but falling short in their ability to characterize channel matrices. Neural networks (NNs) have demonstrated significant potential in this aspect. Nevertheless, integrating traditional inference methods with NNs presents challenges, particularly in tracking the error progression. Given the inevitable presence of noise in wireless systems, generative models that are more resilient to noise are garnering increased attention. In this paper, we propose re-evaluating the MIMO-OFDM receiver using diffusion models, which is a common generative approach. With diffusion models, we can effectively leverage prior knowledge of channel matrices and incorporate traditional signal estimation components. Specifically, we explore the diffusion system and introduce an imagination-screening strategy to guide the diffusion process. Furthermore, diffusion models enable adaptation to varying noise levels and pilot schemes using the same NN, significantly reducing training and deployment costs. Simulated results reveal that, for pilot densities ranging from 4-6 pilots per 64-subcarrier block and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) from -4 dB to 0 dB, our proposed receiver reduces channel-reconstruction error by up to two times compared to leading deep-learning models, with the most pronounced improvements observed in low-pilot conditions. Additionally, performance enhancements can be achieved with a larger imagination size, despite increased computational complexity.</description>

      <title>A New Pathway to Integrated Learning and Communication (ILAC): Large AI Model and Hyperdimensional Computing for Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks necessitates the seamless integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with wireless communications to support emerging intelligent applications that demand both efficient communication and robust learning performance. This dual requirement calls for a unified framework of integrated learning and communication (ILAC), where AI enhances communication through intelligent signal processing and adaptive resource management, while wireless networks support AI model deployment by enabling efficient and reliable data exchanges. However, achieving this integration presents significant challenges in practice. Communication constraints, such as limited bandwidth and fluctuating channels, hinder learning accuracy and convergence. Simultaneously, AI-driven learning dynamics, including model updates and task-driven inference, introduce excessive burdens on communication systems, necessitating flexible, context-aware transmission strategies. Finally, we present a case study on a cost-to-performance optimization problem, where task assignments, model size selection, bandwidth allocation, and transmission power control are jointly optimized, considering computational cost, communication efficiency, and inference accuracy. Leveraging the Dinkelbach and alternating optimization algorithms, we offer a practical and effective solution to achieve an optimal balance between learning performance and communication constraints.</description>

      <title>Sizing Antenna Arrays for Near-field Communication and Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents key performance metrics for near-field communication and sensing systems with a focus on their scaling behavior as a function of the antenna array aperture. Analytical expressions are derived for several standard array geometries to enable the design of the large antenna arrays for given system requirements. First, the near-field beam focusing is analyzed and the minimum beamdepth is observed to rapidly saturate to a low asymptotic limit as the array aperture increases. In contrast, the near-field region span is shown to scale quadratically with the array aperture. Based on these two metrics, the maximum number of resolvable beamspots at 3 dB separation is derived analytically, exhibiting a linear dependence on the array aperture. Finally, the number of significant singular values of a channel observed at the array's broadside is estimated, showing a power-law dependence on the aperture. The resulting expressions provide practical design guidelines for evaluating aperture requirements in near-field communication and sensing applications.</description>

      <title>Fast State-Augmented Learning for Wireless Resource Allocation with Dual Variable Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider resource allocation problems in multi-user wireless networks, where the goal is to optimize a network-wide utility function subject to constraints on the ergodic average performance of users. We demonstrate how a state-augmented graph neural network (GNN) parametrization for the resource allocation policy circumvents the drawbacks of the ubiquitous dual subgradient methods by representing the network configurations (or states) as graphs and viewing dual variables as dynamic inputs to the model, viewed as graph signals supported over the graphs. Lagrangian maximizing state-augmented policies are learned during the offline training phase, and the dual variables evolve through gradient updates while executing the learned state-augmented policies during the inference phase. Our main contributions are to illustrate how near-optimal initialization of dual multipliers for faster inference can be accomplished with dual variable regression, leveraging a secondary GNN parametrization, and how maximization of the Lagrangian over the multipliers sampled from the dual descent dynamics substantially improves the training of state-augmented models. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed algorithm with extensive numerical experiments in a case study of transmit power control. Finally, we prove a convergence result and an exponential probability bound on the excursions of the dual function (iterate) optimality gaps.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Channel Estimation and Data Detection for Cell-Free Massive MIMO with Low-Resolution Quantized Fronthaul Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the joint channel estimation and data detection (JED) problem in a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) network, where access points (APs) communicate with a central processing unit (CPU) over fronthaul links. However, the bandwidth of these links is limited, and thus, presents challenges to the applicability of CF-mMIMO, especially with an ever-increasing number of users. To address this, we propose a method based on variational Bayesian (VB) inference for performing the JED process, where the APs forward low-resolution quantized versions of the signals to the CPU. We consider two approaches: \emph{quantization-and-estimation} (Q-E) and \emph{estimation-and-quantization} (E-Q). In the Q-E approach, each AP uses a low-bit quantizer to quantize the signal before forwarding it to the CPU, while in the E-Q approach, each AP first performs local channel estimation and then sends a low-bit quantized version of the estimated channel to the CPU. We evaluate the performance of our VB-based approach under perfect fronthaul link (PFL) with unquantized received signals, Q-E, and E-Q in terms of symbol error rate (SER), normalized mean square error (NMSE) of the channel estimation, computational complexity, and fronthaul signaling overhead. We also compare these results with those of the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) method under the PFL scenario. Our numerical results show that both the VB(Q-E) and VB(E-Q) approaches achieve superior performance compared to LMMSE(PFL), benefiting from the nonlinear modeling inherent in VB. Furthermore, the VB(Q-E) method outperforms VB(E-Q) due to errors in the local channel estimation process at the APs within the VB(E-Q) approach.</description>

      <title>Achieving 70 Gb/s Over A VCSEL-Based Optical Wireless Link Using A Multi-Mode Fiber-Coupled Receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate a laser-based optical wireless communication (OWC) system employing a 940 nm single-mode (SM) vertical cavity surface emitting laser (VCSEL) and a multi-mode (MM) fiber-coupled receiver, achieving a record data rate beyond 70 Gb/s, while the optical transmit power is below 5 mW. The use of a high speed fiber-optic photoreceiver avoids limiting the communication bandwidth by the receiver, enabling ultra-high capacity and energy-efficient light fidelity (LiFi) links to unlock new applications. This work experimentally validates the feasibility of ultra-high speed indoor OWC systems using a single low-power and low-cost VCSEL for next-generation LiFi connectivity.</description>

      <title>A family of graph GOSPA metrics for graphs with different sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a family of graph metrics for measuring distances between graphs of different sizes. The proposed metric family defines a general form of the graph generalised optimal sub-pattern assignment (GOSPA) metric and is also proved to satisfy the metric properties. Similarly to the graph GOSPA metric, the proposed graph GOSPA metric family also penalises the node attribute costs for assigned nodes between the two graphs, and the number of unassigned nodes. However, the proposed family of metrics provides more general penalties for edge mismatches than the graph GOSPA metric. This paper also shows that the graph GOSPA metric family can be approximately computed using linear programming. Simulation experiments are performed to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family with different choices of hyperparameters. The benefits of the proposed graph GOSPA metric family for classification tasks are also shown on real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Control Attention Network for Underwater Acoustic Localization and Domain Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17409v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localizing acoustic sound sources in the ocean is a challenging task due to the complex and dynamic nature of the environment. Factors such as high background noise, irregular underwater geometries, and varying acoustic properties make accurate localization difficult. To address these obstacles, we propose a multi-branch network architecture designed to accurately predict the distance between a moving acoustic source and a receiver, tested on real-world underwater signal arrays. The network leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for robust spatial feature extraction and integrates Conformers with self-attention mechanism to effectively capture temporal dependencies. Log-mel spectrogram and generalized cross-correlation with phase transform (GCC-PHAT) features are employed as input representations. To further enhance the model performance, we introduce an Adaptive Gain Control (AGC) layer, that adaptively adjusts the amplitude of input features, ensuring consistent energy levels across varying ranges, signal strengths, and noise conditions. We assess the model's generalization capability by training it in one domain and testing it in a different domain, using only a limited amount of data from the test domain for fine-tuning. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches in similar settings, establishing new benchmarks for underwater sound localization.</description>

      <title>Quantizing for Noisy Flash Memory Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flash memory-based processing-in-memory (flash-based PIM) offers high storage capacity and computational efficiency but faces significant reliability challenges due to noise in high-density multi-level cell (MLC) flash memories. Existing verify level optimization methods are designed for general storage scenarios and fail to address the unique requirements of flash-based PIM systems, where metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) are critical. This paper introduces an integrated framework that jointly optimizes quantization and verify levels to minimize the MSE, considering both quantization and flash memory channel errors. We develop an iterative algorithm to solve the joint optimization problem. Experimental results on quantized images and SwinIR model parameters stored in flash memory show that the proposed method significantly improves the reliability of flash-based PIM systems.</description>

      <title>Derandomizing Simultaneous Confidence Regions for Band-Limited Functions by Improved Norm Bounds and Majority-Voting Schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Band-limited functions are fundamental objects that are widely used in systems theory and signal processing. In this paper we refine a recent nonparametric, nonasymptotic method for constructing simultaneous confidence regions for band-limited functions from noisy input-output measurements, by working in a Paley-Wiener reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Kernel norm bounds are tightened using a uniformly-randomized Hoeffding's inequality for small samples and an empirical Bernstein bound for larger ones. We derive an approximate threshold, based on the sample size and how informative the inputs are, that governs which bound to deploy. Finally, we apply majority voting to aggregate confidence sets from random subsamples, boosting both stability and region size. We prove that even per-input aggregated intervals retain their simultaneous coverage guarantee. These refinements are also validated through numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A Locally Differential Private Coding-Assisted Succinct Histogram Protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A succinct histogram captures frequent items and their frequencies across clients and has become increasingly important for large-scale, privacy-sensitive machine learning applications. To develop a rigorous framework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local differential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To preserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally adding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising tool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first practical $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms using error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the underlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces Gaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items with low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Multiobject Tracking With Neural-Enhanced Motion and Measurement Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiobject tracking (MOT) is an important task in applications including autonomous driving, ocean sciences, and aerospace surveillance. Traditional MOT methods are model-based and combine sequential Bayesian estimation with data association and an object birth model. More recent methods are fully data-driven and rely on the training of neural networks. Both approaches offer distinct advantages in specific settings. In particular, model-based methods are generally applicable across a wide range of scenarios, whereas data-driven MOT achieves superior performance in scenarios where abundant labeled data for training is available. A natural thought is whether a general framework can integrate the two approaches. This paper introduces a hybrid method that utilizes neural networks to enhance specific aspects of the statistical model in Bayesian MOT that have been identified as overly simplistic. By doing so, the performance of the prediction and update steps of Bayesian MOT is improved. To ensure tractable computation, our framework uses belief propagation to avoid high-dimensional operations combined with sequential Monte Carlo methods to perform low-dimensional operations efficiently. The resulting method combines the flexibility and robustness of model-based approaches with the capability to learn complex information from data of neural networks. We evaluate the performance of the proposed method based on the nuScenes autonomous driving dataset and demonstrate that it has state-of-the-art performance</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Prediction with Gaussian Process Knowledge Scores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic models are often used to make predictions in regions of the data space where no observations are available, but it is not always clear whether such predictions are well-informed by previously seen data. In this paper, we propose a knowledge score for predictions from Gaussian process regression (GPR) models that quantifies the extent to which observing data have reduced our uncertainty about a prediction. The knowledge score is interpretable and naturally bounded between 0 and 1. We demonstrate in several experiments that the knowledge score can anticipate when predictions from a GPR model are accurate, and that this anticipation improves performance in tasks such as anomaly detection, extrapolation, and missing data imputation.

      <description>arXiv:2506.18638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This note presents a rigorous introduction to a selection of distributions along with their Fourier transforms, which are commonly encountered in signal processing and, in particular, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In contrast to many textbooks on the principles of MRI, which place more emphasis on the signal processing aspect, this note will take a more mathematical approach. In particular, we will make explicit the underlying topological space of interest and clarify the exact sense in which these distributions and their Fourier transforms are defined. Key results presented in this note involve the Poisson summation formula and the Fourier transform of a Gaussian function via an ordinary differential equation (ODE) argument, etc. Although the readers are expected to have prior exposure to functional analysis and distribution theory, this note is intended to be self-contained.</description>

      <title>A Radio Map Approach for Reduced Pilot CSI Tracking in Massive MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05803v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems offer significant potential to enhance wireless communication performance, yet accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) acquisition remains a key challenge. Existing works on CSI estimation and radio map applications typically rely on stationary CSI statistics and accurate location labels. However, the CSI process can be discontinuous due to user mobility and environmental variations, and inaccurate location data can degrade the performance. By contrast, this paper studies radio-map-embedded CSI tracking and radio map construction without the assumptions of stationary CSI statistics and precise location labels. Using radio maps as the prior information, this paper develops a radio-map-embedded switching Kalman filter (SKF) framework that jointly tracks the location and the CSI with adaptive beamforming for sparse CSI observations under reduced pilots. For radio map construction without precise location labels, the location sequence and the channel covariance matrices are jointly estimated based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An unbiased estimator on the channel covariance matrix is found. Numerical results on ray-traced MIMO channel datasets demonstrate that using 1 pilot in every 10 milliseconds, an average of over 97% of capacity over that of perfect CSI can be achieved, while a conventional Kalman filter (KF) can only achieve 76%. Furthermore, the proposed radio-map-embedded CSI model can reduce the localization error from 30 meters from the prior to 6 meters for radio map construction.</description>

      <title>Radio Map Prediction from Aerial Images and Application to Coverage Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17264v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several studies have explored deep learning algorithms to predict large-scale signal fading, or path loss, in urban communication networks. The goal is to replace costly measurement campaigns, inaccurate statistical models, or computationally expensive ray-tracing simulations with machine learning models that deliver quick and accurate predictions. We focus on predicting path loss radio maps using convolutional neural networks, leveraging aerial images alone or in combination with supplementary height information. Notably, our approach does not rely on explicit classification of environmental objects, which is often unavailable for most locations worldwide. While the prediction of radio maps using complete 3D environmental data is well-studied, the use of only aerial images remains under-explored. We address this gap by showing that state-of-the-art models developed for existing radio map datasets can be effectively adapted to this task. Additionally, we introduce a new model dubbed UNetDCN that achieves on par or better performance compared to the state-of-the-art with reduced complexity. The trained models are differentiable, and therefore they can be incorporated in various network optimization algorithms. While an extensive discussion is beyond this paper's scope, we demonstrate this through an example optimizing the directivity of base stations in cellular networks via backpropagation to enhance coverage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.07180v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The time-modulated array is a simple array architecture in which each antenna is connected to an RF switch that serves as a modulator. The phase shift is achieved by digitally controlling the relative delay between the periodic modulating sequences of the antennas. Two factors limit the practical use of this architecture. First, the switching frequency is high, as it must be a multiple of the sampling frequency. Second, the discrete modulating sequence introduces undesired harmonic replicas of the signal with non-negligible power. This paper exploits aliasing to simultaneously reduce sideband radiation and switching frequency. The transmit signal has a repeated block structure in the frequency domain to facilitate coherent combining of the aliased signal blocks. As a result, a factor $A$ reduction in switching frequency is achieved at the cost of a factor $A$ reduction in communication capacity. Doubling $A$ reduces sideband radiation by around 2.9 dB. The feasibility of the proposed method is experimentally validated for wideband signals.</description>

      <title>Goal-oriented Spectrum Sharing: Trading Edge Inference Power for Data Streaming Performance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of spectrum sharing between goal-oriented (GO) and legacy data-oriented (DO) systems. For the former, data quality and representation is no longer optimized based on classical communication key performance indicators, but rather configured on the fly to achieve the goal of communication with the least resource overhead. This paradigm can be followed to flexibly adapt wireless and in-network artificial intelligence operations across different nodes (e.g., access points, users, sensors or actuators) to data traffic, channel conditions, energy availability and distributed computing capabilities. In this paper, we argue and demonstrate that computing and learning/inference operation performance strongly affect lower layers, calling for a real cross-layer optimization that encompasses physical and computation resource orchestration, up to the application level. Focusing on a communication channel shared among a GO and a DO user, we define a goal-effective achievable rate region (GEARR), to assess the maximum data rate attainable by the latter, subject to goal achievement guarantees for the former. Finally, we propose a cross-layer dynamic resource orchestration able to reach the boundaries of the GEARR, under different goal-effectiveness and compute resource consumption constraints.</description>

Abstract: A transformer-based deep learning approach is presented that enables the diagnosis of fault cases in optical fiber amplifiers using condition-based monitoring time series data. The model, Inverse Triple-Aspect Self-Attention Transformer (ITST), uses an encoder-decoder architecture, utilizing three feature extraction paths in the encoder, feature-engineered data for the decoder and a self-attention mechanism. The results show that ITST outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of classification accuracy, which enables predictive maintenance for optical fiber amplifiers, reducing network downtimes and maintenance costs.</description>

      <title>Dim and Small Target Detection for Drone Broadcast Frames Based on Time-Frequency Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dim and small target detection algorithm for drone broadcast frames based on the time-frequency analysis of communication protocol. Specifically, by analyzing modulation parameters and frame structures, the prior knowledge of transmission frequency, signal bandwidth, Zadoff-Chu (ZC) sequences, and frame length of drone broadcast frames is established. The RF signals are processed through the designed filter banks, and the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes generated by the detector are corrected with transmission frequency and signal bandwidth. Given the remarkable correlation characteristics of ZC sequences, the frequency domain parameters of bounding boxes with low confidence scores are corrected based on ZC sequences and frame length, which improves the detection accuracy of dim targets under low signal-to noise ratio situations. Besides, a segmented energy refinement method is applied to mitigate the deviation caused by interference signals with high energy strength, which ulteriorly corrects the time domain detection parameters for dim targets. As the sampling duration increases, the detection speed improves while the detection accuracy of broadcast frames termed as small targets decreases. The trade-off between detection accuracy and speed versus sampling duration is established, which helps to meet different drone regulation requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm improves the evaluation metrics by 2.27\% compared to existing algorithms. The proposed algorithm also performs strong robustness under varying flight distances, diverse types of environment noise, and different flight visual environment. Besides, the broadcast frame decoding results indicate that 97.30\% accuracy of RID has been achieved.</description>

      <title>IQFM A Wireless Foundational Model for I/Q Streams in AI-Native 6G</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Foundational models have shown remarkable potential in natural language processing and computer vision, yet remain in their infancy in wireless communications. While a few efforts have explored image-based modalities such as channel state information (CSI) and frequency spectrograms, foundational models that operate directly on raw IQ data remain largely unexplored. This paper presents, IQFM, the first I/Q signal foundational model for wireless communications. IQFM supporting diverse tasks: modulation classification, angle-of-arrival (AoA), beam prediction, and RF fingerprinting, without heavy preprocessing or handcrafted features. We also introduce a task-aware augmentation strategy that categorizes transformations into core augmentations, such as cyclic time shifting, and task-specific augmentations. This strategy forms the basis for structured, task-dependent representation learning within a contrastive self-supervised learning (SSL) framework. Using this strategy, the lightweight encoder, pre-trained via SSL on over-the-air multi-antenna IQ data, achieves up to 99.67% and 65.45% accuracy on modulation and AoA classification, respectively, using only one labeled sample per class, outperforming supervised baselines by up to 7x and 145x. The model also generalizes to out-of-distribution tasks; when adapted to new tasks using only 500 samples per class and minimal parameter updates via LoRA, the same frozen encoder achieves 94.15% on beam prediction (vs. 89.53% supervised), 50.00% on RML2016a modulation classification (vs. 49.30%), and 96.05% on RF fingerprinting (vs. 96.64%). These results demonstrate the potential of raw IQ-based foundational models as efficient, reusable encoders for multi-task learning in AI-native 6G systems.</description>

      <title>On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part I: Noise-Aware Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) leverages the physical superposition property of wireless multiple access channels (MACs) to compute functions while communication occurs, enabling scalable and low-latency processing in distributed networks. While analog OAC methods suffer from noise sensitivity and hardware constraints, existing digital approaches are often limited in design complexity, which may hinder scalability and fail to exploit spectral efficiency fully. This two-part paper revisits and extends the ChannelComp framework, a general methodology for computing arbitrary finite-valued functions using digital modulation. In Part I, we develop a novel constellation design approach that is aware of the noise distribution and formulates the encoder design as a max-min optimization problem using noise-tailored distance metrics. Our design supports noise models, including Gaussian, Laplace, and heavy-tailed distributions. We further demonstrate that, for heavy-tailed noise, the optimal ChannelComp setup coincides with the solution to the corresponding max-min criterion for the channel noise with heavy-tailed distributions. Numerical experiments confirm that our noise-aware design achieves a substantially lower mean-square error than leading digital OAC methods over noisy MACs. In Part II, we consider a constellation design with a quantization-based sampling scheme to enhance modulation scalability and computational accuracy for large-scale digital OAC.</description>

      <title>On Designing Modulation for Over-the-Air Computation -- Part II: Pyramid Sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (OAC) harnesses the natural superposition of wireless signals to compute aggregate functions during transmission, thereby collapsing communication and computation into a single step and significantly reducing latency and resource usage. In Part I, digital OAC was formulated as a noise-aware constellation design problem by casting encoder design as a max-min optimization that aligns minimum Euclidean distances between superimposed constellation points with squared differences of their corresponding function outputs.
  In this paper, Part II, we address the prohibitive complexity and quantization challenges inherent in digital OAC constellation design for large-scale edge networks. More precisely, we introduce a pyramid sampling strategy that judiciously selects a subset of superimposed constellation points to reduce the encoder design complexity from $\mathcal{O}(q^K)$ to $\mathcal{O}(q^{K-p+1})$, where $p\in\{1,\dots, K\}$ denotes the sampling order, $q$ levels of modulation, and $K$ denotes the number nodes in the network. Under the assumption of symmetric aggregation, this approach enables a controlled trade-off between computational complexity and function computation accuracy. As a special case, we propose majority-based sampling ($p=K$), which confines aggregation to only $q$ consensus points, inherently avoiding destructive overlaps and permitting the use of standard digital modulations (e.g., QAM, PSK, ASK) without bespoke constellation designs. We also show via several simulations, across various aggregation functions, modulation levels, and noise levels, that moderate sampling orders attain acceptable performance with orders-of-magnitude fewer constraints than exhaustive designs.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning With Energy Harvesting Devices: An MDP Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) necessitates that edge devices conduct local training and communicate with a parameter server, resulting in significant energy consumption. A key challenge in practical FL systems is the rapid depletion of battery-limited edge devices, which limits their operational lifespan and impacts learning performance. To tackle this issue, we implement energy harvesting techniques in FL systems to capture ambient energy, thereby providing continuous power to edge devices. We first establish the convergence bound for the wireless FL system with energy harvesting devices, illustrating that the convergence is affected by partial device participation and packet drops, both of which depend on the energy supply. To accelerate the convergence, we formulate a joint device scheduling and power control problem and model it as a Markov decision process (MDP). By solving this MDP, we derive the optimal transmission policy and demonstrate that it possesses a monotone structure with respect to the battery and channel states. To overcome the curse of dimensionality caused by the exponential complexity of computing the optimal policy, we propose a low-complexity algorithm, which is asymptotically optimal as the number of devices increases. Furthermore, for unknown channels and harvested energy statistics, we develop a structure-enhanced deep reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages the monotone structure of the optimal policy to improve the training performance. Finally, extensive numerical experiments on real-world datasets are presented to validate the theoretical results and corroborate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <title>Wireless-Friendly Window Position Optimization for RIS-Aided Outdoor-to-Indoor Networks based on Multi-Modal Large Language Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to simultaneously optimize indoor wireless and daylight performance by adjusting the positions of windows and the beam directions of window-deployed reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for RIS-aided outdoor-to-indoor (O2I) networks utilizing large language models (LLM) as optimizers. Firstly, we illustrate the wireless and daylight system models of RIS-aided O2I networks and formulate a joint optimization problem to enhance both wireless traffic sum rate and daylight illumination performance. Then, we present a multi-modal LLM-based window optimization (LMWO) framework, accompanied by a prompt construction template to optimize the overall performance in a zero-shot fashion, functioning as both an architect and a wireless network planner. Finally, we analyze the optimization performance of the LMWO framework and the impact of the number of windows, room size, number of RIS units, and daylight factor. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed LMWO framework can achieve outstanding optimization performance in terms of initial performance, convergence speed, final outcomes, and time complexity, compared with classic optimization methods. The building's wireless performance can be significantly enhanced while ensuring indoor daylight performance.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Glucose Level Prediction of ICU Patients through Hierarchical Modeling of Irregular Time-Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01418v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately predicting blood glucose (BG) levels of ICU patients is critical, as both hypoglycemia (BG &lt; 70 mg/dL) and hyperglycemia (BG &gt; 180 mg/dL) are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. This study presents a proof-of-concept machine learning framework, the Multi-source Irregular Time-Series Transformer (MITST), designed to predict BG levels in ICU patients. In contrast to existing methods that rely heavily on manual feature engineering or utilize limited Electronic Health Record (EHR) data sources, MITST integrates diverse clinical data--including laboratory results, medications, and vital signs without predefined aggregation. The model leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, designed to capture interactions among features within individual timestamps, temporal dependencies across different timestamps, and semantic relationships across multiple data sources. Evaluated using the extensive eICU database (200,859 ICU stays across 208 hospitals), MITST achieves a statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.001 ) average improvement of 1.7 percentage points (pp) in AUROC and 1.8 pp in AUPRC over a state-of-the-art random forest baseline. Crucially, for hypoglycemia--a rare but life-threatening condition--MITST increases sensitivity by 7.2 pp, potentially enabling hundreds of earlier interventions across ICU populations. The flexible architecture of MITST allows seamless integration of new data sources without retraining the entire model, enhancing its adaptability for clinical decision support. While this study focuses on predicting BG levels, we also demonstrate MITST's ability to generalize to a distinct clinical task (in-hospital mortality prediction), highlighting its potential for broader applicability in ICU settings. MITST thus offers a robust and extensible solution for analyzing complex, multi-source, irregular time-series data.</description>

      <title>Beyond Subjectivity: Continuous Cybersickness Detection Using EEG-based Multitaper Spectrum Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22024v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) presents immersive opportunities across many applications, yet the inherent risk of developing cybersickness during interaction can severely reduce enjoyment and platform adoption. Cybersickness is marked by symptoms such as dizziness and nausea, which previous work primarily assessed via subjective post-immersion questionnaires and motion-restricted controlled setups. In this paper, we investigate the \emph{dynamic nature} of cybersickness while users experience and freely interact in VR. We propose a novel method to \emph{continuously} identify and quantitatively gauge cybersickness levels from users' \emph{passively monitored} electroencephalography (EEG) and head motion signals. Our method estimates multitaper spectrums from EEG, integrating specialized EEG processing techniques to counter motion artifacts, and, thus, tracks cybersickness levels in real-time. Unlike previous approaches, our method requires no user-specific calibration or personalization for detecting cybersickness. Our work addresses the considerable challenge of reproducibility and subjectivity in cybersickness research.</description>

      <title>Beyond ISAC: Toward Integrated Heterogeneous Service Provisioning via Elastic Multi-Dimensional Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the growing complexity of vertical applications, current integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in wireless networks remains insufficient for supporting all required beyond communication services. To this end, future networks are evolving toward an integrated heterogeneous service provisioning (IHSP) platform, which seeks to integrate a broad range of heterogeneous services beyond the dual-function scope of ISAC. Nevertheless, this trend intensifies conflicts among concurrent heterogeneous service requirements under constrained resource sharing. In this paper, we overcome this challenge by the joint use of two novel elastic design strategies: compromised service value assessment and flexible multi-dimensional resource multiplexing. Consequently, we propose a value-prioritized elastic multi-dimensional multiple access (MDMA) mechanism for IHSP systems. First, we modify the Value-of-Service (VoS) metric by incorporating elastic parameters to characterize user-specific tolerance and compromise in response to various performance degradations under constrained resources. This VoS metric serves as the foundation for prioritizing services and enabling effective fairness service scheduling among concurrent competing demands. Next, we adapt the MDMA to elastically multiplex services using appropriate multiple access schemes across different resource domains. This protocol leverages user-specific interference tolerances and cancellation capabilities across different domains to reduce resource-demanding conflicts and co-channel interference within the same domain. Then, we maximize the system's VoS by jointly optimizing MDMA and power allocation. Since this problem is non-convex, we develop a monotonic optimization-assisted dynamic programming algorithm for the optimal solution and a VoS-prioritized successive convex approximation algorithm for efficient suboptimal computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Changepoint localization is the problem of estimating the index at which a change occurred in the data generating distribution of an ordered list of data, or declaring that no change occurred. We present the broadly applicable CONCH (CONformal CHangepoint localization) algorithm, which uses a matrix of conformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint under the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are each exchangeable. We exemplify the CONCH algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to detect changes in sequences of images or text.</description>
