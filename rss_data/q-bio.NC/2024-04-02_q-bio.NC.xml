      <title>Variational design of sensory feedback for powerstroke-recovery systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although the raison d'etre of the brain is the survival of the body, there are relatively few theoretical studies of closed-loop rhythmic motor control systems. In this paper we provide a unified framework, based on variational analysis, for investigating the dual goals of performance and robustness in powerstroke-recovery systems. We augment two previously published closed-loop motor control models by equipping each model with a performance measure based on the rate of progress of the system relative to a spatially extended external substrate -- such as progress relative to the ground for a locomotor task. The sensitivity measure quantifies the ability of the system to maintain performance in response to external perturbations. Motivated by a search for optimal design principles for feedback control achieving the complementary requirements of efficiency and robustness, we discuss the performance-sensitivity patterns of the systems featuring different sensory feedback architectures. In a paradigmatic half-center oscillator (HCO)-motor system, we observe that the excitation-inhibition property of feedback mechanisms determines the sensitivity pattern while the activation-inactivation property determines the performance pattern. Moreover, we show that the nonlinearity of the sigmoid activation of feedback signals allows the existence of optimal combinations of performance and sensitivity. In a detailed hindlimb locomotor system, we find that a force-dependent feedback can simultaneously optimize both performance and robustness, while length-dependent feedback variations result in significant performance-versus-sensitivity tradeoffs. Thus, this work provides an analytical framework for studying feedback control of oscillations in nonlinear dynamical systems, leading to several insights that have the potential to inform the design of control or rehabilitation systems.</description>

      <title>Positioning is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One can drive around safely using a GPS without memorizing a world map (not to mention the dark regions that humans have never explored) because we only pay attention to the next instruction of turning. Such simple observation with attention mechanism has a profound implication on our understanding of how the brain works. The nonlinear effects generated by inhibitory networks have long been known to provide a ``winner-take-all'' mechanism for localized attention. This attention mechanism, at the system level, implements the selection/positioning operation needed by the hippocampus to provide spatio-temporal context to the neocortex. The localized receptive field of sensory organs, when inspected under the framework of embodied cognition, turns from a constraint to an advantage. Since we only need access to a local map, positioning works better than reconstruction. Such simple intuition implies that the attention mechanism is all you need to understand the flexible behavior generated by hippocampal-neocortical systems. Geometrically, we present a novel manifold positioning framework to explain the principle of localized embodied cognition. Through the co-evolution of the hippocampus and the neocortex, the positioning operation implemented by the attention mechanism can be interpreted as a nonlinear projection linking the discovery of local subspace structure by the neocortex (a sensorimotor machine generating the world map) with the navigation task in mind and $without$ discovering global manifold topology by the hippocampus (the neocortex's map index).</description>

      <title>Image Reconstruction from Electroencephalography Using Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have adopted the diffusion-based image reconstruction pipeline previously used for fMRI image reconstruction and applied it to Electroencephalography (EEG). The EEG encoding method is very simple, and forms a baseline from which more sophisticated EEG encoding methods can be compared. We have also evaluated the fidelity of the generated image using the same metrics used in the previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) works. Our results show that while the reconstruction from EEG recorded to rapidly presented images is not as good as reconstructions from fMRI to slower presented images, it holds a surprising amount of information that could be applied in specific use cases. Also, EEG-based image reconstruction works better in some categories-such as land animals and food-than others, shedding new light on previous findings of EEG's sensitivity to those categories and revealing potential for these methods to further understand EEG responses to human visual coding. More investigation should use longer-duration image stimulations to elucidate the later components that might be salient to the different image categories.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Hippocampal Shape Variations: A Study of Neurological Disorders Using Graph Variational Autoencoder with Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study focused on disentangling hippocampal shape variations from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) datasets within the context of neurological disorders. Leveraging a Graph Variational Autoencoder (VAE) enhanced with Supervised Contrastive Learning, our approach aims to improve interpretability by disentangling two distinct latent variables corresponding to age and the presence of diseases. In our ablation study, we investigate a range of VAE architectures and contrastive loss functions, showcasing the enhanced disentanglement capabilities of our approach. This evaluation uses synthetic 3D torus mesh data and real 3D hippocampal mesh datasets derived from the DTI hippocampal dataset. Our supervised disentanglement model outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods like attribute and guided VAEs in terms of disentanglement scores. Our model distinguishes between age groups and disease status in patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using the hippocampus data. Our Graph VAE with Supervised Contrastive Learning shows the volume changes of the hippocampus of MS populations at different ages, and the result is consistent with the current neuroimaging literature. This research provides valuable insights into the relationship between neurological disorder and hippocampal shape changes in different age groups of MS populations using a Graph VAE with Supervised Contrastive loss.</description>

      <title>Hodge-Decomposition of Brain Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.10542v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze brain networks by decomposing them into three orthogonal components: gradient, curl, and harmonic flows, through the Hodge decomposition, a technique advantageous for capturing complex topological features. A Wasserstein distance based topological inference is developed to determine the statistical significance of each component. The Hodge decomposition is applied to human brain networks obtained from a resting-state fMRI study. Our results indicate statistically significant differences in the topological features between male and female brain networks.</description>

      <title>Form Follows Function: A Different Approach to Neuron Connectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.03337v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A different method of discovering how neurons are connected to process information is presented here: Design a simple logic circuit that can perform a single, biologically advantageous function. Engineering concepts can be helpful in choosing the function and in designing the logic circuit. Several implementations of the method are reviewed to demonstrate how a biologically advantageous function can be chosen, how one simple network can generate major phenomena that are widely considered unrelated, and how one network design can lead to others that explain entirely different aspects of the brain. These results show that the method can benefit neuromorphic engineering as well as neuroscience, and that some brain functions can be carried out remarkably simply, at least in principle if not in the details.</description>

      <title>BrainKnow -- Extracting, Linking, and Associating Neuroscience Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04346v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast accumulation of neuroscience knowledge presents a challenge for researchers to timely and accurately locate the specific information they require. Constructing a knowledge engine that automatically extracts and organizes information from academic papers can provide researchers with timely and accurate informational services. We present the Brain Knowledge Engine (BrainKnow), which extracts and integrates neuroscience knowledge from published papers from PubMed. BrainKnow comprises a substantial repository, containing 3,626,931 relations spanning a broad spectrum of 37,011 neuroscience concepts extracted from 1817744 articles. The relations in BrainKnow can be accessed and navigated through a user-friendly web interface. Additionally, BrainKnow employs graph network algorithms for the recommendation and visualization of knowledge. BrainKnow is capable of automatic real-time updates. BrainKnow represents the first neuroscience knowledge graph that not only integrates knowledge in-depth but also facilitates fully automated updates.</description>

      <title>Cross-domain Fiber Cluster Shape Analysis for Language Performance Cognitive Score Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shape plays an important role in computer graphics, offering informative features to convey an object's morphology and functionality. Shape analysis in brain imaging can help interpret structural and functionality correlations of the human brain. In this work, we investigate the shape of the brain's 3D white matter connections and its potential predictive relationship to human cognitive function. We reconstruct brain connections as sequences of 3D points using diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) tractography. To describe each connection, we extract 12 shape descriptors in addition to traditional dMRI connectivity and tissue microstructure features. We introduce a novel framework, Shape--fused Fiber Cluster Transformer (SFFormer), that leverages a multi-head cross-attention feature fusion module to predict subject-specific language performance based on dMRI tractography. We assess the performance of the method on a large dataset including 1065 healthy young adults. The results demonstrate that both the transformer-based SFFormer model and its inter/intra feature fusion with shape, microstructure, and connectivity are informative, and together, they improve the prediction of subject-specific language performance scores. Overall, our results indicate that the shape of the brain's connections is predictive of human language function.</description>
