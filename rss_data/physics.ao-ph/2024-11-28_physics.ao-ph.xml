      <title>Gibbs states and Brownian models for coexisting haze and cloud droplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cloud microphysics studies include how tiny cloud droplets grow, and become rain. This is crucial for understanding cloud properties like size, lifespan, and impact on climate through radiative effects. Small, weak-updraft clouds near the haze-to-cloud transition are especially difficult to measure and understand. They are abundant but hard to capture by satellites. K\"ohler's theory explains initial droplet growth but struggles with large particle groups. Here, we present a stochastic, analytical framework building on K\"ohler's theory to account for (monodisperse) aerosols and cloud droplets interaction through competitive growth in a limited water vapor field. These interactions are modeled by sink terms while fluctuations in supersaturation affecting droplet growth are modeled by nonlinear, white noise terms. Our results identify hysteresis mechanisms in the droplet activation and deactivation processes. Our approach allows for multimodal cloud's droplet size distributions supported by lab experiments, offering a new perspective on haze-to-cloud transition and small cloud formation.</description>

      <title>Prediction Beyond the Medium Range with an Atmosphere-Ocean Model that Combines Physics-based Modeling and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the potential of a hybrid modeling approach that combines machine learning (ML) with conventional physics-based modeling for weather prediction beyond the medium range. It extends the work of Arcomano et al. (2022), which tested the approach for short- and medium-range weather prediction, and the work of Arcomano et al. (2023), which investigated its potential for climate modeling. The hybrid model used for the forecast experiments of the paper is based on the low-resolution, simplified parameterization atmospheric general circulation model SPEEDY. In addition to the hybridized prognostic variables of SPEEDY, the model has three purely ML-based prognostic variables: the 6h cumulative precipitation, the sea surface temperature, and the heat content of the top 300m deep layer of the ocean (a new addition compared to the model used in Arcomano et al., 2023). The model has skill in predicting the El Nino cycle and its global teleconnections with precipitation for 3-7 months depending on the season. The model captures equatorial variability of the precipitation associated with Kelvin and Rossby waves and MJO. Predictions of the precipitation in the equatorial region have skill for 15 days in the East Pacific and 11.5 days in the West Pacific. Though the model has low spatial resolution, for these tasks it has prediction skill comparable to what has been published for high-resolution, purely physics-based, conventional, operational forecast models.</description>
