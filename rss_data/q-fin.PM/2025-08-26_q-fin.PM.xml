      <title>Sizing the Risk: Kelly, VIX, and Hybrid Approaches in Put-Writing on Index Options</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines systematic put-writing strategies applied to S&amp;P 500 Index options, with a focus on position sizing as a key determinant of long-term performance. Despite the well-documented volatility risk premium, where implied volatility exceeds realized volatility, the practical implementation of short-dated volatility-selling strategies remains underdeveloped in the literature. This study evaluates three position sizing approaches: the Kelly criterion, VIX-based volatility regime scaling, and a novel hybrid method combining both. Using SPXW options with expirations from 0 to 5 days, the analysis explores a broad design space, including moneyness levels, volatility estimators, and memory horizons. Results show that ultra-short-dated, far out-of-the-money options deliver superior risk-adjusted returns. The hybrid sizing method consistently balances return generation with robust drawdown control, particularly under low-volatility conditions such as those seen in 2024. The study offers new insights into volatility harvesting, introducing a dynamic sizing framework that adapts to shifting market regimes. It also contributes practical guidance for constructing short-dated option strategies that are robust across market environments. These findings have direct applications for institutional investors seeking to enhance portfolio efficiency through systematic exposure to volatility premia.</description>

      <title>THEME : Enhancing Thematic Investing with Semantic Stock Representations and Temporal Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thematic investing aims to construct portfolios aligned with structural trends, yet selecting relevant stocks remains challenging due to overlapping sector boundaries and evolving market dynamics. To address this challenge, we construct the Thematic Representation Set (TRS), an extended dataset that begins with real-world thematic ETFs and expands upon them by incorporating industry classifications and financial news to overcome their coverage limitations. The final dataset contains both the explicit mapping of themes to their constituent stocks and the rich textual profiles for each. Building on this dataset, we introduce \textsc{THEME}, a hierarchical contrastive learning framework. By representing the textual profiles of themes and stocks as embeddings, \textsc{THEME} first leverages their hierarchical relationship to achieve semantic alignment. Subsequently, it refines these semantic embeddings through a temporal refinement stage that incorporates individual stock returns. The final stock representations are designed for effective retrieval of thematically aligned assets with strong return potential. Empirical results show that \textsc{THEME} outperforms strong baselines across multiple retrieval metrics and significantly improves performance in portfolio construction. By jointly modeling thematic relationships from text and market dynamics from returns, \textsc{THEME} provides a scalable and adaptive solution for navigating complex investment themes.</description>

      <title>Bimodal Dynamics of the Artificial Limit Order Book Stock Exchange with Autonomous Traders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the bifurcative dynamics of an artificial stock market exchange (ASME) with endogenous, myopic traders interacting through a limit order book (LOB). We showed that agent-based price dynamics possess intrinsic bistability, which is not a result of randomness but an emergent property of micro-level trading rules, where even identical initial conditions lead to qualitatively different long-run price equilibria: a deterministic zero-price state and a persistent positive-price equilibrium. The study also identifies a metastable region with elevated volatility between the basins of attraction and reveals distinct transient behaviors for trajectories converging to these equilibria. Furthermore, we observe that the system is neither entirely regular nor fully chaotic. By highlighting the emergence of divergent market outcomes from uniform beginnings, this work contributes a novel perspective on the inherent path dependence and complex dynamics of artificial stock markets.</description>

      <title>FinReflectKG: Agentic Construction and Evaluation of Financial Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The financial domain poses unique challenges for knowledge graph (KG) construction at scale due to the complexity and regulatory nature of financial documents. Despite the critical importance of structured financial knowledge, the field lacks large-scale, open-source datasets capturing rich semantic relationships from corporate disclosures. We introduce an open-source, large-scale financial knowledge graph dataset built from the latest annual SEC 10-K filings of all S and P 100 companies - a comprehensive resource designed to catalyze research in financial AI. We propose a robust and generalizable knowledge graph (KG) construction framework that integrates intelligent document parsing, table-aware chunking, and schema-guided iterative extraction with a reflection-driven feedback loop. Our system incorporates a comprehensive evaluation pipeline, combining rule-based checks, statistical validation, and LLM-as-a-Judge assessments to holistically measure extraction quality. We support three extraction modes - single-pass, multi-pass, and reflection-agent-based - allowing flexible trade-offs between efficiency, accuracy, and reliability based on user requirements. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that the reflection-agent-based mode consistently achieves the best balance, attaining a 64.8 percent compliance score against all rule-based policies (CheckRules) and outperforming baseline methods (single-pass and multi-pass) across key metrics such as precision, comprehensiveness, and relevance in LLM-guided evaluations.</description>

      <title>Is Causality Necessary for Efficient Portfolios? A Computational Perspective on Predictive Validity and Model Misspecification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23138v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent line of research has argued that causal factor models are necessary for portfolio optimization, claiming that structurally misspecified models inevitably produce inverted signals and nonviable frontiers. This paper challenges that view. We show, through theoretical analysis, simulation counterexamples, and empirical validation, that predictive models can remain operationally valid even when structurally incorrect. Our contributions are fourfold. First, we distinguish between directional agreement, ranking, and calibration, proving that sign alignment alone does not ensure efficiency when signals are mis-scaled. Second, we establish that structurally misspecified signals can still yield convex and viable efficient frontiers provided they maintain directional alignment with true returns. Third, we derive and empirically confirm a quantitative scaling law that shows how Sharpe ratios contract smoothly with declining alignment, thereby clarifying the role of calibration within the efficient set. Fourth, we validate these results on real financial data, demonstrating that predictive signals, despite structural imperfections, can support coherent frontiers. These findings refine the debate on causality in portfolio modeling. While causal inference remains valuable for interpretability and risk attribution, it is not a prerequisite for optimization efficiency. Ultimately, what matters is the directional fidelity and calibration of predictive signals in relation to their intended use in robust portfolio construction.</description>
