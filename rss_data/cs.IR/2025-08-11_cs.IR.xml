      <title>Request-Only Optimization for Recommendation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs) represent one of the largest machine learning applications on the planet. Industry-scale DLRMs are trained with petabytes of recommendation data to serve billions of users every day. To utilize the rich user signals in the long user history, DLRMs have been scaled up to unprecedented complexity, up to trillions of floating-point operations (TFLOPs) per example. This scale, coupled with the huge amount of training data, necessitates new storage and training algorithms to efficiently improve the quality of these complex recommendation systems. In this paper, we present a Request-Only Optimizations (ROO) training and modeling paradigm. ROO simultaneously improves the storage and training efficiency as well as the model quality of recommendation systems. We holistically approach this challenge through co-designing data (i.e., request-only data), infrastructure (i.e., request-only based data processing pipeline), and model architecture (i.e., request-only neural architectures). Our ROO training and modeling paradigm treats a user request as a unit of the training data. Compared with the established practice of treating a user impression as a unit, our new design achieves native feature deduplication in data logging, consequently saving data storage. Second, by de-duplicating computations and communications across multiple impressions in a request, this new paradigm enables highly scaled-up neural network architectures to better capture user interest signals, such as Generative Recommenders (GRs) and other request-only friendly architectures.</description>

      <title>Query-Aware Graph Neural Networks for Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) that leverages query-aware attention mechanisms and learned scoring heads to improve retrieval accuracy on complex, multi-hop questions. Unlike traditional dense retrieval methods that treat documents as independent entities, our approach constructs per-episode knowledge graphs that capture both sequential and semantic relationships between text chunks. We introduce an Enhanced Graph Attention Network with query-guided pooling that dynamically focuses on relevant parts of the graph based on user queries. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms standard dense retrievers on complex question answering tasks, particularly for questions requiring multi-document reasoning. Our implementation leverages PyTorch Geometric for efficient processing of graph-structured data, enabling scalable deployment in production retrieval systems</description>

      <title>AquiLLM: a RAG Tool for Capturing Tacit Knowledge in Research Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research groups face persistent challenges in capturing, storing, and retrieving knowledge that is distributed across team members. Although structured data intended for analysis and publication is often well managed, much of a group's collective knowledge remains informal, fragmented, or undocumented--often passed down orally through meetings, mentoring, and day-to-day collaboration. This includes private resources such as emails, meeting notes, training materials, and ad hoc documentation. Together, these reflect the group's tacit knowledge--the informal, experience-based expertise that underlies much of their work. Accessing this knowledge can be difficult, requiring significant time and insider understanding. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems offer promising solutions by enabling users to query and generate responses grounded in relevant source material. However, most current RAG-LLM systems are oriented toward public documents and overlook the privacy concerns of internal research materials. We introduce AquiLLM (pronounced ah-quill-em), a lightweight, modular RAG system designed to meet the needs of research groups. AquiLLM supports varied document types and configurable privacy settings, enabling more effective access to both formal and informal knowledge within scholarly groups.</description>

      <title>AI Guided Accelerator For Search Experience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective query reformulation is pivotal in narrowing the gap between a user's exploratory search behavior and the identification of relevant products in e-commerce environments. While traditional approaches predominantly model query rewrites as isolated pairs, they often fail to capture the sequential and transitional dynamics inherent in real-world user behavior. In this work, we propose a novel framework that explicitly models transitional queries--intermediate reformulations occurring during the user's journey toward their final purchase intent. By mining structured query trajectories from eBay's large-scale user interaction logs, we reconstruct query sequences that reflect shifts in intent while preserving semantic coherence. This approach allows us to model a user's shopping funnel, where mid-journey transitions reflect exploratory behavior and intent refinement. Furthermore, we incorporate generative Large Language Models (LLMs) to produce semantically diverse and intent-preserving alternative queries, extending beyond what can be derived through collaborative filtering alone. These reformulations can be leveraged to populate Related Searches or to power intent-clustered carousels on the search results page, enhancing both discovery and engagement. Our contributions include (i) the formal identification and modeling of transitional queries, (ii) the introduction of a structured query sequence mining pipeline for intent flow understanding, and (iii) the application of LLMs for scalable, intent-aware query expansion. Empirical evaluation demonstrates measurable gains in conversion and engagement metrics compared to the existing Related Searches module, validating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world e-commerce settings.</description>

      <title>OmniBench-RAG: A Multi-Domain Evaluation Platform for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is now widely adopted to enhance LLMs, evaluating its true performance benefits in a reproducible and interpretable way remains a major hurdle. Existing methods often fall short: they lack domain coverage, employ coarse metrics that miss sub document precision, and fail to capture computational trade offs. Most critically, they provide no standardized framework for comparing RAG effectiveness across different models and domains.
  We introduce OmniBench RAG, a novel automated platform for multi domain evaluation of RAG systems. The platform quantifies performance gains across accuracy and efficiency dimensions, spanning nine knowledge fields including culture, geography, and health. We introduce two standardized metrics: Improvements (accuracy gains) and Transformation (efficiency differences between pre RAG and post RAG models), enabling reproducible comparisons across models and tasks. The platform features dynamic test generation, modular evaluation pipelines, and automated knowledge base construction. Our evaluation reveals striking variability in RAG effectiveness, from significant gains in culture to declines in mathematics, highlighting the critical importance of systematic, domain aware assessment.

      <title>Lessons from A Large Language Model-based Outdoor Trail Recommendation Chatbot with Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing popularity of outdoor recreational activities (such as hiking and biking) has boosted the demand for a conversational AI system to provide informative and personalized suggestion on outdoor trails. Challenges arise in response to (1) how to provide accurate outdoor trail information via conversational AI; and (2) how to enable usable and efficient recommendation services. To address above, this paper discusses the preliminary and practical lessons learned from developing Judy, an outdoor trail recommendation chatbot based on the large language model (LLM) with retrieval augmented generation (RAG). To gain concrete system insights, we have performed case studies with the outdoor trails in Connecticut (CT), US. We have conducted web-based data collection, outdoor trail data management, and LLM model performance studies on the RAG-based recommendation. Our experimental results have demonstrated the accuracy, effectiveness, and usability of Judy in recommending outdoor trails based on the LLM with RAG.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Information Retrieval Techniques Applied to IT Support Tickets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Institutions dependent on IT services and resources acknowledge the crucial significance of an IT help desk system, that act as a centralized hub connecting IT staff and users for service requests. Employing various Machine Learning models, these IT help desk systems allow access to corrective actions used in the past, but each model has different performance when applied to different datasets. This work compares eleven Information Retrieval techniques in a dataset of IT support tickets, with the goal of implementing a software that facilitates the work of Information Technology support analysts. The best results were obtained with the Sentence-BERT technique, in its multi-language variation distilluse-base-multilingual-cased-v1, where 78.7% of the recommendations made by the model were considered relevant. TF-IDF (69.0%), Word2vec (68.7%) and LDA (66.3%) techniques also had consistent results. Furthermore, the used datasets and essential parts of coding have been published and made open source. It also demonstrated the practicality of a support ticket recovery system by implementing a minimal viable prototype, and described in detail the implementation of the system. Finally, this work proposed a novel metric for comparing the techniques, whose aim is to closely reflect the perception of the IT analysts about the retrieval quality.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single Labels: Improving Conversational Recommendation through LLM-Powered Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conversational recommender systems (CRSs) enhance recommendation quality by engaging users in multi-turn dialogues, capturing nuanced preferences through natural language interactions. However, these systems often face the false negative issue, where items that a user might like are incorrectly labeled as negative during training, leading to suboptimal recommendations.Expanding the label set through data augmentation presents an intuitive solution but faces the challenge of balancing two key aspects: ensuring semantic relevance and preserving the collaborative information inherent in CRS datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel data augmentation framework that first leverages an LLM-based semantic retriever to identify diverse and semantically relevant items, which are then filtered by a relevance scorer to remove noisy candidates. Building on this, we introduce a two-stage training strategy balancing semantic relevance and collaborative information. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets and user simulators demonstrate significant and consistent performance improvements across various recommenders, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach in advancing CRS performance.</description>

      <title>Open-Source Agentic Hybrid RAG Framework for Scientific Literature Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surge in scientific publications challenges traditional review methods, demanding tools that integrate structured metadata with full-text analysis. Hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, combining graph queries with vector search offer promise but are typically static, rely on proprietary tools, and lack uncertainty estimates. We present an agentic approach that encapsulates the hybrid RAG pipeline within an autonomous agent capable of (1) dynamically selecting between GraphRAG and VectorRAG for each query, (2) adapting instruction-tuned generation in real time to researcher needs, and (3) quantifying uncertainty during inference. This dynamic orchestration improves relevance, reduces hallucinations, and promotes reproducibility.
  Our pipeline ingests bibliometric open-access data from PubMed, arXiv, and Google Scholar APIs, builds a Neo4j citation-based knowledge graph (KG), and embeds full-text PDFs into a FAISS vector store (VS) using the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model. A Llama-3.3-70B agent selects GraphRAG (translating queries to Cypher for KG) or VectorRAG (combining sparse and dense retrieval with re-ranking). Instruction tuning refines domain-specific generation, and bootstrapped evaluation yields standard deviation for evaluation metrics.
  On synthetic benchmarks mimicking real-world queries, the Instruction-Tuned Agent with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) outperforms the baseline, achieving a gain of 0.63 in VS Context Recall and a 0.56 gain in overall Context Precision. Additional gains include 0.24 in VS Faithfulness, 0.12 in both VS Precision and KG Answer Relevance, 0.11 in overall Faithfulness score, 0.05 in KG Context Recall, and 0.04 in both VS Answer Relevance and overall Precision. These results highlight the system's improved reasoning over heterogeneous sources and establish a scalable framework for autonomous, agentic scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Retrieval for Scalable Visual Search in a Two-Sided Marketplace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual search offers an intuitive way for customers to explore diverse product catalogs, particularly in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) marketplaces where listings are often unstructured and visually driven. This paper presents a scalable visual search system deployed in Mercari's C2C marketplace, where end-users act as buyers and sellers. We evaluate recent vision-language models for zero-shot image retrieval and compare their performance with an existing fine-tuned baseline. The system integrates real-time inference and background indexing workflows, supported by a unified embedding pipeline optimized through dimensionality reduction. Offline evaluation using user interaction logs shows that the multilingual SigLIP model outperforms other models across multiple retrieval metrics, achieving a 13.3% increase in nDCG@5 over the baseline. A one-week online A/B test in production further confirms real-world impact, with the treatment group showing substantial gains in engagement and conversion, up to a 40.9% increase in transaction rate via image search. Our findings highlight that recent zero-shot models can serve as a strong and practical baseline for production use, which enables teams to deploy effective visual search systems with minimal overhead, while retaining the flexibility to fine-tune based on future data or domain-specific needs.</description>

      <title>From Static to Dynamic: A Streaming RAG Approach to Real-time Knowledge Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic streams from news feeds, social media, sensor networks, and financial markets challenge static RAG frameworks. Full-scale indices incur high memory costs; periodic rebuilds introduce latency that undermines data freshness; naive sampling sacrifices semantic coverage. We present Streaming RAG, a unified pipeline that combines multi-vector cosine screening, mini-batch clustering, and a counter-based heavy-hitter filter to maintain a compact prototype set. We further prove an approximation bound \$E\[R(K\_t)] \ge R^\* - L \Delta\$ linking retrieval quality to clustering variance. An incremental index upsert mechanism refreshes prototypes without interrupting queries. Experiments on eight real-time streams show statistically significant gains in Recall\@10 (up to 3 points, p &lt; 0.01), end-to-end latency below 15 ms, and throughput above 900 documents per second under a 150 MB budget. Hyperparameter sensitivity analysis over cluster count, admission probability, relevance threshold, and counter capacity validates default settings. In open-domain question answering with GPT-3.5 Turbo, we record 3.2-point gain in Exact Match and 2.8-point gain in F1 on SQuAD; abstractive summarization yields ROUGE-L improvements. Streaming RAG establishes a new Pareto frontier for retrieval augmentation.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Electric Power Industry Customer Support</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many AI customer service systems use standard NLP pipelines or finetuned language models, which often fall short on ambiguous, multi-intent, or detail-specific queries. This case study evaluates recent techniques: query rewriting, RAG Fusion, keyword augmentation, intent recognition, and context reranking, for building a robust customer support system in the electric power domain. We compare vector-store and graph-based RAG frameworks, ultimately selecting the graph-based RAG for its superior performance in handling complex queries. We find that query rewriting improves retrieval for queries using non-standard terminology or requiring precise detail. RAG Fusion boosts performance on vague or multifaceted queries by merging multiple retrievals. Reranking reduces hallucinations by filtering irrelevant contexts. Intent recognition supports the decomposition of complex questions into more targeted sub-queries, increasing both relevance and efficiency. In contrast, keyword augmentation negatively impacts results due to biased keyword selection. Our final system combines intent recognition, RAG Fusion, and reranking to handle disambiguation and multi-source queries. Evaluated on both a GPT-4-generated dataset and a real-world electricity provider FAQ dataset, it achieves 97.9% and 89.6% accuracy respectively, substantially outperforming baseline RAG models.</description>

      <title>HySemRAG: A Hybrid Semantic Retrieval-Augmented Generation Framework for Automated Literature Synthesis and Methodological Gap Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present HySemRAG, a framework that combines Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipelines with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to automate large-scale literature synthesis and identify methodological research gaps. The system addresses limitations in existing RAG architectures through a multi-layered approach: hybrid retrieval combining semantic search, keyword filtering, and knowledge graph traversal; an agentic self-correction framework with iterative quality assurance; and post-hoc citation verification ensuring complete traceability. Our implementation processes scholarly literature through eight integrated stages: multi-source metadata acquisition, asynchronous PDF retrieval, custom document layout analysis using modified Docling architecture, bibliographic management, LLM-based field extraction, topic modeling, semantic unification, and knowledge graph construction. The system creates dual data products - a Neo4j knowledge graph enabling complex relationship queries and Qdrant vector collections supporting semantic search - serving as foundational infrastructure for verifiable information synthesis. Evaluation across 643 observations from 60 testing sessions demonstrates structured field extraction achieving 35.1% higher semantic similarity scores (0.655 $\pm$ 0.178) compared to PDF chunking approaches (0.485 $\pm$ 0.204, p &lt; 0.000001). The agentic quality assurance mechanism achieves 68.3% single-pass success rates with 99.0% citation accuracy in validated responses. Applied to geospatial epidemiology literature on ozone exposure and cardiovascular disease, the system identifies methodological trends and research gaps, demonstrating broad applicability across scientific domains for accelerating evidence synthesis and discovery.</description>

      <title>ITDR: An Instruction Tuning Dataset for Enhancing Large Language Models in Recommendations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding performance in natural language processing tasks. However, in the field of recommendation systems, due to the structural differences between user behavior data and natural language, LLMs struggle to effectively model the associations between user preferences and items. Although prompt-based methods can generate recommendation results, their inadequate understanding of recommendation tasks leads to constrained performance. To address this gap, in this work, we construct a sufficient instruction tuning dataset, ITDR, which encompasses 7 subtasks across two core root tasks--user-item interaction and user-item understanding. The dataset integrates data from 13 public recommendation datasets and is built using manually crafted standardized templates, comprising approximately 200,000 instances. Experimental results demonstrate that ITDR significantly enhances the performance of mainstream open-source LLMs such as GLM-4, Qwen2.5, Qwen2.5-Instruct and LLaMA-3.2 on recommendation tasks. Furthermore, we analyze the correlations between tasks and explore the impact of task descriptions and data scale on instruction tuning effectiveness. Finally, we perform comparative experiments against closed-source LLMs with substantial parameters. Our tuning dataset ITDR and the fine-tuned large recommendation models can be accessed at https://github.com/hellolzk/ITDR.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Vision-Language Models for Markdown Conversion of Financial Tables in Malaysian Audited Financial Reports</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately extracting and representing the structure of tabular data from financial documents remains a critical challenge in document understanding, particularly for regulatory and analytical use cases. This study addresses the complexity of converting financial tables from Malaysian audited financial reports into Markdown format, a task complicated by rotated layouts, multi-level headers, and implicit structural cues. We propose a fine-tuned vision-language model (VLM), based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, optimized for high-fidelity Markdown generation from document images. Our approach includes a curated dataset of 2,152 image-text pairs with augmentations and a supervised fine-tuning strategy using LoRA. To assess performance, we evaluated our model on 100 out-of-sample tables using a dual framework: a criteria-based LLM-as-a-judge for fine-grained accuracy and our novel Markdown Tree-Edit-Distance-based Similarity (TEDS) metric for holistic structural fidelity. Our model achieves a 92.20% overall accuracy on the criteria-based assessment and a 96.53% Markdown TEDS score. This performance significantly surpasses its Qwen2.5-VL-7B base model, larger-scale VLMs, and specialized reasoning-enabled models. Compared to these self-hosted alternatives, it also significantly reduces inference time. Furthermore, its accuracy exceeds that of widely used proprietary models such as OpenAI's GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash. These results demonstrate that domain-specific fine-tuning provides an effective and efficient method to bridge the gap between unstructured financial documents and downstream automation, rivalling much larger and more general models without their computational overhead.</description>

      <title>LMAR: Language Model Augmented Retriever for Domain-specific Knowledge Indexing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often struggle with domain-specific knowledge due to performance deterioration of pre-trained embeddings and prohibitive computational costs of large language model (LLM)-based retrievers. While fine-tuning data augmentation embedding models offers a promising direction, its effectiveness is limited by the need for high-quality training data and reliable chunking strategies that preserve contextual integrity. We propose LMAR (Language Model Augmented Retriever), a model-agnostic framework that addresses these challenges by combining LLM-guided data synthesis with contrastive embedding adaptation and efficient text clustering. LMAR consists of a two-stage pipeline: (1) Triplet sampling and synthetic data augmentation, where LLMs act as both labeler and validator to ensure high-fidelity supervision throughout the pipeline. Experimental results across multiple domain-specific benchmark datasets demonstrate that LMAR outperforms multiple baseline models, while maintaining moderate hardware requirements and low latency. Its model-agnostic nature further enables seamless integration with emerging RAG architectures and text embedding models, ensuring continual improvements without redesigning the pipeline. These results highlight LMAR as a practical and cost-effective solution for scalable domain-specific adaptation.</description>

      <title>Breaking the Top-$K$ Barrier: Advancing Top-$K$ Ranking Metrics Optimization in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of recommender systems (RS), Top-$K$ ranking metrics such as NDCG@$K$ are the gold standard for evaluating recommendation performance. However, during the training of recommendation models, optimizing NDCG@$K$ poses significant challenges due to its inherent discontinuous nature and the intricate Top-$K$ truncation. Recent efforts to optimize NDCG@$K$ have either overlooked the Top-$K$ truncation or suffered from high computational costs and training instability. To overcome these limitations, we propose SoftmaxLoss@$K$ (SL@$K$), a novel recommendation loss tailored for NDCG@$K$ optimization. Specifically, we integrate the quantile technique to handle Top-$K$ truncation and derive a smooth upper bound for optimizing NDCG@$K$ to address discontinuity. The resulting SL@$K$ loss has several desirable properties, including theoretical guarantees, ease of implementation, computational efficiency, gradient stability, and noise robustness. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets and three recommendation backbones demonstrate that SL@$K$ outperforms existing losses with a notable average improvement of 6.03%.

      <title>Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning and Prompt-Based Learning: A Comparative Study for developing Natural Language-Based BIM Information Retrieval Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building Information Modeling (BIM) is essential for managing building data across the entire lifecycle, supporting tasks from design to maintenance. Natural Language Interface (NLI) systems are increasingly explored as user-friendly tools for information retrieval in Building Information Modeling (BIM) environments. Despite their potential, accurately extracting BIM-related data through natural language queries remains a persistent challenge due to the complexity use queries and specificity of domain knowledge. This study presents a comparative analysis of two prominent approaches for developing NLI-based BIM information retrieval systems: domain-specific fine-tuning and prompt-based learning using large language models (LLMs). A two-stage framework consisting of intent recognition and table-based question answering is implemented to evaluate the effectiveness of both approaches. To support this evaluation, a BIM-specific dataset of 1,740 annotated queries of varying types across 69 models is constructed. Experimental results show that domain-specific fine-tuning delivers superior performance in intent recognition tasks, while prompt-based learning, particularly with GPT-4o, shows strength in table-based question answering. Based on these findings, this study identify a hybrid configuration that combines fine-tuning for intent recognition with prompt-based learning for question answering, achieving more balanced and robust performance across tasks. This integrated approach is further tested through case studies involving BIM models of varying complexity. This study provides a systematic analysis of the strengths and limitations of each approach and discusses the applicability of the NLI to real-world BIM scenarios. The findings offer insights for researchers and practitioners in designing intelligent, language-driven BIM systems.</description>

      <title>Are All Genders Equal in the Eyes of Algorithms? -- Analysing Search and Retrieval Algorithms for Algorithmic Gender Fairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Algorithmic systems such as search engines and information retrieval platforms significantly influence academic visibility and the dissemination of knowledge. Despite assumptions of neutrality, these systems can reproduce or reinforce societal biases, including those related to gender. This paper introduces and applies a bias-preserving definition of algorithmic gender fairness, which assesses whether algorithmic outputs reflect real-world gender distributions without introducing or amplifying disparities. Using a heterogeneous dataset of academic profiles from German universities and universities of applied sciences, we analyse gender differences in metadata completeness, publication retrieval in academic databases, and visibility in Google search results. While we observe no overt algorithmic discrimination, our findings reveal subtle but consistent imbalances: male professors are associated with a greater number of search results and more aligned publication records, while female professors display higher variability in digital visibility. These patterns reflect the interplay between platform algorithms, institutional curation, and individual self-presentation. Our study highlights the need for fairness evaluations that account for both technical performance and representational equality in digital systems.</description>

      <title>LLM4ES: Learning User Embeddings from Event Sequences via Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents LLM4ES, a novel framework that exploits large pre-trained language models (LLMs) to derive user embeddings from event sequences. Event sequences are transformed into a textual representation, which is subsequently used to fine-tune an LLM through next-token prediction to generate high-quality embeddings. We introduce a text enrichment technique that enhances LLM adaptation to event sequence data, improving representation quality for low-variability domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLM4ES achieves state-of-the-art performance in user classification tasks in financial and other domains, outperforming existing embedding methods. The resulting user embeddings can be incorporated into a wide range of applications, from user segmentation in finance to patient outcome prediction in healthcare.</description>

      <title>Multi-Faceted Large Embedding Tables for Pinterest Ads Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large embedding tables are indispensable in modern recommendation systems, thanks to their ability to effectively capture and memorize intricate details of interactions among diverse entities. As we explore integrating large embedding tables into Pinterest's ads ranking models, we encountered not only common challenges such as sparsity and scalability, but also several obstacles unique to our context. Notably, our initial attempts to train large embedding tables from scratch resulted in neutral metrics. To tackle this, we introduced a novel multi-faceted pretraining scheme that incorporates multiple pretraining algorithms. This approach greatly enriched the embedding tables and resulted in significant performance improvements. As a result, the multi-faceted large embedding tables bring great performance gain on both the Click-Through Rate (CTR) and Conversion Rate (CVR) domains. Moreover, we designed a CPU-GPU hybrid serving infrastructure to overcome GPU memory limits and elevate the scalability. This framework has been deployed in the Pinterest Ads system and achieved 1.34% online CPC reduction and 2.60% CTR increase with neutral end-to-end latency change.</description>

      <title>G-UBS: Towards Robust Understanding of Implicit Feedback via Group-Aware User Behavior Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: User feedback is critical for refining recommendation systems, yet explicit feedback (e.g., likes or dislikes) remains scarce in practice. As a more feasible alternative, inferring user preferences from massive implicit feedback has shown great potential (e.g., a user quickly skipping a recommended video usually indicates disinterest). Unfortunately, implicit feedback is often noisy: a user might skip a video due to accidental clicks or other reasons, rather than disliking it. Such noise can easily misjudge user interests, thereby undermining recommendation performance. To address this issue, we propose a novel Group-aware User Behavior Simulation (G-UBS) paradigm, which leverages contextual guidance from relevant user groups, enabling robust and in-depth interpretation of implicit feedback for individual users. Specifically, G-UBS operates via two key agents. First, the User Group Manager (UGM) effectively clusters users to generate group profiles utilizing a ``summarize-cluster-reflect" workflow based on LLMs. Second, the User Feedback Modeler (UFM) employs an innovative group-aware reinforcement learning approach, where each user is guided by the associated group profiles during the reinforcement learning process, allowing UFM to robustly and deeply examine the reasons behind implicit feedback. To assess our G-UBS paradigm, we have constructed a Video Recommendation benchmark with Implicit Feedback (IF-VR). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal benchmark for implicit feedback evaluation in video recommendation, encompassing 15k users, 25k videos, and 933k interaction records with implicit feedback. Extensive experiments on IF-VR demonstrate that G-UBS significantly outperforms mainstream LLMs and MLLMs, with a 4.0% higher proportion of videos achieving a play rate &gt; 30% and 14.9% higher reasoning accuracy on IF-VR.</description>

      <title>WebWatcher: Breaking New Frontier of Vision-Language Deep Research Agent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05748v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Web agents such as Deep Research have demonstrated superhuman cognitive abilities, capable of solving highly challenging information-seeking problems. However, most research remains primarily text-centric, overlooking visual information in the real world. This makes multimodal Deep Research highly challenging, as such agents require much stronger reasoning abilities in perception, logic, knowledge, and the use of more sophisticated tools compared to text-based agents. To address this limitation, we introduce WebWatcher, a multi-modal Agent for Deep Research equipped with enhanced visual-language reasoning capabilities. It leverages high-quality synthetic multimodal trajectories for efficient cold start training, utilizes various tools for deep reasoning, and further enhances generalization through reinforcement learning. To better evaluate the capabilities of multimodal agents, we propose BrowseComp-VL, a benchmark with BrowseComp-style that requires complex information retrieval involving both visual and textual information. Experimental results show that WebWatcher significantly outperforms proprietary baseline, RAG workflow and open-source agents in four challenging VQA benchmarks, which paves the way for solving complex multimodal information-seeking tasks.</description>

      <title>Dual prototype attentive graph network for cross-market recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cross-market recommender systems (CMRS) aim to utilize historical data from mature markets to promote multinational products in emerging markets. However, existing CMRS approaches often overlook the potential for shared preferences among users in different markets, focusing primarily on modeling specific preferences within each market. In this paper, we argue that incorporating both market-specific and market-shared insights can enhance the generalizability and robustness of CMRS. We propose a novel approach called Dual Prototype Attentive Graph Network for Cross-Market Recommendation (DGRE) to address this. DGRE leverages prototypes based on graph representation learning from both items and users to capture market-specific and market-shared insights. Specifically, DGRE incorporates market-shared prototypes by clustering users from various markets to identify behavioural similarities and create market-shared user profiles. Additionally, it constructs item-side prototypes by aggregating item features within each market, providing valuable market-specific insights. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of DGRE on a real-world cross-market dataset, and the results show that considering both market-specific and market-sharing aspects in modelling can improve the generalization and robustness of CMRS.</description>

      <title>Efficient Multimodal Streaming Recommendation via Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Streaming recommender systems (SRSs) are widely deployed in real-world applications, where user interests shift and new items arrive over time. As a result, effectively capturing users' latest preferences is challenging, as interactions reflecting recent interests are limited and new items often lack sufficient feedback. A common solution is to enrich item representations using multimodal encoders (e.g., BERT or ViT) to extract visual and textual features. However, these encoders are pretrained on general-purpose tasks: they are not tailored to user preference modeling, and they overlook the fact that user tastes toward modality-specific features such as visual styles and textual tones can also drift over time. This presents two key challenges in streaming scenarios: the high cost of fine-tuning large multimodal encoders, and the risk of forgetting long-term user preferences due to continuous model updates.
  To tackle these challenges, we propose Expandable Side Mixture-of-Experts (XSMoE), a memory-efficient framework for multimodal streaming recommendation. XSMoE attaches lightweight side-tuning modules consisting of expandable expert networks to frozen pretrained encoders and incrementally expands them in response to evolving user feedback. A gating router dynamically combines expert and backbone outputs, while a utilization-based pruning strategy maintains model compactness. By learning new patterns through expandable experts without overwriting previously acquired knowledge, XSMoE effectively captures both cold start and shifting preferences in multimodal features. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that XSMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both recommendation quality and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Semantic Item Graph Enhancement for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation systems have attracted increasing attention for their improved performance by leveraging items' multimodal information. Prior methods often build modality-specific item-item semantic graphs from raw modality features and use them as supplementary structures alongside the user-item interaction graph to enhance user preference learning. However, these semantic graphs suffer from semantic deficiencies, including (1) insufficient modeling of collaborative signals among items and (2) structural distortions introduced by noise in raw modality features, ultimately compromising performance. To address these issues, we first extract collaborative signals from the interaction graph and infuse them into each modality-specific item semantic graph to enhance semantic modeling. Then, we design a modulus-based personalized embedding perturbation mechanism that injects perturbations with modulus-guided personalized intensity into embeddings to generate contrastive views. This enables the model to learn noise-robust representations through contrastive learning, thereby reducing the effect of structural noise in semantic graphs. Besides, we propose a dual representation alignment mechanism that first aligns multiple semantic representations via a designed Anchor-based InfoNCE loss using behavior representations as anchors, and then aligns behavior representations with the fused semantics by standard InfoNCE, to ensure representation consistency. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework.</description>

      <title>Improving Table Retrieval with Question Generation from Partial Tables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in open-domain question answering over tables have widely adopted large language models (LLMs) under the Retriever-Reader architecture. Prior works have effectively leveraged LLMs to tackle the complex reasoning demands of the Reader component, such as text-to-text, text-to-SQL, and multi hop reasoning. In contrast, the Retriever component has primarily focused on optimizing the query representation-training retrievers to retrieve relevant tables based on questions, or to select keywords from questions for matching table segments. However, little attention has been given to enhancing how tables themselves are represented in embedding space to better align with questions. To address this, we propose QGpT (Question Generation from Partial Tables), a simple yet effective method that uses an LLM to generate synthetic questions based on small portions of a table. These questions are generated to simulate how a user might query the content of the table currently under consideration. The generated questions are then jointly embedded with the partial table segments used for generation, enhancing semantic alignment with user queries. Without the need to embed entire tables, our method significantly improves retrieval performance across multiple benchmarks for both dense and late-interaction retrievers.</description>

      <title>M2IO-R1: An Efficient RL-Enhanced Reasoning Framework for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Multimodal Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current research on Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) enables diverse multimodal inputs but remains limited to single-modality outputs, restricting expressive capacity and practical utility. In contrast, real-world applications often demand both multimodal inputs and multimodal outputs for effective communication and grounded reasoning. Motivated by the recent success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in complex reasoning tasks for Large Language Models (LLMs), we adopt RL as a principled and effective paradigm to address the multi-step, outcome-driven challenges inherent in multimodal output generation. Here, we introduce M2IO-R1, a novel framework for Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Multimodal Generation (MRAMG) that supports both multimodal inputs and outputs. Central to our framework is an RL-based inserter, Inserter-R1-3B, trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization to guide image selection and placement in a controllable and semantically aligned manner. Empirical results show that our lightweight 3B inserter achieves strong reasoning capabilities with significantly reduced latency, outperforming baselines in both quality and efficiency.</description>

      <title>eSASRec: Enhancing Transformer-based Recommendations in a Modular Fashion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since their introduction, Transformer-based models, such as SASRec and BERT4Rec, have become common baselines for sequential recommendations, surpassing earlier neural and non-neural methods. A number of following publications have shown that the effectiveness of these models can be improved by, for example, slightly updating the architecture of the Transformer layers, using better training objectives, and employing improved loss functions. However, the additivity of these modular improvements has not been systematically benchmarked - this is the gap we aim to close in this paper. Through our experiments, we identify a very strong model that uses SASRec's training objective, LiGR Transformer layers, and Sampled Softmax Loss. We call this combination eSASRec (Enhanced SASRec). While we primarily focus on realistic, production-like evaluation, in our preliminarily study we find that common academic benchmarks show eSASRec to be 23% more effective compared to the most recent state-of-the-art models, such as ActionPiece. In our main production-like benchmark, eSASRec resides on the Pareto frontier in terms of the accuracy-coverage tradeoff (alongside the recent industrial models HSTU and FuXi. As the modifications compared to the original SASRec are relatively straightforward and no extra features are needed (such as timestamps in HSTU), we believe that eSASRec can be easily integrated into existing recommendation pipelines and can can serve as a strong yet very simple baseline for emerging complicated algorithms. To facilitate this, we provide the open-source implementations for our models and benchmarks in repository https://github.com/blondered/transformer_benchmark</description>

      <title>Maximum Impact with Fewer Features: Efficient Feature Selection for Cold-Start Recommenders through Collaborative Importance Weighting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cold-start challenges in recommender systems necessitate leveraging auxiliary features beyond user-item interactions. However, the presence of irrelevant or noisy features can degrade predictive performance, whereas an excessive number of features increases computational demands, leading to higher memory consumption and prolonged training times.
  To address this, we propose a feature selection strategy that prioritizes the user behavioral information. Our method enhances the feature representation by incorporating correlations from collaborative behavior data using a hybrid matrix factorization technique and then ranks features using a mechanism based on the maximum volume algorithm. This approach identifies the most influential features, striking a balance between recommendation accuracy and computational efficiency. We conduct an extensive evaluation across various datasets and hybrid recommendation models, demonstrating that our method excels in cold-start scenarios by selecting minimal yet highly effective feature subsets. Even under strict feature reduction, our approach surpasses existing feature selection techniques while maintaining superior efficiency.</description>

      <title>Planning Agents on an Ego-Trip: Leveraging Hybrid Ego-Graph Ensembles for Improved Tool Retrieval in Enterprise Task Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective tool retrieval is essential for AI agents to select from a vast array of tools when identifying and planning actions in the context of complex user queries. Despite its central role in planning, this aspect remains underexplored in the literature. Traditional approaches rely primarily on similarities between user queries and tool descriptions, which significantly limits retrieval accuracy, specifically when handling multi-step user requests. To address these limitations, we propose a Knowledge Graph (KG)-based tool retrieval framework that captures the semantic relationships between tools and their functional dependencies. Our retrieval algorithm leverages ensembles of 1-hop ego tool graphs to model direct and indirect connections between tools, enabling more comprehensive and contextual tool selection for multi-step tasks. We evaluate our approach on a synthetically generated internal dataset across six defined user classes, extending previous work on coherent dialogue synthesis and too retrieval benchmarks. Results demonstrate that our tool graph-based method achieves 91.85% tool coverage on the micro-average Complete Recall metric, compared to 89.26% for re-ranked semantic-lexical hybrid retrieval, the strongest non-KG baseline in our experiments. These findings support our hypothesis that the structural information in the KG provides complementary signals to pure similarity matching, particularly for queries requiring sequential tool composition.</description>

      <title>When a Paper Has 1000 Authors: Rethinking Citation Metrics in the Era of LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Author-level citation metrics provide a practical, interpretable, and scalable signal of scholarly influence in a complex research ecosystem. It has been widely used as a proxy in hiring decisions. However, the past five years have seen the rapid emergence of large-scale publications in the field of large language models and foundation models, with papers featuring hundreds to thousands of co-authors and receiving tens of thousands of citations within months. For example, Gemini has 1361 authors and has been cited around 4600 times in 19 months. In such cases, traditional metrics, such as total citation count and the $h$-index, fail to meaningfully distinguish individual contributions. Therefore, we propose the following research question: How can one identify standout researchers among thousands of co-authors in large-scale LLM papers? This question is particularly important in scenarios such as academic hiring and funding decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel citation metric designed to address this challenge by balancing contributions across large-scale and small-scale publications. We propose the SBCI index, analyze its theoretical properties, and evaluate its behavior on synthetic publication datasets. Our results demonstrate that the proposed metric provides a more robust and discriminative assessment of individual scholarly impact in the era of large-scale collaborations.</description>

      <title>Few-Shot Prompting for Extractive Quranic QA with Instruction-Tuned LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two effective approaches for Extractive Question Answering (QA) on the Quran. It addresses challenges related to complex language, unique terminology, and deep meaning in the text. The second uses few-shot prompting with instruction-tuned large language models such as Gemini and DeepSeek. A specialized Arabic prompt framework is developed for span extraction. A strong post-processing system integrates subword alignment, overlap suppression, and semantic filtering. This improves precision and reduces hallucinations. Evaluations show that large language models with Arabic instructions outperform traditional fine-tuned models. The best configuration achieves a pAP10 score of 0.637. The results confirm that prompt-based instruction tuning is effective for low-resource, semantically rich QA tasks.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Literature Review of Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Techniques, Metrics, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This systematic review of the research literature on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) provides a focused analysis of the most highly cited studies published between 2020 and May 2025. A total of 128 articles met our inclusion criteria. The records were retrieved from ACM Digital Library, IEEE Xplore, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and the Digital Bibliography and Library Project (DBLP). RAG couples a neural retriever with a generative language model, grounding output in up-to-date, non-parametric memory while retaining the semantic generalisation stored in model weights. Guided by the PRISMA 2020 framework, we (i) specify explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria based on citation count and research questions, (ii) catalogue datasets, architectures, and evaluation practices, and (iii) synthesise empirical evidence on the effectiveness and limitations of RAG. To mitigate citation-lag bias, we applied a lower citation-count threshold to papers published in 2025 so that emerging breakthroughs with naturally fewer citations were still captured. This review clarifies the current research landscape, highlights methodological gaps, and charts priority directions for future research.</description>

      <title>ArchRAG: Attributed Community-based Hierarchical Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09891v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven effective in integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs) for solving question-answer (QA) tasks. The state-of-the-art RAG approaches often use the graph data as the external data since they capture the rich semantic information and link relationships between entities. However, existing graph-based RAG approaches cannot accurately identify the relevant information from the graph and also consume large numbers of tokens in the online retrieval process. To address these issues, we introduce a novel graph-based RAG approach, called Attributed Community-based Hierarchical RAG (ArchRAG), by augmenting the question using attributed communities, and also introducing a novel LLM-based hierarchical clustering method. To retrieve the most relevant information from the graph for the question, we build a novel hierarchical index structure for the attributed communities and develop an effective online retrieval method. Experimental results demonstrate that ArchRAG outperforms existing methods in both accuracy and token cost.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Light for Cold-Start Recommendations: Leveraging Epistemic Uncertainty to Enhance Performance in User-Item Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16256v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most recent paradigms of generative model-based recommendation still face challenges related to the cold-start problem. Existing models addressing cold item recommendations mainly focus on acquiring more knowledge to enrich embeddings or model inputs. However, many models do not assess the efficiency with which they utilize the available training knowledge, leading to the extraction of significant knowledge that is not fully used, thus limiting improvements in cold-start performance. To address this, we introduce the concept of epistemic uncertainty to indirectly define how efficiently a model uses the training knowledge. Since epistemic uncertainty represents the reducible part of the total uncertainty, we can optimize the recommendation model further based on epistemic uncertainty to improve its performance. To this end, we propose a Cold-Start Recommendation based on Epistemic Uncertainty (CREU) framework. Additionally, CREU is inspired by Pairwise-Distance Estimators (PaiDEs) to efficiently and accurately measure epistemic uncertainty by evaluating the mutual information between model outputs and weights in high-dimensional spaces. The proposed method is evaluated through extensive offline experiments on public datasets, which further demonstrate the advantages and robustness of CREU. The source code is available at https://github.com/EsiksonX/CREU.</description>

      <title>Rank1: Test-Time Compute for Reranking in Information Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce Rank1, the first reranking model trained to take advantage of test-time compute. Rank1 demonstrates the applicability within retrieval of using a reasoning language model (i.e. OpenAI's o1, Deepseek's R1, etc.) for distillation in order to rapidly improve the performance of a smaller model. We gather and open-source a dataset of more than 600,000 examples of R1 reasoning traces from queries and passages in MS MARCO. Models trained on this dataset show: (1) state-of-the-art performance on advanced reasoning and instruction following datasets; (2) work remarkably well out of distribution due to the ability to respond to user-input prompts; and (3) have explainable reasoning chains that can be given to users or RAG-based systems. Further, we demonstrate that quantized versions of these models retain strong performance while using less compute/memory. Overall, Rank1 shows that test-time compute allows for a fundamentally new type of explainable and performant reranker model for search.</description>

      <title>Nyay-Darpan: Enhancing Decision Making Through Summarization and Case Retrieval for Consumer Law in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06090v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: AI-based judicial assistance and case prediction have been extensively studied in criminal and civil domains, but remain largely unexplored in consumer law, especially in India. In this paper, we present Nyay-Darpan, a novel two-in-one framework that (i) summarizes consumer case files and (ii) retrieves similar case judgements to aid decision-making in consumer dispute resolution. Our methodology not only addresses the gap in consumer law AI tools but also introduces an innovative approach to evaluate the quality of the summary. The term 'Nyay-Darpan' translates into 'Mirror of Justice', symbolizing the ability of our tool to reflect the core of consumer disputes through precise summarization and intelligent case retrieval. Our system achieves over 75 percent accuracy in similar case prediction and approximately 70 percent accuracy across material summary evaluation metrics, demonstrating its practical effectiveness. We will publicly release the Nyay-Darpan framework and dataset to promote reproducibility and facilitate further research in this underexplored yet impactful domain.</description>

      <title>CAMEF: Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting by Integrating Time Series Patterns and Salient Macroeconomic Announcements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04592v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurately forecasting the impact of macroeconomic events is critical for investors and policymakers. Salient events like monetary policy decisions and employment reports often trigger market movements by shaping expectations of economic growth and risk, thereby establishing causal relationships between events and market behavior. Existing forecasting methods typically focus either on textual analysis or time-series modeling, but fail to capture the multi-modal nature of financial markets and the causal relationship between events and price movements. To address these gaps, we propose CAMEF (Causal-Augmented Multi-Modality Event-Driven Financial Forecasting), a multi-modality framework that effectively integrates textual and time-series data with a causal learning mechanism and an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation technique for causal-enhanced financial forecasting. Our contributions include: (1) a multi-modal framework that captures causal relationships between policy texts and historical price data; (2) a new financial dataset with six types of macroeconomic releases from 2008 to April 2024, and high-frequency real trading data for five key U.S. financial assets; and (3) an LLM-based counterfactual event augmentation strategy. We compare CAMEF to state-of-the-art transformer-based time-series and multi-modal baselines, and perform ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of the causal learning mechanism and event types.</description>

      <title>DAGR: Decomposition Augmented Graph Retrieval with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but struggle with multi-hop reasoning and factual consistency, limiting their effectiveness on knowledge-intensive tasks like complex question answering (QA). Linking Knowledge Graphs (KG) and LLMs has shown promising results, but LLMs generally lack the ability to reason efficiently over graph-structured information. To address this challenge, we introduce DAGR, a retrieval method that leverages both complex questions and their decomposition in subquestions to extract relevant, linked textual subgraphs. DAGR first breaks down complex queries, retrieves subgraphs guided by a weighted similarity function over both the original and decomposed queries, and creates a question-specific knowledge graph to guide answer generation. The resulting Graph-RAG pipeline is suited to handle complex multi-hop questions and effectively reason over graph-structured data. We evaluate DAGR on standard multi-hop QA benchmarks and show that it achieves comparable or superior performance to competitive existing methods, using smaller models and fewer LLM calls.</description>

Abstract: The increasing emphasis on privacy in recommendation systems has led to the adoption of Federated Learning (FL) as a privacy-preserving solution, enabling collaborative training without sharing user data. While Federated Recommendation (FedRec) effectively protects privacy, existing methods struggle with non-stationary data streams, failing to maintain consistent recommendation quality over time. On the other hand, Continual Learning Recommendation (CLRec) methods address evolving user preferences but typically assume centralized data access, making them incompatible with FL constraints. To bridge this gap, we introduce Federated Continual Recommendation (FCRec), a novel task that integrates FedRec and CLRec, requiring models to learn from streaming data while preserving privacy. As a solution, we propose F3CRec, a framework designed to balance knowledge retention and adaptation under the strict constraints of FCRec. F3CRec introduces two key components: Adaptive Replay Memory on the client side, which selectively retains past preferences based on user-specific shifts, and Item-wise Temporal Mean on the server side, which integrates new knowledge while preserving prior information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that F3CRec outperforms existing approaches in maintaining recommendation quality over time in a federated environment.</description>
