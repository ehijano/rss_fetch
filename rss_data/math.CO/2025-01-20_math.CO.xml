      <title>Spectral Bounds of the Generating Graph of $\mathbb{Z}_n.$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group. A group is said to be $k$-generated if it can be generated by its $k$ elements. A generating set of $G$ is called a minimal generating set if no proper subset of it generates $G.$ A minimal generating set of a group can have different sizes. The generating graph $\Gamma (G)$ of a group $G$ is defined as a graph with the vertex set $G$, where two distinct vertices are adjacent if they together generate $G.$ This graph is particularly useful when studying 2-generated groups. In this context, consider the group $G = \mathbb{Z}_n$, the integers modulo $n.$ In this paper, we explore various graph-theoretic properties of the generating graph $\Gamma(\mathbb{Z}_n)$ and investigate the spectra of its adjacency and Laplacian matrices. Additionally, we explicitly determine the set of all possible minimal generating sets of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ of size $k.$</description>

Abstract: Barbieri recently showed that the finite graphs realising any given finite automorphism group have unbounded genus, answering a question of Cornwell et al. In this note we give a short proof of a stronger result: they have unbounded clique number.</description>

      <title>Coarse tree-width</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove two theorems about tree-decompositions in the setting of coarse graph theory. First, we show that a graph $G$ admits a tree-decomposition in which each bag is contained in the union of a bounded number of balls of bounded radius, if and only if $G$ admits a quasi-isometry to a graph with bounded tree-width. (The ``if'' half is easy, but the ``only if'' half is challenging.) This generalizes a recent result of Berger and Seymour, concerning tree-decompositions when each bag has bounded radius.
  Second, we show that if $G$ admits a quasi-isometry $\phi$ to a graph $H$ of bounded path-width, then $G$ admits a quasi-isometry (with error only an additive constant) to a graph of bounded path-width. Indeed, we will show a much stronger statement: that we can assign a non-negative integer length to each edge of $H$, such that the same function $\phi$ is a quasi-isometry (with error only an additive constant) to this weighted version of $H$.</description>

      <title>The semi-inducibility problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $H$ be a $k$-edge-coloured graph and let $n$ be a positive integer. What is the maximum number of copies of $H$ in a $k$-edge-coloured complete graph on $n$ vertices? We investigate this problem in the case of $k=2$ colours, which has close ties to the inducibility problem of Pippenger and Golumbic. We prove sharp or almost sharp results for alternating walks, for alternating cycles of length divisible by 4, and for 4-cycles of every colour pattern.</description>

      <title>Exact VC-Dimensions of Certain Geometric Set Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VC-dimension of a family of sets is a measure of its combinatorial complexity used in machine learning theory, computational geometry, and even model theory. Computing the VC-dimension of the $k$-fold union of geometric set systems has been an open and difficult combinatorial problem, dating back to Blumer, Ehrenfeucht, Haussler, and Warmuth in 1989, who ask about the VC-dimension of $k$-fold unions of half-spaces in $\mathbb{R}^d$.
  Let $\mathcal{F}_1$ denote the family of all lines in $\mathbb{R}^2$. It is well-known that $\mathsf{VC}\text{-}\mathsf{dim}(\mathcal{F}_1) = 2$. In this paper, we study the $2$-fold and $3$-fold unions of $\mathcal{F}_1$, denoted $\mathcal{F}_2$ and $\mathcal{F}_3$, respectively. We show that $\mathsf{VC}\text{-}\mathsf{dim}(\mathcal{F}_2) = 5$ and $\mathsf{VC}\text{-}\mathsf{dim}(\mathcal{F}_3) = 9$. Moreover, we give complete characterisations of the subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$ of maximal size that can be shattered by $\mathcal{F}_2$ and $\mathcal{F}_3$, showing they are exactly two and five, respectively, up to isomorphism in the language of the point-line incidence relation.</description>

      <title>Improved bound on the number of cycle sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cycle set of a graph $G$ is the set consisting of all sizes of cycles in $G$. Answering a conjecture of Erd\H{o}s and Faudree, Verstra\"{e}te showed that there are at most $2^{n - n^{1/10}}$ different cycle sets of graphs with $n$ vertices. We improve this bound to $2^{n - n^{1/2 - o(1)}}$. Our proof follows the general strategy of Verstra\"{e}te of reducing the problem to counting cycle sets of Hamiltonian graphs with many chords or a large maximum degree. The key new ingredients are near-optimal container lemmata for cycle sets of such graphs.</description>

      <title>The sign character of the triagonal fermionic coinvariant ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We determine the trigraded multiplicity of the sign character of the triagonal fermionic coinvariant ring $R_n^{(0,3)}$. As a corollary, this proves a conjecture of Bergeron (2020) that the dimension of the sign character of $R_n^{(0,3)}$ is $n^2-n+1$. We also give an explicit formula for double hook characters in the diagonal fermionic coinvariant ring $R_n^{(0,2)}$, and discuss methods towards calculating the sign character of $R_n^{(0,4)}$. Finally, we give a multigraded refinement of a conjecture of Bergeron (2020) that the dimension of the sign character of the $(1,3)$-bosonic-fermionic coinvariant ring $R_n^{(1,3)}$ is $\frac{1}{2}F_{3n}$, where $F_n$ is a Fibonacci number.</description>

      <title>Further Results for the Capacity Statistic Distribution on Compositions of 1's and 2's</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study additional aspects of the capacity distribution on the set $\mathcal{B}_n$ of compositions of $n$ consisting of $1$'s and $2$'s. Among our results are further recurrences for this distribution as well as formulas for the total capacity and sign balance on $\mathcal{B}_n$. We provide algebraic and combinatorial proofs of our results. We also give combinatorial explanations of some prior results where such a proof was requested. Finally, the joint distribution of the capacity statistic with two further parameters on $\mathcal{B}_n$ is briefly considered.</description>

      <title>Word-representability of co-bipartite graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V, E)$ is word-representable, if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that for letters $\{x,y\}\in V$, $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$ if and only if $xy \in E$. A graph is co-bipartite if its complement is a bipartite graph. Therefore, the vertex set of a co-bipartite graph can be partitioned into two disjoint cliques.
  The concept of word-representability for co-bipartite graphs has not yet been fully studied. In the book Words and Graphs written by Sergey Kitaev and Vadim Lozin, examples of co-bipartite graphs that are not word-representable are provided. The authors have stated that it remains an open problem to characterize word-representable co-bipartite graphs. It is known that taking the complement of word-representable graphs does not preserve their word-representability. In this paper, we first identify certain classes of bipartite graphs for which word-representation is preserved after the complement operation. We found that the complement of the path graphs, even cycle graphs and generalized crown graphs are also word-representable. Next, we aim to find word-representable co-bipartite graphs in which the size of one clique partition is fixed while the other one can vary. We studied the word-representability of co-bipartite graphs where the sizes of one clique partition are $2$ and $3$. We found that any co-bipartite graphs where the size of the one clique partition is $2$ are word-representable. Also, when the size of the one clique partition is $3$, we found certain co-bipartite graphs are word-representable. Additionally, for word-representable graphs, it has been established that a graph is word-representable if and only if it can be oriented in a specific manner, known as semi-transitive orientation. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for a co-bipartite graph to have a semi-transitive orientation.</description>

      <title>p-Strong Roman Domination in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Domination in graphs is a widely studied field, where many different definitions have been introduced in the last years to respond to different network requirements. This paper presents a new dominating parameter based on the well-known strong Roman domination model. Given a positive integer $p$, we call a $p$-strong Roman domination function ($p$-StRDF) in a graph $G$ to a function $f:V(G)\rightarrow \{0,1,2, \ldots , \left\lceil \frac{\Delta+p}{p} \right\rceil \}$ having the property that if $f(v)=0$, then there is a vertex $u\in N(v)$ such that $f(u) \ge 1+ \left\lceil \frac{ |B_0\cap N(u)|}{p} \right\rceil $, where $B_0$ is the set of vertices with label $0$. The $p$-strong Roman domination number $\gamma_{StR}^p(G)$ is the minimum weight (sum of labels) of a $p$-StRDF on $G$. We study the NP-completeness of the \emph{$p$-StRD}-problem, we also provide general and tight upper and lower bounds depending on several classical invariants of the graph and, finally, we determine the exact values for some families of graphs.</description>

      <title>Maximal NIC-plane graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is called {\it NIC-planar} if it admits a drawing in the plane such that each edge is crossed at most once and two pairs of crossing edges share at most one vertex. A graph together with a NIC-planar drawing is a {\it NIC-plane graph}. A NIC-plane graph is maximal if no new edge can be added so that the resulting graph is still NIC-plane. In this paper, we show that any maximal NIC-plane graph of order $n$ and minimum degree at least $3$ has at least $\frac{7}{3}n-\frac{10}{3}$ edges, and any maximal NIC-plane graph of order $n$ has at least $\frac{11}{5}n-\frac{18}{5}$ edges. Moreover, both lower bounds are tight for infinitely many positive integers $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the enumeration problem of higher dimensional partitions, a natural generalisation of classical integer partitions. We show that their counting problem is equivalent to the enumeration of simpler classes of higher dimensional partitions, satisfying suitable constraints on their embedding dimension and socle type. We provide exact formulas for the generating functions of several infinite families of such partitions, and design a procedure enumerating them in the general case. As a proof of concept, we determine the number of partitions of size up to 30 in any dimension.</description>

      <title>The Pop-Stack Operator on Ornamentation Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Each rooted plane tree $\mathsf{T}$ has an associated ornamentation lattice $\mathcal{O}(\mathsf{T})$. The ornamentation lattice of an $n$-element chain is the $n$-th Tamari lattice. We study the pop-stack operator $\mathsf{Pop}\colon\mathcal{O}(\mathsf{T})\to\mathcal{O}(\mathsf{T})$, which sends each element $\delta$ to the meet of the elements covered by or equal to $\delta$. We compute the maximum size of a forward orbit of $\mathsf{Pop}$ on $\mathcal{O}(\mathsf{T})$, generalizing a result of Defant for Tamari lattices. We also characterize the image of $\mathsf{Pop}$ on $\mathcal{O}(\mathsf{T})$, generalizing a result of Hong for Tamari lattices. For each integer $k\geq 0$, we provide necessary conditions for an element of $\mathcal{O}(\mathsf{T})$ to be in the image of $\mathsf{Pop}^k$. This allows us to completely characterize the image of $\mathsf{Pop}^k$ on a Tamari lattice.</description>

Abstract: It is a classical problem in algebraic topology asked by Steenrod which graded rings occur as the cohomology ring of a space.
  In this paper, we define an algebraic version of the graph colouring, span colouring, and observe the relation between span colourings and Steenrod's problem for graded Stanley-Reisner rings, in other words polynomial rings divided by an ideal generated by square-free monic monomials.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Algorithm for Permutation Iteration Using a Singly Linked List</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for iterating over all permutations of a sequence. The algorithm leverages elementary operations on recursive lists. Within each recursive call, only two operations are required to generate all permutations (albeit in an unusual order): swapping the first two elements of the list or moving the last element to the front. As a result, no new nodes are allocated during the computation. Instead, all elements are rearranged within the original nodes of the singly linked list throughout the process. A proof of concept written in the Lisp programming language is proposed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Cutwidth and Crossings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide theoretical insights around the cutwidth of a graph and the One-Sided Crossing Minimization (OSCM) problem. OSCM was posed in the Parameterized Algorithms and Computational Experiments Challenge 2024, where the cutwidth of the input graph was the parameter in the parameterized track. We prove an asymptotically sharp upper bound on the size of a graph in terms of its order and cutwidth. As the number of so-called unsuited pairs is one of the factors that determine the difficulty of an OSCM instance, we provide a sharp upper bound on them in terms of the order $n$ and the cutwidth of the input graph. If the cutwidth is bounded by a constant, this implies an $\mathcal{O}(2^n)$-time algorithm, while the trivial algorithm has a running time of $\mathcal{O}(2^{n^2})$. At last, we prove structural properties of the so-called crossing numbers in an OSCM instance.</description>

      <title>The Erd\H{o}s--Moser sum-free set problem via improved bounds for $k$-configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A $k$-configuration is a collection of $k$ distinct integers $x_1,\ldots,x_k$ together with their pairwise arithmetic means $\frac{x_i+x_j}{2}$ for $1 \leq i &lt; j \leq k$. Building on recent work of Filmus, Hatami, Hosseini and Kelman on binary systems of linear forms and of Kelley and Meka on Roth's theorem on arithmetic progressions, we show that, for $N \geq \exp((k\log(2/\alpha))^{O(1)})$, any subset $A \subseteq [N]$ of density at least $\alpha$ contains a $k$-configuration. This improves on the previously best known bound $N \geq \exp((2/\alpha)^{O(k^2)})$, due to Shao. As a consequence, it follows that any finite non-empty set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}$ contains a subset $B \subseteq A$ of size at least $(\log|A|)^{1+\Omega(1)}$ such that $b_1+b_2 \not\in A$ for any distinct $b_1,b_2 \in B$. This provides a new proof of a lower bound for the Erd\H{o}s--Moser sum-free set problem of the same shape as the best known bound, established by Sanders.</description>

      <title>Random-Key Algorithms for Optimizing Integrated Operating Room Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient surgery room scheduling is essential for hospital efficiency, patient satisfaction, and resource utilization. This study addresses this challenge by introducing a novel concept of Random-Key Optimizer (RKO), rigorously tested on literature and new, real-world inspired instances. Our combinatorial optimization problem incorporates multi-room scheduling, equipment scheduling, and complex availability constraints for rooms, patients, and surgeons, facilitating rescheduling and enhancing operational flexibility. The RKO approach represents solutions as points in a continuous space, which are then mapped in the problem solution space via a deterministic function known as a decoder. The core idea is to operate metaheuristics and heuristics in the random-key space, unaware of the original solution space. We design the Biased Random-Key Genetic Algorithm with $Q$-Learning, Simulated Annealing, and Iterated Local Search for use within an RKO framework, employing a single decoder function. The proposed metaheuristics are complemented by lower-bound formulations, providing optimal gaps for evaluating the effectiveness of the heuristic results. Our results demonstrate significant lower and upper bounds improvements for the literature instances, notably proving one optimal result. Furthermore, the best-proposed metaheuristic efficiently generates schedules for the newly introduced instances, even in highly constrained scenarios. This research offers valuable insights and practical solutions for improving surgery scheduling processes, offering tangible benefits to hospitals by optimising resource allocation, reducing patient wait times, and enhancing overall operational efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Letting $\delta_1(n,m)$ be the density of the set of integers with exactly one divisor in $(n,m)$, Erd\H{o}s wondered if $\delta_1(n,m)$ is unimodular for fixed $n$.
  We prove this is false in general, as the sequence $(\delta_1(n,m))$ has superpolynomially many local extrema. However, we confirm unimodality in the single case for which it occurs; $n = 1$.
  We also solve the question on unimodality of the density of integers whose $k^{th}$ prime is $p$.</description>

      <title>Hypergraph Tur\'an Problems in $\ell_2$-Norm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.10406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are various different notions measuring extremality of hypergraphs. In this survey we compare the recently introduced notion of the codegree squared extremal function with the Tur\'an function, the minimum codegree threshold and the uniform Tur\'an density.
  The codegree squared sum $\textrm{co}_2(G)$ of a $3$-uniform hypergraph $G$ is defined to be the sum of codegrees squared $d(x,y)^2$ over all pairs of vertices $x,y$. In other words, this is the square of the $\ell_2$-norm of the codegree vector. We are interested in how large $\textrm{co}_2(G)$ can be if we require $G$ to be $H$-free for some $3$-uniform hypergraph $H$. This maximum value of $\textrm{co}_2(G)$ over all $H$-free $n$-vertex $3$-uniform hypergraphs $G$ is called the codegree squared extremal function, which we denote by $\textrm{exco}_2(n,H)$. We systemically study the extremal codegree squared sum of various $3$-uniform hypergraphs using various proof techniques. Some of our proofs rely on the flag algebra method while others use more classical tools such as the stability method. In particular, we (asymptotically) determine the codegree squared extremal numbers of matchings, stars, paths, cycles, and $F_5$, the $5$-vertex hypergraph with edge set $\{123,124,345\}$.
  Additionally, our paper has a survey format, as we state several conjectures and give an overview of Tur\'an densities, minimum codegree thresholds and codegree squared extremal numbers of popular hypergraphs. We intend to update the arXiv version of this paper regularly.</description>

      <title>A note on an application of discrete Morse theoretic techniques on the complex of disconnected graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08086v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Robin Forman's highly influential 2002 paper A User's Guide to Discrete Morse Theory presents an overview of the subject in a very readable manner. As a proof of concept, the author determines the topology (homotopy type) of the abstract simplicial complex of disconnected graphs of order $n$ (which was previously done by Victor Vassiliev using classical topological methods) using discrete Morse theoretic techniques, which are purely combinatorial in nature. The techniques involve the construction (and verification) of a discrete gradient vector field on the complex. However, the verification part relies on a claim that doesn't seem to hold. In this note, we provide a couple of counterexamples against this specific claim. We also provide an alternative proof of the bigger claim that the constructed discrete vector field is indeed a gradient vector field. Our proof technique relies on a key observation which is not specific to the problem at hand, and thus is applicable while verifying a constructed discrete vector field is a gradient one in general.</description>

Abstract: For each uniformity $k \geq 3$, we construct $k$-uniform linear hypergraphs $G$ with arbitrarily large maximum degree $\Delta$ whose independence polynomial $Z_G$ has a root $\lambda$ with $\lvert\lambda\rvert = O\left(\frac{\log \Delta}{\Delta}\right)$. This disproves a recent conjecture of Galvin, McKinley, Perkins, Sarantis, and Tetali.</description>

Abstract: Soprunov and Soprunova introduced the notion of a good infinite family of toric codes. We prove that such good families do not exist by proving a more general Szemer\'edi-type result: for all $c\in(0,1]$ and all positive integers $N$, subsets of density at least $c$ in $\{0,1,\dots,N-1\}^n$ contain hypercubes of arbitrarily large dimension as $n$ grows.</description>

Abstract: We introduce path-conjoined graphs defined for two rooted graphs by joining their roots with a path, and investigate the chromatic symmetric functions of its two generalizations: spider-conjoined graphs and chain-conjoined graphs. By using the composition method developed by Zhou and the third author recently, we obtain neat positive $e_I$-expansions for the chromatic symmetric functions of clique-path-cycle graphs, path-clique-path graphs, and clique-clique-path graphs. We pose the $e$-positivity conjecture for hat-chains.</description>

      <title>Connections between Combinations Without Specified Separations and Strongly Restricted Permutations, Compositions, and Bit Strings</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00624v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ and $S_{n,k}$ be, respectively, the number of subsets and $k$-subsets of $\mathbb{N}_n=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that no two subset elements differ by an element of the set $\mathcal{Q}$, the largest element of which is $q$. We prove a bijection between such $k$-subsets when $\mathcal{Q}=\{m,2m,\ldots,jm\}$ with $j,m&gt;0$ and permutations $\pi$ of $\mathbb{N}_{n+jm}$ with $k$ excedances satisfying $\pi(i)-i\in\{-m,0,jm\}$ for all $i\in\mathbb{N}_{n+jm}$. We also identify a bijection between another class of restricted permutation and the cases $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,q\}$. This bijection allows us to prove a conjectured recursion relation for the number of such permutations which corresponds to the case $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,4\}$. We also obtain the generating function for $S_n$ in the case $\mathcal{Q}=\{1,5\}$ by first obtaining generating functions for the numbers of closed walks of a given length on a particular class of directed pseudograph. We give some classes of $\mathcal{Q}$ for which $S_n$ is also the number of compositions of $n+q$ into a given set of allowed parts. A bijection between the $k$-subsets for any $\mathcal{Q}$ and bit strings is also noted. Aided by this, an efficient algorithm for finding $S_n$ and $S_{n,k}$ is given. We also prove a bijection between $k$-subsets for a class of $\mathcal{Q}$ and the set representations of size $k$ of equivalence classes for the occurrence of a given length-($q+1$) subword within bit strings. We then formulate a straightforward procedure for obtaining the generating function for the number of such equivalence classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01743v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A positroid is a matroid realized by a matrix such that all maximal minors are non-negative. Positroid polytopes are matroid polytopes of positroids. In particular, they are lattice polytopes. The Ehrhart polynomial of a lattice polytope counts the number of integer points in the dilation of that polytope. The Ehrhart series is the generating function of the Ehrhart polynomial, a rational function with a numerator called the $h^*$-polynomial. We give explicit formulas for the $h^*$-polynomials of an arbitrary positroid polytope regarding permutation descents. Our result generalizes that of Early, Kim, and Li for hypersimplices.</description>

      <title>A charge monomial basis of the Garsia-Procesi ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a basis of the Garsia-Procesi ring using the catabolizability type of standard Young tableaux and the charge statistic. This basis turns out to be equal to the descent basis defined in Carlsson-Chou (2024+). Our new construction connects the combinatorics of the basis with the well-known combinatorial formula for the modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials $\tilde{H}_\mu[X;q]$, due to Lascoux, which expresses the polynomials as a sum over standard tableaux that satisfy a catabolizability condition. In addition, we prove that identifying a basis for the antisymmetric part of $R_{\mu}$ with respect to a Young subgroup $S_\gamma$ is equivalent to finding pairs of standard tableaux that satisfy conditions regarding catabolizability and descents. This gives an elementary proof of the fact that the graded Frobenius character of $R_{\mu}$ is given by the catabolizability formula for $\tilde{H}_\mu[X;q]$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a formula for the density of $0$ in the sequence of generalized Motzkin numbers, $M^{a, b}_n$, modulo a prime, $p$, in terms of the first $p$ generalized central trinomial coefficients $T^{a, b}_n\bmod p$ (with $n&lt;p$). We apply our method to various other sequences to obtain similar formulas. We also prove that $T^{a, b}_{p-1-n}\equiv (b^2-4a^2)^{\frac{p-1}{2}-n}T^{a, b}_n\pmod p$ to obtain tight lower bounds for the density of $0$ in our sequences. This symmetry of the first $p$ central trinomial coefficients mod $p$ also appears in a couple of other applications, including the proof of a novel symmetry of the first $p-2$ Motzkin numbers that is of independent interest: $M^{a, b}_{p-3-n}\equiv (b^2-4a^2)^{\frac{p-3}{2}-n}M^{a, b}_n\pmod p$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1710.10888v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in the plane. We compute the value of $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$ for which the rectilinear convex hull of $P$, denoted by $\mathcal{RH}_\theta(P)$, has minimum (or maximum) area in optimal $O(n\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space, improving the previous $O(n^2)$ bound. Let $\mathcal{O}$ be a set of $k$ lines through the origin sorted by slope and let $\alpha_i$ be the sizes of the $2k$ angles defined by pairs of two consecutive lines, $i=1, \ldots , 2k$. Let $\Theta_{i}=\pi-\alpha_i$ and $\Theta=\min\{\Theta_i \colon i=1,\ldots,2k\}$. We obtain: (1) Given a set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\Theta\ge\frac{\pi}{2}$, we provide an algorithm to compute the $\mathcal{O}$-convex hull of $P$ in optimal $O(n\log n)$ time and $O(n)$ space; If $\Theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$, the time and space complexities are $O(\frac{n}{\Theta}\log n)$ and $O(\frac{n}{\Theta})$ respectively. (2) Given a set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\Theta\ge\frac{\pi}{2}$, we compute and maintain the boundary of the ${\mathcal{O}}_{\theta}$-convex hull of $P$ for $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$ in $O(kn\log n)$ time and $O(kn)$ space, or if $\Theta &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$, in $O(k\frac{n}{\Theta}\log n)$ time and $O(k\frac{n}{\Theta})$ space. (3) Finally, given a set $\mathcal{O}$ such that $\Theta\ge\frac{\pi}{2}$, we compute, in $O(kn\log n)$ time and $O(kn)$ space, the angle $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$ such that the $\mathcal{O}_{\theta}$-convex hull of $P$ has minimum (or maximum) area over all $\theta\in [0,2\pi)$.</description>

Abstract: The paper [GLZ] "L-functions of Carlitz modules, resultantal varieties and rooted binary trees" is devoted to a description of some resultantal varieties related to L-functions of Carlitz modules. It contains a conjecture that some of these varieties coincide. This conjecture can be formulated in terms of polynomials, namely, in terms of a fact that an explicitly defined polynomial belongs to the radical of the ideal generated by some other polynomials. We give an explicit statement of this conjecture and a numerical result.</description>

      <title>Bounded twin-width graphs are polynomially $\chi$-bounded</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11231v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every graph with twin-width $t$ has chromatic number $O(\omega ^{k_t})$ for some integer $k_t$, where $\omega$ denotes the clique number. This extends a quasi-polynomial bound from Pilipczuk and Soko{\l}owski and generalizes a result for bounded clique-width graphs by Bonamy and Pilipczuk. The proof uses the main ideas of the quasi-polynomial approach, with a different treatment of the decomposition tree. In particular, we identify two types of extensions of a class of graphs: the delayed-extension (which preserves polynomial $\chi$-boundedness) and the right-extension (which preserves polynomial $\chi$-boundedness under bounded twin-width condition). Our main result is that every bounded twin-width graph is a delayed extension of simpler classes of graphs, each expressed as a bounded union of right extensions of lower twin-width graphs.</description>

      <title>Spherical complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07727v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we define spherical complexes as simplicial complexes with the property that every subcomplex obtained by a sequence of links and deletions either has trivial homology, or has the homology of a sphere. Examples of such complexes are independence complexes of ternary graphs and independence complexes of simplicial forests. We give criteria for when a spherical complex is acyclic, and describe the dimension of the sphere when it is not. We then apply our results to compute the Leray number of these complexes, and define combinatorial invariants for them which are counterparts to algebraic invariants of their Stanley-Reisner rings.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, Topology, and Convexity of Recurrence in Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04108v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider non-homogeneous random walks on the two-dimensional positive quadrant $\mathbb{N}^2$ and the one-dimensional slab $\{0,1,\dots,k\}\times\mathbb{N}$. In the 1960's the following question was asked for $\mathbb{N}^2$: is it true if such a random walk $X$ is recurrent and $Y$ is another random walk that at every point is more likely to go down and more likely to go left than $Y$, then $Y$ is also recurrent?
  We provide an example showing that the answer is negative. We also show, via a coupling argument, that if either the random walk $X$ or $Y$ is sufficiently homogeneous then the answer is in fact positive. In addition, we show using the Rayleigh monotonicity principle that the analogous question for random walks on trees is positive.
  These results show that the subset of parameter space that yields recurrent random walks possesses some geometric properties, in this case the structure of an order ideal. Motivated by this perspective, we consider the more symmetric setting of homogeneous random walks on finitely generated abelian groups, and ask when this subset possesses other geometric properties, namely various topological properties and convexity. We answer some of these questions: in particular, we show that this subset is closed, and under a symmetric support condition, show it is path-connected and additionally show it is convex if and only if its effective dimension is at most 2. We also show its complement is in some sense typically path-connected but not convex. We finally propose some related open problems.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Bugs: The Limits of Symmetry Metrics to Detect Partisan Gerrymandering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12167v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider two symmetry metrics commonly used to analyze partisan gerrymandering: the Mean-Median Difference (MM) and Partisan Bias (PB). Our main results compare, for combinations of seats and votes achievable in districted elections, the number of districts won by each party to the extent of potential deviation from the ideal metric values, taking into account the political geography of the state. These comparisons are motivated by examples where the MM and PB have been used in efforts to detect when a districting plan awards extreme number of districts won by some party. These examples include expert testimony, public-facing apps, recommendations by experts to redistricting commissions, and public policy proposals.
  To achieve this goal we perform both theoretical and empirical analyses of the MM and PB. In our theoretical analysis, we consider vote-share, seat-share pairs (V, S) for which one can construct election data having vote share V and seat share S, and turnout is equal in each district. We calculate the range of values that MM and PB can achieve on that constructed election data. In the process, we find the range of (V,S) pairs that achieve MM = 0, and see that the corresponding range for PB is the same set of (V,S) pairs. We show how the set of such (V,S) pairs allowing for MM = 0 (and PB = 0) changes when turnout in each district is allowed to vary. By observing the results of this theoretical analysis, we can show that the values taken on by these metrics do not necessarily attain more extreme values in plans with more extreme numbers of districts won. We also analyze specific example elections, showing how these metrics can return unintuitive results. We follow this with an empirical study, where we show that on 18 different U.S. maps these metrics can fail to detect extreme seats outcomes.</description>

      <title>Cycles in graphs and in hypergraphs: towards homology theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this expository paper we present some ideas of algebraic topology (more precisely, of homology theory) in a language accessible to non-specialists in the area. A $1$-cycle in a graph is a set $C$ of edges such that every vertex is contained in an even number of edges from $C$. It is easy to check that the sum (modulo $2$) of $1$-cycles is a $1$-cycle. We start from the following problems: to find
  $\bullet$ the number of all $1$-cycles in a given graph;
  $\bullet$ a small number of $1$-cycles in a given graph such that any $1$-cycle is the sum of some of them.
  We consider generalizations (of these problems) to graphs with symmetry, to $2$-cycles in $2$-dimensional hypergraphs, and to certain configuration spaces of graphs (namely, to the square and the deleted square).</description>

      <title>On Vu's theorem in Waring's problem for thinner sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $s\geq k(\log k+3.20032)$. Let $\mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ be the set of $k$-th powers of nonnegative integers. Assume that $\psi$ is an increasing function tending to infinity with $\psi(x)=o(\log x)$ and satifying some regularity conditions. Then, there exists a subsequence $\mathfrak{X}_{k}=\mathfrak{X}_{k}(s)\subset\mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ for which the number of representations $R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k})$ of each $n\in\mathbb{N}$ as $$n=x_{1}^{k}+\ldots+x_{s}^{k}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ x_{i}^{k}\in\mathfrak{X}_{k}$$ satisfies the asymptotic formula $$ R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k})\sim \mathfrak{S}(n)\psi(n)$$ for almost all natural numbers $n$, with $\mathfrak{S}(n)$ being the singular series associated to Waring's problem. If moreover $s\geq k(\log k+4.20032)$ the above conclusion holds for almost all $n\in [X,X+\log X]$ as $X\to\infty$.
  Let $T(k)$ be the least natural number for which it is known that all large integers are the sum of $T(k)$ $k$-th powers of natural numbers. We also show for $k\geq 14$ and every $s\geq T(k)$ the existence of a sequence $\mathfrak{X}_{k}'\subset \mathbb{N}_{0}^{k}$ satisfying $$R_{s}(n;\mathfrak{X}_{k}')\asymp \log n$$ for every sufficiently large $n$. The latter conclusion sharpens a result of Wooley and addresses a question of Vu.</description>

      <title>Partition-theoretic model of prime distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make an application of ideas from partition theory to a problem in multiplicative number theory. We propose a deterministic model of prime number distribution, from first principles related to properties of integer partitions, that predicts the prime number theorem and suggests new conjectures regarding predictable variations in prime gaps. The model posits that, for $n\geq 2$, $$p_{n}\ =\ 1\ +\ 2\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}\left\lceil \frac{d(j)}{2}\right\rceil\ +\ \varepsilon(n),$$
  where $p_k$ is the $k$th prime number, $d(k)$ is the divisor function, and $\varepsilon(k)\geq 0$ is an error that is negligible asymptotically; both the main term and error are enumerative functions in our conceptual model. We refine the error to give numerical estimates of $\pi(n)$ similar to those provided by the logarithmic integral, and much more accurate than $\operatorname{li}(n)$ up to $n=10{,}000$ where the estimate is almost exact. We also test a seemingly dubious prediction suggested by the model, that prime-indexed primes $p_2, p_3, p_5, p_7,$ etc., are more likely to be involved in twin prime pairs than are arbitrary primes; surprisingly, computations show prime-indexed primes are more likely to be twin primes up to at least $n=10{,}000{,}000{,}000$, with the bias diminishing but persistent as $n$ increases.</description>

      <title>Parsings of Stationary Processes, Stopping Times and the Fundamental Pointwise Convergence Theorems of Ergodic Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The idea of a parsing of a stationary process according to a collection of words is introduced, and the basic framework required for the asymptotic analysis of these parsings is presented. We demonstrate how the pointwise ergodic theorem and the Shannon-McMillan-Breiman theorem can be deduced from their respective weaker convergence in probability versions combined with our observations regarding parsings, where the parsings are done according to collections that originate in stopping times tailored for that purpose.</description>

      <title>Khovanskii bases of subalgebras arising from finite distributive lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of Khovanskii bases was introduced by Kaveh and Manon. It is a generalization of the notion of SAGBI bases for a subalgebra of polynomials. The notion of SAGBI bases was introduced by Robbiano and Sweedler as an analogue of Gr\"{o}bner bases in the context of subalgebras. A Hibi ideal is an ideal of a polynomial ring that arises from a distributive lattice. For the development of an analogy of the theory of Hibi ideals and Gr\"{o}bner bases within the framework of subalgebras, in this paper, we investigate when the set of the polynomials associated with a distributive lattice forms a Khovanskii basis of the subalgebras it generates. We characterize such distributive lattices and their underlying posets. In particular, generalized snake posets and $\{(2+2),(1+1+1)\}$-free posets appear as the characterization.</description>

      <title>Monochromatic Subgraphs in Randomly Colored Dense Multiplex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a sequence of graphs $G_n$ and a fixed graph $H$, denote by $T(H, G_n)$ the number of monochromatic copies of the graph $H$ in a uniformly random $c$-coloring of the vertices of $G_n$. In this paper we study the joint distribution of a finite collection of monochromatic graph counts in networks with multiple layers (multiplex networks). Specifically, given a finite collection of graphs $H_1, H_2, \ldots, H_d$ we derive the joint distribution of $(T(H_1, G_n^{(1)}), T(H_2, G_n^{(2)}), \ldots, T(H_d, G_n^{(d)}))$, where $\boldsymbol{G}_n = (G_n^{(1)}, G_n^{(2)}, \ldots, G_n^{(d)})$ is a collection of dense graphs on the same vertex set converging in the joint cut-metric. The limiting distribution is the sum of 2 independent components: a multivariate Gaussian and a sum of independent bivariate stochastic integrals. This extends previous results on the marginal convergence of monochromatic subgraphs in a sequence of graphs to the joint convergence of a finite collection of monochromatic subgraphs in a sequence of multiplex networks. Several applications and examples are discussed.</description>
