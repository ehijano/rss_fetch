      <title>Emergence of universality in transport of noisy free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the effects of various forms of noise on one-dimensional systems of non-interacting fermions. In the strong noise limit, we demonstrate, under mild assumptions, that the statistics of the fermionic correlation matrix in the thermodynamic limit follow a universal form described by the recently introduced quantum simple symmetric exclusion process (Q-SSEP). For charge transport, we show that Q-SSEP, along with all models in its universality class, shares the same large deviation function for the transferred charge as the classical SSEP model. The method we introduce to derive this result relies on a gauge-like invariance associated with the choice of the bond where the current is measured. This approach enables the explicit calculation of the cumulant generating function for both Q-SSEP and SSEP and establishes an exact correspondence between them. These analytical findings are validated by extensive numerical simulations. Our results establish that a wide range of noisy free-fermionic models share the same Q-SSEP universality class and show that their transport properties are essentially classical.</description>

      <title>Universal KPZ Fluctuations for Moderate Deviations of Random Walks in Random Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of diffusion seeks to describe the motion of particles in a chaotic environment. Classical theory models individual particles as independent random walkers, effectively forgetting that particles evolve together in the same environment. Random Walks in a Random Environment (RWRE) models treat the environment as a random space-time field that biases the motion of particles based on where they are in the environment. We provide a universality result for the moderate deviations of the transition probability of this model over a wide class of choices of random environments. In particular, we show the convergence of moments to those of the multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation (SHE), whose logarithm is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. The environment only filters into the scaling limit through one parameter, which depends explicitly on the statistical description of the environment. This forms the basis for our introduction, in arXiv:2406.17733, of the extreme diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <title>Passive objects in a chiral active bath: from micro to macro</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed derivation of the Langevin dynamics obeyed by a massive rigid body immersed in a chiral active bath. We show how the antisymmetric nature of the noise leads to an unusual relationship between the Langevin equation describing stochastic trajectories and the Fokker-Planck equation governing the time-evolution of the probability density. The chirality of the bath endows the object dynamics with odd diffusivity, odd mobility, and rotational ratchet effects that depend on the object symmetries. For rotationally-symmetric objects, we show that a hidden time-reversal symmetry leads to separate effective equilibrium descriptions for the translational and rotational degrees of freedom. Finally, starting from the bath dynamics, we construct a multipole expansion to quadrupolar order that allows predicting the far-field current and density modulation induced by the object on the bath.</description>

      <title>Nonperturbative treatment of a quenched Langevin field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel approach within the functional renormalization group framework for computing critical exponents that characterize the time evolution of out-of-equilibrium many-body systems. Our approach permits access to quantities involved in the renormalization procedure, using an expansion about time-translation invariant problems. This expansion can be upgraded to a fully time-dependent computation by iteration. As a prototypical example, we compute the aging exponent $\theta$ describing the dynamics of model A following a sudden quench to the critical point. Already at leading order, the approach demonstrates remarkable accuracy when compared with MC simulations and resummed perturbative expansions in the range $2&lt;d&lt;4$. This yields results that surpass those of the two-loop $\epsilon$ expansion in accuracy and match analytically known benchmarks at large $N$. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of out-of-equilibrium universality and open new avenues for non-perturbative studies of critical dynamics, as well as for exploring the critical behavior of systems with spatial boundaries.</description>

      <title>Percolation of systems having hyperuniformity or giant number-fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generate point configurations (PCs) by thresholding the local energy of the Ashkin-Teller model in two dimensions (2D) and study the percolation transition at different values of $\lambda$ along the critical Baxter line by varying the threshold that controls the particle density $\rho$. For all values of $\lambda$, the PCs exhibit power-law correlations with a decay exponent $a$ that remains independent of $\rho$ and varies continuously with $\lambda$. For $\lambda &lt; 0$, where the PCs are hyperuniform, the percolation critical behavior is identical to that of ordinary percolation. In contrast, for $\lambda &gt; 0$, the configurations exhibit giant number fluctuations, and all critical exponents vary continuously, but form a superuniversality class of percolation transition in 2D.</description>

      <title>Exact Diagonalization, Matrix Product States and Conformal Perturbation Theory Study of a 3D Ising Fuzzy Sphere Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical studies of phase transitions in statistical and quantum lattice models provide crucial insights into the corresponding Conformal Field Theories (CFTs). In higher dimensions, comparing finite-volume numerical results to infinite-volume CFT data is facilitated by choosing the sphere $S^{d-1}$ as the spatial manifold. Recently, the fuzzy sphere regulator in Ref. [Zhu et al, Phys. Rev. X 13 021009 (2023)] has enabled such studies with exact rotational invariance, yielding impressive agreement with known 3D Ising CFT predictions, as well as new results. However, systematic improvements and a deeper understanding of finite-size corrections remain essential. In this work, we revisit the fuzzy sphere regulator, focusing on the original Ising model, with two main goals. First, we assess the robustness of this approach using Conformal Perturbation Theory (CPT), to which we provide a detailed guidebook. We demonstrate how CPT provides a unified framework for determining the critical point, the speed of light, and residual deviations from CFT predictions. Applying this framework, we study finite-size corrections and clarify the role of tuning the model in minimizing these effects. Second, we develop a novel method for extracting Operator Product Expansion (OPE) coefficients from fuzzy sphere data. This method leverages the sensitivity of energy levels to detuning from criticality, providing new insights into level mixing and avoided crossings in finite systems. Our work also includes validation of CPT in a 1+1D Ising model away from the integrable limit.</description>

      <title>From point patterns to networks: to what extent does the Delaunay triangulation reproduce key spatial and density information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is important that a spatial network's construction algorithm reproduces the structural properties of the original physical embedding. Here, we assess the Delaunay triangulation as a spatial network construction algorithm for seven different types of 2D point patterns, including hyperuniform systems. The latter are characterized by completely suppressed normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations. We demonstrate that the quartile coefficients of dispersion of multiple centrality measures are capable of rank-ordering hyperuniform and nonhyperuniform systems independently, but they cannot distinguish a system that is nearly hyperuniform from hyperuniform systems. Thus, we investigate the local densities of the point pattern and of the network. We reveal that there is a strong correlation between local densities in the point pattern and network in nonhyperuniform systems, but there is no such correlation in hyperuniform systems. When calculating the pair-correlation function and local density covariance function on the point pattern and network, the point pattern and network functions are similar only in nonhyperuniform systems. In hyperuniform systems, the triangulation has a positive covariance of local network densities in pairs of nodes that are close together that is not present in the point patterns. Thus, we demonstrate that the Delaunay triangulation accurately captures the density fluctuations of the point pattern only when the point pattern possesses a positive local density covariance at small distances. Such positive correlation is seen in most real-world systems, so the Delaunay triangulation is generally an effective tool for building a spatial network from a 2D point pattern, but there are situations (i.e., disordered hyperuniform systems) where we caution that the Delaunay triangulation would not be effective at capturing the underlying physical embedding.</description>

      <title>Reputation in public goods cooperation under double Q-learning protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and resolving cooperation dilemmas are key challenges in evolutionary game theory, which have revealed several mechanisms to address them. This paper investigates the comprehensive influence of multiple reputation-related components on public cooperation. In particular, cooperative investments in public goods game are not fixed but simultaneously depend on the reputation of group organizers and the population's cooperation willingness, hence indirectly impacting on the players' income. Additionally, individual payoff can also be directly affected by their reputation via a weighted approach which effectively evaluates the actual income of players. Unlike conventional models, the reputation change of players is non-monotonic, but may transform abruptly due to specific actions. Importantly, a theoretically supported double Q-learning algorithm is introduced to avoid overestimation bias inherent from the classical Q-learning algorithm. Our simulations reveal a significantly improved cooperation level, that is explained by a detailed Q-value analysis. We also observe the lack of massive cooperative clusters in the absence of network reciprocity. At the same time, as an intriguing phenomenon, some actors maintain moderate reputation and are continuously flipping between cooperation and defection. The robustness of our results are validated by mean-field approximation.</description>

      <title>Fractional diffusion without disorder in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyse how simple local constraints in two dimensions lead a defect to exhibit robust, non-transient, and tunable, subdiffusion. We uncover a rich dynamical phenomenology realised in ice- and dimer-type models. On the microscopic scale the path of a single defect exhibits anomalously long retractions, amounting to dynamical caging in a continuous-time random-walk framework, culminating in an effective fractional diffusion equation. Mapping to a height field yields an effective random walk subject to an emergent (entropic) logarithmic potential, whose strength is tunable, related to the exponent of algebraic ground-state correlations. The defect's path, viewed as non-equilibrium growth process, yields a frontier of fractal dimension of $5/4$, the value for a loop-erased random walk, rather than $4/3$ for simple and self-avoiding random walks. Such frustration/constraint-induced subdiffusion is expected to be relevant to platforms such as artificial spin ice and quantum simulators aiming to realize discrete link models and emergent gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Phases of Higher Dimensional Floquet CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical phases of Floquet Conformal Field Theories (CFTs) in space-time dimensions greater than two. Building upon our previous work [1] which introduced quaternionic representations for studying Floquet dynamics in higher-dimensional CFTs, we now explore more general square pulse drive protocols that go beyond a single SU(1,1) subgroup. We demonstrate that, for multi-step drive protocols, the system exhibits distinct dynamical phases characterized by the nature of the eigenvalues of the quaternionic matrix representing time evolution in a single cycle, leading to different stroboscopic responses. Our analysis establishes a fundamental geometric interpretation where these dynamical phases directly correspond to the presence or absence of Killing horizons in the base space of the CFT and in a higher dimensional AdS space on which a putative dual lives. The heating phase is associated with a non-extremal horizon, the critical phase with an extremal horizon which disappears in the non heating phase. We develop perturbative approaches to compute the Floquet Hamiltonians in different regimes and show, how tuning drive parameters can lead to horizons, providing a geometric framework for understanding heating phenomena in driven conformal systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00144v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dynamic concordia discors, a finely tuned equilibrium between opposing forces, is hypothesized to drive historical transformations. Similarly, a precise interplay of excitation and inhibition, the 80:20 ratio, is at the basis of the normal functionality of neural systems. In artificial neural networks, reinforcement learning allows for fine-tuning internal signed connections, optimizing adaptive responses to complex stimuli, and ensuring robust performance. At present, engineered structures of competing components are, however, largely unexplored, particularly because their emergent phases are closely linked with frustration mechanisms in the hosting network. In this context, the spin glass theory has shown how an apparently uncontrollable non-ergodic chaotic behavior arises from the complex interplay of competing interactions and frustration among units, leading to multiple metastable states preventing the system from exploring all accessible configurations over time. Here, we tackle the problem of disentangling topology and dynamics in systems with antagonistic interactions. We make use of the signed Laplacian operator to demonstrate how fundamental topological defects in lattices and networks percolate, shaping the geometrical arena and complex energy landscape of the system. This unveils novel, highly robust multistable phases and establishes deep connections with spin glasses when thermal noise is considered, providing a natural topological and algebraic description of their still-unknown set of pure states at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Deterministic quantum trajectory via imaginary time evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic quantum trajectories, such as pure state evolutions under unitary dynamics and random measurements, offer a crucial ensemble description of many-body open system dynamics. Recent studies have highlighted that individual quantum trajectories also encode essential physical information. Prominent examples include measurement induced phase transitions, where a pure quantum state corresponding to fixed measurement outcomes (trajectories) exhibits distinct entanglement phases, depending on the measurement rate. However, direct observation of this effect is hindered by an exponential post-selection barrier, whereby the probability of realizing a specific trajectory is exponentially small. We propose a deterministic method to efficiently prepare quantum trajectories in polynomial time using imaginary time evolution and, thus, overcome this fundamental challenge. We demonstrate that our method applies to a certain class of quantum states, and argue that there does not exist universal approaches for any quantum trajectories. Our result paves the way for experimentally exploring the physics of individual quantum trajectories at scale and enables direct observation of certain post-selection-dependent phenomena.</description>

      <title>A Clue on Small-Capacitance Josephson Junction: What to Expect from Cooper Pair Ideal Conductor and Ohmic Resistor in Parallel?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using analytical and Worldline Monte Carlo approaches, we investigate the effects induced by quantum phase fluctuations combined with quasiparticle subgap and shunt resistances on a small-capacitance Josephson junction. By using the linear response theory in the presence of two biasing schemes, we prove that the ideal conduction, foreseen in the pioneering papers on this topic, is not robust against either quantum phase fluctuations or dissipative effects. By including both of them in the Hamiltonian, we prove that an increase of the Ohmic dissipation strength induces a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless quantum phase transition in thermodynamic equilibrium. Then we study charge and phase fluctuations at the thermodynamic equilibrium within the linear response theory. We find that the phase particle motion, in a quantum Josephson junction, does not change from diffusive to localized, resulting in an insulator-superconductor transition, as is commonly believed. At the transition, we prove that: i) the motion of the phase particle changes from ballistic to localized; ii) by turning on the coupling with the environment, a long-lived excitation at finite frequency emerges in the charge response function: it evolves first into a resonance and then disappears at the transition. Consequences beyond the linear response regime are investigated, leading to an alternative comprehensive physical picture for this system: we predict a transition from a dissipative quasiparticle current to a polaronic Cooper pair current.</description>

      <title>Extremal monomial property of q-characters and polynomiality of the X-series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The character of every irreducible finite-dimensional representation of a simple Lie algebra has the highest weight property. The invariance of the character under the action of the Weyl group W implies that there is a similar "extremal weight property" for every weight obtained by applying an element of W to the highest weight. In this paper we conjecture an analogous "extremal monomial property" of the q-characters of simple finite-dimensional modules over the quantum affine algebras, using the braid group action on q-characters defined by Chari. In the case of the identity element of W, this is the highest monomial property of q-characters proved in arXiv:math/9911112. Here we prove it for simple reflections. Somewhat surprisingly, the extremal monomial property for each w in W turns out to be equivalent to polynomiality of the "X-series" corresponding to w, which we introduce in this paper. We show that these X-series are equal to certain limits of the generalized Baxter operators for all w in W. Thus, we find a new bridge between q-characters and the spectra of XXZ-type quantum integrable models associated to quantum affine algebras. This leads us to conjecture polynomiality of all generalized Baxter operators, extending the results of arXiv:1308.3444.</description>

      <title>Observation of Quantum Darwinism and the Origin of Classicality with Superconducting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transition from quantum to classical behavior is a central question in modern physics. How can we rationalize everyday classical observations from an inherently quantum world? For instance, what makes two people, each absorbing an independent fraction of photons scattered from this screen or paper, agree on the observation of the text written here? Quantum Darwinism offers a compelling framework to explain this emergence of classicality by proposing that the environment redundantly encodes information about a quantum system, leading to the objective reality we perceive. Here, by leveraging cutting-edge superconducting quantum circuits, we observe the highly structured branching quantum states that support classicality and the saturation of quantum mutual information, establishing a robust verification of the foundational framework of quantum Darwinism and the accompanying underlying geometric structure of quantum states. Additionally, we propose a particular class of observables that can be used as a separate quantifier for classicality, originating a computationally and experimentally inexpensive method to probe quantum-to-classical transitions. Our investigation delves into how the quantum effects are inaccessible to observers, allowing only classical properties to be detected. It experimentally demonstrates the physical framework through which everyday classical observations emerge from underlying quantum principles and paves the way to settling the measurement problem.</description>

      <title>Spectral Architecture Search for Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Architecture design and optimization are challenging problems in the field of artificial neural networks. Working in this context, we here present SPARCS (SPectral ARchiteCture Search), a novel architecture search protocol which exploits the spectral attributes of the inter-layer transfer matrices. SPARCS allows one to explore the space of possible architectures by spanning continuous and differentiable manifolds, thus enabling for gradient-based optimization algorithms to be eventually employed. With reference to simple benchmark models, we show that the newly proposed method yields a self-emerging architecture with a minimal degree of expressivity to handle the task under investigation and with a reduced parameter count as compared to other viable alternatives.</description>

      <title>Measurement Induced Dynamics and Trace Preserving Replica Cutoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general methodology for addressing the infinite hierarchy problem that arises in measurement-induced dynamics of replicated quantum systems. Our approach introduces trace-preserving replica cutoffs using tomographic-like techniques to estimate higher-order replica states from lower ones, ensuring that partial trace reduction properties are rigorously maintained. This guarantees that the dynamics of single-replica systems correctly reduce to standard Lindblad evolution. By systematically mapping information between replica spaces of different orders, we characterise null spaces under partial trace operations and outline efficient algorithmic approaches to enforce positivity. Importantly, it is demonstrated that pre-calculated stochastic Gaussian ensembles of free fermion states provide an effective and computationally efficient means to stabilise the replica hierarchy, even in the presence of interactions. Numerical tests on small interacting fermionic systems illustrate the effectiveness and practicality of our approach, showing precise agreement with trajectory methods while providing significantly better statistical convergence.</description>

      <title>Cellular automata in $d$ dimensions and ground states of spin models in $(d+1)$ dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08059v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show how the trajectories of $d$-dimensional cellular automata (CA) can be used to determine the ground states of $(d+1)$-dimensional classical spin models, and we characterise their quantum phase transition, when in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. For each of the 256 one-dimensional elementary CA we explicitly construct the simplest local two-dimensional classical spin model associated to the given CA, and we also describe this method for $d&gt;1$ through selected examples. We illustrate our general observations with detailed studies of: (i) the $d=1$ CA Rule 150 and its $d=2$ four-body plaquette spin model, (ii) the $d=2$ CA whose associated model is the $d=3$ square-pyramid plaquette model, and (iii) two counter-propagating $d=1$ Rule 60 CA that correspond to the two-dimensional Baxter-Wu spin model. For the quantum spin models, we show that the connection to CAs implies a sensitivity on the approach to the thermodynamic limit via finite size scaling for their quantum phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions in $q$-state clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17507v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $q-$state clock model, sometimes called the discrete $XY$ model, is known to show a second-order (symmetry breaking) phase transition in two-dimension (2D) for $q\le 4$ ($q=2$ corresponds to the Ising model). On the other hand, the $q\to\infty$ limit of the model corresponds to the $XY$ model, which shows the infinite order (non-symmetry breaking) Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) phase transition in 2D. Interestingly, the 2D clock model with $q\ge 5$ is predicted to show three different phases and two associated phase transitions. There are varying opinions about the actual characters of phases and the associated transitions. In this work, we develop the basic and higher-order mean-field (MF) theories to study the $q$-state clock model systematically. Our MF calculations reaffirm that, for large $q$, there are three phases: (broken) $\mathbb{Z}_q$ symmetric ferromagnetic phase at the low temperature, emergent $U(1)$ symmetric BKT phase at the intermediate temperature, and paramagnetic (disordered) phase at the high temperature. The phase transition at the higher temperature is found to be of the BKT type, and the other transition at the lower temperature is argued to be a large-order spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) type (the largeness of transition order yields the possibility of having some of the numerical characteristics of a BKT transition). The higher-order MF theory developed here better characterizes phases by estimating the spin-spin correlation between two neighbors.</description>

      <title>The quantum Newman-Moore model in a longitudinal field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the quantum Newman-Moore model, or quantum triangular plaquette model (qTPM), in the presence of a longitudinal field (qTPMz). We present evidence that indicates that the ground state phase diagram of the qTPMz includes various frustrated phases breaking translational symmetries, dependent on the specific sequence of system sizes used to take the large-size limit. This phase diagram includes the known first-order phase transition of the qTPM, but also additional first-order transitions due to the frustrated phases. Using the average longitudinal magnetization as an order parameter, we analyze the magnetization plateaus that characterize the ground state phases, describe their degeneracies, and obtain the qTPMz phase diagram using classical transfer matrix and quantum matrix product state techniques. We identify a region of parameter space which can be effectively described by a Rydberg blockade model on the triangular lattice and also find indications of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order connecting the quantum paramagnetic and classical frustrated phases.</description>

      <title>Solving the Kinetic Ising Model with Non-Reciprocity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23615v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are a generic feature of non-equilibrium systems. We define a non-reciprocal generalization of the kinetic Ising model in one spatial dimension. We solve the model exactly using two different approaches for infinite, semi-infinite and finite systems with either periodic or open boundary conditions. The exact solution allows us to explore a range of novel phenomena tied to non-reciprocity like non-reciprocity induced frustration and wave phenomena with interesting parity-dependence for finite systems of size $N$.
  We study dynamical questions like the approach to equilibrium with various boundary conditions. We find new regimes, separated by $N^{th}$-order exceptional points, which can be classified as overdamped, underdamped and critically damped phases. Despite these new regimes, long-time order is only present at zero temperature. Additionally, we explore the low-energy behavior of the system in various limits, including the ageing and spatio-temporal Porod regimes, demonstrating that non-reciprocity induces unique scaling behavior at zero temperature. Lastly, we present general results for systems where spins interact with no more than two spins, outlining the conditions under which long-time order may exist.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior and phases of nonlinear sigma model on real Stiefel manifolds near two dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a quasi-two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model on the real Stiefel manifolds with a generalized (anisotropic) metric, the equations of a two-charge renormalization group (RG) for the homothety and anisotropy of the metric as effective couplings are obtained in a one-loop approximation. Normal coordinates and the curvature tensor are exploited for the renormalization of the metric. The RG trajectories are investigated and the presence of a fixed point common to four critical lines or four phases (tetracritical point) in the general case, or its absence in the case of an Abelian structure group, is established. For the tetracritical point, the critical exponents are evaluated and compared with those known earlier for a simpler particular case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20689v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When submerged in a chiral active bath, a passive object becomes a spinning ratchet imbued with odd transport properties. We present the most general Langevin dynamics for a rigid body in a chiral active bath, in the adiabatic limit of large object mass. For rotationally symmetric objects, odd diffusion and odd mobility are connected by an Einstein relation, that we show numerically to break down outside the adiabatic limit. As the object symmetry decreases, its dynamics becomes increasingly irreversible: a massive disk exhibits an effective equilibrium dynamics, while a rod admits distinct translational and rotational temperatures, and a wedge is fully irreversible.Conversely, this departure from equilibrium can be read in universal far-field currents and density modulations of the bath, which we measure numerically and derive analytically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the study of 1D elementary cellular automata (CA) to the nonlinear rules, following our study of the linear rules in Ref.[arXiv:2309.08059]. We thus construct the respective classical spin models and obtain their zero temperature ground states. We argue that these models are examples of frustrated systems where their ground state space can be exactly and systematically calculated. By including quantum fluctuations through the addition of a transverse field, we study their ground state quantum phases and phase transitions. We use rules 30, 54 and 201 as a probe of our two main results: (a) for small transverse fields we identify an order-by-disorder mechanism which stabilizes the classical phase, and (ii) we observe a first-order quantum phase transition between the classical and quantum paramagnetic phases when the transverse field strength equals the classical coupling strength, as for the linear rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It's been argued that a finite effective temperature emerges and characterizes the thermal property of double-scaled SYK model in the infinite temperature limit \cite{Lin:2022nss}. Meanwhile, in the static patch of de Sitter, the maximally entangled state satisfies a KMS condition at infinite temperature \cite{Witten:2023xze}, suggesting the Type II$_1$ nature of the observable algebra gravitationally dressed to the observer. In this work, we analyze the double-scaled algebra generated by chord operators in the double-scaled SYK model and demonstrate that it exhibits features reflecting both perspectives. Specifically, we prove that the algebra is a Type II$_1$ factor, and that the empty state with no chord satisfies the tracial property, in agreement with expectations from \cite{Lin:2022rbf}. We further show that this state is cyclic and separating for the double-scaled algebra, based on which we explore its modular structure. We then explore various physical limits of the theory, drawing connections to JT gravity, the Hilbert space of baby universes, and Brownian double-scaled SYK. We also present analytic solutions to the energy spectrum in both the zero- and one-particle sectors of the left/right chord Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Thermal disorder and phonon softening in the ferroelectric phase transition of lead titanate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06414v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a molecular dynamics study of ab initio quality of the ferroelectric phase transition in crystalline PbTiO3. We model anharmonicity accurately in terms of potential energy and polarization surfaces trained on density functional theory data with modern machine learning techniques. Our simulations demonstrate that the transition has a strong order-disorder character, in agreement with diffraction experiments, and provide fresh insight into the approach to equilibrium across the phase transition. We find that the emergence and disappearance of the macroscopic polarization is driven by dipolar switching at the nanometer scale. We also computed the infrared optical absorption spectra in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases, finding good agreement with the experimental Raman frequencies. Often, the almost ideal displacive character of the soft mode detected by Raman scattering in the paraelectric phase has been contrasted with the order-disorder character of the transition suggested by diffraction experiments. We settle this issue by showing that the soft mode coexists with a strong Debye relaxation associated with thermal disordering of the dipoles. The Debye relaxation feature is centered at zero frequency and appears near the transition temperature in both the ferroelectric and the paraelectric phases.</description>

      <title>Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11635v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.</description>

Abstract: We study the operator product expansion (OPE) of identical scalars in a conformal four-point correlator as a Stieltjes moment problem, and use Riemann-Liouville type fractional differential operators to transform the correlation function into a classical moment-generating function. We use crossing symmetry to derive leading and subleading relations between moments in $\Delta$ and $J_2 = \ell(\ell+d-2)$ in the ``heavy" limit of large external scaling dimension, and combine them with constraints from unitarity to derive two-sided bounds on moment sequences in $\Delta$ and the covariance between $\Delta$ and $J_2$. The moment sequences which saturate these bounds produce ``saddle point" solutions to the crossing equations which we identify as particular limits of correlators in a generalized free field (GFF) theory. This motivates us to study perturbations of heavy GFF four-point correlators by way of saddle point analysis, and we show that saddles in the OPE arise from contributions of fixed-length operator families encoded by a decomposition into deformed higher-spin conformal blocks. To apply our techniques, we consider holographic correlators of four identical single scalar fields perturbed by a bulk interaction, and use their first few moments to derive Gaussian weight-interpolating functions that predict the OPE coefficients of interacting double-twist operators in the heavy limit. We further compute tree-level perturbations on saddles in 1/2 BPS Wilson line defect correlators in planar $\mathcal{N} = 4$ SYM, making predictions about deformations of families of long operators.</description>

      <title>Optimal generalisation and learning transition in extensive-width shallow neural networks near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a teacher-student model of supervised learning with a fully-trained two-layer neural network whose width $k$ and input dimension $d$ are large and proportional. We provide an effective theory for approximating the Bayes-optimal generalisation error of the network for any activation function in the regime of sample size $n$ scaling quadratically with the input dimension, i.e., around the interpolation threshold where the number of trainable parameters $kd+k$ and of data $n$ are comparable. Our analysis tackles generic weight distributions. We uncover a discontinuous phase transition separating a "universal" phase from a "specialisation" phase. In the first, the generalisation error is independent of the weight distribution and decays slowly with the sampling rate $n/d^2$, with the student learning only some non-linear combinations of the teacher weights. In the latter, the error is weight distribution-dependent and decays faster due to the alignment of the student towards the teacher network. We thus unveil the existence of a highly predictive solution near interpolation, which is however potentially hard to find by practical algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Julia package FuzzifiED aims at simplifying the numerical calculations on the fuzzy sphere. It supports exact diagonalisation (ED) and density matrix renormalisation group (DMRG) calculations. FuzzifiED can also apply to generic fermionic and bosonic models. This documentation provides a review of the fuzzy sphere regularisation and an instruction for using FuzzifiED for numerical calculations.</description>

      <title>Viscosity of polymer melts using non-affine theory based on vibrational modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02806v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Viscosity, a fundamental transport and rheological property of liquids, quantifies the resistance to relative motion between molecular layers and plays a critical role in understanding material behavior. Conventional methods, such as the Green-Kubo (GK) approach, rely on time integration of correlation functions, which becomes computationally intensive near the glass transition due to slow correlation decay. A recently proposed method based on non-affine lattice dynamics (NALD) and instantaneous normal mode analysis offers a promising alternative for estimating the viscosity. In this study, we apply the NALD approach to compute the viscosity of the Kremer-Grest polymer system over a range of temperatures and compare these results with those from the GK method and non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our findings reveal that all vibration modes, including the instantaneous normal modes, contribute to the viscosity. This work presents an efficient framework for calculating viscosity across diverse systems, including near the glass transition where the GK method is no longer applicable. Also, it opens the avenue to understanding the role of different vibrational modes linked with structure, facilitating the design of materials with tunable rheological properties.</description>

      <title>No-go theorem for environment-assisted invariance in non-unitary dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10400v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the requirements for quantum operations that achieve environment-assisted invariance (envariance), a symmetry of entanglement. While envariance has traditionally been studied within the framework of local unitary operations, we extend the analysis to consider non-unitary local operations. First, we investigate the conditions imposed on operators acting on pure bipartite entanglement to attain envariance. We show that the local operations must take a direct-sum form in their Kraus operator representations, establishing decoherence-free subspaces. Furthermore, we prove that this also holds for the multipartite scenario. As an immediate consequence, we demonstrate that environment-assisted shortcuts to adiabaticity cannot be achieved through non-unitary operations. In addition, we show that the static condition of the eternal black hole in AdS/CFT is violated when the CFTs are coupled to the external baths.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for investigating the role of stiffness heterogeneity in structure and dynamics of flexible polymer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heteropolymers are ubiquitous in both synthetic systems, such as block copolymers, and biological macromolecules, including proteins and nucleic acids. Beyond their chemical composition, these polymers often exhibit spatial variations in physical properties. For instance, in biopolymers such as chromatin, stiffness heterogeneity arises from inherent molecular features as well as extensile or contractile active forces. In this letter, we develop a theoretical framework that extends the physics of flexible polymers, a widely used tool to describe biopolymer dynamics, to incorporate spatially varying stiffness. Using this approach, we specifically analyze the structure and dynamics of flexible heteropolymers with periodic stepwise stiffness profiles. We find that stiffness heterogeneity leads to qualitative deviations in dynamical observables such as mean squared displacement while also increasing structural anisotropy. Altogether, this framework provides a platform to interpret stiffness heterogeneity from experimental data especially for biopolymers as well as to design heteropolymers with tailored structural and dynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Prethermalization by Random Multipolar Driving on a 78-Qubit Superconducting Processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time-dependent drives hold the promise of realizing non-equilibrium many-body phenomena that are absent in undriven systems. Yet, drive-induced heating normally destabilizes the systems, which can be parametrically suppressed in the high-frequency regime by using periodic (Floquet) drives. It remains largely unknown to what extent highly controllable quantum simulators can suppress heating in non-periodically driven systems. Using the 78-qubit superconducting quantum processor, Chuang-tzu 2.0, we report the experimental observation of long-lived prethermal phases in many-body systems with tunable heating rates, driven by structured random protocols, characterized by $n$-multipolar temporal correlations. By measuring both the particle imbalance and subsystem entanglement entropy, we monitor the entire heating process over 1,000 driving cycles and observe the existence of the prethermal plateau. The prethermal lifetime is `doubly tunable': one way by driving frequency, the other by multipolar order; it grows algebraically with the frequency with the universal scaling exponent $2n{+}1$. Using quantum state tomography on different subsystems, we demonstrate a non-uniform spatial entanglement distribution and observe a crossover from area-law to volume-law entanglement scaling. With 78 qubits and 137 couplers in a 2D configuration, the entire far-from-equilibrium heating dynamics are beyond the reach of simulation using tensor-network numerical techniques. Our work highlights superconducting quantum processors as a powerful platform for exploring universal scaling laws and non-equilibrium phases of matter in driven systems in regimes where classical simulation faces formidable challenges.</description>

      <title>Penetration of surface effects on structural relaxation and particle hops in glassy films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.</description>
