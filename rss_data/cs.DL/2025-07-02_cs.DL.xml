      <title>The hunt for research data: Development of an open-source workflow for tracking institutionally-affiliated research data publications</title>

Abstract: The ability to find data is central to the FAIR principles underlying research data stewardship. As with the ability to reuse data, efforts to ensure and enhance findability have historically focused on discoverability of data by other researchers, but there is a growing recognition of the importance of stewarding data in a fashion that makes them FAIR for a wide range of potential reusers and stakeholders. Research institutions are one such stakeholder and have a range of motivations for discovering data, specifically those affiliated with a focal institution, from facilitating compliance with funder provisions to gathering data to inform research data services. However, many research datasets and repositories are not optimized for institutional discovery (e.g., not recording or standardizing affiliation metadata), which creates downstream obstacles to workflows designed for theoretically comprehensive discovery and to metadata-conscious data generators. Here I describe an open-source workflow for institutional tracking of research datasets at the University of Texas at Austin. This workflow comprises a multi-faceted approach that utilizes multiple open application programming interfaces (APIs) in order to address some of the common challenges to institutional discovery, such as variation in whether affiliation metadata are recorded or made public, and if so, how metadata are standardized, structured, and recorded. It is presently able to retrieve more than 4,000 affiliated datasets across nearly 70 distinct platforms, including objects without DOIs and objects without affiliation metadata. However, there remain major gaps that stem from suboptimal practices of both researchers and data repositories, many of which were identified in previous studies and which persist despite significant investment in efforts to standardize and elevate the quality of datasets and their metadata.</description>

      <title>A bibliometric analysis on the current situation and hot trends of the impact of microplastics on soil based on CiteSpace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to comprehensively grasp the research status and development trends of soil microplastics (MPs). It collects studies from the Web of Science Core Collection covering the period from 2013 to 2024. Employing CiteSpace and VOSviewer, the paper conducts in - depth analyses of literature regarding the environmental impacts of microplastics. These analyses involve keyword co - occurrence, clustering, burst term identification, as well as co - occurrence analysis of authors and institutions. Microplastics can accumulate in soil, transfer through food chains, and ultimately affect human health, making the research on them essential for effective pollution control. Focusing on the international research on the impacts of microplastics on soil and ecosystems, the study reveals a steadily increasing trend in the number of publications each year, reaching a peak of 956 articles in 2024. A small number of highly productive authors contribute significantly to the overall research output. The keyword clustering analysis results in ten major clusters, including topics such as plastic pollution and microbial communities. The research on soil microplastics has evolved through three distinct stages: the preliminary exploration phase from 2013 to 2016, the expansion phase from 2017 to 2020, and the integration phase from 2021 to 2024. For future research, multi - level assessments of the impacts of microplastics on soil ecosystems and organisms should be emphasized, in order to fully uncover the associated hazards and develop practical solutions.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Cartography of the Epistemic Diffusion of Artificial Intelligence in Neuroscience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuroscience and AI have an intertwined history, largely relayed in the literature of both fields. In recent years, due to the engineering orientations of AI research and the monopoly of industry for its large-scale applications, the mutual expansion of neuroscience and AI in fundamental research seems challenged. In this paper, we bring some empirical evidences that, on the contrary, AI and neuroscience are continuing to grow together, but with a pronounced interest in the fields of study related to neurodegenerative diseases since the 1990s. With a temporal knowledge cartography of neuroscience drawn with advanced document embedding techniques, we draw the dynamical shaping of the discipline since the 1970s and identified the conceptual articulation of AI with this particular subfield mentioned before. However, a further analysis of the underlying citation network of the studied corpus shows that the produced AI technologies remain confined in the different subfields and are not transferred from one subfield to another. This invites us to discuss the genericity capability of AI in the context of an intradisciplinary development, especially in the diffusion of its associated metrology.</description>

      <title>Tenure and Research Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</description>
