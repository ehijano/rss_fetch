      <title>Classifying covering types in homotopy type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covering spaces are a fundamental tool in algebraic topology because of the close relationship they bear with the fundamental groups of spaces. Indeed, they are in correspondence with the subgroups of the fundamental group: this is known as the Galois correspondence. In particular, the covering space corresponding to the trivial group is the universal covering, which is a "1-connected" variant of the original space, in the sense that it has the same homotopy groups, except for the first one which is trivial. In this article, we formalize this correspondence in homotopy type theory, a variant of Martin-L\"of type theory in which types can be interpreted as spaces (up to homotopy). Along the way, we develop an n-dimensional generalization of covering spaces. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we formally classify the covering of lens spaces and explain how to construct the Poincar\'e homology sphere.</description>

      <title>Translating Informal Proofs into Formal Proofs Using a Chain of States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the problem of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4 under a constrained computational budget. Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates.</description>

      <title>Learning to Split: A Reinforcement-Learning-Guided Splitting Heuristic for Neural Network Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art neural network verifiers operate by encoding neural
  network verification as constraint satisfaction problems. When
  dealing with standard piecewise-linear activation functions, such as
  ReLUs, verifiers typically employ branching heuristics that break a
  complex constraint satisfaction problem into multiple, simpler
  problems. The verifier's performance depends heavily on the order in
  which this branching is performed: a poor selection may give rise to
  exponentially many sub-problem, hampering scalability. Here, we
  focus on the setting where multiple verification queries must be
  solved for the same neural network. The core idea is to use past
  experience to make good branching decisions, expediting
  verification. We present a reinforcement-learning-based branching
  heuristic that achieves this, by applying a learning from
  demonstrations (DQfD) techniques. Our experimental
  evaluation demonstrates a substantial reduction in average
  verification time and in the average number of iterations required,
  compared to modern splitting heuristics. These results highlight
  the great potential of reinforcement learning in the context of
  neural network verification.</description>

      <title>Lax Modal Lambda Calculi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intuitionistic modal logics (IMLs) extend intuitionistic propositional logic with modalities such as the box and diamond connectives. Advances in the study of IMLs have inspired several applications in programming languages via the development of corresponding type theories with modalities. Until recently, IMLs with diamonds have been misunderstood as somewhat peculiar and unstable, causing the development of type theories with diamonds to lag behind type theories with boxes. In this article, we develop a family of typed-lambda calculi corresponding to sublogics of a peculiar IML with diamonds known as Lax logic. These calculi provide a modal logical foundation for various strong functors in typed-functional programming. We present possible-world and categorical semantics for these calculi and constructively prove normalization, equational completeness and proof-theoretic inadmissibility results. Our main results have been formalized using the proof assistant Agda.</description>

      <title>Intrinsically Correct Algorithms and Recursive Coalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recursive coalgebras provide an elegant categorical tool for modelling recursive algorithms and analysing their termination and correctness. By considering coalgebras over categories of suitably indexed families, the correctness of the corresponding algorithms follows intrinsically just from the type of the computed maps. However, proving recursivity of the underlying coalgebras is non-trivial, and proofs are typically ad hoc. This layer of complexity impedes the formalization of coalgebraically defined recursive algorithms in proof assistants. We introduce a framework for constructing coalgebras which are intrinsically recursive in the sense that the type of the coalgebra guarantees recursivity from the outset. Our approach is based on the novel concept of a well-founded functor on a category of families indexed by a well-founded relation. We show as our main result that every coalgebra for a well-founded functor is recursive, and demonstrate that well-known techniques for proving recursivity and termination such as ranking functions are subsumed by this abstract setup. We present a number of case studies, including Quicksort, the Euclidian algorithm, and CYK parsing. Both the main theoretical result and selected case studies have been formalized in Cubical Agda.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03955v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a generic computational model that can be used effectively for establishing the existence of winning strategies for concrete finite combinatorial games. Our modelling is (equational) logic-based involving advanced techniques from algebraic specification, and it can be executed by equational programming systems such as those from the OBJ-family. We show how this provides a form of experimental mathematics for strategy problems involving combinatorial games. We do this by defining general methods and by illustrating these with case studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14563v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider event structures and their probabilistic and quantum extensions as originally defined by Winskel. If these structures have already been part of sophisticated computational models, they have rarely been directly studied as an immediate model of execution traces of programs. This paper offers such an analysis. We propose a simple imperative operational framework and show how to derive soundness and adequacy results with event structures considered as a semantics. We show how event structures naturally handle non-deterministic, probabilistic and quantum effects.</description>

      <title>From Innermost to Full Probabilistic Term Rewriting: Almost-Sure Termination, Complexity, and Modularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17714v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are many evaluation strategies for term rewrite systems, but automatically proving termination or analyzing complexity is usually easiest for innermost rewriting. Several syntactic criteria exist when innermost termination implies (full) termination or when runtime complexity and innermost runtime complexity coincide. We adapt these criteria to the probabilistic setting, e.g., we show when it suffices to analyze almost-sure termination w.r.t. innermost rewriting in order to prove (full) almost-sure termination of probabilistic term rewrite systems. These criteria can be applied for both termination and complexity analysis in the probabilistic setting. We implemented and evaluated our new contributions in the tool AProVE. Moreover, we also use our new results to investigate the modularity of probabilistic termination properties.</description>

      <title>The Yoneda embedding in simplicial type theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13229v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Riehl and Shulman introduced simplicial type theory (STT), a variant of homotopy type theory which aimed to study not just homotopy theory, but its fusion with category theory: $(\infty,1)$-category theory. While notoriously technical, manipulating $\infty$-categories in simplicial type theory is often easier than working with ordinary categories, with the type theory handling infinite stacks of coherences in the background. We capitalize on recent work by Gratzer et al. defining the $(\infty,1)$-category of $\infty$-groupoids in STT to define presheaf categories within STT and systematically develop their theory. In particular, we construct the Yoneda embedding, prove the universal property of presheaf categories, refine the theory of adjunctions in STT, introduce the theory of Kan extensions, and prove Quillen's Theorem A.</description>

      <title>Formula size game and model checking for modal substitution calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent research has applied modal substitution calculus (MSC) and its variants to characterize various computational frameworks such as graph neural networks (GNNs) and distributed computing systems. For example, it has been shown that the expressive power of recurrent graph neural networks coincides with graded modal substitution calculus GMSC, which is the extension of MSC with counting modalities. GMSC can be further extended with the counting global modality, resulting in the logic GGMSC which corresponds to GNNs with global readout mechanisms. In this paper we introduce a formula-size game that characterizes the expressive power of MSC, GMSC, GGMSC, and related logics. Furthermore, we study the expressiveness and model checking of logics in this family. We prove that MSC and its extensions (GMSC, GGMSC) are as expressive as linear tape-bounded Turing machines, while asynchronous variants are linked to modal mu-calculus and modal computation logic MCL. We establish that for MSC, GMSC and GGMSC, both combined and data complexity of model checking are PSPACE-complete, and for their asynchronous variants, both complexities are PTIME-complete. We also establish that for the propositional fragment SC of MSC, the combined complexity of model checking is PSPACE-complete, while for asynchronous SC it is PTIME-complete, and in both cases, data complexity is constant. As a corollary, we observe that SC satisfiability is PSPACE-complete and NP-complete for its asynchronous variant. Finally, we construct a universal reduction from all recursively enumerable problems to MSC model checking.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.19424v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial Markov categories are a recent framework for categorical probability theory that provide an abstract account of partial probabilistic computation with updating semantics. In this article, we discuss two order relations on the morphisms of a partial Markov category. In particular, we prove that every partial Markov category is canonically preorder-enriched, recovering several well-known order enrichments. We also demonstrate that the existence of codiagonal maps (comparators) is closely related to order properties of partial Markov categories. Finally, we introduce a synthetic version of the Cauchy--Schwarz inequality and, from it, we prove that updating increases validity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.16852v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the confluence property of abstract rewriting systems internal to cubical categories. We introduce cubical contractions, a higher-dimensional generalisation of reductions to normal forms, and employ them to construct cubical polygraphic resolutions of convergent rewriting systems. Within this categorical framework, we establish cubical proofs of fundamental rewriting results -- Newman's lemma, the Church-Rosser theorem, and Squier's coherence theorem -- via the pasting of cubical coherence cells. We moreover derive, in purely categorical terms, the cube law known from the $\lambda$-calculus and Garside theory. As a consequence, we show that every convergent abstract rewriting system freely generates an acyclic cubical groupoid, in which higher-dimensional generators can be replaced by degenerate cells beyond dimension two.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning for Quantifier Selection in cvc5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14338v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we considerably improve the state-of-the-art SMT solving on first-order quantified problems by efficient machine learning guidance of quantifier selection. Quantifiers represent a significant challenge for SMT and are technically a source of undecidability. In our approach, we train an efficient machine learning model that informs the solver which quantifiers should be instantiated and which not. Each quantifier may be instantiated multiple times and the set of the active quantifiers changes as the solving progresses. Therefore, we invoke the ML predictor many times, during the whole run of the solver. To make this efficient, we use fast ML models based on gradient boosting decision trees. We integrate our approach into the state-of-the-art cvc5 SMT solver and show a considerable increase of the system's holdout-set performance after training it on a large set of first-order problems collected from the Mizar Mathematical Library.</description>

      <title>The biequivalence of path categories and axiomatic Martin-L\"of type theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The semantics of extensional type theory has an elegant categorical description: models of extensional =-types, 1-types, and Sigma-types are biequivalent to finitely complete categories, while adding Pi-types yields locally Cartesian closed categories. We establish parallel results for axiomatic type theory, which includes systems like cubical type theory, where the computation rule of the =-types only holds as a propositional axiom instead of a definitional reduction. In particular, we prove that models of axiomatic =-types, and standard 1- and Sigma-types are biequivalent to certain path categories, while adding axiomatic Pi-types yields dependent homotopy exponents.
  This biequivalence simplifies axiomatic =-types, which are more intricate than extensional ones since they permit higher dimensional structure. Specifically, path categories use a primitive notion of equivalence instead of a direct reproduction of the syntactic elimination rules and computation axioms. We apply our correspondence to prove a coherence theorem: we show that these weak homotopical models can be turned into equivalent strict models of axiomatic type theory. In addition, we introduce a more modular notion, that of a display map path category, which only models axiomatic =-types by default, while leaving room to add other axiomatic type formers such as 1-, Sigma-, and Pi-types.</description>

      <title>Scaling Neuro-symbolic Problem Solving: Solver-Free Learning of Constraints and Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20978v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets, there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.</description>
