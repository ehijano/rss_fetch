      <title>Concatenated Matrix SVD: Compression Bounds, Incremental Approximation, and Error-Constrained Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large collections of matrices arise throughout modern machine learning, signal processing, and scientific computing, where they are commonly compressed by concatenation followed by truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). This strategy enables parameter sharing and efficient reconstruction and has been widely adopted across domains ranging from multi-view learning and signal processing to neural network compression. However, it leaves a fundamental question unanswered: which matrices can be safely concatenated and compressed together under explicit reconstruction error constraints? Existing approaches rely on heuristic or architecture-specific grouping and provide no principled guarantees on the resulting SVD approximation error. In the present work, we introduce a theory-driven framework for compression-aware clustering of matrices under SVD compression constraints. Our analysis establishes new spectral bounds for horizontally concatenated matrices, deriving global upper bounds on the optimal rank-$r$ SVD reconstruction error from lower bounds on singular value growth. The first bound follows from Weyl-type monotonicity under blockwise extensions, while the second leverages singular values of incremental residuals to yield tighter, per-block guarantees. We further develop an efficient approximate estimator based on incremental truncated SVD that tracks dominant singular values without forming the full concatenated matrix. Therefore, we propose three clustering algorithms that merge matrices only when their predicted joint SVD compression error remains below a user-specified threshold. The algorithms span a trade-off between speed, provable accuracy, and scalability, enabling compression-aware clustering with explicit error control. Code is available online.</description>

      <title>Dirichlet Extremals for Discrete Plateau Problems in GT-Bezier Spaces via PSO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a discrete analogue of the parametric Plateau problem in a non-polynomial tensor-product surface spaces generated by the generalized trigonometric (GT)--B\'ezier basis. Boundary interpolation is imposed by prescribing the boundary rows and columns of the control net, while the interior control points are selected by a Dirichlet principle: for each admissible choice of B\'ezier basis shape parameters, we compute the unique Dirichlet-energy extremal within the corresponding GT--B\'ezier patch space, which yields a parameter-dependent symmetric linear system for the interior control net under standard nondegeneracy assumptions. The remaining design freedom is thereby reduced to a four-parameter optimization problem, which we solve by particle swarm optimization. Numerical experiments show that the resulting two-level procedure consistently decreases the Dirichlet energy and, in our tests, often reduces the realized surface area relative to classical Bernstein--B\'ezier Dirichlet patches and representative quasi-harmonic and bending-energy constructions under identical boundary control data. We further adapt the same Dirichlet-extremal methodology to a hybrid tensor-product/bilinear Coons framework, obtaining minimality-biased TB--Coons patches from sparse boundary specifications.</description>

      <title>Solving High-Dimensional PDEs Using Linearized Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearized shallow neural networks that are constructed by fixing the hidden-layer parameters have recently shown strong performance in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). Such models, widely used in the random feature method (RFM) and extreme learning machines (ELM), transform network training into a linear least-squares problem. In this paper, we conduct a numerical study of the variational (Galerkin) and collocation formulations for these linearized networks. Our numerical results reveal that, in the variational formulation, the associated linear systems are severely ill-conditioned, forming the primary computational bottleneck in scaling the neural network size, even when direct solvers are employed. In contrast, collocation methods combined with robust least-squares solvers exhibit better numerical stability and achieve higher accuracy as we increase neuron numbers. This behavior is consistently observed for both ReLU$^k$ and $\tanh$ activations, with $\tanh$ networks exhibiting even worse conditioning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that random sampling of the hidden layer parameters, commonly used in RFM and ELM, is not necessary for achieving high accuracy. For ReLU$^k$ activations, this follows from existing theory and is verified numerically in this paper, while for $\tanh$ activations, we introduce two deterministic schemes that achieve comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Global Recovery from Local Data: Interior Nudging for 2D Navier-Stokes equations in a Physical Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many real-world applications of data assimilation (DA), the strategic placement of observers is crucial for effective and efficient forecasting. Motivated by practical constraints in sensor deployment, we show that global recovery of the flow field can be achieved using observations available only in a subregion of the domain, possibly far from the boundary. We focus on the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed in a bounded physical domain with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Building on the continuous data assimilation framework of Azouani, Olson, and Titi (2014), we rigorously prove that the assimilated solution converges globally to the true solution under suitable conditions on the nudging parameter, spatial resolution, and the geometry of the observation region, specifically, when the maximum distance from any point in the domain to the observational subregion is bounded by a constant multiple of \( \nu^{1/2} \) (in terms of scaling). Our computational results, conducted via finite element methods over complex geometries, support the theoretical findings and reveal even greater robustness in practice. Specifically, synchronization with the true solution is achieved even when the observational subregion lies farther from the rest of the domain than the theoretical threshold permits. Across all three tested scenarios, the local nudging algorithm performs comparably to full-domain assimilation, reaching global accuracy up to machine precision. Interestingly, observational data near the boundary are found to be largely uninformative. This demonstrates that full observability is not necessary: carefully chosen interior observations, even far from the boundary, can suffice.</description>

      <title>A Separable and Asymptotic-Preserving Dynamical Low-Rank Method for the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a dynamical low-rank (DLR) method for the Vlasov--Poisson--Fokker--Planck (VPFP) system. Our main contributions are two-fold: (i) a conservative spatial discretization of the Fokker--Planck operator that factors into velocity-only and space-only components, enabling efficient low-rank projection, and (ii) a time discretization within the DLR framework that properly handles stiff collisions. We propose both first-order and second-order low-rank IMEX schemes. For the first-order scheme, we prove an asymptotic-preserving (AP) property when the field fluctuation is small. Numerical experiments demonstrate accuracy, robustness, and AP property at modest ranks.</description>

      <title>Phase-IDENT: Identification of Two-phase PDEs with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel method, Phase-IDENT, for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) from noisy observations of dynamical systems that exhibit phase transitions. Such phenomena are prevalent in fluid dynamics and materials science, where they can be modeled mathematically as functions satisfying different PDEs within distinct regions separated by phase boundaries. Our approach simultaneously identifies the underlying PDEs in each regime and accurately reconstructs the phase boundaries. Furthermore, by incorporating change point detection techniques, we provide uncertainty quantification for the detected boundaries, enhancing the interpretability and robustness of our method. We conduct numerical experiments on a variety of two-phase PDE systems under different noise levels, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Spherical Designs: Existence, Numerical Constructions, and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a survey of spherical designs and their applications, with a particular emphasis on the perspective of ``numerical analysis''. A set \(X_N\) of \(N\) points on the unit sphere \(\mathbb{S}^d\) is called a \textit{spherical \(t\)-design} if the average value of any polynomial of degree at most \(t\) over \(X_N\) equals its average over the entire sphere. Spherical designs represent one of the most significant topics in the study of point distributions on spheres. They are deeply connected to algebraic combinatorics, discrete geometry, differential geometry, approximation theory, optimization, coding theory, quantum physics, and other fields, which have led to the development of profound and elegant mathematical theories. This article reviews fundamental theoretical results, numerical construction methods, and applied outcomes related to spherical designs. Key topics covered include existence proofs, optimization-based construction techniques, fast computational algorithms, and applications in interpolation, numerical integration, hyperinterpolation, signal and image processing, as well as numerical solutions to partial differential and integral equations.</description>

      <title>The linearization approach to the Calder\'on problem revisited: reconstruction via the Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Linearization techniques are widely used in the analysis and numerical solution of the Calder\'on inverse problem, even if their theoretical basis is not fully understood. In this article, we study the effectiveness of linearization for reconstructing a conductivity from its Dirichlet-to-Neumann (DtN) map, combining rigorous analysis with numerical experiments. In particular, we prove that any DtN map arising from a radial conductivity in the unit ball of $\mathbb{R}^d$ admits an exact representation as a linearized DtN map for a uniquely determined integrable function, the Born approximation. We linearize on a family of background conductivities that includes the constant case, giving a rigorous foundation for linearization-based methods in this framework. We also characterize the Born approximation as a solution of a generalized moment problem. Since this moment problem is formally well-defined even for non-radial conductivities, we use it to develop a numerical algorithm to reconstruct the Born approximation of a general conductivity on the unit disk. We provide numerical experiments to test the resolution and robustness of the Born approximation in different situations. Finally, we show how it can be used as the starting point of an algorithm for reconstructing a conductivity from its DtN map.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Level Deep Framework for Deep Solvers of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, inspired by the multigrid method, we propose a multi-level deep framework for deep solvers. Overall, it divides the entire training process into different levels of training. At each level of training, an adaptive sampling method proposed in this paper is first employed to obtain new training points, so that these points become increasingly concentrated in computational regions corresponding to high-frequency components. Then, the generalization ability of deep neural networks are utilized to update the PDEs for the next level of training based on the results from all previous levels. Rigorous mathematical proofs and detailed numerical experiments are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Streaming Operator Inference for Model Reduction of Large-Scale Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projection-based model reduction enables efficient simulation of complex dynamical systems by constructing low-dimensional surrogate models from high-dimensional data. The Operator Inference (OpInf) approach learns such reduced surrogate models through a two-step process: constructing a low-dimensional basis via Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to compress the data, then solving a linear least-squares (LS) problem to infer reduced operators that govern the dynamics in this compressed space, all without access to the underlying code or full model operators, i.e., non-intrusively. Traditional OpInf operates as a batch learning method, where both the SVD and LS steps process all data simultaneously. This poses a barrier to deployment of the approach on large-scale applications where dataset sizes prevent the loading of all data into memory at once. Additionally, the traditional batch approach does not naturally allow model updates using new data acquired during online computation. To address these limitations, we propose Streaming OpInf, which learns reduced models from sequentially arriving data streams. Our approach employs incremental SVD for adaptive basis construction and recursive LS for streaming operator updates, eliminating the need to store complete data sets while enabling online model adaptation. The approach can flexibly combine different choices of streaming algorithms for numerical linear algebra: we systematically explore the impact of these choices both analytically and numerically to identify effective combinations for accurate reduced model learning. Numerical experiments on benchmark problems and a large-scale turbulent channel flow demonstrate that Streaming OpInf achieves accuracy comparable to batch OpInf while reducing memory requirements by over 99% and enabling dimension reductions exceeding 31,000x, resulting in orders-of-magnitude faster predictions.</description>

      <title>Explicit symmetric low-regularity integrators for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the design and analysis of symmetric low-regularity integrators for the semilinear Klein-Gordon equation. We first propose a general symmetrization procedure that allows for the systematic construction of symmetric schemes from existing explicit (non-symmetric) integrators. Applying this procedure, we derive two novel schemes. Error analyses show that both integrators achieve their optimal convergence orders in the energy space under significantly relaxed regularity assumptions. Furthermore, the symmetry property ensures that the convergence order of a first-order symmetric scheme improves as the regularity of the exact solution increases. A numerical experiment demonstrates that the proposed second-order symmetric scheme nearly preserves the system energy over extended periods.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed machine learning for reconstruction of dynamical systems with invariant measure score matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a novel mesh-free framework, termed physics-informed neural networks with invariant measure score matching (PINN-IMSM), for reconstructing dynamical systems from unlabeled point-cloud data that capture the system's invariant measure. The invariant density satisfies the steady-state Fokker-Planck (FP) equation. We reformulate this equation in terms of its score function (the gradient of the log-density), which is estimated directly from data via denoising score matching, thereby bypassing explicit density estimation. This learned score is then embedded into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct the drift velocity field under the resulting score-based FP equation. The mesh-free nature of PINNs allows the framework to scale to higher dimensions, avoiding the curse of dimensionality inherent in mesh-based methods. To address the ill-posedness of high-dimensional inverse problems, we recast the problem as a PDE-constrained optimization that seeks the minimal-energy velocity field. Under suitable conditions, we prove that this problem admits a unique solution that depends continuously on the score function. The constrained formulation is solved using a stochastic augmented Lagrangian method. Numerical experiments on representative dynamical systems, including the Van der Pol oscillator, an active swimmer in an anharmonic trap, and the chaotic Lorenz-63 and Lorenz-96 systems, demonstrate that PINN-IMSM accurately recovers invariant measures and reconstructs faithful dynamical behavior for problems in up to five dimensions.</description>

      <title>High-order Lagrange multiplier schemes for general Hamiltonian PDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier approach to construct linearly implicit energy-preserving schemes of arbitrary order for general Hamiltonian PDEs. Unlike the widely used auxiliary variable methods, this novel approach does not require the nonlinear part of the energy to be bounded from below, thereby offering broader applicability. Moreover, this approach preserves the original energy exactly at both the continuous and discrete levels, as opposed to a modified energy preserved by the auxiliary variable methods. Rigorous proofs are provided for the energy conservation and numerical accuracy of all derived schemes. The trade-off for these advantages is the need to solve a nonlinear algebraic equation to determine the Lagrange multiplier. Nevertheless, numerical experiments show that the associated computational cost is generally not dominant, indicating that the new schemes retain computational efficiency comparable to the auxiliary variable-based schemes. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and structure-preserving properties of the proposed schemes.</description>

      <title>Graph Laplacian assisted regularization method under noise level free heuristic and statistical stopping rule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we address the solution of both linear and nonlinear ill-posed inverse problems by developing a novel graph-based regularization framework, where the regularization term is formulated through an iteratively updated graph Laplacian. The proposed approach operates without prior knowledge of the noise level and employs two distinct stopping criteria namely, the heuristic rule and the statistical discrepancy principle. To facilitate the latter, we utilize averaged measurements derived from multiple repeated observations. We provide a detailed convergence analysis of the method in statistical prospective, establishing its stability and regularization properties under both stopping strategies. The algorithm begins with the computation of an initial reconstruction using any suitable techniques like Tikhonov regularization (Tik), filtered back projection (FBP) or total variation (TV), which is used as the foundation for generating the initial graph Laplacian. The reconstruction is made better step by step using an iterative process, during which the graph Laplacian is dynamically re-calibrated to reflect how the solution's structure is changing. Finally, we present numerical experiments on X-ray Computed Tomography (CT) and phase retrieval CT, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method and comparing its reconstruction performance under both stopping rules.</description>

      <title>Two Frameworks and their Fourth Order Implicit Schemes for Time Discretization of Maxwell's Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our work is about energy conserving fourth-order time discretizations of a three-field formulation of Maxwell's equations in conjunction with a spatial discretization using higher-order and compatible de Rham finite element spaces. Toward this end, we delineate two broad classes of strategies for general higher-order time discretizations which we term spatial and temporal strategies. We provide a description of these two strategies and develop fourth-order time accurate schemes in the context of our Maxwell's system. However, our description can be used to prescribe similar fourth- or even higher-order time-integration methods for any linear (or quasi-linear) system of time-dependent partial differential equations. Our organizing principle in our proposed two strategies is to Taylor expand the unknown solution in time by assuming sufficient regularity. Then, in the spatial strategy, we use Maxwell's equations themselves to replace the fourth-order time derivatives in an appropriately truncated Taylor expansion with corresponding higher-order spatial derivatives. On the other hand, in the temporal strategy, we simply use higher-order finite difference schemes for the various higher-order time derivative terms in the truncated Taylor approximation. In both cases, we then defer to a standard finite element exterior calculus manner of compatible discretization for the spatial component of the Maxwell's solution. For our proposed schemes corresponding to the two strategies, we show that they are both stable and convergent and provide some validating numerical examples in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Our main contributions are in the development of the fourth-order time discretization methods that are energy conserving using our two outlined strategies and proofs of their convergence for semi- and full-discretizations of our three-field system of Maxwell's equations.</description>

      <title>Data-Consistent Learning of Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems are inherently ill-posed, suffering from non-uniqueness and instability. Classical regularization methods provide mathematically well-founded solutions, ensuring stability and convergence, but often at the cost of reduced flexibility or visual quality. Learned reconstruction methods, such as convolutional neural networks, can produce visually compelling results, yet they typically lack rigorous theoretical guarantees. DC (DC) networks address this gap by enforcing the measurement model within the network architecture. In particular, null-space networks combined with a classical regularization method as an initial reconstruction define a convergent regularization method. This approach preserves the theoretical reliability of classical schemes while leveraging the expressive power of data-driven learning, yielding reconstructions that are both accurate and visually appealing.</description>

      <title>A hierarchical splitting approach for N-split differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a hierarchical splitting approach to differential equations that provides a design principle for constructing splitting methods for $N$-split systems by iteratively applying splitting methods for two-split systems. We analyze the convergence order, derive explicit formulas for the leading-order error terms, and investigate self-adjointness. Moreover, we discuss compositions of hierarchical splitting methods in detail. We further augment the hierarchical splitting approach with multiple time-stepping techniques, turning the class into a promising framework at the intersection of geometric numerical integration and multirate integration. In this context, we characterize the computational order of a multirate integrator and establish conditions on the multirate factors that guarantee an increased convergence rate in practical computations up to a certain step size. Finally, we design several hierarchical splitting methods and perform numerical simulations for rigid body equations and a separable Hamiltonian system with multirate potential, confirming the theoretical findings and showcasing the computational efficiency of hierarchical splitting methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly oscillatory differential equations, commonly encountered in multi-scale problems, are often too complex to solve analytically. However, several numerical methods have been developed to approximate their solutions. Although these methods have shown their efficiency, the first part of the strategy often involves heavy pre-computations from averaging theory. In this paper, we leverage neural networks (machine learning) to approximate the vector fields required by the pre-computations in the first part, and combine this with micro-macro techniques to efficiently solve the oscillatory problem. We illustrate our work by numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>An iterative approach to a fluid-rigid body interaction problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a novel approach for the existence of solutions to an incompressible fluid-rigid body interaction problem in three dimensions. Our approach introduces an iteration based on a sequence of related problems posed on domains with prescribed evolution. In particular we prove the short-time existence of strong solutions to a system coupling the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations to the ordinary differential equations governing the motion of a rigid body, with no slip boundary conditions on the boundary of the rigid body, provided that the relative density $\frac{\rho}{\rho_B}$, is sufficiently small. We also discuss the use of our iterative approach in numerical methods for the moving boundary problem, and complement this with some numerical experiments in two dimensions which demonstrate the necessity of the smallness assumption on $\frac{\rho}{\rho_B}$.</description>

      <title>Solving Generalized Lyapunov Equations with guarantees: application to the Model Reduction of Switched Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an efficient strategy to approximate the solutions of large-scale generalized Lyapunov equations (GLEs) with rigorous, computable error guarantees. This work is motivated by applications in model order reduction (MOR) of switched linear systems (SLS) in control form, where GLEs play a central role. We analyze how inaccuracies in the numerical solution of GLEs propagate through the MOR procedure and affect the accuracy and reliability of the reduced order model. Furthermore, the classical balanced-truncation error estimate for SLS is neither theoretically nor practically viable, as they rely on restrictive assumptions requiring several requiring several linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to be satisfied exactly by numerically computed solutions of the GLEs. To overcome these limitation, we propose a new MOR framework for SLS, called piecewise balanced reduction (PBR). The method is based on solving multiple GLEs and the construction of projection matrices that are piecewise constant in time to appropriately balance and subsequently reduce the SLS. We extend the standard balanced-truncation error bounds and demonstrate that the PBR formulation allows us to control the error arising from the inexact LMI. In addition, our new error bound accounts for the influence of the piecewise constant time-varying projection matrices. Altogether, this renders the PBR approach for SLS applicable to a broad and flexible class of SLS. Numerical experiments are provided to corroborate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Gradient Descent for Nonlinear Inverse Problems in Banach Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and its variants are widely used and highly effective optimization methods in machine learning, especially for neural network training. By using a single datum or a small subset of the data, selected randomly at each iteration, SGD scales well to problem size and has been shown to be effective for solving large-scale inverse problems. In this work, we investigate SGD for solving nonlinear inverse problems in Banach spaces through the lens of iterative regularization. Under general assumptions, we prove almost sure convergence of the iterates to the minimum distance solution and show the regularizing property in expectation under an a priori stopping rule. Further, we establish convergence rates under the conditional stability assumptions for both exact and noisy data. Numerical experiments on Schlieren tomography and electrical impedance tomography are presented to show distinct features of the method.</description>

      <title>Towards Matrix-Free Patch Smoothers for the Stokes Problem: Evaluating Local p-Multigrid Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vertex-patch smoothers offer an effective strategy for achieving robust geometric multigrid convergence for the Stokes equations, particularly in the context of high-order finite elements. However, their practical efficiency is often limited by the computational cost of solving the local saddle-point problems, especially when explicit matrix factorizations are not feasible. We explore a fully iterative, matrix-free-compatible approach to the local patch solve using $p$-multigrid techniques. We evaluate different local solver configurations: Braess-Sarazin and block-triangular preconditioners. Our numerical experiments suggest that the Braess-Sarazin approach is particularly resilient. We find that a single iteration of the local solver yields global convergence rates comparable to those obtained with exact local solvers, even on distorted meshes and in the presence of large viscosity jumps.</description>

      <title>Deep Neural networks for solving high-dimensional parabolic partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The numerical solution of high dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs) is severely constrained by the curse of dimensionality (CoD), rendering classical grid--based methods impractical beyond a few dimensions. In recent years, deep neural networks have emerged as a promising mesh free alternative, enabling the approximation of PDE solutions in tens to thousands of dimensions. This review provides a tutorial--oriented introduction to neural--network--based methods for solving high dimensional parabolic PDEs, emphasizing conceptual clarity and methodological connections. We organize the literature around three unifying paradigms: (i) PDE residual--based approaches, including physicsinformed neural networks and their high dimensional variants; (ii) stochastic methods derived from Feynman--Kac and backward stochastic differential equation formulations; and (iii) hybrid derivative--free random difference approaches designed to alleviate the computational cost of derivatives in high dimensions. For each paradigm, we outline the underlying mathematical formulation, algorithmic implementation, and practical strengths and limitations. Representative benchmark problems--including Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman and Black--Scholes equations in up to 1000 dimensions --illustrate the scalability, effectiveness, and accuracy of the methods. The paper concludes with a discussion of open challenges and future directions for reliable and scalable solvers of high dimensional PDEs.</description>

      <title>A Scalable Sequential Framework for Dynamic Inverse Problems via Model Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale dynamic inverse problems are often ill-posed due to model complexity and the high dimensionality of the unknown parameters. Regularization is commonly employed to mitigate ill-posedness by incorporating prior information and structural constraints. However, classical regularization formulations are frequently infeasible in this setting due to prohibitive memory requirements, necessitating sequential methods that process data and state information online, eliminating the need to form the full space-time problem. In this work, we propose a memory-efficient framework for reconstructing dynamic sequences of undersampled images from computerized tomography data that requires minimal hyperparameter tuning. The approach is based on a prior-informed, dimension-reduced Kalman filter with smoothing. While well suited for dynamic image reconstruction, practical deployment is challenging when the state transition model and covariance parameters must be initialized without prior knowledge and estimated in a single pass. To address these limitations, we integrate regularized motion models with expectation-maximization strategies for the estimation of state transition dynamics and error covariances within the Kalman filtering framework. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through numerical experiments on limited-angle and single-shot computerized tomography problems, highlighting improvements in reconstruction accuracy, memory efficiency, and computational cost.</description>

      <title>Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Distributed-Delay Dynamics via the Linear Chain Trick</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) framework has been frequently used to discover parsimonious differential equations governing natural and physical systems. This includes recent extensions to SINDy that enable the recovery of discrete delay differential equations, where delay terms are represented explicitly in the candidate library. However, such formulations cannot capture the distributed delays that naturally arise in biological, physical, and engineering systems. In the present work, we extend SINDy to identify distributed-delay differential equations by incorporating the Linear Chain Trick (LCT), which provides a finite-dimensional ordinary differential equation representing the distributed memory effects. Hence, SINDy can operate in an augmented state space using conventional sparse regression while preserving a clear interpretation of delayed influences via the chain trick. From time-series data, the proposed method jointly infers the governing equations, the mean delay, and the dispersion of the underlying delay distribution. We numerically verify the method on several models with distributed delay, including the logistic growth model and a Hes1--mRNA gene regulatory network model. We show that the proposed method accurately reconstructs distributed delay dynamics, remains robust under noise and sparse sampling, and provides a transparent, data-driven approach for discovering nonlinear systems with distributed-delay.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a traffic flow model based on a microscopic follow-the-leader model, while enforcing maximal constraints on the density and velocity of the flow. The related macroscopic model can be represented in conservative formulation. By introducing an advected variable up with the flow, where p is the velocity offset, and u is the relative velocity, we reformulate the classical Aw-Rascle-Zhang (ARZ) model and the modified Aw-Rascle model to describe a realistic fundamental diagrams. The elementary waves are derived, and the Riemann problem is solved to validate the model's theoretical consistency. We further extend to a two-dimensional model. Numerical simulations are given for both one-and two-dimensional case by using the hybrid Godunov-Glimm scheme to verify the model's performance.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear fractional-periodic boundary value problems with Hilfer fractional derivative: existence and numerical approximations of solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove conditions for existence of analytical solutions for boundary value problems with the Hilfer fractional derivative, generalizing the commonly used Riemann-Liouville and Caputo operators. The boundary values, referred to in this paper as fractional-periodic, are fractional integral conditions generalizing recurrent solution values for the non-Caputo case of the Hilfer fractional derivative. Analytical solutions to the studied problem are obtained using a perturbation of the corresponding initial value problem with enforced boundary conditions. In general, solutions to the boundary value problem are singular for $t\downarrow 0$. To overcome this singularity, we construct a sequence of converging solutions in a weighted continuous function space. We present a Bernstein splines-based implementation to numerically approximate solutions. We prove convergence of the numerical method, providing convergence criteria and asymptotic convergence rates. Numerical examples show empirical convergence results corresponding with the theoretical bounds. Moreover, the method is able to approximate the singular behavior of solutions and is demonstrated to converge for nonlinear problems. Finally, we apply a grid search to obtain correspondence to the original, non-perturbed system.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Parallel Schemes with Lyapunov Exponents and kNN-LLE Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse parallel schemes remain indispensable tools for computing the roots of nonlinear systems, yet their dynamical behavior can be unexpectedly rich, ranging from strong contraction to oscillatory or chaotic transients depending on the choice of algorithmic parameters and initial states. A unified analytical-data-driven methodology for identifying, measuring, and reducing such instabilities in a family of uni-parametric inverse parallel solvers is presented in this study. On the theoretical side, we derive stability and bifurcation characterizations of the underlying iterative maps, identifying parameter regions associated with periodic or chaotic behavior. On the computational side, we introduce a micro-series pipeline based on kNN-driven estimation of the local largest Lyapunov exponent (LLE), applied to scalar time series derived from solver trajectories. The resulting sliding-window Lyapunov profiles provide fine-grained, real-time diagnostics of contractive or unstable phases and reveal transient behaviors not captured by coarse linearized analysis. Leveraging this correspondence, we introduce a Lyapunov-informed parameter selection strategy that identifies solver settings associated with stable behavior, particularly when the estimated LLE indicates persistent instability. Comprehensive experiments on ensembles of perturbed initial guesses demonstrate close agreement between the theoretical stability diagrams and empirical Lyapunov profiles, and show that the proposed adaptive mechanism significantly improves robustness. The study establishes micro-series Lyapunov analysis as a practical, interpretable tool for constructing self-stabilizing root-finding schemes and opens avenues for extending such diagnostics to higher-dimensional or noise-contaminated problems.</description>

      <title>Direct Finite-Time Contraction (Step-Log) Profiling--Driven Optimization of Parallel Schemes for Nonlinear Problems on Multicore Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient computation of all distinct solutions of nonlinear problems is essential in many scientific and engineering applications. Although high-order parallel iterative schemes offer fast convergence, their practical performance is often limited by sensitivity to internal parameters and the lack of reproducible tuning procedures. Classical parameter selection tools based on analytical conditions and dynamical-system diagnostics can be problem-dependent and computationally demanding, which motivates lightweight data-driven alternatives.
  In this study, we propose a parameterized single-step bi-parametric parallel Weierstrass-type scheme with third-order convergence together with a training-free tuning framework based on Direct finite-time contraction (step-log) profiling. The approach extracts Lyapunov-like finite-time contraction information directly from solver trajectories via step norms and step-log ratios, aggregates the resulting profiles over micro-launch ensembles, and ranks parameter candidates using two compact scores: the stability minimum S_min and the stability moment S_mom. Numerical results demonstrate consistent improvements in convergence rate, stability, and robustness across diverse nonlinear test problems, establishing the proposed profiling-based strategy as an efficient and reproducible alternative to classical parameter tuning methods.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear compressive reduced basis approximation : when Taylor meets Kolmogorov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates model reduction methods for efficiently approximating the solution of parameter-dependent PDEs with a multi-parameter vector $\vec{\mu} \in \mathbb{R}^p$. In cases where the Kolmogorov $N$-width decays fast enough, it is effective to approximate the solution as a sum of $N$ separable terms, each being the product of a parameter-dependent coefficient and a space-dependent function. This leads to reduced-order models with $N$ degrees of freedom and complexity of order ${\mathcal O}(N^3)$.
  However, when the $N$-width decays slowly, $N$ must be large to achieve acceptable accuracy, making cubic complexity prohibitive. The linear complexity measure in terms of Kolmogorov width must be replaced by the Gelfand width, with its associated sensing number. Recent nonlinear approaches based on this notion decompose the $N$ coordinates into two groups: $n$ free variables and $\overline{n}$ dependent variables, where the latter are nonlinear functions of the former ($N= n+\overline n$). Several works have focused on cases where these $\overline{n}$ functions are homogeneous quadratic forms of the $n$ variables, with optimization strategies for choosing $n$ given a target accuracy.
  A rigorous analysis of the local sensing number is carried out, showing that $n = p$ is optimal and appropriate, at least locally, around a reference point. In practical scenarios involving wide parameter ranges, the condition $p\le n \le p + k$ (with $k$ small) is valid and more robust from continuity arguments. Additionally, the assumption of a quadratic mapping, while justified in a local sense, becomes insufficient. More expressive nonlinear mappings-including those using machine learning-become necessary. This work contributes a theoretical foundation for such strategies and highlights the need for further investigations to push back the Kolmogorov Barrier.</description>

      <title>A Hybridizable Discontinuous Galerkin Method for the non--local Camassa--Holm--Kadomtsev--Petviashvili equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method for the two-dimensional Camassa--Holm--Kadomtsev--Petviashvili equation. The method employs Cartesian meshes with tensor-product polynomial spaces, enabling separate treatment of \(x\) and \(y\) derivatives. The non-local operator \(\partial_{x}^{-1}u_{y}\) is localized through an auxiliary variable \(v\) satisfying \(v_x = u_y\), allowing efficient element-by-element computations. We prove energy stability of the semi-discrete scheme and derive \(\mathcal{O}(h^{k+1/2})\) convergence in space. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the method's capability to accurately resolve smooth solutions and peaked solitary waves (peakons).</description>

      <title>Multi-Trace M\"uller Boundary Integral Equation for Electromagnetic Scattering by Composite Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a boundary integral equation for time-harmonic electromagnetic scattering by composite dielectric objects. The formulation extends the classical M\"uller equation to composite structures through the global multi-trace method. The key ingredient enabling this extension is the use of the Stratton-Chu representation in complementary region, also known as the extinction property, which augments the off-diagonal blocks of the interior representation operator. The resulting block system is composed entirely of second-kind operators. A Petrov-Galerkin (mixed) discretization using Rao-Wilton-Glisson trial functions and Buffa-Christiansen test functions is employed, yielding linear systems that remain well conditioned on dense meshes and at low frequencies without the need for additional stabilization. This reduces computational costs associated with matrix-vector multiplications and iterative solving. Numerical experiments demonstrate the accuracy of the method in computing field traces and derived quantities.</description>

      <title>Improving the local solution of the DG predictor of the ADER-DG method for solving systems of ordinary differential equations and its applicability to systems of differential-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Improved local numerical solution for the ADER-DG numerical method with a local DG predictor for solving the initial value problem for a first-order ODE system is proposed. The improved local numerical solution demonstrates convergence orders of one higher than the convergence order of the local numerical solution of the original ADER-DG numerical method and has the property of continuity at grid nodes. Rigorous proofs of the approximation orders of the local numerical solution and the improved local numerical solution are presented. Obtaining the proposed improved local numerical solution does not require significant changes to the structure of the ADER-DG numerical method. Therefore, all conclusions regarding the convergence orders of the numerical solution at grid nodes, the resulting superconvergence, and the high stability of the ADER-DG numerical method remain unchanged. A wide range of applications of the ADER-DG numerical method is presented for solving specific initial value problems for ODE systems for a wide range of polynomial degrees. The obtained results provide strong confirmation for the developed rigorous theory. The improved local numerical solution is shown to exhibit both higher accuracy and improved smoothness and point-wise comparability. Empirical convergence orders of all individual numerical solutions were calculated for a wide range of error norms, which well agree with the expected convergence orders. The rigorous proof, based on the $\epsilon$-embedding method, of the applicability of the ADER-DG numerical method with a local DG predictor to solving DAE systems is presents.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The processes of simultaneous coagulation and Ostwald ripening of particles in the concluding stage of phase transformation are considered. We solve the integro-differential system of Smoluchowski-type kinetic and mass balance equations using a computationally efficient numerical algorithm based on low-rank matrices. We compare our numerical solutions for different initial particle-volume distributions with the universal distribution function for combined coagulation and Ostwald ripening. Our calculations confirm the tendency of a particulate ensemble to the universal particle-volume distribution to be approached asymptotically after a sufficiently long time, no matter what the initial particle-volume distribution might be.</description>

      <title>On the optimal shape parameter for kernel methods: Sharp direct and inverse statements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The search for the optimal shape parameter for Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel approximation has been an outstanding research problem for decades. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework for this problem by leveraging a recently established theory on sharp direct, inverse and saturation statements for kernel based approximation. In particular, we link the search for the optimal shape parameter to superconvergence phenomena. Our analysis is carried out for finitely smooth Sobolev kernels, thereby covering large classes of radial kernels used in practice, including those emerging from current machine-learning methodologies. Our results elucidate how approximation regimes, kernel regularity, and parameter choices interact, thereby clarifying a question that has remained unresolved for decades.</description>

      <title>Local electrical impedance tomography via projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for approximately eliminating the effect that conductivity changes outside the region of interest have in electrical impedance tomography, allowing to form a local reconstruction in the region of interest only. The method considers the Jacobian matrix of the forward map, i.e., of the map that sends the discretized conductivity to the electrode measurements, at an initial guess for the conductivity. The Jacobian matrix is divided columnwise into two parts: one corresponding to the region of interest and a nuisance Jacobian corresponding to the rest of the domain. The leading idea is to project both the electrode measurements and the forward map onto the orthogonal complement of the span of a number of left-hand singular vectors for a suitably weighted nuisance Jacobian. The weighting can, e.g., account for the element sizes in a finite element discretization or to prior information on the conductivity outside the region of interest. The inverse problem is then solved by considering the projected relation between the measurements and the forward map, only reconstructing the conductivity in the region of interest. The functionality of the method is demonstrated by applying a reconstruction algorithm that combines lagged diffusivity iteration and total variation regularization to experimental data. In particular, data from a head-shaped water tank is considered, with the conductivity change in the region of interest mimicking growth of a hemorrhagic stroke and the changes outside the region of interest imitating physiological variations in the conductivity of the scalp.</description>

      <title>Convergence analysis and a novel Lagrange multiplier partitioned method for fluid-poroelastic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a partitioned method for the monolithic formulation of the Stokes-Biot system that incorporates Lagrange multipliers enforcing the interface conditions. The monolithic system is discretized using finite elements, and we establish convergence of the resulting approximation. A Schur complement based algorithm is developed together with an efficient preconditioner, enabling the fluid and poroelastic structure subproblems to be decoupled and solved independently at each time step. The Lagrange multipliers approximate the interface fluxes and act as Neumann boundary conditions for the subproblems, yielding parallel solution of the Stokes and Biot equations. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and validate the theoretical error estimate.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Black-Box Optimization (PBBO): Theory and the Model-Based Algorithm DFOp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on solving unconstrained privacy-preserving black-box optimization (PBBO), its corresponding least Frobenius norm updating of quadratic models, and the differentially privacy mechanisms for PBBO. Optimization problems with transformed/encrypted objective functions aim to minimize F(x), which is encrypted/transformed/encrypted to F_k(x) as the output at the k-th iteration. A new derivative-free solver named DFOp, with its implementation, is proposed in this paper, which has a new updating formula for the quadratic model functions. The convergence of DFOp for solving problems with transformed/encrypted objective functions is given. Other analyses, including the new model updating formula and the analysis of the transformation's impact to model functions are presented. We propose two differentially private noise-adding mechanisms for privacy-preserving black-box optimization. Numerical results show that DFOp performs better than compared algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, DFOp is the first derivative-free solver that can solve black-box optimization problems with step-encryption and privacy-preserving black-box problems exactly, which also tries to answer the open question about the combination of derivative-free optimization and privacy.</description>

      <title>Level set-based topology optimization of micropolar solids under thermo-mechanical loading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel level set-based topology optimization for micropolar solids subjected to thermo-mechanical loading. To capture the size effects, we have incorporated the microstructural length-scale information into the level set-based topology optimization method by adopting a micropolar theory. The proposed non-local topology optimization method can provide accurate topology optimization for size-dependent solids under thermo-mechanical loading. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method through a few representative two-dimensional benchmark problems. The numerical results reveal the substantial influence of underlying micro-structures, incorporated in the model through micropolar parameters, and temperature on topology optimization, highlighting the necessity of the proposed thermo-mechanical micropolar formulation for materials with pronounced non-local effects. For the numerical implementation of the proposed model, we have used open-source finite element libraries, \texttt{Gridap.jl}, and \texttt{GridapTopOpt.jl}, available in Julia, to ensure transparency and reproducibility of the reported computational results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Epidemic models play a crucial role in population dynamics, offering valuable insights into disease transmission while aiding in epidemic prediction and control. In this paper, we analyze the mathematical model of the time-fractional Zika virus transmission for human and mosquito populations. The fractional derivative is considered in the Caputo sense of order $\alpha\in(0,1).$ We begin by conducting a qualitative analysis using the stability theory of differential equations. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are established, and the model's stability is examined through Hyers-Ulam stability analysis. Furthermore, an efficient difference scheme utilizing the standard L1 technique is developed to simulate the model and analyze the solution's behavior under key parameters. The resulting nonlinear algebraic system is solved using the Newton-Raphson method. Finally, illustrative examples are presented to validate the theoretical findings. Graphical results indicate that the fractional model provides deeper insights and a better understanding of disease dynamics. These findings aid in controlling the virus through contact precautions and recommended therapies while also helping to predict its future spread.</description>

      <title>sangkuriang: A pseudo-spectral Python library for Korteweg-de Vries soliton simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation serves as a foundational model in nonlinear wave physics, describing the balance between dispersive spreading and nonlinear steepening that gives rise to solitons. This article introduces sangkuriang, an open-source Python library for solving this equation using Fourier pseudo-spectral spatial discretization coupled with adaptive high-order time integration. The implementation leverages just-in-time (JIT) compilation for computational efficiency while maintaining accessibility for instructional purposes. Validation encompasses progressively complex scenarios including isolated soliton propagation, symmetric two-wave configurations, overtaking collisions between waves of differing amplitudes, and three-body interactions. Conservation of the classical invariants is monitored throughout, with deviations remaining small across all test cases. Measured soliton velocities conform closely to theoretical predictions based on the amplitude-velocity relationship characteristic of integrable systems. Complementary diagnostics drawn from information theory and recurrence analysis confirm that computed solutions preserve the regular phase-space structure expected for completely integrable dynamics. The solver outputs data in standard scientific formats compatible with common analysis tools and generates visualizations of spatiotemporal wave evolution. By combining numerical accuracy with practical accessibility on modest computational resources, sangkuriang offers a platform suitable for both classroom demonstrations of nonlinear wave phenomena and exploratory research into soliton dynamics.</description>

      <title>Koopman Spectral Computation Beyond The Reflexive Regime: Endpoint Solvability Complexity Index And Type-2 Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) of Koopman operator spectral computation in the information-based framework of towers of algorithms. Given a compact metric space $(\mathcal{X},d)$ with a finite Borel measure $\omega$ on $\mathcal{X}$ and a continuous nonsingular map $F:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$, our focus is the Koopman operator $\mathcal{K}_F$ acting on $L^p(\mathcal{X},\omega)$ for $p\in\{1,\infty\}$ for the computational problem \[ \Xi_{\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}}(F) :=\sigma_{\mathrm{ap}}\!\bigl(\mathcal{K}_F\bigr), \] with input access given by point evaluations of $F\mapsto F(x)$ (and fixed quadrature access to $\omega$).
  We clarify how the $L^1$ case can be brought into the same oracle model as the reflexive regime $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ by proving a uniform finite-dimensional quadrature compatibility, while highlighting the fundamentally different role played by non-separability at $p=\infty$.
  Beyond Koopman operators, we also construct a prototype family of decision problems $(\Xi_m)_{m\in\mathbb N}$ realizing prescribed finite tower heights, providing a reusable reduction source for future SCI lower bounds. Finally, we place these results deeper in the broader computational landscape of Type-2/Weihrauch theory.</description>

When the total fidelity can be represented as a ratio of two quadratic forms (e.g., in the case of mapping a mixed state to a pure state, projective operators, unitary learning, and others), Semidefinite Programming (SDP) can be applied to solve the fidelity optimization problem with respect to the Choi matrix. A remarkable feature of SDP is that the optimization is convex, which allows the problem to be efficiently solved by a variety of numerical algorithms. We have tested several commercially available SDP solvers, all of which allowed for the reconstruction of quantum channels of different forms. A notable feature is that the Kraus rank of the obtained quantum channel typically comprises less than a few percent of its maximal possible value. This suggests that a relatively small Kraus rank quantum channel is typically sufficient to describe experimentally observed classical data. The theory was also applied to the problem of reconstructing projective operators from data. Finally, we discuss a classical computational model based on quantum channel transformation, performed and calculated on a classical computer, possibly hardware-optimized.</description>

      <title>A Functorial Approach to Multi-Space Interpolation with Function Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an extension of interpolation theory to more than two spaces by employing a functional parameter, while retaining a fully functorial and systematic framework. This approach allows for the construction of generalized intermediate spaces and ensures stability under natural operations such as powers and convex combinations. As a significant application, we demonstrate that the interpolation of multiple generalized Sobolev spaces yields a generalized Besov space. Our framework provides explicit tools for handling multi-parameter interpolation, highlighting both its theoretical robustness and practical relevance.</description>

      <title>New Trends in the Stability of Sinkhorn Semigroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12633v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. In contrast with optimal transport maps which often have limited applicability in high dimensions, Schrodinger bridges can be solved using the celebrated Sinkhorn's algorithm, a.k.a. the iterative proportional fitting procedure. The stability properties of Sinkhorn bridges when the number of iterations tends to infinity is a very active research area in applied probability and machine learning. Traditional proofs of convergence are mainly based on nonlinear versions of Perron-Frobenius theory and related Hilbert projective metric techniques, gradient descent, Bregman divergence techniques and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, including propagation of convexity profiles based on coupling diffusions by reflection methods. The objective of this review article is to present, in a self-contained manner, recently developed Sinkhorn/Gibbs-type semigroup analysis based upon contraction coefficients and Lyapunov-type operator-theoretic techniques. These powerful, off-the-shelf semigroup methods are based upon transportation cost inequalities (e.g. log-Sobolev, Talagrand quadratic inequality, curvature estimates), $\phi$-divergences, Kantorovich-type criteria and Dobrushin contraction-type coefficients on weighted Banach spaces as well as Wasserstein distances. This novel semigroup analysis allows one to unify and simplify many arguments in the stability of Sinkhorn algorithm. It also yields new contraction estimates w.r.t. generalized $\phi$-entropies, as well as weighted total variation norms, Kantorovich criteria and Wasserstein distances.</description>

      <title>An efficient numerical method for simulating two-dimensional non-periodic metasurfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.12674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces are extremely useful for controlling and manipulating electromagnetic waves. Full-wave numerical simulation is highly desired for their design and optimization, but it is notoriously difficult, even for two-dimensional metasurfaces, when they comprise a huge number of subwavelength elements. This paper focuses on two-dimensional non-periodic metasurfaces that contain only a relatively small number of distinct subwavelength elements. We develop an efficient numerical method based on Neumann-to-Dirichlet operators, the finite element method and local function expansions. Our method drastically reduces the total number of unknowns and is capable of simulating two-dimensional metasurfaces with $10^{5}$ subwavelength elements on a personal computer. Numerical examples demonstrate that the method maintains high accuracy while offering significant advantages in both computational time and memory usage compared to the classical full-domain finite element method, making it particularly suited for the analysis of large metasurfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that quantum search can be used to compute the hardness to round an elementary function, that is, to determine the minimum working precision required to compute the values of an elementary function correctly rounded to a target precision of $n$ digits for all possible precision-$n$ floating-point inputs in a given interval. For elementary functions $f$ related to the exponential function, quantum search takes time $\tilde O(2^{n/2} \log (1/\delta))$ to return, with probability $1-\delta$, the hardness to round $f$ over all $n$-bit floating-point inputs in a given binade. For periodic elementary functions in large binades, standalone quantum search yields an asymptotic speedup over the best known classical algorithms and heuristics.</description>

      <title>Moving Least Squares without Quasi-Uniformity: A Stochastic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local Polynomial Regression (LPR) and Moving Least Squares (MLS) are closely related nonparametric estimation methods, developed independently in statistics and approximation theory. While statistical LPR analysis focuses on overcoming sampling noise under probabilistic assumptions, the deterministic MLS theory studies smoothness properties and convergence rates with respect to the \textit{fill-distance} (a resolution parameter). Despite this similarity, the deterministic assumptions underlying MLS fail to hold under random sampling. We begin by quantifying the probabilistic behavior of the fill-distance $h_n$ and \textit{separation} $\delta_n$ of an i.i.d. random sample. That is, for a distribution satisfying a mild regularity condition, $h_n\propto n^{-1/d}\log^{1/d} (n)$ and $\delta_n \propto n^{-1/d}$. We then prove that, for MLS of degree $k\!-\!1$, the approximation error associated with a differential operator $Q$ of order $|m|\le k-1$ decays as $h_n^{\,k-|m|}$ up to logarithmic factors, establishing stochastic analogues of the classical MLS estimates. Additionally, We show that the MLS approximant is smooth with high probability. Finally, we apply the stochastic MLS theory to manifold estimation. Assuming that the sampled Manifold is $k$-times smooth, we show that the Hausdorff distance between the true manifold and its MLS reconstruction decays as $h_n^k$, extending the deterministic Manifold-MLS guarantees to random samples. This work provides the first unified stochastic analysis of MLS, demonstrating that -- despite the failure of deterministic sampling assumptions -- the classical convergence and smoothness properties persist under natural probabilistic models</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional FrBD friction models for rolling contact: extension to linear viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.13818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.13818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the distributed rolling contact FrBD framework to linear viscoelasticity by considering classic derivative Generalised Maxwell and Kelvin-Voigt rheological representations of the bristle element. With this modelling approach, the dynamics of the bristle, generated friction forces, and internal deformation states are described by a system of 2(n+1) hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs), which can capture complex relaxation phenomena originating from viscoelastic behaviours. By appropriately specifying the analytical expressions for the transport and rigid relative velocity, three distributed formulations of increasing complexity are introduced, which account for different levels of spin excitation. For the linear variants, well-posedness and passivity are analysed rigorously, showing that these properties hold for any physically meaningful parametrisation. Numerical experiments complement the theoretical results by illustrating steady-state characteristics and transient relaxation effects. The findings of this paper substantially advance the FrBD paradigm by enabling a unified and systematic treatment of linear viscoelasticity.</description>

      <title>Rigid Body Dynamics in Ambient Fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.13971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for rigid body dynamics in ambient media, such as air or water, enabling accurate motion prediction of objects without requiring computational fluid dynamics simulations. Our method computes the added mass of the fluid and replaces heuristic models for shape-dependent lift and drag with a generalized estimate of flow separation and dynamic pressure. Our method is the first within the rigid body dynamics context to reproduce the full range of falling plate behaviors: fluttering, tumbling, chaotic and steady modes, as well as phenomena such as the Magnus effect and the flight dynamics of an American football (tight spiral pass paradox). The resulting algorithm is simple to implement, robust, does not rely on specialized integrators and incorporates seamlessly into existing physics engines for real-time simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1912.07075v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the approximation of a function $u$ in a given approximation space $V_m$ of dimension $m$ from evaluations of the function at $n$ suitably chosen points. The aim is to construct an approximation of $u$ in $V_m$ which yields an error close to the best approximation error in $V_m$ and using as few evaluations as possible. Classical least-squares regression, which defines a projection in $V_m$ from $n$ random points, usually requires a large $n$ to guarantee a stable approximation and an error close to the best approximation error. This is a major drawback for applications where $u$ is expensive to evaluate. One remedy is to use a weighted least squares projection using $n$ samples drawn from a properly selected distribution. In this paper, we introduce a boosted weighted least-squares method which allows to ensure almost surely the stability of the weighted least squares projection with a sample size close to the interpolation regime $n=m$. It consists in sampling according to a measure associated with the optimization of a stability criterion over a collection of independent $n$-samples, and resampling according to this measure until a stability condition is satisfied. A greedy method is then proposed to remove points from the obtained sample. Quasi-optimality properties are obtained for the weighted least-squares projection, with or without the greedy procedure. The proposed method is validated on numerical examples and compared to state-of-the-art interpolation and weighted least squares methods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2212.02940v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudoinverse of a matrix, a generalized notion of the inverse, is of fundamental importance in linear algebra and, thereby, in many different fields. Despite its proven existence, an algorithmic approach is typically necessary to obtain the pseudoinverse in practical applications. Therefore, we analyze if and to what degree the pseudoinverse can be computed on perfect digital hardware platforms modeled as Turing machines. For this, we utilize the notion of an effective algorithm that describes a provably correct computation: upon an input of any error parameter, the algorithm provides an approximation within the given error bound with respect to the unknown solution. We prove that a universal effective algorithm for computing the pseudoinverse of any matrix with a finite error bound does not exist on Turing machines. However, for specific classes of matrices, we show that provably correct algorithms exist and obtain a characterization of the properties of the input set, leading to the effective computability breakdown.</description>

      <title>Fast and Inverse-Free Algorithms for Deflating Subspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.00193v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores a key question in numerical linear algebra: how can we compute projectors onto the deflating subspaces of a regular matrix pencil $(A,B)$, in particular without using matrix inversion or defaulting to an expensive Schur decomposition? We focus specifically on spectral projectors, whose associated deflating subspaces correspond to sets of eigenvalues/eigenvectors. In this work, we present a high-level approach to computing these projectors, which combines rational function approximation with an inverse-free arithmetic of Benner and Byers [Numerische Mathematik 2006]. The result is a numerical framework that captures existing inverse-free methods, generates an array of new options, and provides straightforward tools for pursuing efficiency on structured problems (e.g., definite pencils). To exhibit the efficacy of this framework, we consider a handful of methods in detail, including Implicit Repeated Squaring and iterations based on the matrix sign function. In an appendix, we demonstrate that recent, randomized divide-and-conquer eigensolvers -- which are built on fast methods for individual projectors -- can be adapted to produce the generalized Schur form of any matrix pencil in nearly matrix multiplication time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an adaptive geometric multigrid method for the solution of large-scale finite cell flow problems. The finite cell method seeks to circumvent the need for a boundary-conforming mesh through the embedding of the physical domain in a regular background mesh. As a result of the intersection between the physical domain and the background computational mesh, the resultant systems of equations are typically numerically ill-conditioned, rendering the appropriate treatment of cutcells a crucial aspect of the solver. To this end, we propose a smoother operator with favorable parallel properties and discuss its memory footprint and parallelization aspects. We propose three cache policies that offer a balance between cached and on-the-fly computation and discuss the optimization opportunities offered by the smoother operator. It is shown that the smoother operator, on account of its additive nature, can be replicated in parallel exactly with little communication overhead, which offers a major advantage in parallel settings as the geometric multigrid solver is consequently independent of the number of processes. The convergence and scalability of the geometric multigrid method is studied using numerical examples. It is shown that the iteration count of the solver remains bounded independent of the problem size and depth of the grid hierarchy. The solver is shown to obtain excellent weak and strong scaling using numerical benchmarks with more than 665 million degrees of freedom. The presented geometric multigrid solver is, therefore, an attractive option for the solution of large-scale finite cell problems in massively parallel high-performance computing environments.</description>

      <title>Matrix perturbation analysis of methods for extracting singular values from approximate singular subspaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given (orthonormal) approximations $\tilde{U}$ and $\tilde{V}$ to the left and right subspaces spanned by the leading singular vectors of a matrix $A$, we discuss methods to approximate the leading singular values of $A$ and study their accuracy. In particular, we focus our analysis on the generalized Nystr\"om approximation, as surprisingly, it is able to obtain significantly better accuracy than classical methods, namely Rayleigh-Ritz and (one-sided) projected SVD.
  A key idea of the analysis is to view the methods as finding the exact singular values of a perturbation of $A$. In this context, we derive a matrix perturbation result that exploits the structure of such $2\times2$ block matrix perturbation. Furthermore, we extend it to block tridiagonal matrices. We then obtain bounds on the accuracy of the extracted singular values. This leads to sharp bounds that predict well the approximation error trends and explain the difference in the behavior of these methods. Finally, we present an approach to derive an a-posteriori version of those bounds, which are more amenable to computation in practice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the integration problem over the $s$-dimensional unit cube on four types of Banach spaces of integrands. First we consider Haar wavelet spaces, consisting of functions whose Haar wavelet coefficients exhibit a certain decay behavior measured by a parameter $\alpha &gt;0$. We study the worst case error of integration over the norm unit ball and provide upper error bounds for quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) cubature rules based on arbitrary $(t,m,s)$-nets as well as matching lower error bounds for arbitrary cubature rules. These results show that using arbitrary $(t,m,s)$-nets as sample points yields the best possible rate of convergence. Afterwards we study spaces of integrands of fractional smoothness $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and state a sharp Koksma-Hlawka-type inequality. More precisely, we show that on those spaces the worst case error of integration is equal to the corresponding fractional discrepancy. Those spaces can be continuously embedded into tensor product Bessel potential spaces, also known as Sobolev spaces of dominated mixed smoothness, with the same set of parameters. The latter spaces can be embedded into suitable Besov spaces of dominating mixed smoothness $\alpha$, which in turn can be embedded into the Haar wavelet spaces with the same set of parameters. Therefore our upper error bounds on Haar wavelet spaces for QMC cubatures based on $(t,m,s)$-nets transfer (with possibly different constants) to the corresponding spaces of integrands of fractional smoothness and to Sobolev and Besov spaces of dominating mixed smoothness. Moreover, known lower error bounds for periodic Sobolev and Besov spaces of dominating mixed smoothness show that QMC integration based on arbitrary $(t,m,s)$-nets yields the best possible convergence rate on periodic as well as on non-periodic Sobolev and Besov spaces of dominating smoothness.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a subspace method based on neural networks for eigenvalue problems with high accuracy and low cost. We first construct a neural network-based orthogonal basis by some deep learning method and dimensionality reduction technique, and then calculate the Galerkin projection of the eigenvalue problem onto the subspace spanned by the orthogonal basis and obtain an approximate solution. Numerical experiments show that we can obtain approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions with very high accuracy but low cost.</description>

      <title>Tensorization of neural networks for improved privacy and interpretability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06300v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a tensorization algorithm for constructing tensor train/matrix product state (MPS) representations of functions, drawing on sketching and cross interpolation ideas. The method only requires black-box access to the target function and a small set of sample points defining the domain of interest. Thus, it is particularly well-suited for machine learning models, where the domain of interest is naturally defined by the training dataset. We show that this approach can be used to enhance the privacy and interpretability of neural network models. Specifically, we apply our decomposition to (i) obfuscate neural networks whose parameters encode patterns tied to the training data distribution, and (ii) estimate topological phases of matter that are easily accessible from the MPS representation. Additionally, we show that this tensorization can serve as an efficient initialization method for optimizing MPS in general settings, and that, for model compression, our algorithm achieves a superior trade-off between memory and time complexity compared to conventional tensorization methods of neural networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel Asymptotic-Preserving Neural Network (APNN) approach utilizing even-odd decomposition to tackle the nonlinear gray radiative transfer equations (GRTEs). Our AP loss demonstrates consistent stability concerning the small Knudsen number, ensuring the neural network solution uniformly converges to the diffusion limit solution. This APNN method alleviates the rigorous conservation requirements while simultaneously incorporating an auxiliary deep neural network, distinguishing it from the APNN method based on micro-macro decomposition for GRTE. Several numerical problems are examined to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed APNN technique.</description>

      <title>A Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method for cell-centred finite volume solid mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the efficacy of Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods in finite-volume solid mechanics. Traditional Newton-based approaches require explicit Jacobian matrix formation and storage, which can be computationally expensive and memory-intensive. In contrast, Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods approximate the Jacobian's action using finite differences, combined with Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalised minimal residual method (GMRES), enabling seamless integration into existing segregated finite-volume frameworks without major code refactoring. This work proposes and benchmarks the performance of a compact-stencil Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method against a conventional segregated approach on a suite of test cases, encompassing varying geometric dimensions, nonlinearities, dynamic responses, and material behaviours. Key metrics, including computational cost, memory efficiency, and robustness, are evaluated, along with the influence of preconditioning strategies and stabilisation scaling. Results show that the proposed Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov method outperforms the segregated approach in all linear and nonlinear elastic cases, achieving order-of-magnitude speedups in many instances; however, divergence is observed in elastoplastic cases, highlighting areas for further development. It is found that preconditioning choice impacts performance: a LU direct solver is fastest in small to moderately-sized cases, while a multigrid method is more effective for larger problems. The findings demonstrate that Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov methods are promising for advancing finite-volume solid mechanics simulations, particularly for existing segregated frameworks where minimal modifications enable their adoption. The described implementations are available in the solids4foam toolbox for OpenFOAM, inviting the community to explore, extend, and compare these procedures.</description>

      <title>High-dimensional sparse recovery from function samples Decoders, guarantees and instance optimality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the reconstruction of multivariate functions from samples using sparse recovery techniques. For Square Root Lasso, Orthogonal Matching Pursuit, and Compressive Sampling Matching Pursuit, we demonstrate both theoretically and empirically that they allow us to recover functions from a small number of random samples. In contrast to Basis Pursuit Denoising, the deployed decoders only require a search space $V_J$ spanned by dictionary elements indexed by $J$ and a sparsity parameter $n$ to guarantee an $L_2$-approximation error decaying no worse than a best $n$-term approximation error and the truncation error with respect to the search space $V_J$ and the uniform norm. We show that this happens simultaneously for all admissible functions if the number of samples scales as $n\log^2 n\log |J|$, coming from known bounds for the RIP for matrices built upon bounded orthonormal systems. As a consequence, we obtain bounds for sampling widths in function classes. In addition, we establish lower bounds on the required sample complexity, which show that the log-factor in $\vert J \vert$ is indeed necessary to obtain such {\em instance-optimal} error guarantees. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to show that our theoretical bounds are reasonable and compare the discussed decoders in practice.</description>

Abstract: A conforming finite element scheme with mixed explicit-implicit time discretization for quasi-incompressible Navier-Stokes-Maxwell-Stefan systems in a bounded domain with periodic boundary conditions is presented. The system consists of the Navier-Stokes equations, together with a quasi-incompressibility constraint, coupled with the cross-diffusion Maxwell-Stefan equations. The numerical scheme preserves the partial masses and the quasi-incompressibility constraint and dissipates the discrete energy. Numerical experiments in two space dimensions illustrate the convergence of the scheme and the structure-preserving properties.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a mathematical and computational framework to model the dynamics of open lipid bilayer membranes interacting with ambient Stokes flow. The model explicitly couples the three-dimensional viscous fluid, the two-dimensional membrane surface, and its one-dimensional free edge. We develop an axisymmetric hybrid BEM-FEM method that solves the problem with an effective one-dimensional formulation. A key component is a local mesh refinement strategy designed to accurately resolve singularities and boundary layers originating at the membrane edge. Several numerical examples are provided to showcase its ability to capture intricate edge dynamics and multiscale fluid-membrane coupling.</description>

      <title>A finite volume Simo-Reissner beam method for moored floating body dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel finite volume mooring line model based on the geometrically exact Simo-Reissner beam model for analysing the interaction between a floating rigid body and its mooring lines. The coupled numerical model is implemented entirely within a finite volume-based discretisation framework using a popular computational fluid dynamics C++ toolbox, OpenFOAM. Unlike existing methods for modelling mooring lines, which rely on lumped mass models or finite element-based approaches, this work simulates the mooring cables using non-linear beam models implemented in a finite volume framework to account for bending, tensile, and torsional loading. This advancement makes the current work particularly valuable for simulating extreme sea conditions. The coupled model developed in this study has been validated and verified using experimental and numerical data for a floating box moored with four catenary mooring lines under regular wave conditions featuring different wave heights and periods. The results demonstrate strong agreement with both experimental and numerical data, highlighting the model's accuracy in capturing mooring dynamics and floating body motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09857v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces the High-Order Hermite Optimization (HOHO) method, an open-loop discrete adjoint method for quantum optimal control. Our method is the first of its kind to efficiently compute exact (discrete) gradients when using continuous, parameterized control pulses while solving the forward equations (e.g. Schrodinger's equation or the Linblad master equation) with an arbitrarily high-order Hermite Runge-Kutta method. The HOHO method is implemented in QuantumGateDesign$.$jl (https://github.com/leespen1/QuantumGateDesign.jl), an open-source software package for the Julia programming language, which we use to perform numerical experiments comparing the method to Juqbox$.$jl (https://github.com/LLNL/Juqbox.jl). For realistic model problems we observe speedups up to 775x.</description>

      <title>Refinement of the theory and convergence of the Sinc convolution -- beyond Stenger's conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12406v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sinc convolution is an approximate formula for indefinite convolutions proposed by Stenger. The formula was derived based on the Sinc indefinite integration formula combined with the single-exponential transformation. Although its efficiency has been confirmed in various fields, several theoretical issues remain unresolved. The first contribution of this study is to resolve those issues by refining the underlying theory of the Sinc convolution. This contribution includes an essential resolution of Stenger's conjecture. The second contribution of this study is to improve the convergence rate by replacing the single-exponential transformation with the double-exponential transformation. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments confirm that the modified formula achieves superior convergence compared to Stenger's original formula.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for multi-material elasticity problems in electronic packaging</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.16999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for analyzing elasticity problems in multi-material electronic packaging structures. The method replaces traditional Multi-Layer Perceptrons with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks within an energy-based Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. By constructing admissible displacement fields satisfying essential boundary conditions and optimizing network parameters through numerical integration, the proposed method effectively handles material property discontinuities. Unlike traditional methods that require domain decomposition and interface constraints for multi-material problems, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks' trainable B-spline activation functions provide inherent piecewise characteristics. This capability stems from B-splines' local support, which enables effective approximation of discontinuities despite their individual smoothness. Consequently, this approach enables accurate approximation across the entire domain using a single network and simplifying the computational framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves excellent accuracy and robustness in multi-material elasticity problems, validating its practical potential for electronic packaging analysis.

      <description>arXiv:2509.08645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider parabolic evolution equations with Lipschitz continuous and strongly monotone spatial operators. By introducing an additional variable, we construct an equivalent system where the operator is a Lipschitz continuous mapping from a Hilbert space $Y \times X$ to its dual, with a Lipschitz continuous inverse. Resulting Galerkin discretizations can be solved with an inexact Uzawa type algorithm. Quasi-optimality of the Galerkin approximations is guaranteed under an inf-sup condition on the selected `test' and `trial' subspaces of $Y$ and $X$. To circumvent the restriction imposed by this inf-sup condition, an a posteriori condition for quasi-optimality is developed that is shown to be satisfied whenever the test space is sufficiently large.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23078v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A numerical framework is proposed for identifying partial differential equations (PDEs) governing dynamical systems directly from their observation data using Chebyshev polynomial approximation. In contrast to data-driven approaches such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), which approximate the Koopman operator without a clear connection to differential operators, the proposed method constructs finite-dimensional Koopman matrices by projecting the dynamics onto a Chebyshev basis, thereby capturing both differential and nonlinear terms. This establishes a numerical link between the Koopman and differential operators. Numerical experiments on benchmark dynamical systems confirm the accuracy and efficiency of the approach, underscoring its potential for interpretable operator learning. The framework also lays a foundation for future integration with symbolic regression, enabling the construction of explicit mathematical models directly from data.</description>

      <title>Exact Constraint Enforcement in Physics-Informed Extreme Learning Machines using Null-Space Projection Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.10999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed extreme learning machines (PIELMs) typically impose boundary and initial conditions through penalty terms, yielding only approximate satisfaction that is sensitive to user-specified weights and can propagate errors into the interior solution. This work introduces Null-Space Projected PIELM (NP-PIELM), achieving exact constraint enforcement through algebraic projection in coefficient space. The method exploits the geometric structure of the admissible coefficient manifold, recognizing that it admits a decomposition through the null space of the boundary operator. By characterizing this manifold via a translation-invariant representation and projecting onto the kernel component, optimization is restricted to constraint-preserving directions, transforming the constrained problem into unconstrained least-squares where boundary conditions are satisfied exactly at discrete collocation points. This eliminates penalty coefficients, dual variables, and problem-specific constructions while preserving single-shot training efficiency. Numerical experiments on elliptic and parabolic problems including complex geometries and mixed boundary conditions validate the framework.</description>

      <title>Constructing Orthogonal Rational Function Vectors with an application in Rational Approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two algorithms for constructing orthonormal bases of rational function vectors with respect to a discrete inner product, and discuss how to use them for a rational approximation problem. Building on the pencil-based formulation of the inverse generalized eigenvalue problem by Van Buggenhout et al. (2022), we extend it to rational vectors of arbitrary length $k$, where the recurrence relations are represented by a pair of $k$-Hessenberg matrices, i.e., matrices with possibly $k$ nonzero subdiagonals. An updating algorithm based on similarity transformations using rotations and a Krylov-type algorithm related to the rational Arnoldi method are derived. The performance is demonstrated on the rational approximation of $\sqrt{z}$ on $[0,1]$, where the optimal lightning + polynomial convergence rate of Herremans, Huybrechs, and Trefethen (2023) is successfully recovered. This illustrates the robustness of the proposed methods for handling exponentially clustered poles near singularities.</description>

      <title>Deeper or Wider: A Perspective from Optimal Generalization Error with Sobolev Loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00152v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Constructing the architecture of a neural network is a challenging pursuit for the machine learning community, and the dilemma of whether to go deeper or wider remains a persistent question. This paper explores a comparison between deeper neural networks (DeNNs) with a flexible number of layers and wider neural networks (WeNNs) with limited hidden layers, focusing on their optimal generalization error in Sobolev losses. Analytical investigations reveal that the architecture of a neural network can be significantly influenced by various factors, including the number of sample points, parameters within the neural networks, and the regularity of the loss function. Specifically, a higher number of parameters tends to favor WeNNs, while an increased number of sample points and greater regularity in the loss function lean towards the adoption of DeNNs. We ultimately apply this theory to address partial differential equations using deep Ritz and physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods, guiding the design of neural networks.</description>

      <title>Constructive proofs for some semilinear PDEs on $H^2(e^{|x|^2/4},\mathbb{R}^d)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop computer-assisted tools to study semilinear equations of the form \begin{equation*} -\Delta u -\frac{x}{2}\cdot \nabla{u}= f(x,u,\nabla u) ,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^d. \end{equation*} Such equations appear naturally in several contexts, and in particular when looking for self-similar solutions of parabolic PDEs. We develop a general methodology, allowing us not only to prove the existence of solutions, but also to describe them very precisely. We introduce a spectral approach based on an eigenbasis of $\mathcal{L}:= -\Delta -\frac{x}{2}\cdot \nabla$ in spherical coordinates, together with a quadrature rule allowing to deal with nonlinearities, in order to get accurate approximate solutions. We then use a Newton-Kantorovich argument, in an appropriate weighted Sobolev space, to prove the existence of a nearby exact solution. We apply our approach to nonlinear heat equations, to nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations and to a generalised viscous Burgers equation, and obtain both radial and non-radial self-similar profiles.</description>

      <title>Fast-forwarding quantum algorithms for linear dissipative differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish improved complexity estimates of quantum algorithms for linear dissipative ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and show that the time dependence can be fast-forwarded to be sub-linear. Specifically, we show that a quantum algorithm based on truncated Dyson series can prepare history states of dissipative ODEs up to time $T$ with cost $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log(T) (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, which is an exponential speedup over the best previous result. For final state preparation at time $T$, we show that its complexity is $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T} (\log(1/\epsilon))^2 )$, achieving a polynomial speedup in $T$. We also analyze the complexity of simpler lower-order quantum algorithms, such as the forward Euler method and the trapezoidal rule, and find that even lower-order methods can still achieve $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ cost with respect to time $T$ for preparing final states of dissipative ODEs. As applications, we show that quantum algorithms can simulate dissipative non-Hermitian quantum dynamics and heat processes with fast-forwarded complexity sub-linear in time.</description>

      <title>A Novel Approach to the Initial Value Problem with a complete validated algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00503v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the first order autonomous differential equation (ODE) ${\bf x}'={\bf f}({\bf x})$ where ${\bf f}: {\mathbb R}^n\to{\mathbb R}^n$ is locally Lipschitz. For ${\bf x}_0\in{\mathbb R}^n$ and $h&gt;0$, the initial value problem (IVP) for $({\bf f},{\bf x}_0,h)$ is to determine if there is a unique solution, i.e., a function ${\bf x}:[0,h]\to{\mathbb R}^n$ that satisfies the ODE with ${\bf x}(0)={\bf x}_0$. Write ${\bf x} ={\tt IVP}_{\bf f}({\bf x}_0,h)$ for this unique solution.
  We pose a corresponding computational problem, called the End Enclosure Problem: given $({\bf f},B_0,h,\varepsilon_0)$ where $B_0\subseteq{\mathbb R}^n$ is a box and $\varepsilon_0&gt;0$, to compute a pair of non-empty boxes $(\underline{B}_0,B_1)$ such that $\underline{B}_0\subseteq B_0$, width of $B_1$ is $&lt;\varepsilon_0$, and for all ${\bf x}_0\in \underline{B}_0$, ${\bf x}={\tt IVP}_{\bf f}({\bf x}_0,h)$ exists and ${\bf x}(h)\in B_1$. We provide a complete validated algorithm for this problem. Under the assumption (promise) that for all ${\bf x}_0\in B_0$, ${\tt IVP}_{\bf f}({\bf x}_0,h)$ exists, we prove the halting of our algorithm. This is the first halting algorithm for IVP problems in such a general setting.
  We also introduce novel techniques for subroutines such as StepA and StepB, and a scaffold datastructure to support our End Enclosure algorithm. Among the techniques are new ways refine full- and end-enclosures based on a {\bf radical transform} combined with logarithm norms. Our preliminary implementation and experiments show considerable promise, and compare well with current validated algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22553v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1996, Meshulam proved that every sequence generated by applying projections onto affine subspaces, drawn from a finite collection in Euclidean space, must be bounded.
  In this paper, we extend his result not only from affine subspaces to convex polyhedral subsets, but also from Euclidean to general Hilbert space. Various examples are provided to illustrate the sharpness of the results.</description>

      <title>Efficient Parametric SVD of Koopman Operator for Stochastic Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a principled framework for analyzing nonlinear dynamical systems through linear operator theory. Recent advances in dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) have shown that trajectory data can be used to identify dominant modes of a system in a data-driven manner. Building on this idea, deep learning methods such as VAMPnet and DPNet have been proposed to learn the leading singular subspaces of the Koopman operator. However, these methods require backpropagation through potentially numerically unstable operations on empirical second moment matrices, such as singular value decomposition and matrix inversion, during objective computation, which can introduce biased gradient estimates and hinder scalability to large systems. In this work, we propose a scalable and conceptually simple method for learning the top-$k$ singular functions of the Koopman operator for stochastic dynamical systems based on the idea of low-rank approximation. Our approach eliminates the need for unstable linear-algebraic operations and integrates easily into modern deep learning pipelines. Empirical results demonstrate that the learned singular subspaces are both reliable and effective for downstream tasks such as eigen-analysis and multi-step prediction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04444v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose new randomized algorithms for estimating the two-to-infinity and one-to-two norms in a matrix-free setting, using only matrix-vector multiplications. Our methods are based on appropriate modifications of Hutchinson's diagonal estimator and its Hutch++ version. We provide oracle complexity bounds for both modifications. We further illustrate the practical utility of our algorithms for Jacobian-based regularization in deep neural network training on image classification tasks. We also demonstrate that our methodology can be applied to mitigate the effect of adversarial attacks in the domain of recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Constitutive Model Discovery from Sparse and Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13559v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, unsupervised constitutive model discovery has gained attention through frameworks based on the Virtual Fields Method (VFM), most prominently the EUCLID approach. However, the performance of VFM-based approaches, including EUCLID, is affected by measurement noise and data sparsity, which are unavoidable in practice. The statistical finite element method (statFEM) offers a complementary perspective by providing a Bayesian framework for assimilating noisy and sparse measurements to reconstruct the full-field displacement response, together with quantified uncertainty. While statFEM recovers displacement fields under uncertainty, it does not strictly enforce consistency with constitutive relations. In this work, we integrate statFEM with unsupervised constitutive model discovery in the EUCLID framework, yielding statFEM-EUCLID. The framework is demonstrated for isotropic hyperelastic materials. The results show that this integration reduces sensitivity to noise and data sparsity, while ensuring that the reconstructed fields remain consistent with both equilibrium and constitutive laws.</description>

      <title>The Geometry of the Pivot: A Note on Lazy Pivoted Cholesky and Farthest Point Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03706v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Discrete versus continuous -- lattice models and their exact continuous counterparts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We review and study the correspondence between discrete lattice/chain models of interacting particles and their continuous counterparts represented by partial differential equations. We study the correspondence problem for nearest neighbour interaction lattice models as well as for multiple-neighbour interaction lattice models, and we gradually proceed from infinite lattices to periodic lattices and finally to finite lattices with fixed ends/zero Dirichlet boundary conditions. The whole study is framed as systematic specialisation of Fourier analysis tools from the continuous to the discrete setting and vice versa, and the correspondence between the discrete and continuous models is examined primarily with regard to the dispersion relation.</description>

      <title>Jordan-Segmentable Masks: A Topology-Aware definition for characterizing Binary Image Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Image segmentation plays a central role in computer vision. However, widely used evaluation metrics, whether pixel-wise, region-based, or boundary-focused, often struggle to capture the structural and topological coherence of a segmentation. In many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging or object delineation, small inaccuracies in boundary, holes, or fragmented predictions can result in high metric scores, despite the fact that the resulting masks fail to preserve the object global shape or connectivity. This highlights a limitation of conventional metrics: they are unable to assess whether a predicted segmentation partitions the image into meaningful interior and exterior regions.
  In this work, we introduce a topology-aware notion of segmentation based on the Jordan Curve Theorem, and adapted for use in digital planes. We define the concept of a \emph{Jordan-segmentatable mask}, which is a binary segmentation whose structure ensures a topological separation of the image domain into two connected components. We analyze segmentation masks through the lens of digital topology and homology theory, extracting a $4$-curve candidate from the mask, verifying its topological validity using Betti numbers. A mask is considered Jordan-segmentatable when this candidate forms a digital 4-curve with $\beta_0 = \beta_1 = 1$, or equivalently when its complement splits into exactly two $8$-connected components.
  This framework provides a mathematically rigorous, unsupervised criterion with which to assess the structural coherence of segmentation masks. By combining digital Jordan theory and homological invariants, our approach provides a valuable alternative to standard evaluation metrics, especially in applications where topological correctness must be preserved.</description>
