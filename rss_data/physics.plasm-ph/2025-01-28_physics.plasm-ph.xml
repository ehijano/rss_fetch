      <title>Similarity for downscaled kinetic simulations of electrostatic plasmas: reconciling the large system size with small Debye length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A simple similarity has been proposed for kinetic (e.g., particle-in-cell) simulations of plasma transport that can effectively address the longstanding challenge of reconciling the tiny Debye length with the vast system size. This applies to both transport in unmagnetized plasma and parallel transport in magnetized plasmas, where the characteristics length scales are given by the Debye length, collisional mean free paths, and the system or gradient lengths. The controlled scaled variables are the configuration space, $\mathbf{x}/\mathscr{L},$ and an artificial Coulomb Logarithm, $\mathscr{L}\ln \Lambda,$ for collisions, while the scaled time, $t/\mathscr{L}$, and electric field, $\mathscr{L}\mathbf{E}$, are automatic outcomes. The similarity properties are examined, demonstrating that the macroscopic transport physics is preserved through a similarity transformation while keeping the microscopic physics at its original scale of Debye length. To showcase the utility of this approach, two examples of 1D plasma transport problems were simulated using the VPIC code: the plasma thermal quench in tokamaks [J. Li, et al., Nuclear Fusion \textbf{63}, 066030 (2023)] and the plasma sheath in the high-recycling regime [Y. Li, et al., Physics of Plasmas \textbf{30}, 063505 (2023)].</description>

      <title>Drift-kinetic PIC simulations of plasma flow and energy transport in the magnetic mirror configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma flow and acceleration in a magnetic mirror configuration are studied using a drift-kinetic particles-in-cell model in the paraxial approximation, with an emphasis on finite temperature effects and energy transport. Energy conversion between electrons and ions, overall energy balance, and axial energy losses are investigated. The simulations of plasma flow, acceleration, and energy transport in the magnetic mirror are extended into the high-density regimes with implicit particle-in-cell simulations. It is shown that profiles of the anisotropic ion temperatures and heat fluxes obtained with the full drift-kinetic model compare favorably with the results of a fluid model, which includes collisionless ion heat fluxes beyond the two-pressure adiabatic equations. The effects of collisions on trapped electrons and the resulting impacts on electron temperature and electric field profiles are investigated using a model collision operator.</description>

      <title>Mode transitions and spoke structures in ExB Penning discharge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations in the (radial-azimuthal) plane perpendicular to the axial direction of a cylindrical ExB Penning discharge are presented. The low-pressure discharge is self-consistently supported by plasma ionization from the electron beam injected axially, along the direction of the external magnetic field. It is shown that with the increasing strength of the external magnetic field, the discharge undergoes a sequence of transitions between several azimuthal modes. Azimuthal m&gt;1 spiral arm structures are excited at low magnetic field values as plasma confinement improves and the radial density profile becomes peaked. With a larger field, spiral arms with m&gt;1 are replaced by the m=1 spoke mode, most clearly seen in plasma density. A transition from spiral arms to the spoke regime occurs when the plasma potential in the center changes from weakly positive (or zero) to negative. Further increase of the magnetic field results in a well-developed m=1 spoke mode with additional small-scale higher frequency m&gt;1 structures inside and around the spoke. It is shown that while ionization and collisions affect some characteristics of the observed fluctuations, the basic features of the spoke and m&gt;1 spiral structure remained similar without ionization. The role of energy conservation in small-scale high-frequency modes and spoke dynamics is discussed. It is demonstrated that in regimes with the m=1 spoke mode, additional m=4 harmonics of the ion and electron fluxes to the wall appear due to the square boundary. The frequency of the m=1 mode is weakly affected by the geometry of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear equation for drift waves gives both soliton and vortex solutions in limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A general nonlinear equation for drift waves has been derived using reductive perturbation method (RPM) which admits the solutions in the forms of Korteweg de-Vries (KdV) soliton and dipolar vortex in different limits. It has been found that the contribution of electrons nonlinear density term also appears in the Hasegawa-Mima equation [A. Hasegawa and K. Mima, The Physics of Fluids 21, 87 (1978)] if it is derived in stretched coordinates by employing RPM. The general nonlinear equation reduces to KdV equation [H. Saleem, Physics of Plasmas 31, 112102 (2024)] if the electrostatic potential is assumed to be the function of only one spatial coordinate along which the wave propagates predominantly. On the other hand, if the scalar nonlinear term is ignored, the equation reduces to the Hasegawa-Mima like equation in stretched coordinates. Therefore, it is concluded that the general nonlinear equation for drift waves contains both solitons and vortices.</description>

      <title>Ion Beam Instabilities during Solar Flare Energy Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The linear stability of waves driven by ion beams produced during solar flare energy release are explored to assess their role in driving abundance enhancements in minority species such as $^3$He and in controlling, through pitch-angle scattering, proton/alpha confinement during energy release. The Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS) is used to solve the linear dispersion relation for a population of energetic, reconnection-accelerated protons streaming into a cold background plasma. We assume equal densities of the two populations, using an anisotropic ($T_\parallel/T_\perp = 10$), one-sided kappa distribution for the energetic streaming population and a cold Maxwellian for the background. We find two unstable modes with parallel propagation: a right-handed wave with a frequency of the order of the proton cyclotron frequency ($\Omega_{cp}$) and a left-handed, lower frequency mode. We also find highly oblique modes with frequencies below $\Omega_{cp}$ that are unstable for higher beam energies. Through resonant interactions, all three modes will contribute to the scattering of the high-energy protons, thereby limiting their transport out of the flare-acceleration region. The higher-frequency oblique mode, which can be characterized as a kinetic Alfv\'en wave, will preferentially heat $^3$He, making it a good candidate for the driver of the abundance enhancements commonly observed for this species in impulsive events.</description>

      <title>Global Heliospheric Termination Shock Strength in the Solar-Interstellar Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A heliospheric termination shock (HTS) surrounds our solar system at approximately 100 astronomical units from the Sun, where the expanding solar wind (SW) is compressed and heated before encountering the interstellar medium. HTS-accelerated particles govern the pressure balance with the interstellar medium, but little is known about the HTS's global properties beyond in situ measurements from Voyager in only two directions of the sky. We fill this gap in knowledge with a novel and complex methodology: particle-in-cell, test particle, and MHD simulations, combined with a global minimization scheme to derive global HTS compression ratio sky maps. The methods utilize Interstellar Boundary Explorer observations of energetic neutral atoms produced from HTS-accelerated particles. Our results reveal unique, three-dimensional characteristics, such as higher compression near the poles during solar minimum, north-south asymmetries from the disparate polar coronal holes' evolution, and minimum compression near the flanks likely from SW slowing by mass-loading over a greater distance to the HTS.</description>

      <title>NAS-PINNv2: Improved neural architecture search framework for physics-informed neural networks in low-temperature plasma simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited by the operation and measurement conditions, numerical simulation is often the only feasible approach for studying plasma behavior and mechanisms. Although artificial intelligence methods, especially physics-informed neural network (PINN), have been widely applied in plasma simulation, the design of the neural network structures still largely relies on the experience of researchers. Meanwhile, existing neural architecture search methods tailored for PINN have encountered failures when dealing with complex plasma governing equations characterized by variable coefficients and strong nonlinearity. Therefore, we propose an improved neural architecture search-guided method, namely NAS-PINNv2, to address the limitations of existing methods. By analyzing the causes of failure, the sigmoid function is applied to calculate the architecture-related weights, and a new loss term is introduced. The performance of NAS-PINNv2 is verified in several numerical experiments including the Elenbaas-Heller equation without and with radial velocity, the drift-diffusion-Poisson equation and the Boltzmann equation. The results again emphasize that larger neural networks do not necessarily perform better, and the discovered neural architecture with multiple neuron numbers in a single hidden layer imply a more flexible and sophisticated design rule for fully connected networks.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic Separable Solutions of Force-Free Magnetic Fields in Plane-Parallel and Axial Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15232v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a systematic method for identifying analytical and semi-analytical solutions of force-free magnetic fields with plane-parallel and axial symmetry. The method of separation of variables is used, allowing the transformation of the non-linear partial differential equation, corresponding to force-free magnetic fields, to a system of decoupled ordinary differential equations, which nevertheless, are in general non-linear. It is then shown that such solutions are feasible for configurations where the electric current has a logarithmic dependence to the magnetic field flux. The properties of the magnetic fields are studied for a variety of physical parameters, through solution of the systems of the ordinary differential equations for various values of the parameters. It is demonstrated that this new logarithmic family of solutions has properties that are highly distinct from the known linear and non-linear equations, as it allows for bounded solutions of magnetic fields, for periodic solutions and for solutions that extend to infinity. Possible applications to astrophysical fields and plasmas are discussed as well as their use in numerical studies, and the overall enrichment of our understanding of force-free configurations.</description>

      <title>Numerical Study of Solar Eruption, EUV Wave Propagation, and Wave-Induced Prominence Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) waves, frequently produced by eruptions, propagate through the non-uniform magnetic field of the solar corona and interact with distant prominences, inducing their global oscillations. However, the generation, propagation, and interaction of these waves with distant prominences remain poorly understood. We aim to study the influence of an eruptive flux rope (EFR) on a distant prominence by means of extreme-resolution numerical simulations. We cover a domain of horizontal extent of 1100 Mm while capturing details down to 130 km using automated grid refinement. We performed a 2.5D numerical experiment using the open-source MPI-AMRVAC 3.1 code, modeling an eruption as a 2.5D catastrophe scenario augmented with a distant dipole magnetic field to form the flux rope prominence. Our findings reveal that the EFR becomes unstable and generates a quasicircular front. The primary front produces a slow secondary front when crossing equipartition lines where the Alfv\'en speed is close to the sound speed. The resulting fast and slow EUV waves show different behaviors, with the fast EUV wave slightly decelerating as it propagates through the corona, while the slow EUV wave forms a stationary front. The fast EUV wave interacts with the remote prominence, driving both transverse and longitudinal oscillations. Additionally, magnetic reconnection at a null point below the prominence flux rope is triggered by the fast EUV wave, affecting the flux rope magnetic field and the prominence oscillations. Our study unifies important results of the dynamics of eruptive events and their interactions with distant prominences, including details of (oscillatory) reconnection and chaotic plasmoid dynamics. We demonstrate for the first time the full consequences of remote eruptions on prominence dynamics and clarify the damping mechanisms of prominence oscillations.</description>

      <title>Icarus 3.0: Dynamic Heliosphere Modelling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space weather predictions are necessary to avoid damage caused by intense geomagnetic storms. Such strong storms are usually caused by a co-rotating interaction region (CIR) passing at Earth or by the arrival of strong coronal mass ejections (CMEs). To mitigate the damage, the effect of propagating CMEs in the solar wind must be estimated accurately at Earth and other locations. Modelling solar wind accurately is crucial for space weather predictions, as it is the medium for CME propagation. The Icarus heliospheric modelling tool is upgraded to handle dynamic inner heliospheric driving instead of using steady boundary conditions. The ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) solver and the automated grid-adaptivity are adjusted to the latest MPI-AMRVAC version. The inner boundary conditions, prescribed at 0.1 AU for the heliospheric model, are updated time-dependently throughout the simulation. The coronal model is computed repeatedly for selected magnetograms. The particle sampling within MPI-AMRVAC is extended to handle stretched spherical grid information. The solar wind obtained in the simulation is dynamic and shows significant variations throughout the evolution. When comparing the results with the observations, the dynamic solar wind results are more accurate than previous results obtained with purely steady boundary driving. The CMEs propagated through the dynamic solar wind background produce more similar signatures in the time-series data than in the steady solar wind. Dynamic boundary driving in Icarus results in a more self-consistent solar wind evolution in the inner heliosphere. The obtained space weather modelling tool for dynamic solar wind and CME simulations is better suited for space weather forecasting than a steady solar wind model.</description>

      <title>Charge separation by standing waves of strongly focused single-cycle terahertz pulses for particle acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16019v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron and ion acceleration in laser beam driven gas and solid-state plasmas are well-known and thoroughly investigated. Here we propose and numerically investigate an ion acceleration scheme using the Coulomb explosion of ion bunches created by separating electron and ion bunches from gas plasma by the standing wave of counter-propagating THz/laser pulse pair(s). The low density and the supposed only few-cycle long THz/laser pulses ensure that much less complicated mechanisms play a role in the separation and acceleration processes, resulting in more predictable outcomes than for single-laser-beam-driven solid-state plasmas. The charge separation is investigated using the EPOCH PIC code. After the charge separation, the ion dynamics ar followed by the GPT code. Calculations predict the generation of relativistic electron bunches and ion bunches with sub-MeV average energy, and with distribution suitable for very efficient use of the accelerated ions in ultrashort-pulse neutron sources.</description>

      <title>Force Fields for Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Charged Dust Particles with Finite Size in Complex Plasmas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.17782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To exclude collisions leading to the overlap of finite-sized charged particles in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in systems like complex (dusty) plasmas, we developed a scheme to generate a pair interaction force functionally depending on the pair distribution of particles. This ensures that the pair distribution function drops to zero at distances between particles corresponding to the point where the surfaces of two particles come into contact. The presented model has a wide utility for the description of various processes in dusty plasmas. As an example, using the non-equilibrium MD method, we performed calculations of the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity of charged spherical particles interacting via screened Yukawa potential. The role of finite particle size was found to be particularly important for small values of the coupling parameter, i.e., for gas-like and weakly correlated liquid-like systems. Furthermore, we have analyzed the shear viscosity and thermal conductivity in the presence of an external uniform magnetic field.</description>

      <title>A transformational approach to collective behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08558v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a revolutionary approach to the characterization, forecast, and control of collective systems. Collective systems are an ensemble of conservatively interacting entities. The evolution of the entities are determined by symmetries of the entities. Collective systems take many different forms. A plasma is a collective of charged particles, a fluid is a collective of molecules, a elementary field is a collective of elementary particles, and a cosmos is a collective of celestial bodies. Our new theory builds on the canonical transformation approach to dynamics. This approach recognizes that the symmetry leads to the conservation of a real function, that is the infinitesimal generator of a Lie group. The finite generator of the canonical transformation is derived from the infinitesimal generator by the solution of the Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This generating function is also known as the action, the entropy, and the logarithmic likelihood. The new theory generalizes this generating function to the generating functional of the collective field. Finally, this paper derives the formula for the Mayer Cluster Expansion, or the S-matrix expansion of the generating functional. We call it the Heisenberg Scattering Transformation (HST). Practically, this is a localized Fourier Transformation, whose principal components give the singularity spectrums, that is the solution to the Renormalization Group Equations. Limitations on the measurement of the system (that is the Born Rule and the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle) lead to quantization of the stochastic probabilities of the collective field. How different collective systems couple together to form systems-of-systems is formalized. The details of a practical implementation of the HST will be presented.</description>

Abstract: A new axisymmetric equilibrium solver has been written, called FEQIS (Flexible EQuIlibrium Solver), which purpose is to be used inside integrated modeling of tokamak plasmas. The FEQIS code solves the Grad-Shafranov equation and the "circuit" equations for the external coils and passive conducting structures that are toroidally connected. The code has been specifically equipped with flexibility in choice of circuit connections, and a stripped-down numerical scheme for the solution of the Grad-Shafranov equation through a structure of multi-level simplifications which can be tested against the required accuracy.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates a novel method for estimating two-dimensional velocities using coarse-grained imaging data, which is particularly relevant for applications in plasma diagnostics. The method utilizes measurements from three non-collinear points and is derived from a stochastic model that describes the propagation of uncorrelated pulses through two-dimensional space. We demonstrate that the method provides exact time delay estimates when applied to a superposition of Gaussian structures and remains accurate for various other pulse functions. Through extensive numerical simulations, we evaluate the method's performance under variations in signal duration, pulse overlap, spatial and temporal resolution, and the presence of additive noise. Additionally, we investigate the impact of temporal pulse evolution due to linear damping and explore the so-called barberpole effect, which occurs with elongated and tilted structures. Although the method is susceptible to the barberpole effect, we analytically demonstrate that this effect does not occur when the elongated structures propagate parallel to one of their axes, and we establish bounds for the associated errors. We propose a series of safeguards to anticipate the applicability of the velocity estimation method, considering factors such as signal length, number of pulses, temporal and spatial resolution, signal-to-noise ratio, and pulse size. However, these safeguards do not ensure applicability in cases involving the barberpole effect or correlations between amplitudes and velocities. Overall, our findings provide a comprehensive and robust framework for accurate two-dimensional velocity estimation, enhancing the capabilities of fusion plasma diagnostics and potentially benefiting other fields requiring precise motion analysis.</description>

      <title>All-optical compact setup for generation of collimated multi-MeV proton beams with a "snail" target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17302</link>

Abstract: The work considers an optical scheme for collimation of high-energy proton beams using $\sim 10^5$~T scale magnetic fields induced in a miniature "snail" target by petawatt or multi-petawatt laser irradiation in ps or fs regime. Such magnetic fields are known to be frozen into hot plasma and exist on at least a hundred of picoseconds time-scale, allowing their use for control of charged particle beams. The high values of the magnetic field along with the compact size perfectly match conditions for an all-in-one optical setup, where first, the laser beam accelerates protons, by, e.g. Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, and second, the closely positioned snail target is driven to guide the proton beam. An important issue is that the laser drivers for both proton acceleration schemes and the magnetic field generation in the considered targets may have the same properties, and even be parts of one splitted beam. Numerical simulations show that the considered setup can be used for efficient collimation of $\simeq 100$~MeV protons. The collimation effect weakly depends on the fine magnetic field structure and can be observed both for a simple magneto-dipole field profile and for a more complex coaxial-like profiles accounting for the intricate structure of electric currents in the interaction region. The obtained results are interesting for the development of intense laser-driven sources of charged particle beams with low divergence and high energy of accelerated particles.</description>
