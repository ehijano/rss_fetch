      <title>Squares K-theory and 2-Segal spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an $S_\bullet$-construction for squares categories, and introduce a class of squares categories we call "proto-Waldhausen" which capture the properties required for the $S_\bullet$-construction to model the K-theory space. The primary question we investigate is when the $S_\bullet$-construction of a squares category produces a 2-Segal space. We show that the answer to this question is affirmative when the squares category satisfies certain "stability" conditions. In an appendix, we discuss a version of Waldhausen's additivity theorem for squares K-theory.</description>

      <title>Twisted Roe algebras and $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of twisted Roe algebras and a twisted coarse Baum-Connes conjecture. We study the basic properties of twisted Roe algebras, including a coarse analogue of the imprimitivity theorem for metric spaces with a structure of coarse fibrations. We show that the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a metric space with a coarse fibration structure when the base space and the fiber satisfy the twisted coarse Baum-Connes conjecture with coefficients. As an application, the coarse Baum-Connes conjecture holds for a finitely generated group which is an extension of coarsely embeddable groups.</description>

      <title>Complex K-theory of 4-complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note summarizes a number of facts about the ring $K^0(X)$ for $X$ a $4$-dimensional CW-complex. Unusual features of this dimension are that every complex vector bundle is determined up to stable isomorphism by its Chern classes, that every even cohomology class arises as a Chern class of a vector bundle, and that $K^0(X)$ is completely determined as a ring by knowledge of the even-dimensional cohomology ring $H^{\text{even}}(X; \mathbb Z)$. (All of these fail in high dimensions.)</description>

      <title>Derived hyperquot schemes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a derived enhancement of the hyperquot scheme (also known as nested Quot scheme), which classically parametrises flags of quotients of a perfect coherent sheaf on a projective scheme. We prove it is representable by a derived scheme, and we compute its global tangent complex. As an application, we provide a natural obstruction theory on the classical hyperquot scheme. The latter recovers the virtual fundamental class recently constructed by the first and third author in the context of the enumerative geometry of hyperquot schemes on smooth projective curves.</description>

      <title>The geometric diagonal of the special linear algebraic cobordism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The motivic version of the $c_1$-spherical cobordism spectrum is constructed. A connection of this spectrum with other motivic Thom spectra is established. Using this connection, we compute the $\mathbb{P}^1$-diagonal of the homotopy groups of the special linear algebraic cobordism $\pi_{2*,*}(\mathrm{MSL})$ over a local Dedekind domain $k$ with $1/2\in k$ after inverting the exponential characteristic of the residue field of $k$. We discuss the action of the motivic Hopf element $\eta$ on this ring, obtain a description of the localization away from $2$ and compute the $2$-primary torsion subgroup. The complete answer is given in terms of the special unitary cobordism ring. An important component of the computation is the construction of Pontryagin characteristic numbers with values in the Hermitian K-theory. We also construct Chern numbers in this setting, prove the motivic version of the Anderson-Brown-Peterson theorem and briefly discuss classes of Calabi-Yau varieties in the $\mathrm{SL}$-cobordism ring.</description>

      <title>Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology in the context of curved algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14309v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology of an algebra with coefficients in a module is defined by deriving a functor based on K\"ahler differential forms. It can be computed using a cofibrant resolution of the algebra in a model category structure where weak equivalences are quasi-isomorphisms. This construction works for algebras over an operad, providing a cohomology theory tailored for each type of algebra. For curved algebras however, the notion of quasi-isomorphism is meaningless. The occurrence and importance of curved structures in various research topics (symplectic topology, deformation theory, derived geometry, mathematical physics) motivate the development of their homotopy theory and Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology theory. To get a homotopical context with an appropriate notion of weak equivalence, we consider filtered complete modules with a predifferential inducing a differential on the associated graded. Curved algebras in such modules are algebras over a curved operad. In this article, we consider curved operads which are not necessarily augmented. Bar and cobar constructions adapted to these curved operads are developed, as well as Koszul duality theory. Consequently, we obtain homotopy versions of our curved algebras and make it explicit for interesting cases. Two main examples are the curved operads encoding curved unital associative algebras and curved complex Lie algebras. In particular, homotopy curved unital associative algebras describe the structure of Floer complexes of lagrangian submanifolds and Fukaya categories in symplectic topology. Bar and cobar constructions for curved algebras are also developed, and we obtain resolutions from which we compute their Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology with module coefficients. Our computations in the case of curved complex Lie algebras reveal an interesting link between their Andr\'e-Quillen cohomology and derived complex analytic geometry.</description>
