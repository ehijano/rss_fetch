      <title>Causality constraints on radiative transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard formula, due to Spiegel, for the smoothing of temperature fluctuations by radiative transfer is unstable in relativity. This is due to the fact that Spiegel neglected the transit time of light, thereby allowing the transport coefficients to move outside the convex geometry compatible with causality (the "hydrohedron"). Here, we fix this pathology. First, we prove that the linearized radiative transfer equations are causal and covariantly stable by construction. Then, we repeat Spiegel's calculation accounting for the finite speed of photons. We find that the full transfer problem can be solved analytically. All the infinite (exact) transport coefficients arising from it fall inside the hydrohedron. Our analysis also accounts for isotropic scattering.</description>

      <title>Bose-Einstein condensation of five $\alpha$ clusters in $^{20}$Ne and supersolidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the five $\alpha$ cluster states recently observed in $^{20}$Ne, slightly above the five $\alpha$ threshold energy, are Bose-Einstein condensates of five $\alpha$ clusters. The states are described well using a superfluid cluster model, where the order parameter is defined. We suggest that the the five $\alpha$ states are fragmented. Theory predicts the emergence of a five $\alpha$ rotational roton band characterized by a large moment of inertia. This band is formed through roton excitations of the five $\alpha$ BEC vacuum and possesses dual properties of superfluidity and crystallinity, a property of supersolidity. The persistent existence of such a roton bandis discussed and confirmed for the four $\alpha$ condensate above the four $\alpha$ threshold in $^{16}$O and the three $\alpha$ condensate above the three $\alpha$ threshold in $^{12}$C.</description>

      <title>Quarkonium Spectroscopy in the Quark-Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of bound states are fundamental to hadronic spectroscopy and play a central role in the transition from hadronic matter to a quark-gluon plasma (QGP). In a strongly coupled QGP (sQGP), the interplay of temperature, binding energy and large collisional widths of the partons poses formidable challenges in evaluating the in-medium properties of hadronic states and their eventual melting. In particular, the existence of heavy quarkonia in the QGP is a long-standing problem that is hard to solve by considering their spectral properties on the real-energy axis. We address this problem by analyzing in-medium thermodynamic quarkonium $T$-matrices in the complex energy plane. We first validate this method in vacuum, where the $T$-matrix poles of observed states are readily identified. When deploying this approach to recent self-consistently calculated $T$-matrices in the QGP, we find that poles in the complex energy plane can persist to surprisingly large temperatures, depending on the strength of the in-medium interactions. While the masses and widths of the pole positions are precisely defined, the notion of a binding energy is not due to the absence of thresholds caused by the (large) widths of the underlying anti-/quark spectral functions. Our method thus provides a new and rigorous quantum-mechanical criterion to determine the melting temperature of hadronic states in the sQGP while increasing the accuracy in the theoretical determination of transport parameters.</description>

      <title>Low-energy spectra of nobelium isotopes: Skyrme random-phase-approximation analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy spectra in the isotopic chain $^{250-262}$No are systematically investigated within the fully self-consistent Quasiparticle Random-Phase-Approximation (QRPA) using Skyrme forces SLy6, SkM* and SVbas. QRPA states of multipolarity $\lambda\mu$=20, 22, 30, 31, 32, 33, 43, 44 and 98 are considered. The main attention is paid to isotopes $^{252}$No and $^{254}$No, for which the most extensive experimental spectroscopic information is available. In these two nuclei, a reasonable description of $K^{\pi}=8^-, 2^-$and $3^+$ isomers is obtained with the force SLy6. The disputed $8^-$ isomer in $^{254}$No is assigned as neutron two-quasiparticle configuration $nn[734\uparrow,613\uparrow]$. At the energies 1.2 - 1.4 MeV, the 2qp K-isomers $4^-, 7^-$ in $^{252}$No and $4^-, 6^-, 7^-$ in $^{254}$No are predicted. In $^{254}$No, the $K^{\pi}=3^+$ isomer should be accompanied by the nearby $K^{\pi}=4^+$ counterpart. It is shown that, in the chain $^{250-262}$No, some features of $^{252}$No and $^{254}$No exhibit essential irregularities caused by a shell gap in the neutron single-particle spectrum and corresponding breakdown of the neutron pairing. In particular, low-energy pairing-vibrational $K^{\pi}=0^+$ states in $^{252,254}$No are predicted.</description>

      <title>Source function from two-particle correlation function through entropy-regularized Richardson-Lucy deblurring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Source functions are obtained from $p$-$p$ and $d$--$\alpha$ correlation functions by applying the Richardson-Lucy (RL) deblurring to the Koonin-Pratt (KP) equation. To prevent fitting of noise in the correlation function, total-variation (TV) regularization is employed that has been effective in ordinary image restoration. TV alone cannot ensure normalization of the source functions. To ensure the latter, we propose a maximum-entropy regularized RL algorithm (MEM-RL). We outline the MEM-RL formalism and optimization strategy for the KP equation, demonstrating its effectiveness on both simulated and experimental data, including the $p$-$p$ and $d$-$\alpha$ correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Gauge Ambiguities for DUNE Precision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Forest prescription for handling off-shell initial states in the impulse approximation for lepton-nucleus scattering breaks gauge invariance. We discuss existing methods to address this problem and handle the form factor scale ambiguity. We demonstrate that the irreducible differences between the prescriptions are significant compared to the precision expected of next-generation accelerator neutrino experiments. A novel approach directly using the off-shell currents is proposed as a systematically improvable alternative.</description>

      <title>Internal color contributions to flux tube entanglement entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work arXiv:2410.00112, we introduced and computed entanglement entropy of the color flux tube (FTE$^2$) between a heavy quark-antiquark pair in (2+1)D Yang-Mills theory. Our numerical results suggest that FTE$^2$ can be partitioned into a component corresponding to transverse vibrations of the flux tube and an internal color entropy. Further, motivated by analytical (1+1)D calculations, and SU(2) (2+1)D Yang-Mills numerical results, we argued that the internal entropy takes the form $\langle F\rangle\log(N_c)$, with $\langle F\rangle$ the number of times, on average, that the flux tube crossed a boundary between region $V$ and its complement. We extend here our FTE$^2$ study to consider different geometries of region $V$, varying the number of boundary crossings, and number of colors. Our preliminary results support the conjectured form of the internal entropy, albeit with noteworthy subtleties relating to the partial/full intersections of the flux tube with the region $V$.</description>

      <title>PSR J1231-1411 revisited: Pulse Profile Analysis of X-ray Observation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the primary goals of Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER)-like X-ray missions is to impose stringent constraints on the neutron star equation of state by precisely measuring their masses and radii. NICER has recently expanded the dataset of inferred mass-radius relations for neutron stars, including four rotation-powered millisecond pulsars PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0437-4715, and PSR J1231-1411. In this work, the mass-radius relation and X-ray emitting region properties of PSR J1231-1411 are inferred with an independent pulse profile modeling based on the spherical star Schwarzschild-spacetime and Doppler approximation. With one single-temperature elongated hot spot and one single-temperature crescent hot spot, the inferred gravitational mass is $M = 1.12 \pm 0.07 M_{\odot}$ and the inferred equatorial radius is $R_{eq} = 9.91_{-0.86}^{+0.88}$ km (68% credible intervals). It provides an alternative geometry configuration of the X-ray emitting region for PSR J1231-1411 to sufficiently explain the observation data of NICER and XMM-Newton. The inferred radius is smaller than that derived by \citet{salmi2024nicer} ($M = 1.04_{-0.03}^{+0.05} M_{\odot}$, $R_{eq} = 12.6 \pm 0.3$ km), and the inferred mass is slightly higher in this work. The inferred geometry configurations of the X-ray emitting region in both works are non-antipodal, which is not consistent with a centered dipole magnetic field and suggests a complex magnetic field structure.</description>

      <title>PSR J0952-0607: Probing the Stiffest Equations of State and r-Mode Suppression Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze PSR J0952-0607, the most massive and fastest spinning neutron star observed to date, to refine constraints on the neutron star equation of state (EoS) and investigate its robustness against r-mode instabilities. With a mass of \( 2.35 \pm 0.17 \, M_{\odot} \) and a spin frequency of 709.2 Hz, PSR J0952-0607 provides a unique opportunity to examine the effects of rapid rotation on the structure of a neutron star. Using a Bayesian framework, we incorporate the rotationally corrected mass of PSR J0952-0607, alongside PSR J0740+6620's static mass measurement, to constrain the EoS. Our findings demonstrate that neglecting rotational effects leads to biases in the inferred EoS, while including the neutron star spin produces tighter constraints on pressure-density and mass-radius relations. Additionally, we explore the r-mode instability window for PSR J0952-0607 under the assumption of both rigid and elastic crust models and find that a rigid crust allows a higher stable temperature range, whereas an elastic crust places the star within the instability window under certain thermal insulation conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08385v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Investigating nucleon-nucleon correlations inherent to the strong nuclear force is one of the core goals in nuclear physics research. We showcase the unique opportunities offered by collisions of $^{16}$O nuclei at high-energy facilities to reveal detailed many-body properties of the nuclear ground state. We interface existing knowledge about the geometry of $^{16}$O coming from \textit{ab-initio} calculations of nuclear structure with transport simulations of high-energy $^{16}$O+$^{16}$O collisions. Bulk observables in these processes, such as the elliptic flow or the fluctuations of the mean transverse momentum, are found to depend significantly on the input nuclear model and to be sensitive to realistic clustering and short-range repulsive correlations, effectively opening a new avenue to probe these features experimentally. This finding demonstrates collisions of oxygen nuclei as a tool to elucidate initial conditions of small collision systems while fostering connections with effective field theories of nuclei rooted in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>Energy dependence of transverse momentum fluctuations in Au+Au collisions from a multiphase transport model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Event-by-event mean transverse momentum fluctuations ($\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$) serve as a sensitive probe of initial state overlap geometry and energy density fluctuations in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. We present a systematic investigation of $\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$ fluctuations in \auau collisions at $\mathrm{\sqrt{s_{NN}}} =$3.0-19.6 GeV, examining their centrality and energy dependence with the framework of an improved multiphase transport (AMPT) model. The centrality dependence of the $p_\mathrm{T}$ cumulants up to fourth order deviates significantly from simple powering-law scaling. Scaled cumulants are performed, with variances aligning well with the trends observed in the experimental data. Employing a two-subevent method, short-range correlations are slightly suppressed compared to the standard approach. Furthermore, baryons exhibit more pronounced $\langle p_\mathrm{T}\rangle$ fluctuations than mesons, potentially attributable to the effect of radial flow. These results provide referenced insights into the role of initial state fluctuations across different energies in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions at both Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider(LHC) energies, focusing on various \textit{ab-initio} models of oxygen structure. We identify that the correlator $V_{2\Delta}$ effectively differentiates between the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) structure and other models, such as Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM), revealing similar behaviors between the latter two. By utilizing the isolated non-spherical components, we highlight significant negative contributions in the structure generated by VMC compared to the other configurations. Additionally, we show that employing decorrelation $r_2$ to mitigate non-flow effects proves beneficial in identifying various modeled structures. We further examine flow decorrelations across different systems, including d+Au and O+O collisions at 200 GeV, as well as Ne+Ne and O+O collisions at 6.37 TeV, indicating a hierarchy in decorrelations that underscores the complexity of these interactions. Our findings emphasize that the role of asymmetry in d+Au collisions and its impact on flow correlations is mitigated by the correlator $V_{2\Delta} (\eta, \eta_{\text{ref}} )$. Additionally, our analysis of flow angle decorrelations shows diverse distributions of $\cos(2\Delta\psi_2)$ vs. overall flow magnitude in d+Au collisions compared to those in other collision systems, as indicated by the mean value of $\cos(2\Delta\psi_2)$.</description>

      <title>Directly probing existence of $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne by relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can relativistic heavy-ion collisions only probe the global shape of colliding nuclei, or their detailed internal structure as well? Taking $^{20}$Ne as an example, we attempt to directly probe its internal $\alpha$-cluster structure, by comparing experimentally measured observables in collisions at relativistic energies from density distributions of $^{20}$Ne with and without $\alpha$-cluster structure. Since the two density distributions give the same nucleus size and deformation, they lead to similar mid-rapidity observables. However, the $\alpha$-cluster structure may considerably reduce the free spectator nucleon yield and enhance the spectator light nuclei yield, as a result of more compact initial phase-space distribution of nucleons inside $\alpha$ clusters. We propose to measure the scaled yield ratio of free spectator neutrons to charged particles with mass-to-charge ratio $A/Z = 3$, 3/2, and 2 in ultra-central $^{20}$Ne+$^{20}$Ne collisions, which is found to be reduced by about $25\%$ at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 7$ TeV and about $20\%$ at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}} = 200$ GeV with $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne. This scaled yield ratio thus serves as a robust and direct probe of the existence of $\alpha$-cluster structure in $^{20}$Ne free from the uncertainty of mid-rapidity dynamics.</description>

Splitting the SU(\(N\)) gauge field into background and fluctuation parts, we use well-developed techniques to calculate the one-loop effective action for the theory. We find that for constant self-dual background field-strength tensor the notorious infrared divergences of the effective action cancel between gauge and matter sectors if the number of massless quark flavors is exactly . The ultraviolet divergencies of the effective action are non-perturbatively renormalized with a \b{eta}-function that matches the known perturbative result in the high energy limit. The resulting UV- and IR-finite effective action possesses a non-trivial saddle which has lower free energy than the perturbative vacuum, and for which the expectation value of the Polyakov loop vanishes. Inclusion of finite temperature effects points to the presence of a first-order phase transition to the perturbative vacuum with a calculable critical temperature.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Imaging of Pion using Lattice QCD: Generalized Parton Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03516</link>

Abstract: In this work, we report a lattice calculation of $x$-dependent valence pion generalized parton distributions (GPDs) at zero skewness with multiple values of the momentum transfer $-t$. The calculations are based on an $N_f=2+1$ gauge ensemble of highly improved staggered quarks with Wilson-Clover valence fermion. The lattice spacing is 0.04 fm, and the pion valence mass is tuned to be 300 MeV. We determine the Lorentz-invariant amplitudes of the quasi-GPD matrix elements for both symmetric and asymmetric momenta transfers with similar values and show the equivalence of both frames. Then, focusing on the asymmetric frame, we utilize a hybrid scheme to renormalize the quasi-GPD matrix elements obtained from the lattice calculations. After the Fourier transforms, the quasi-GPDs are then matched to the light-cone GPDs within the framework of large momentum effective theory with improved matching, including the next-to-next-to-leading order perturbative corrections, and leading renormalon and renormalization group resummations. We also present the 3-dimensional image of the pion in impact-parameter space through the Fourier transform of the momentum transfer $-t$.</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>

      <title>Second-order chiral kinetic theory from Wigner function approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic method to derive the chiral kinetic theory from the Wigner equations based on quantum field theory order by order. We take special effort to derive the chiral kinetic theory in seven-dimensional phase space from the eight-dimensional chiral kinetic theory. We give the seven-dimensional chiral kinetic theory up to second order of semiclassical expansion. We find some new second-order contributions compared with other approaches.</description>

      <title>Mixing mechanism for the $J^{P}=0^{+}$ mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18589v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There are three scalar nonets in the Particle Data Group (PDG), one of which includes [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$], another includes [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$], and the third includes [$a_0(1710), K_0^*(1950)$]. Motivated by Ref.[1], we examine an alternative mixing mechanism that could potentially explain the small mass difference between the $a_0 (1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$. According to the tetraquark mixing model, two types, distinguished by their color-spin structures, are necessary to describe the tetraquark structure of the two nonets containing [$a_0(980), K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430)$]. Considering the color-spin structures, we argue that the mixing mechanism generating $a_0(1450)$ and $K_0^* (1430)$ on the one hand, and $a_0(1710)$ and $K_0^* (1950)$ on the other hand might be relevant for resolving the small mass difference. We also discuss the limitations of other mixing mechanisms that generate the two nonets involving [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1450)$, $K_0^* (1430)$] or [$a_0(980),K_0^*(700)$] and [$a_0(1710)$, $K_0^* (1950)$]</description>
