      <title>WiLLM: An Open Wireless LLM Communication System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid evolution of LLMs threatens to overwhelm existing wireless infrastructure, necessitating architectural innovations for burgeoning mobile LLM services. This paper introduces WiLLM, the first open-source wireless system specifically designed for these services. First, we establish a new paradigm by deploying LLMs in core networks (CNs) with abundant GPUs. This enables distributed inference services, strategically positioning LLM inference at the convergence of backbone bandwidth and the cellular network's edge. Second, we propose an innovative "Tree-Branch-Fruit" extension to the conventional network slicing architecture. This specialized design allows telecom operators to monetize LLM services through slice subscriptions while maintaining infrastructure ownership. Finally, to realize this vision, WiLLM addresses critical limitations in current solutions with several novel capabilities. It features enhanced slice orchestration through a dual-layer slicing architecture, enabling coordinated multi-UE-multi-slice scheduling for finer-grained resource allocation. To ensure universal compatibility, an application-layer tunneling mechanism allows legacy devices without native slicing to access LLM slice services without hardware upgrades. Furthermore, its dual-mode scheduling and cross-layer APIs support flexible deployment from CNs to servers. Built on OpenAirInterface, WiLLM extends this established framework, lowering the adoption barrier for researchers. We also release the first LLM wireless communication dataset with 1,649,996 records and synchronized 58-dimensional metrics, alongside two benchmarks. A case study with smart glasses demonstrates practical viability for resource-constrained devices. WiLLM aims to foster an open platform for cross-layer optimization and AI-telecom convergence. The code, datasets, and hardware details are available at https://openwillm.github.io.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Evacuation Safety: Detecting Post-Nuclear Event Radiation Levels in an Urban Area</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detonation of an improvised nuclear device (IND) in an urban area would cause catastrophic damage, followed by hazardous radioactive fallout. Timely dissemination of radiation data is crucial for evacuation and casualty reduction. However, conventional communication infrastructure is likely to be severely disrupted. This study designs and builds a pseudorealistic, geospatially and temporally dynamic post-nuclear event (PNE) scenario using the Opportunistic Network Environment (ONE) simulator. It integrates radiation sensing by emergency responders, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and civilian devices as dynamic nodes within Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTNs). The performance of two DTN routing protocols, Epidemic and PRoPHET, was evaluated across multiple PNE phases. Both protocols achieve high message delivery rates, with PRoPHET exhibiting lower network overhead but higher latency. Findings demonstrate the potential of DTN-based solutions to support emergency response and evacuation safety by ensuring critical radiation data propagation despite severe infrastructure damage.</description>

      <title>A Study on E2E Performance Improvement of Platooning Using Outdoor LiFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platooning within autonomous vehicles has proven effective in addressing driver shortages and reducing fuel consumption. However, as platooning lengths increase, traditional C-V2X (cellular vehicle-to-everything) architectures are susceptible to end-to-end (E2E) latency increases. This is due to the necessity of relaying information through multiple hops from the leader vehicle to the last vehicle. To address this problem, this paper proposes a hybrid communication architecture based on a simulation that integrates light fidelity (LiFi) and C-V2X. The proposed architecture introduces multiple-leader vehicles equipped with outdoor LiFi communication nodes in platoons to achieve high-speed and low-delay communication between leader vehicles, which reduces E2E delay.</description>

      <title>Fractality of Wireless Mesh Networks: Dimensional Effects on Network Performance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) depend on the spatial distribution of nodes, which directly influences connectivity, routing efficiency, and overall network performance. Conventional models typically assume uniform or random node placement, which inadequately represent the complex, hierarchical spatial patterns observed in practical deployments. In this study, we present a novel algorithm that constructs WMN topologies with tunable fractal dimensions, allowing precise control over spatial self-similarity. By systematically varying the fractal dimension, the algorithm generates network layouts spanning a continuum of spatial complexities, ranging from sparse fragmented clusters to dense, cohesive structures. Through NS-3 simulations, Key performance metrics including throughput, latency, jitter, and packet delivery ratio were evaluated across a range of fractal dimensions. Comparative evaluations against classical random, small-world, and scale-free network models reveal that high-dimensional fractal topologies achieve enhanced resilience and throughput under equivalent conditions. These findings demonstrate the potential of fractal geometry as a design paradigm for scalable and efficient WMN architectures.</description>

      <title>CORMO-RAN: Lossless Migration of xApps in O-RAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open Radio Access Network (RAN) is a key paradigm to attain unprecedented flexibility of the RAN via disaggregation and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based applications called xApps. In dense areas with many active RAN nodes, compute resources are engineered to support potentially hundreds of xApps monitoring and controlling the RAN to achieve operator's intents. However, such resources might become underutilized during low-traffic periods, where most cells are sleeping and, given the reduced RAN complexity, only a few xApps are needed for its control. In this paper, we propose CORMO-RAN, a data-driven orchestrator that dynamically activates compute nodes based on xApp load to save energy, and performs lossless migration of xApps from nodes to be turned off to active ones while ensuring xApp availability during migration. CORMO-RAN tackles the trade-off among service availability, scalability, and energy consumption while (i) preserving xApps' internal state to prevent RAN performance degradation during migration; (ii) accounting for xApp diversity in state size and timing constraints; and (iii) implementing several migration strategies and providing guidelines on best strategies to use based on resource availability and requirements. We prototype CORMO-RAN as an rApp, and experimentally evaluate it on an O-RAN private 5G testbed hosted on a Red Hat OpenShift cluster with commercial radio units. Results demonstrate that CORMO-RAN is effective in minimizing energy consumption of the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) cluster, yielding up to 64% energy saving when compared to existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Experimental Assessment of Neural 3D Reconstruction for Small UAV-based Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However, this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.</description>

      <title>Experimental Assessment of A Framework for In-body RF-backscattering Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Localization of in-body devices is beneficial for Gastrointestinal (GI) diagnosis and targeted treatment. Traditional methods such as imaging and endoscopy are invasive and limited in resolution, highlighting the need for innovative alternatives. This study presents an experimental framework for Radio Frequency (RF)-backscatter-based in-body localization, inspired by the ReMix approach, and evaluates its performance in real-world conditions. The experimental setup includes an in-body backscatter device and various off-body antenna configurations to investigate harmonic generation and reception in air, chicken and pork tissues. The results indicate that optimal backscatter device positioning, antenna selection, and gain settings significantly impact performance, with denser biological tissues leading to greater attenuation. The study also highlights challenges such as external interference and plastic enclosures affecting propagation. The findings emphasize the importance of interference mitigation and refined propagation models to enhance performance.</description>

      <title>Densify &amp; Conquer: Densified, smaller base-stations can conquer the increasing carbon footprint problem in nextG wireless</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Connectivity on-the-go has been one of the most impressive technological achievements in the 2010s decade. However, multiple studies show that this has come at an expense of increased carbon footprint, that also rivals the entire aviation sector's carbon footprint. The two major contributors of this increased footprint are (a) smartphone batteries which affect the embodied footprint and (b) base-stations that occupy ever-increasing energy footprint to provide the last mile wireless connectivity to smartphones. The root-cause of both these turn out to be the same, which is communicating over the last-mile lossy wireless medium. We show in this paper, titled DensQuer, how base-station densification, which is to replace a single larger base-station with multiple smaller ones, reduces the effect of the last-mile wireless, and in effect conquers both these adverse sources of increased carbon footprint. Backed by a open-source ray-tracing computation framework (Sionna), we show how a strategic densification strategy can minimize the number of required smaller base-stations to practically achievable numbers, which lead to about 3x power-savings in the base-station network. Also, DensQuer is able to also reduce the required deployment height of base-stations to as low as 15m, that makes the smaller cells easily deployable on trees/street poles instead of requiring a dedicated tower. Further, by utilizing newly introduced hardware power rails in Google Pixel 7a and above phones, we also show that this strategic densified network leads to reduction in mobile transmit power by 10-15 dB, leading to about 3x reduction in total cellular power consumption, and about 50% increase in smartphone battery life when it communicates data via the cellular network.</description>

      <title>Space-ground Fluid AI for 6G Edge Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Edge artificial intelligence (AI) and space-ground integrated networks (SGINs) are two main usage scenarios of the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. Edge AI supports pervasive low-latency AI services to users, whereas SGINs provide digital services to spatial, aerial, maritime, and ground users. This article advocates the integration of the two technologies by extending edge AI to space, thereby delivering AI services to every corner of the planet. Beyond a simple combination, our novel framework, called space-ground fluid AI, leverages the predictive mobility of satellites to facilitate fluid horizontal and vertical task/model migration in the networks. This ensures non-disruptive AI service provisioning in spite of the high mobility of satellite servers. The aim of the article is to introduce the (space-ground) fluid AI technology. First, we outline the network architecture and unique characteristics of fluid AI. Then, we delve into three key components of fluid AI, i.e., fluid learning, fluid inference, and fluid model downloading. They share the common feature of coping with satellite mobility via inter-satellite and space-ground cooperation to support AI services. Finally, we discuss the considerations for the real-world deployment of fluid AI and identify further research opportunities.</description>

      <title>MOSE: A Novel Orchestration Framework for Stateful Microservice Migration at the Edge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stateful migration has emerged as the dominant technology to support microservice mobility at the network edge while ensuring a satisfying experience to mobile end users. This work addresses two pivotal challenges, namely, the implementation and the orchestration of the migration process. We first introduce a novel framework that efficiently implements stateful migration and effectively orchestrates the migration process by fulfilling both network and application KPI targets. Through experimental validation using realistic microservices, we then show that our solution (i) greatly improves migration performance, yielding up to 77% decrease of the migration downtime with respect to the state of the art, and (ii) successfully addresses the strict user QoE requirements of critical scenarios featuring latency-sensitive microservices. Further, we consider two practical use cases, featuring, respectively, a UAV autopilot microservice and a multi-object tracking task, and demonstrate how our framework outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches in configuring the migration process and in meeting KPI targets.</description>

      <title>VReaves: Eavesdropping on Virtual Reality App Identity and Activity via Electromagnetic Side Channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Virtual reality (VR) has recently proliferated significantly, consisting of headsets or head-mounted displays (HMDs) and hand controllers for an embodied and immersive experience. The VR device is usually embedded with different kinds of IoT sensors, such as cameras, microphones, communication sensors, etc. However, VR security has not been scrutinized from a physical hardware point of view, especially electromagnetic emanations (EM) that are automatically and unintentionally emitted from the VR headset. This paper presents VReaves, a system that can eavesdrop on the electromagnetic emanation side channel of a VR headset for VR app identification and activity recognition. To do so, we first characterize the electromagnetic emanations from the embedded IoT sensors (e.g., cameras and microphones) in the VR headset through a signal processing pipeline and further propose machine learning models to identify the VR app and recognize the VR app activities. Our experimental evaluation with commercial off-the-shelf VR devices demonstrates the efficiency of VR app identification and activity recognition via electromagnetic emanation side channel.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Scheduling schemes based on Carrier Aggregation in LTE-Advanced and their improvement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02368v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper I focused on resource scheduling in the downlink of LTE-Advanced with aggregation of multiple Component Carriers (CCs). When Carrier Aggregation (CA) is applied, a well-designed resource scheduling scheme is essential to the LTE-A system. Joint User Scheduling (JUS), Separated Random User Scheduling (SRUS), Separated Burst-Level Scheduling (SBLS) are three different resource scheduling schemes. JUS is optimal in performance but with high complexity and not considering quality of experience (QoE) parameters. Whereas SRUS and SBLS are contrary and users will acquire few resources because they do not support CA and the system fairness is disappointing. The author propose a novel Carrier Scheduling (CS) scheme, termed as "Quality of Service and Channel Scheduling" (QSCS). Connected CCs of one user can be changed in burst level and these changes are based on checking of services priority and quality of signal that user experiences. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively enhance throughput of users like JUS and also it chooses best CCs based on QoS and channel quality parameters. The simulation results also show that achieved QoE is much better than other algorithms.</description>

      <title>Picsou: Enabling Replicated State Machines to Communicate Efficiently</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11029v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Replicated state machines (RSMs) cannot communicate effectively today as there is no formal framework or efficient protocol to do so. To address this issue, we introduce a new primitive, Cross-Cluster Consistent Broadcast (C3B) and present PICSOU, a practical implementation of the C3B primitive. PICSOU draws inspiration from networking and TCP to allow two RSMs to communicate with constant metadata overhead in the failure-free case and a minimal number of message resends in the case of failures. PICSOU is flexible and allows both crash fault tolerant and Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocols to communicate. At the heart of PICSOU's good performance and generality is the concept of QUACKs (quorum acknowledgments). QUACKs allow nodes in each RSM to precisely determine when messages have definitely been received, or likely lost. Our results are promising: we obtain up to 24x better performance than prior solutions on microbenchmarks and applications, ranging from disaster recovery to data reconciliation.</description>
