      <title>Infinite Schnyder Woods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that any finite triangulation possesses a unique maximal Schnyder wood. We introduce Schnyder woods of infinite triangulations, and prove there exists a unique maximal Schnyder wood of any infinite triangulation with finite boundary, and of the uniform infinite half-planar triangulation. Furthermore, the maximal Schnyder wood of the uniform infinite planar triangulation is the limit of maximal Schnyder woods of large finite random triangulations. Several structural properties of infinite Schnyder woods are also described.</description>

      <title>A Census of Edge-transitive Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study edge-transitive surfaces, i.e. triangulated 2-dimensional manifolds whose automorphism groups act transitively on the edges of these triangulated surfaces. We show that there exist four types of edge-transitive surfaces, splitting up further into a total of five sub-types. We exploit our theoretical results to compute a census of edge-transitive surfaces with up to 5000 faces by constructing suitable cycle double covers of edge-transitive cubic graphs.</description>

      <title>Linear Programming Hierarchies Collapse under Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of symmetries is one of the central structural features that make some integer programs challenging for state-of-the-art solvers. In this work, we study the efficacy of Linear Programming (LP) hierarchies in the presence of symmetries. Our main theorem unveils a connection between the algebraic structure of these relaxations and the geometry of the initial integer-empty polytope: We show that under $(k+1)$-transitive symmetries--a measure of the underlying symmetry in the problem--the corresponding relaxation at level $k$ of the hierarchy is non-empty if and only if the initial polytope intersects all $(n-k)$-dimensional faces of the hypercube. In particular, the hierarchies of Sherali-Adams, Lov\'asz-Schrijver, and the Lift-and-Project closure are equally effective at detecting integer emptiness. Our result provides a unifying, group-theoretic characterization of the poor performance of LP-based hierarchies, and offers a simple procedure for proving lower bounds on the integrality gaps of symmetric polytopes under these hierarchies.</description>

      <title>Inferring DAGs and Phylogenetic Networks from Least Common Ancestors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A least common ancestor (LCA) of two leaves in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) is a vertex that is an ancestor of both leaves and has no proper descendant that is also their common ancestor. LCAs capture hierarchical relationships in rooted trees and, more generally, in DAGs. In 1981, Aho et al. introduced the problem of determining whether a set of pairwise LCA constraints on a set $X$, of the form $(i,j)&lt;(k,l)$ with $i,j,k,l\in X$, can be realized by a rooted tree whose leaf set is $X$, such that whenever $(i,j)&lt;(k,l)$, the LCA of $i,j$ is a descendant of that of $k,l$. They also presented a polynomial-time algorithm, BUILD, to solve this problem. However, many such constraint systems cannot be realized by any tree, prompting the question of whether they can be realized by a more general DAG. We extend Aho et al.'s framework from trees to DAGs, providing both theoretical and algorithmic foundations for reasoning about LCA constraints in this broader setting. Given a collection $R$ of LCA constraints, we define its $+$-closure $R^+$, capturing additional LCA relations implied by $R$. Using $R^+$, we construct a canonical DAG $G_R$ and prove that $R$ is DAG-realizable if and only if it is realized by $G_R$. We further adapt this construction to phylogenetic networks, defining a canonical network $N_R$ and prove that it is regular, i.e., it coincides with the Hasse diagram of its underlying set system. Finally, we show that for any DAG-realizable $R$, its classical closure - comprising all LCA constraints that hold in every DAG realizing $R$ - coincides with its $+$-closure. All constructions are computable in polynomial time, and we provide explicit algorithms for each.</description>

      <title>Graph Classes Closed under Self-intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A graph class is monotone if it is closed under taking subgraphs. It is known that a monotone class defined by finitely many obstructions has bounded treewidth if and only if one of the obstructions is a so-called tripod, that is, a disjoint union of trees with exactly one vertex of degree 3 and paths. This dichotomy also characterizes exactly those monotone graph classes for which many NP-hard algorithmic problems admit polynomial-time algorithms. These algorithmic dichotomies, however, do not extend to the universe of all hereditary classes, which are classes closed under taking induced subgraphs. This leads to the natural question of whether we can extend known algorithmic dichotomies for monotone classes to larger families of hereditary classes. We give an affirmative answer to this question by considering the family of hereditary graph classes that are closed under self-intersection, which is known to be located strictly between the monotone and hereditary classes. We prove a new structural characterization of graphs in self-intersection-closed classes excluding a tripod. We use our characterization to give a complete dichotomy of Maximum Independent Set, and its weighted variant for self-intersection-closed classes defined by finitely many obstructions: these problems are in P if the class excludes a tripod and NP-hard otherwise. This generalizes several known results on Maximum Independent Set. We also use it to obtain dichotomies for Maximum Induced Matching on self-intersection-closed classes of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many obstructions. Similarly, we obtain dichotomies for Satisfiability and Counting Satisfiability on self-intersection-closed classes of (bipartite) incidence graphs defined by finitely many obstructions, and for boundedness of clique-width for self-intersection-closed classes of bipartite graphs defined by finitely many obstructions.</description>

      <title>From the Finite to the Infinite: Sharper Asymptotic Bounds on Norin's Conjecture via SAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Norin (2008) conjectured that any $2$-edge-coloring of the hypercube $Q_n$ in which antipodal edges receive different colors must contain a monochromatic path between some pair of antipodal vertices. While the general conjecture remains elusive, progress thus far has been made on two fronts: finite cases and asymptotic relaxations. The best finite results are due to Frankston and Scheinerman (2024) who verified the conjecture for $n \leq 7$ using SAT solvers, and the best asymptotic result is due to Dvo\v{r}\'ak (2020), who showed that every $2$-edge-coloring of $Q_n$ admits an antipodal path of length $n$ with at most $0.375n + o(n)$ color changes. We improve on both fronts via SAT. First, we extend the verification to $n = 8$ by introducing a more compact and efficient SAT encoding, enhanced with symmetry breaking and cube-and-conquer parallelism. The versatility of this new encoding allows us to recast parts of Dvo\v{r}\'ak's asymptotic approach as a SAT problem, thereby improving the asymptotic upper bound to $0.3125n + O(1)$ color changes. Our work demonstrates how SAT-based methods can yield not only finite-case confirmations but also asymptotic progress on combinatorial conjectures.</description>

      <title>On the Computational Power of Extensional ESO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extensional ESO is a fragment of existential second-order logic (ESO) that captures the following family of problems. Given a fixed ESO sentence $\Psi$ and an input structure $\mathbb A$ the task if to decide whether there is an extension $\mathbb B$ of $\mathbb A$ that satisfies the first-order part of $\Psi$, i.e., a structure $\mathbb B$ such that $R^{\mathbb A}\subseteq R^{\mathbb B}$ for every existentially quantified predicate $R$ of $\Psi$, and $R^{\mathbb A} = R^{\mathbb B}$ for every non-quantified predicate $R$ of $\Psi$. In particular, extensional ESO describes all pre-coloured finite-domain constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs).
  In this paper we study the computational power of extensional ESO; we ask, for which problems in NP is there a polynomial-time equivalent problem in extensional ESO?. One of our main results states that extensional ESO has the same computational power as hereditary first-order logic. We also characterize the computational power of the fragment of extensional ESO with monotone universal first-order part in terms of finitely bounded CSPs. These results suggest a rich computational power of this logic, and we conjecture that extensional ESO captures NP-intermediate problems. We further support this conjecture by showing that extensional ESO can express current candidate NP-intermediate problems such as Graph Isomorphism, and Monotone Dualization (up to polynomial-time equivalence). On the other hand, another main result proves that extensional ESO does not have the full computational power of NP: there are problems in NP that are not polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in extensional ESP (unless E=NE).</description>

      <title>Zoo of Centralities: Encyclopedia of Node Metrics in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Centrality is a fundamental concept in network science, providing critical insights into the structure and dynamics of complex systems such as social, transportation, biological and financial networks. Despite its extensive use, there is no universally accepted definition of centrality, leading to the development of a vast array of distinct centrality measures. These measures have grown so numerous that they resemble a 'zoo', each representing a unique approach to capturing node importance within a network. However, the increasing number of metrics being developed has led to several challenges, including issues of discoverability, redundancy, naming conflicts, validation and accessibility. This work aims to address these challenges by providing a comprehensive catalog of over 400 centrality measures, along with clear descriptions and references to original sources. While not exhaustive, this compilation represents the most extensive and systematic effort to date in organizing and presenting centrality measures. We also encourage readers to explore and contribute to the Centrality Zoo website at https://centralityzoo.github.io/, which provides an interactive platform for discovering, comparing and implementing centrality measures.</description>
