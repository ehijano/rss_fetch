      <title>Spectral Density and Sum Rules for Second-Order Response Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sum rules for linear response functions give powerful and experimentally-relevant relations between frequency moments of response functions and ground state properties. In particular, renewed interest has been drawn to optical conductivity and density-density sum rules and their connection to quantum geometry in topological materials. At the same time, recent work has also illustrated the connection between quantum geometry and second-order nonlinear response functions in quantum materials, motivating the search for exact sum rules for second-order response that can provide experimental probes and theoretical constraints for geometry and topology in these systems. Here we begin to address these questions by developing a general formalism for deriving sum rules for second-order response functions. Using generalized Kramers-Kronig relations, we show that the second-order Kubo formula can be expressed in terms of a spectral density that is a sum of Dirac delta functions in frequency. We show that moments of the spectral density can be expressed in terms of averages of equal-time commutators, yielding a family of generalized sum rules; furthermore, these sum rules constrain the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the second harmonic generation rate. We apply our formalism to study generalized $f$-sum rules for the second-order density-density response function and the longitudinal nonlinear conductivity. We show that for noninteracting electrons in solids, the generalized $f$-sum rule can be written entirely in terms of matrix elements of the Bloch Hamiltonian. Finally, we derive a family of sum rules for rectification response, determining the large-frequency asymptotic behavior of the time-independent response to a harmonic perturbation.</description>

      <title>Two qubit gate with macroscopic singlet-triplet qubits in synthetic spin-one chains in InAsP quantum dot nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theory of a two qubit gate with macroscopic singlet-triplet (ST) qubits in synthetic spin-one chains in InAsP quantum dot nanowires. The macroscopic topologically protected singlet-triplet qubits are built with two spin-half Haldane quasiparticles. The Haldane quasiparticles are hosted by synthetic spin-one chain realized in chains of InAsP quantum dots embedded in an InP nanowire, with four electrons each. The quantum dot nanowire is described by a Hubbard-Kanamori (HK) Hamiltonian derived from an interacting atomistic model. Using exact diagonalization and Matrix Product States (MPS) tools, we demonstrate that the low-energy behavior of the HK Hamiltonian is effectively captured by an antiferromagnetic spin-one chain Hamiltonian. Next we consider two macroscopic qubits and present a method for creating a tunable coupling between the two macroscopic qubits by inserting an intermediate control dot between the two chains. Finally, we propose and demonstrate two approaches for generating highly accurate two-ST qubit gates : (1) by controlling the length of each qubit, and (2) by employing different background magnetic fields for the two qubits.</description>

      <title>Germanium-based hybrid semiconductor-superconductor topological quantum computing platforms: Disorder effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently suggested that proximitized gate-defined Ge hole nanowires could serve as an alternative materials platform for the realization of topological Majorana zero modes (MZMs). Here, we theoretically study the expected experimental signatures of Ge-based MZMs in tunneling conductance measurements, taking into account that unintentional random disorder is unavoidably present in realistic devices. Explicitly, we present numerically calculated local and nonlocal tunneling conductance spectra (as functions of bias voltage and magnetic field) for two different wire lengths, two different disorder models, two different parent superconductors (Al and NbTiN), and various disorder strengths, which we relate to an estimated lower bound for the disorder strength in Ge-based hybrid devices that we extract from the experimentally reported hole mobilities in current state-of-the-art two-dimensional Ge hole gases. We find that even if the actual disorder strength in the Ge-based hybrid device exceeds this theoretical lower bound by an order of magnitude, the system is still in the weak disorder regime, where the topological superconductivity is intact and the local conductance spectra manifest clear end-to-end correlated zero-bias peaks if and only if the system hosts topological end MZMs. This shows that, despite the relatively small pristine topological gaps ($\sim\,$a few tens of $\mu$eV), Ge-based hybrid devices are a promising alternative platform for Majorana experiments due to the extremely high materials quality, which leads to an increased gap-to-disorder ratio and, therefore, to less ambiguity in the experimental tunneling conductance data compared to InAs-based devices.</description>

      <title>Euler band topology in spin-orbit coupled magnetic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Euler class characterizes the topology of two real bands isolated from other bands in two-dimensions. Despite various intriguing topological properties predicted up to now, the candidate real materials hosting electronic Euler bands are extremely rare. Here, we show that in a quantum spin Hall insulator with two-fold rotation $C_{2z}$ about the $z$-axis, a pair of bands with nontrivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant turn into magnetic Euler bands under in-plane Zeeman field or in-plane ferromagnetic ordering. The resulting magnetic insulator generally carries a nontrivial second Stiefel-Whitney invariant. In particular, when the topmost pair of occupied bands carry a nonzero Euler number, the corresponding magnetic insulator can be called a magnetic Euler insulator. Moreover, the topological phase transition between a trivial magnetic insulator and a magnetic Stiefel-Whitney or Euler insulator is mediated by a stable topological semimetal phase in which Dirac nodes carrying non-Abelian topological charges exhibit braiding processes across the transition. Using the first-principles calculations, we propose various candidate materials hosting magnetic Euler bands. We especially show that ZrTe$_5$ bilayers under in-plane ferromagnetism are a candidate system for magnetic Stiefel-Whitney insulators in which the non-Abelian braiding-induced topological phase transitions can occur under pressure.</description>

      <title>Magnetocapacitance oscillations dominated by giant Rashba spin orbit interaction in InAs/GaSb quantum wells separated by AlSb barrier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed magnetocapacitance oscillations in InAs/GaSb quantum wells separated by a $20$\,nm AlSb middle barrier. By realizing independent ohmic contacts for electrons in InAs and holes in the GaSb layer, we found an out-of-plane oscillatory response in capacitance representing the density of states of this system. We were able to tune the charge carrier densities by applying a DC bias voltage, identifying the formation of beating signatures for forward bias. The coexistence of two distinguishable two dimensional charge carrier systems of unequal densities was verified. The corresponding Landau phase diagram presents distinct features originating from the two observed densities. A giant Rashba coefficient ranging from $430-612$\,meV$\text{\AA}$ and large \textit{g}-factor value underlines the influence of spin orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>Quantification of 2D Interfaces: Quality of heterostructures, and what is inside a nanobubble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped materials at the interfaces of two-dimensional heterostructures (HS) lead to reduced coupling between the layers, resulting in degraded optoelectronic performance and device variability. Further, nanobubbles can form at the interface during transfer or after annealing. The question of what is inside a nanobubble, i.e. the trapped material, remains unanswered, limiting the studies and applications of these nanobubble systems. In this work, we report two key advances. Firstly, we quantify the interface quality using RAW-format optical imaging, and distinguish between ideal and non-ideal interfaces. The HS-substrate ratio value is calculated using a transfer matrix model, and is able to detect the presence of trapped layers. The second key advance is identification of water as the trapped material inside a nanobubble. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to show that optical imaging alone can quantify interface quality, and find the type of trapped material inside spontaneously formed nanobubbles. We also define a quality index parameter to quantify the interface quality of HS. Quantitative measurement of the interface will help answer the question whether annealing is necessary during HS preparation, and will enable creation of complex HS with small twist angles. Identification of the trapped materials will pave the way towards using nanobubbles for novel optical and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Wave-function engineering on superconducting substrates: Chiral Yu-Shiba-Rusinov molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic adatoms on superconductors give rise to Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states that hold considerable interest for the design of topological superconductivity. Here, we show that YSR states are also an ideal platform to engineer structures with intricate wave-function symmetries. We assemble structures of iron atoms on the quasi-two-dimensional superconductor $2H$-NbSe$_2$. The Yu-Shiba-Rusinov wave functions of individual atoms extend over several nanometers enabling hybridization even at large adatom spacing. We show that the substrate can be exploited to deliberately break symmetries of the adatom structure in ways unachievable in the gas phase. We highlight this potential by designing chiral wave functions of triangular adatom structures confined within a plane. Our results significantly expand the range of interesting quantum states that can be engineered using arrays of magnetic adatoms on superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures of magnetic topological insulators (MTIs) and superconductors (SCs) in two-dimensional (2D) slab and one-dimensional (1D) nanoribbon geometries have been predicted to host, respectively, chiral Majorana edge states (CMESs) and Majorana bound states (MBSs). We study the topological properties of such MTI/SC heterostructures upon variation of the geometry from wide slabs to quasi-1D nanoribbon systems and as a function of the chemical potential, the magnetic doping, and the induced superconducting pairing potential. To do so, we construct effective symmetry-constrained low-energy Hamiltonians accounting for the real-space confinement. For a nanoribbon geometry with finite width and length, we observe different phases characterized by CMESs, MBSs, as well as coexisting CMESs and MBSs, as the chemical potential, the magnetic doping and/or the width are varied.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of spin current to charge current conversion in Ferromagnet/Graphene interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of graphene in spintronic devices depend, on its ability to convert a spin current into an electric charge current. We have systematically investigated the spin pumping induced spin-to-charge current conversion at the Graphene/FM interface and the effect of interface modification through high spin orbit coupling (SOC) material (Pt) as an interlayer (IL) of varying thicknesses by using broadband FMR spectroscopy. The spin mixing conductance was enhanced from $1.66 \times 10^{18}$ m$^{-2}$ to $2.72 \times 10^{18}$ m$^{-2}$ where as the spin current density was enhanced from 0.135$\pm $0.003 to 0.242$\pm$0.004 MA/m$^{2}$ at the Graphene/FM interface due to the interface modification using high SOC material Pt as an interlayer. We observe the value of spin current to charge current conversion efficiency $\approx 0.292\times10^{-3}$ nm for the Graphene/FM interface. These findings support the idea that Graphene in contact with high SOC material (Pt) be a potential candidate for spintronic applications, specifically for spin-torque-based memory applications.</description>

      <title>Superconducting Klein and anti-Klein tunneling in Weyl junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Klein tunneling is an old topic in relativistic quantum physics, and has been observed recently in graphene where massless particles reside. Here, we propose a new heterostructure platform for Klein tunneling to occur, which consists of a Weyl-semimetal-based normal state/superconductor (NS) junction. By developing a Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk-like theory, we find that Klein tunneling occurs at normal incidence, which can lead to differential conductance doubling. If the (single) Weyl semimeltals are replaced by double Weyl semimetals, anti-Klein tunneling will take place of Klein tunneling. Our work provides a theoretical guide for the detection of (anti-)Klein tunneling in three-dimensional chiral NS junctions.</description>

      <title>Second-order adiabatic expansions of heat and charge currents with nonequilibrium Green's functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to technological needs, nanoscale heat management, energy conversion and quantum thermodynamics have become key areas of research, putting heat pumps and nanomotors center stage. The treatment of these particular systems often requires the use of adiabatic expansions in terms of the frequency of the external driving or the velocity of some classical degree of freedom. However, due to the difficulty of getting the expressions, most works have only explored first-order terms. Despite this, adiabatic expansions have allowed the study of intriguing phenomena such as adiabatic quantum pumps and motors, or electronic friction. Here, we use nonequilibrium Green's functions, within a Schwinger-Keldysh approach, to develop second-order expressions for the energy, heat, and charge currents. We illustrate, through two simple models, how the obtained formulas produce physically consistent results, and allow for the thermodynamic study of unexplored phenomena, such as second-order monoparametric pumping.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric and magnetic waveguides are considered in planar Dirac materials like graphene as well as their classical version for relativistic particles of zero mass and electric charge. In order to solve the Dirac-Weyl equation analytically, we have assumed the displacement symmetry of the system along a direction. In these conditions we have examined the rest of symmetries relevant each type, magnetic or electric system, which will determine their similarities and differences. We have worked out waveguides with square profile in detail to show up some of the most interesting features also in quantum and classical complementary contexts. All the results have been visualized along a series of representative graphics showing explicitly the main properties for both types of waveguides.</description>

      <title>Imaging Tunable Luttinger Liquid Systems in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) interacting electrons are often described as a Luttinger liquid1-4 having properties that are intrinsically different from Fermi liquids in higher dimensions5,6. 1D electrons in materials systems exhibit exotic quantum phenomena that can be tuned by both intra- and inter-1D-chain electronic interactions, but their experimental characterization can be challenging. Here we demonstrate that layer-stacking domain walls (DWs) in van der Waals heterostructures form a broadly tunable Luttinger liquid system including both isolated and coupled arrays. We have imaged the evolution of DW Luttinger liquids under different interaction regimes tuned by electron density using a novel scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) technique. Single DWs at low carrier density are highly susceptible to Wigner crystallization consistent with a spin-incoherent Luttinger liquid, while at intermediate densities dimerized Wigner crystals form due to an enhanced magneto-elastic coupling. Periodic arrays of DWs exhibit an interplay between intra- and inter-chain interactions that gives rise to new quantum phases. At low electron densities inter-chain interactions are dominant and induce a 2D electron crystal composed of phased-locked 1D Wigner crystal in a staggered configuration. Increased electron density causes intra-chain fluctuation potentials to dominate, leading to an electronic smectic liquid crystal phase where electrons are ordered with algebraical correlation decay along the chain direction but disordered between chains. Our work shows that layer-stacking DWs in 2D heterostructures offers new opportunities to explore Luttinger liquid physics.</description>

      <title>Generation of multiple bound states in the continuum through doubly degenerate quasi-guided modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed theoretical analysis of a peculiar generation of multiple bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two-dimensional periodic arrays of dielectric spheres. They emerge in high-symmetry lattices with the $C_{6v}$ and $C_{4v}$ point groups and involve doubly degenerate quasi-guided modes at the $\Gamma$ point that can couple to external radiation. By tuning a system parameter, the doubly degenerate modes can exhibit accidental BICs at a critical parameter. In the vicinity of the critical parameter, the two bands originating from the degenerate mode exhibit multiple off-$\Gamma$ BICs. They move and annihilate across the two bands by changing the parameter around the critical one. A ring-like high $Q$ channel pinned with multiple BICs emerges particularly for the $C_{6v}$ case. Across the critical coupling, the total vorticity of the multiple BICs is conserved. The $\vb*{k}\cdot\vb*{p}$ perturbation theory explains some features of the phenomena reasonably well.</description>

      <title>Observation of intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the symmetry-breaking electronic orders intertwined with the superconductivity provide important clues for understanding the nature of the unconventional pairing mechanism. Recently, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations and translational symmetry breaking, namely the pair density wave (PDW) state, has attracted broad attention. Without breaking translational symmetry, point group symmetry breaking may also induce superconductivity modulations on different atom sites within a single unit cell. However, the intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulation has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of intra-unit-cell superconductivity modulations in the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness in monolayer high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001) substrates. Further analysis shows that the maxima and minima in the superconductivity modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the Te/Se atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the Te/Se atoms in monolayer high-Tc Fe(Te,Se) films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information of superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and indicate that the p-orbital electrons of the Te/Se atoms also play an important role in Cooper pairing in unconventional high-Tc iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Enhancing nanocrystal superlattice self-assembly near a metastable liquid binodal</title>

Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.</description>

      <title>Amoeba Formulation of Non-Bloch Band Theory in Arbitrary Dimensions</title>

Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect dramatically reshapes the energy bands of non-Hermitian systems, meaning that the usual Bloch band theory is fundamentally inadequate as their characterization. The non-Bloch band theory, in which the concept of Brillouin zone is generalized, has been widely applied to investigate non-Hermitian systems in one spatial dimension. However, its generalization to higher dimensions has been challenging. Here, we develop a formulation of the non-Hermitian skin effect and non-Bloch band theory in arbitrary spatial dimensions, which is based on a natural geometrical object known as the amoeba. Our theory provides a general framework for studying non-Hermitian bands beyond one dimension. Key quantities of non-Hermitian bands, including the energy spectrum, eigenstates profiles, and the generalized Brillouin zone, can be efficiently obtained from this approach.</description>

      <title>Manipulating Spin-Lattice Coupling in Layered Magnetic Topological Insulator Heterostructure $via$ Interface Engineering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.12772v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Induced magnetic order in a topological insulator (TI) can be realized either by depositing magnetic adatoms on the surface of a TI or engineering the interface with epitaxial thin film or stacked assembly of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials. Herein, we report the observation of spin-phonon coupling in the otherwise non-magnetic TI Bi$_\mathrm{2}$Te$_\mathrm{3}$, due to the proximity of FePS$_\mathrm{3}$ (an antiferromagnet (AFM), $T_\mathrm{N}$ $\sim$ 120 K), in a vdW heterostructure framework. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopic studies reveal deviation from the usual phonon anharmonicity originated from spin-lattice coupling at the Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/FePS$_{3}$ interface at/below 60 K in the peak position (self-energy) and linewidth (lifetime) of the characteristic phonon modes of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ (106 cm$^{-1}$ and 138 cm$^{-1}$) in the stacked heterostructure. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) formalism, where the respective phonon frequencies of Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$ couple to phonons of similar frequencies of FePS$_{3}$ in the AFM phase, has been adopted to understand the origin of the hybrid magneto-elastic modes. At the same time, the reduction of characteristic $T_\mathrm{N}$ of FePS$_3$ from 120 K in isolated flakes to 65 K in the heterostructure, possibly due to the interfacial strain, which leads to smaller Fe-S-Fe bond angles as corroborated by computational studies using density functional theory (DFT). Besides, inserting hexagonal boron nitride within Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$/FePS$_{3}$ stacking regains the anharmonicity in Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. Controlling interfacial spin-phonon coupling in stacked heterostructure can have potential application in surface code spin logic devices.</description>

      <title>Determination of optimal experimental conditions for accurate 3D reconstruction of the magnetization vector via XMCD-PEEM</title>

Abstract: In this work we present a detailed analysis on the performance of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism photo-emission electron microscopy (XMCD-PEEM) as a tool for vector reconstruction of the magnetization. For this, we choose 360$^{\circ}$ domain wall ring structures which form in a synthetic antiferromagnet as our model to conduct the quantitative analysis. We assess how the quality of the results is affected depending on the number of projections that are involved in the reconstruction process, as well as their angular distribution. For this we develop a self-consistent error metric, which indicates that the main factor of improvement comes from selecting the projections evenly spread out in space, over having a larger number of these spanning a smaller angular range. This work thus poses XMCD-PEEM as a powerful tool for vector imaging of complex 3D magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetic simulations of the size dependence of the Curie temperature in ferromagnetic nanowires and nanolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05722v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation in the finite-temperature regime, where thermal fluctuations are modeled by a random magnetic field whose variance is proportional to the temperature. By rescaling the temperature proportionally to the computational cell size $\Delta x$ ($T \to T\,\Delta x/a_{\text{eff}}$, where $a_{\text{eff}}$ is the lattice constant) [M. B. Hahn, J. Phys. Comm., 3:075009, 2019], we obtain Curie temperatures $T_{\text{C}}$ that are in line with the experimental values for cobalt, iron and nickel. For finite-sized objects such as nanowires (1D) and nanolayers (2D), the Curie temperature varies with the smallest size $d$ of the system. We show that the difference between the computed finite-size $T_{\text{C}}$ and the bulk $T_{\text{C}}$ follows a power-law of the type: $(\xi_0/d)^\lambda$, where $\xi_0$ is the correlation length at zero temperature, and $\lambda$ is a critical exponent. We obtain values of $\xi_0$ in the nanometer range, also in accordance with other simulations and experiments. The computed critical exponent is close to $\lambda=2$ for all considered materials and geometries. This is the expected result for a mean-field approach, but slightly larger than the values observed experimentally.</description>

Abstract: We conduct an experimental study of high-mobility two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum wells modulated by strong magnetism at an in-plane magnetic field ($B$). The modulated $B$-fields are performed via the single stripe and gratings which are made of the heavy rare earth metal Terbium (Tb) thin films on the sample surface. The robust ferromagnetic resonances (FMRs) persist to the temperature of 50-70 K in both the stripe and grating samples, for the ferromagnetism (FM) phase of Tb exists at above 100 K. The high-order (with integer numbers of $j \equiv \hbar\omega/g\mu_{B}B = 1, 2,$...) magnetic resonances can also be observed in the stripe structure via the microwave (MW) photovoltaic detection and magnetoresistance under microwave irradiation. In addition, the resonance features around $j = 1/2$ are robust in the single-stripe modulated sample, which suggests the spinons with spin-1/2 collective excitations in a 1D Heisenberg model.</description>

Abstract: Extensive efforts have been undertaken to combine superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect so that Cooper-pair transport between superconducting electrodes in Josephson junctions is mediated by one-dimensional edge states. This interest has been motivated by prospects of finding new physics, including topologically-protected quasiparticles, but also extends into metrology and device applications. So far it has proven challenging to achieve detectable supercurrents through quantum Hall conductors. Here we show that domain walls in minimally twisted bilayer graphene support exceptionally robust proximity superconductivity in the quantum Hall regime, allowing Josephson junctions to operate in fields close to the upper critical field of superconducting electrodes. The critical current is found to be non-oscillatory and practically unchanging over the entire range of quantizing fields, with its value being limited by the quantum conductance of ballistic, strictly one-dimensional electronic channels residing within the domain walls. The system described is unique in its ability to support Andreev bound states at quantizing fields and offers many interesting directions for further exploration.</description>

      <title>Control of proton transport and hydrogenation in double-gated graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The basal plane of graphene can function as a selective barrier that is permeable to protons but impermeable to all ions and gases, stimulating its use in applications such as membranes, catalysis and isotope separation. Protons can chemically adsorb on graphene and hydrogenate it, inducing a conductor-insulator transition that has been explored intensively in graphene electronic devices. However, both processes face energy barriers and various strategies have been proposed to accelerate proton transport, for example by introducing vacancies, incorporating catalytic metals or chemically functionalizing the lattice. However, these techniques can compromise other properties, such as ion selectivity or mechanical stability. Here we show that independent control of the electric field, E, at around 1 V nm-1, and charge-carrier density, n, at around 1 x 10^14 cm-2, in double-gated graphene allows the decoupling of proton transport from lattice hydrogenation and can thereby accelerate proton transport such that it approaches the limiting electrolyte current for our devices. Proton transport and hydrogenation can be driven selectively with precision and robustness, enabling proton-based logic and memory graphene devices that have on-off ratios spanning orders of magnitude. Our results show that field effects can accelerate and decouple electrochemical processes in double-gated 2D crystals and demonstrate the possibility of mapping such processes as a function of E and n, which is a new technique for the study of 2D electrode-electrolyte interfaces.</description>

      <title>Competing anisotropies in the chiral cubic magnet Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ unveiled by resonant x-ray magnetic scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cubic $\beta$-Mn-type alloy Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$ is a chiral helimagnet that exhibits a peculiar temperature-dependent behavior in the spiral pitch, which decreases from 130 nm at room temperature to 70 nm below 20 K. Notably, this shortening is also accompanied by a structural transition of the metastable skyrmion texture, transforming from a hexagonal lattice to a square lattice of elongated skyrmions. The underlying mechanism of these transformations remain unknown, with interactions potentially involved including temperature-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, magnetocrystalline anisotropy, and exchange anisotropy. Here, x-ray resonant magnetic small-angle scattering in vectorial magnetic fields was employed to investigate the temperature dependence of the anisotropic properties of the helical phase in Co$_8$Zn$_8$Mn$_4$. Our results reveal quantitatively that the magnitude of the anisotropic exchange interaction increases by a factor of 4 on cooling from room temperature to 20 K, leading to a 5% variation in the helical pitch within the (001) plane at 20 K. While anisotropic exchange interaction contributes to the shortening of the spiral pitch, its magnitude is insufficient to explain the variation in the spiral periodicity from room to low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that magnetocrystalline and exchange anisotropies compete, favoring different orientations of the helical vector in the ground state.</description>

Abstract: In superconductors that lack inversion symmetry, a supercurrent flow can lead to nondissipative magnetoelectric effects. We offer a straightforward formalism to obtain a supercurrent-induced magnetization in superconductors with broken inversion symmetry, which may have orbital, layer, sublattice, or valley degrees of freedom, multiband noncentrosymmetric superconductors. The nondissipative magnetoelectric effect may find applications in fabricating quantum computation platforms or efficient superconducting spintronic devices. We explore how the current-induced magnetization can be employed to create and manipulate Majorana zero modes in a simple hybrid structure.</description>

      <title>Unidirectional Ray Polaritons in Twisted Asymmetric Stacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.18657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The emergence of a vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons - light coupled to matter excitations - offers a plethora of different possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the subwavelength-scale. In particular, the development of twistoptics - the study of the optical properties of twisted stacks of vdW materials - allows the directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, which has been coined as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of nanoscale unidirectional propagation that naturally emerges thanks to twistoptics: unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). This natural phenomenon arises in two types of twisted hyperbolic stacks: homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, each with very different thicknesses of its constituents. URPs are characterized by the absence of diffraction and the presence of a single phase of the propagating field. Importantly, we demonstrate that this ray behavior can be tuned by means of both relative twist angle and illumination frequency variations. Additionally, an unprecedented "pinwheel-like" propagation emerges at specific twist angles of the homostructure. We show that URPs emerge due to the twist between asymmetrically stacked biaxial slabs, while the shear effect in monoclinic $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ is of minor importance. Our findings demonstrate a natural way to excite unidirectional ray-like PhPs and offer a unique platform for controlling the propagation of PhPs at the nanoscale with many potential applications like nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.</description>

      <title>Direct transition from a fractional quantum anomalous Hall state to a smectic state with the same Hall conductance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.06745v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in twisted MoTe_2 and rhombohedral multilayer graphene have generated widespread attention to the general features of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) states, including their possible coexistence with and transition to various symmetry breaking charge ordered states. These attentions are pushing forward our knowledge of the relation between the topological order in FQAH states and the Landau-type of symmetry breaking order such as the 1D smectic electronic liquid crystal and 2D charge-density-wave (CDW) solid. Although the transitions from topological states to symmetry breaking states with trivial topology have been discussed, the road from one topological ordered state to another with the same Hall conductance and broken translational symmetry has not been found. Here we show the intriguing evidence that the FQAH to FQAH Smectic (FQAHS) transition is robustly realizable in the archetypal correlated flat Chern-band model at filling $\nu$ = 2/3. This transition is novel in that: i) the FQAHS acquires the same fractional Hall conductance as FQAH, which cannot be explained by mean-field band folding. The formation of smectic order can be viewed as perturbation around the transition point, and thus, do not destroy or change the original topology; ii) the charge excitation remains gapped across the transition although the neutral gap is closed at transition point; and iii) the transition is triggered by the softening of roton mode with the same wave vector as the smectic order. Our discovery opens countless new possibilities, both theoretical and experimental, in the fast-growing field of robust fractional Chern insulators.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in Quantum Dots: Insights from Dynamic Susceptibility and Quantum Fisher Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the entanglement properties of quantum dots (QDs) under a universal Hamiltonian where the Coulomb interaction between particles (electrons or holes) decouples into a charging energy and an exchange coupling term. While this formalism typically decouples the charge and spin components, the confinement-induced energy splitting can induce unexpected entanglement in the system. By analyzing the dynamic susceptibility and quantum Fisher information (QFI), we uncover intriguing behaviors influenced by exchange constants, temperature variations, and confinement effects. In Ising QDs, far below the Stoner instability point where the QD is in a disordered paramagnetic phase, temperature reductions unexpectedly lead to decreased entanglement, challenging conventional expectations. Conversely, anisotropic Heisenberg models exhibit enhanced entanglement near isotropic points. Our findings highlight the intricate interplay between exchange interactions and entanglement in QDs, laying the groundwork for future studies on topological entanglement and the influence of entanglement on material properties. Overall, this work contributes to advancing our understanding of entanglement in QDs and its potential applications in quantum technologies.</description>
