      <title>Learning the Optimal Hydrodynamic Closure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the optimal hydrodynamic model for rarefied gas flows by combining the recent theory of slow spectral closure with machine learning techniques. We learn generalized transport coefficients from density fluctuation data and demonstrate that our approach decisively outperforms previously proposed constitutive laws for higher-order hydrodynamics. The novel hydrodynamic model is in extremely close alignment with the Shakhov kinetic model and DSMC data, thus proving the optimality of the slow spectral closure. Our theory is independent on any smallness assumption of the Knudsen number and is formulated solely in terms of macroscopic observables.</description>

      <title>Numerical study of vortices within a background vortex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study aims to exploit the analogy of vortex dynamics in a 2D ideal fluid and 2D non-neutral plasma. Numerical simulations using contour dynamics with adaptive refinement are conducted to study the dynamics of one or more vortices within a background vortex, and results are compared with experiments using magnetized non-neutral electron plasmas confined in a Penning-Malmberg trap. This comparison is based on the isomorphism between the 2D Euler equations for ideal fluid and the 2D drift-Poisson equations for non-neutral plasma, where the the fluid vorticity and stream function correspond to the plasma charge density and electric potential. Agreement and discrepancy between simulation and experiment are observed and discussed.</description>

      <title>High-efficient machine learning projection method for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study proposes a high-efficient machine learning (ML) projection method using forward-generated data for incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. A Poisson neural network (Poisson-NN) embedded method and a wavelet transform convolutional neural network multigrid (WTCNN-MG) method are proposed, integrated into the projection method framework in patchwork and overall differentiable manners with MG method, respectively. The solution of the pressure Poisson equation split from the Navier-Stokes equations is first generated either following a random field (e.g. Gaussian random field, GRF, computational complexity O(NlogN), N is the number of spatial points) or physical laws (e.g. a kind of spectra, computational complexity O(NM), M is the number of modes), then the source terms, boundary conditions and initial conditions are constructed via balance of equations, avoiding the difficulties of obtaining high-fidelity training datasets. The feasibility of generated data for training Poisson-NN and WTCNN as well as the acceleration performances of the Poisson-NN embedded method and WTCNN-MG method are validated. The results indicate that even without any DNS data, the generated data can train these two models with excellent generalization and accuracy. The data following physical laws can significantly improve the high-frequency approximation, convergence rate, generalization and accuracy than that generated following GRF. The ML projection method offers significant improvements in computational efficiency. Particularly, the Poisson-NN embedded method achieves an average speed-up of 5.83 times over the traditional MG method, while the WTCNN-MG method offers an even greater average speed-up of 7.03 times, demonstrating impressive acceleration performance.</description>

      <title>Leveraging three-dimensionality for navigation in bluff-body wakes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological flyers and swimmers navigate in unsteady wake flows using limited sensory abilities and actuation energies. Understanding how vortical structures can be leveraged for energy-efficient navigation in unsteady flows is beneficial in developing autonomous navigation for small-scale aerial and marine vehicles. Such vehicles are typically operated with constrained onboard actuation and sensing capabilities, making energy-efficient trajectory planning critically important. This study finds that trajectory planners can leverage three-dimensionality appearing in a complex unsteady wake for efficient navigation using limited flowfield information. This is revealed with comprehensive investigations by finite-horizon model-predictive control for trajectory planning of a swimmer behind a cylinder wake at Re=300. The navigation performance of three-dimensional (3D) cases is compared to scenarios in a two-dimensional (2D) wake. The underactuated swimmer is able to reach the target by leveraging the background flow when the prediction horizon exceeds one-tenth of the wake-shedding period, demonstrating that navigation is feasible with limited information about the flowfield. Further, we identify that the swimmer can leverage the secondary transverse vortical structures to reach the target faster than is achievable navigating in a 2D wake.</description>

      <title>Multi-scale physics of cryogenic liquid helium-4: Inverse coarse-graining properties of smoothed particle hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent numerical studies on cryogenic liquid helium-4 have provided a multiscale physics perspective based on Landau's two-fluid model. This study presents the possibility that two-fluid models based on classical and quantum hydrodynamics have a relationship between scale transformation by filtering in large eddy simulations (LES) and inverse scale transformation using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We consider that the spin angle momentum conservation term, which we previously introduced into the two-fluid model as a quantum mechanical correction, formally corresponds to the subgrid-scale (SGS) model, which can be derived from the scale transformation of the two-fluid model from quantum to classical hydrodynamics. We demonstrate that solving the two-fluid model based on classical hydrodynamics using SPH can reproduce the fluctuations at the microscopic scale because the truncation errors owing to the smoothing kernel approximation can substitute the fluctuations at the microscopic scale. In particular, the fluctuations can be reproduced at more macroscopic scales and amplified according to the size of kernel radius. Our results and discussion provide new insights into the microscopic composition of cryogenic liquid helium4 within a multiscale framework. First, a normal fluid can be a mixture of inviscid and viscous particles. Second, a flow identified as a normal fluid on the microscopic scale because of the presence of molecular viscosity is still classified as an inviscid fluid on the hydrodynamic scale because its viscosity is insufficient to produce eddy viscosity. In conclusion, we provide a new multiscale physical framework for cryogenic liquid helium-4.</description>

      <title>Non-selective evaporation mechanism of binary aerosol generating agent on porous atomizer and its experimental verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explain the similarity between e-cigarette aerosol and e-liquid composition despite differing component boiling points, a non-selective evaporation mechanism for binary aerosol generating agents was investigated using phase diagrams and capillary evaporation theory. Experiments including evaporation temperature measurement, airflow heating, and capillary evaporation observation validated the non-selective evaporation process. Key findings: 1) Non-selective evaporation occurs due to liquid convection obstruction in capillaries, forming an evaporation layer with a composition distinct from the main liquid phase. Stable non-selective evaporation arises when the gas-phase composition matches the liquid-phase components transferred to the evaporation layer. 2) Evaporation temperature (T) deviated significantly from the bubble point temperature (Tb) and aligned closely with the dew point temperature (Tc), indicating a stable evaporation layer with a unique composition. 3) Surface heating and porous material experiments demonstrated significant deviations from ideal selective evaporation in water/methanol, water/propylene glycol, and propylene glycol/glycerol systems, highlighting the roles of "surface heating" and "mass transfer resistance" in non-selective evaporation. 4) A two-stage capillary evaporation experiment revealed a transition in evaporation rate, confirming a shift in the evaporation layer's composition during stable non-selective evaporation. 5) Particle tracing confirmed unidirectional liquid flow in capillaries, with micro-convection near the meniscus, further supporting the "evaporation layer" concept. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of non-selective evaporation in e-cigarette aerosols.</description>

      <title>An improved numerical simulation methodology for nanoparticle injection through aerodynamic lens systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerosol injectors applied in single-particle diffractive imaging experiments demonstrated their potential in efficiently delivering nanoparticles with high density. Continuous optimization of injector design is crucial for achieving high-density particle streams, minimizing background gas, enhancing X-ray interactions, and generating high-quality diffraction patterns. We present an updated simulation framework designed for the fast and effective exploration of the experimental parameter space to enhance the optimization process. The framework includes both the simulation of the carrier gas and the particle trajectories within injectors and their expansion into the experimental vacuum chamber. A hybrid molecular-continuum-simulation method (DSMC/CFD) is utilized to accurately capture the multi-scale nature of the flow. The simulation setup, initial benchmark results of the coupled approach, and the validation of the entire methodology against experimental data are presented.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Dynamics of a Liquid Corner Film</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the rheology of liquids typically requires precise control over shear rates and stresses. However, we demonstrate that the features of a power-law fluid can be predicted by simply observing the capillary spreading dynamics of viscous droplets within a wedge-shaped geometry. By considering the influence of capillary and viscous forces within this geometry, we show that the spreading dynamics can be described by a nonlinear diffusion equation. Analytical predictions indicate subdiffusive behavior, establishing a direct relationship between the diffusion exponent and the rheological exponent, which is also corroborated by experimental results. Since this relationship is independent of flow details, it provides robust predictions for the rheological properties of power-law fluids.</description>

      <title>Acceleration of RANS Solver Convergence via Initialization with Wake Extension Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Use of appropriate initialization to warm-start Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations of turbulent flow can facilitate convergence and lead to efficient use of computational resources. In this work, a method to model downstream wake development in external turbulent flow is proposed and used for RANS solver convergence acceleration. To balance the model accuracy and cost, the proposed method divides the analysis domain into three regions: near-body, wake and off-body. An approach based on a convolutional neural network is introduced as an efficient method to predict the downstream wake development. The model training only requires data from a single simulation, and its use is demonstrated to be effective in accelerating the RANS simulation when combined with an accurate flow prediction in the near-body region. The simulation using the proposed method took 26.3x fewer iterations, achieving 16.4x speedup in wall-clock time, compared to a baseline run using freestream initialization.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Stability of Partially and Fully Saturated Atmospheres to Moist Convection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a linear analysis of a minimal model of moist convection under a variety of atmospheric conditions. The stationary solutions that we analyze include both fully saturated and partially unsaturated atmospheres in both unconditionally and conditionally unstable cases. We find that all of the solutions we consider are linearly unstable via exchange of stability when sufficiently driven. The critical Rayleigh numbers vary by over an order of magnitude between unconditionally unstable and conditionally unstable atmospheres. The unsaturated atmospheres are notable for the presence of linear gravity wave-like oscillations even in unstable conditions. We study their eigenfunction structure and find that the buoyancy and moisture perturbations are anticorrelated in $z$, such that regions of negative buoyancy have positive moisture content. We suggest that these features in unsaturated atmospheres may explain the phenomenon of gravity wave shedding by moist convective plumes.</description>

      <title>AI-driven random walk simulations of viscophoresis and visco-diffusiophoretic particle trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Viscophoresis refers to the transport of suspended nanoparticles driven by a steep viscosity gradient. This work investigates this new transport effect using a random walk simulation. By modelling position-dependent Brownian motion, viscophoresis, and diffusiophoresis in a one-dimensional geometry, the simulation yields results that align well with experimental data, demonstrating viscophoresis as a new phoretic transport mechanism. Additionally, the simulation predicts the efficient separation of nanoparticles based on size, suggesting potential applications for sorting in microfluidic systems. The Python script for the simulation was generated using ChatGPT o1, significantly accelerating model development and providing accurate physical insights and efficient equations. However, caution is advised, as ChatGPT may generate non-physical results; iterative testing and validation is important.</description>

      <title>Metriplectic 4-bracket algorithm for constructing thermodynamically consistent dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A unified thermodynamic algorithm (UTA) is presented for constructing thermodynamically consistent dynamical systems, i.e., systems that have Hamiltonian and dissipative parts that conserve energy while producing entropy. The algorithm is based on the metriplectic 4-bracket given in Morrison and Updike [Phys.\ Rev.\ E 109, 045202 (2024)]. A feature of the UTA is the force-flux relation $\mathbf{J}^\alpha = - L^{\alpha\beta}\, \nabla(\delta H / \delta \xi^\beta)$ for phenomenological coefficients $L^{\alpha\beta}$, Hamiltonian $H$ and dynamical variables $\xi^\beta$. The algorithm is applied to the Navier-Stokes-Fourier, the Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes, and and Brenner-Navier-Stokes-Fourier systems, and significant generalizations of these systems are obtained.</description>

      <title>MeshMask: Physics-Based Simulations with Masked Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08738v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel masked pre-training technique for graph neural networks (GNNs) applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems. By randomly masking up to 40\% of input mesh nodes during pre-training, we force the model to learn robust representations of complex fluid dynamics. We pair this masking strategy with an asymmetric encoder-decoder architecture and gated multi-layer perceptrons to further enhance performance. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on seven CFD datasets, including a new challenging dataset of 3D intracranial aneurysm simulations with over 250,000 nodes per mesh. Moreover, it significantly improves model performance and training efficiency across such diverse range of fluid simulation tasks. We demonstrate improvements of up to 60\% in long-term prediction accuracy compared to previous best models, while maintaining similar computational costs. Notably, our approach enables effective pre-training on multiple datasets simultaneously, significantly reducing the time and data required to achieve high performance on new tasks. Through extensive ablation studies, we provide insights into the optimal masking ratio, architectural choices, and training strategies.</description>
