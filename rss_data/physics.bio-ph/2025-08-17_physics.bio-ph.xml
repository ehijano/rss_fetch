      <title>Particle-based simulation of non-elementary bimolecular kinetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle-based simulations are an essential tool for the study of biochemical systems for scales between molecular/Brownian dynamics and the reaction-diffusion master equation. These simulations utilise proximity-based reaction conditions and are typically limited to elementary (mass-action) kinetics. We present a novel framework for directly simulating non-elementary bimolecular kinetics in a particle-based framework. By mimicking the behaviour of a third implicit reactant, we adapt non-elementary reaction conditions, previously restricted to trimolecular chemical interactions, to biomolecular reactions for the first time. We implement our approach in an event-driven simulation, which we validate by reproducing Michaelis-Menten kinetics. We then demonstrate its utility by simulating the classical Goldbeter model of circadian oscillations completely at the level of individual molecules. This model features multiple non-elementary reactions and requires the incorporation of several existing simulation techniques. Our method accurately reproduces the target non-elementary kinetics, without simulating the implied underlying fast elementary reactions, thereby significantly reducing the computational cost. This work expands the class of reaction networks accessible to particle-based simulations and provides a practical alternative to explicitly simulating all elementary steps in systems where quasi-steady-state approximations are applicable.</description>

      <title>Measurement of tissue viscosity to relate force and motion in collective cell migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In tissue development, wound healing, and cancer invasion, coordinated cell motion arises from active forces produced by the cells. The relationship between force and motion remains unclear, however, because the forces are a sum active and passive contributions. Here, we show that the active forces can be decoupled from the passive by careful investigation of the distribution of shear stress against strain rate. With this method, we show experimentally that the order of magnitude of passive tissue viscosity is 100 Pa-hr and that increasing (decreasing) the actomyosin cytoskeleton and cell-cell adhesions increase (decrease) the magnitude of tissue viscosity. These results establish tissue viscosity as a meaningful way to describe the mechanical behavior of epithelial tissues, and demonstrate a direct relationship between tissue microstructure and material properties. By providing the first experimental measurement of tissue viscosity, our study separates the active and passive components of stress, in turn clarifying the relationship between force and motion and providing a new means of identifying how active cell forces evolve in space and time.</description>

      <title>Unconventional Phase Separation and Fractal Interfaces of Colloids in Active Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase separation driven by nonequilibrium fluctuations is a hallmark of both living and synthetic active matter. Unlike equilibrium systems, where ordered states arise from the minimization of free energy, active systems are fueled by a constant injection of energy at the microscopic scale. The emergence of ordered phases in such driven systems challenges our conventional views of domain growth and interfacial structure. In this study, we investigate the coarsening of colloidal clusters in active liquids containing E. coli. Our experiments reveal that uniform dispersions of colloids and swimmers are inherently unstable, resulting in spontaneous phase separation characterized by fractal interfaces and unconventional kinetics. The correlation function of the order parameter displays dynamical scaling, with the size of colloidal domains growing as $t^{1/z}$, where $z \sim 4$, in contrast to the well-known growth laws for thermal systems with a conserved order parameter. Furthermore, the structure factor exhibits non-Porod behavior, indicating domains with fractal interfaces. This non-Porod behavior also manifests itself as a cusp singularity in the correlation function. We elucidate our experimental findings using a scalar field theory in which the nonequilibrium fluctuations arising from swimmer activity are modeled as spatio-temporally correlated noise. This coarse-grained model, which breaks time-reversal symmetry and detailed balance, successfully reproduces key experimental observations. Furthermore, it reveals a fluctuating microphase separation, where the initial domain growth, following $t^{1/4}$ scaling, is eventually arrested, thereby shedding new light on the microscopic origins of unconventional phase separation of colloids in active liquids.</description>

      <title>Measuring irreversibility by counting: a random coarse-graining framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11586v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermodynamic irreversibility is a fundamental concept in statistical physics, yet its experimental measurement remains challenging, especially for complex systems. We introduce a novel random coarse-graining framework to identify model-free measures of irreversibility in complex many-body systems. These measures are constructed from the asymmetry of cross-correlation functions between suitably chosen observables, providing rigorous lower bounds on entropy production. For many-particle systems, we propose a particularly practical implementation that divides real space into virtual boxes and monitors particle number densities within them, requiring only simple counting from video microscopy, without single-particle tracking, trajectory reconstruction, or prior knowledge of interactions. Owing to its generality and minimal data requirements, the random coarse-graining framework offers broad applicability across diverse nonequilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Enhanced Feature Selection in Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08867v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Feature selection is a machine learning technique for identifying relevant variables in classification and regression models. In single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data analysis, feature selection is used to identify relevant genes that are crucial for understanding cellular processes. Traditional feature selection methods often struggle with the complexity of scRNA-seq data and suffer from interpretation difficulties. Quantum annealing presents a promising alternative approach. In this study, we implement quantum annealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for feature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell differentiation system and an anticancer drug resistance study, we demonstrate that QUBO feature selection effectively identifies genes whose expression patterns reflect critical cell state transitions associated with differentiation and drug resistance development. Our findings indicate that quantum annealing-powered QUBO reveals complex gene expression patterns potentially missed by traditional methods, thereby enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Identifying nonequilibrium degrees of freedom in high-dimensional stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08247v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any coarse-grained description of a nonequilibrium system should faithfully represent its latent irreversible degrees of freedom. However, standard dimensionality reduction methods typically prioritize accurate reconstruction over physical relevance. Here, we introduce a model-free approach to identify irreversible degrees of freedom in stochastic systems that are in a nonequilibrium steady state. Our method leverages the insight that a black-box classifier, trained to differentiate between forward and time-reversed trajectories, implicitly estimates the local entropy production rate. By parameterizing this classifier as a quadratic form of learned state representations, we obtain nonlinear embeddings of high-dimensional state-space dynamics, which we term Latent Embeddings of Nonequilibrium Systems (LENS). LENS effectively identifies low-dimensional irreversible flows and provides a scalable, learning-based strategy for estimating entropy production rates directly from high-dimensional time series data.</description>
