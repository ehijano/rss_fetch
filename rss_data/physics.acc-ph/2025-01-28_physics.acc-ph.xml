      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The proposed construction of new particle accelerator-based facilities in the coming decades -- and upgrades to existing facilities -- provides the unique opportunity to embed innovative environmental impact reduction techniques into their design. This living document provides high-level guidelines to improve environmental sustainability in the planning, construction, operational and decommissioning stages of large accelerator facilities. A collection of various resources is provided, with examples of some existing and suggested practices.</description>

      <title>Transient Finite Element Simulation of Accelerator Magnets Using Thermal Thin Shell Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermal transient responses of superconducting magnets can be simulated using the finite element (FE) method. Some accelerator magnets use cables whose electric insulation is significantly thinner than the bare electric conductor. The FE discretisation of such geometries with high-quality meshes leads to many degrees of freedom. This increases the computational time, particularly since non-linear material properties are involved. In this work, we propose to use a thermal thin-shell approximation (TSA) to improve the computational efficiency when solving the heat diffusion equation in two dimensions. We apply the method to compute the thermal transient response of superconducting accelerator magnets used for CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and High-Luminosity LHC. The TSA collapses thin electrical insulation layers into lines while accurately representing the thermal gradient across the insulation's thickness. The TSA is implemented in the multipole module of the open-source Finite Element Quench Simulator (FiQuS), which can generate the multipole magnet models programmatically from input text files. First, the TSA approach is verified by comparison to classical FE simulations with meshed surface insulation regions for a simple block of four cables and a detailed model of the MBH dipole. The results show that the TSA approach reduces the computational time significantly while preserving the accuracy of the solution. Second, the quench heater (QH) delay computed with the TSA method is compared to measurements for the MBH magnet. To this end, the thermal transient simulation is coupled to a magnetostatic solution to account for magneto-resistive effects. Third, the TSA's full capabilities are showcased in non-linear magneto-thermal simulations of several LHC and HL-LHC superconducting magnet models. The full source code, including all input files, is publicly available.</description>

      <title>Implementation of X-rays production in LegPy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LegPy package has been upgraded by including the production of X-ray fluorescence based on a simple model. Several tests have been done to check the validity of our approximations. This simple model has been sufficient to fix severe deviations of LegPy with respect to the well-established code PENELOPE in those particular cases for which fluorescence emission has a relevant impact.</description>

      <title>Charge separation by standing waves of strongly focused single-cycle terahertz pulses for particle acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16019v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron and ion acceleration in laser beam driven gas and solid-state plasmas are well-known and thoroughly investigated. Here we propose and numerically investigate an ion acceleration scheme using the Coulomb explosion of ion bunches created by separating electron and ion bunches from gas plasma by the standing wave of counter-propagating THz/laser pulse pair(s). The low density and the supposed only few-cycle long THz/laser pulses ensure that much less complicated mechanisms play a role in the separation and acceleration processes, resulting in more predictable outcomes than for single-laser-beam-driven solid-state plasmas. The charge separation is investigated using the EPOCH PIC code. After the charge separation, the ion dynamics ar followed by the GPT code. Calculations predict the generation of relativistic electron bunches and ion bunches with sub-MeV average energy, and with distribution suitable for very efficient use of the accelerated ions in ultrashort-pulse neutron sources.</description>

      <title>Radiation of a particle performing helical motion in a multilayer cylindrical waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: - An algorithm for calculating the radiation field of a charged point particle performing a spiral motion in an infinite cylindrical waveguide with a multilayer side wall is found. The number of layers and their filling is arbitrary. The axis of the spiral is aligned with the axis of the waveguide, so that the geometry of the problem has cylindrical symmetry. Explicit expressions for modal frequency distributions and equations for resonant frequencies for single-layer and double-layer waveguides are given. Examples of graphical constructions of modal frequency distributions of modes for single-layer (resistive), double-layer (metal-dielectric) and triple-layer (metal-dielectric with internal NEG coating) waveguides are presented.</description>

      <title>All-optical compact setup for generation of collimated multi-MeV proton beams with a "snail" target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The work considers an optical scheme for collimation of high-energy proton beams using $\sim 10^5$~T scale magnetic fields induced in a miniature "snail" target by petawatt or multi-petawatt laser irradiation in ps or fs regime. Such magnetic fields are known to be frozen into hot plasma and exist on at least a hundred of picoseconds time-scale, allowing their use for control of charged particle beams. The high values of the magnetic field along with the compact size perfectly match conditions for an all-in-one optical setup, where first, the laser beam accelerates protons, by, e.g. Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA) mechanism, and second, the closely positioned snail target is driven to guide the proton beam. An important issue is that the laser drivers for both proton acceleration schemes and the magnetic field generation in the considered targets may have the same properties, and even be parts of one splitted beam. Numerical simulations show that the considered setup can be used for efficient collimation of $\simeq 100$~MeV protons. The collimation effect weakly depends on the fine magnetic field structure and can be observed both for a simple magneto-dipole field profile and for a more complex coaxial-like profiles accounting for the intricate structure of electric currents in the interaction region. The obtained results are interesting for the development of intense laser-driven sources of charged particle beams with low divergence and high energy of accelerated particles.</description>
