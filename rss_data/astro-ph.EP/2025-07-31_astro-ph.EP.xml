      <title>The Role of Tectonic Luck in Long-Term Habitability of Abiotic Earth-like Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Carbonate-silicate weathering feedback is thought to stabilize Earth's climate on geologic timescales. If climate warms, faster mineral dissolution and increased rainfall speed up weathering, increasing CO2 drawdown and opposing the initial warming. Limits to where this feedback might operate on terrestrial exoplanets with N2-O2-CO2-H2O atmospheres are used to define the 'habitable zone'-the range of orbits around a star where liquid water can be stable on a planet's surface. However, the impacts on long-term habitability of randomly varying volcanic outgassing, tectonic collisions, and tectonic parameters (e.g., number of continental plates, size of plates, plate velocity) remain poorly understood. In this work, we present an idealized and broadly-applicable quasi-2D model of the long-term climate stability of abiotic Earth-twins. The model tracks atmospheric CO2 as 'disks' collide, promoting uplift and supplying new weatherable minerals through erosion. Without resupply, soils become less weatherable and the feedback's strength wanes, making a planet susceptible to catastrophic warming events or hard snowballs where the surface becomes frozen over. We find that tectonic uplift spurred by continental collisions cannot be the sole supplier of weatherable minerals within our model framework, as such climates either become uninhabitably hot (for complex life) as soils become leached of weatherable minerals or experience extreme swings in temperature over short timescales. This conclusion is strengthened when taking into account the destabilizing effects of outgassing variability and increasing stellar luminosity. In addition to frequent collisions, other resupply mechanisms for weatherable minerals, such as wind-driven dust transport, glacial erosion, and/or seafloor weathering, are likely required for long-term stability on Earth-like terrestrial exoplanets.</description>

      <title>On the Interpretation of Velocity Residuals in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-order analytical model for line-of-sight velocity residuals, defined as the difference between observed velocities and those predicted by a fiducial model, assuming a flared, nearly axisymmetric disk with the perturbations in disk surface height $\delta h(r)$, inclination $\delta i(r)$, and position angle $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$. Introducing projection-deprojection mapping between sky-plane and disk-frame coordinates, we demonstrate that the normalized velocity residuals exhibit Fourier components up to the third harmonic ($\sin3\phi$ and $\cos3\phi$). Moreover, we show that the radial profiles of $\delta h(r)$, $\delta i(r)$, and $\delta\mathrm{PA}(r)$ can be uniquely recovered from the data by solving a linear inverse problem. For comparison, we highlight factors that are not considered in previous models. We also outline how our framework can be extended beyond the first-order residuals and applied to additional observables, such as line intensities and widths.</description>

      <title>The Hot Neptune Initiative (HONEI) II. TOI-5795 b: A hot super-Neptune orbiting a metal-poor star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of Neptune planets with orbital periods less than 10\,days remains uncertain. They might have developed similarly to longer-period counterparts, emerged from rare collisions between smaller planets, or could be the remnant cores of stripped giant planets. Characterizing a large number of them is important to advance our understanding of how they form and evolve. We aimed at confirming the planetary nature and characterizing the properties of a close-in Neptune-type transiting exoplanet candidate revealed by TESS around the star TOI-5795 (V = 10.7 mag), 162 pc away from the Sun. We monitored TOI-5795 with the HARPS spectrograph for two months to quantify periodic variations in radial velocity (RV) to estimate the mass of the smaller companion. We combined these RV and TESS photometry. High-angular-resolution speckle and adaptive optics imaging excluded contamination from nearby sources. We found that the parent star is a metal-poor (${\rm [Fe/H]}=-0.27\pm0.07$), G3\,V star ($T_{\rm eff}=5718\pm50$\,K), with $R_{\star}=1.082\pm0.026\,R_{\sun}$, $M_{\star}=0.901^{+0.055}_{-0.037}\,M_{\sun}$ and $10.2^{+2.5}_{-3.3}$\,Gyr. We estimated that the planet has an orbital period of $P_{\rm orb}=6.1406325 \pm 0.0000054$ days and an orbital eccentricity compatible with zero. Having a mass of $23.66^{+4.09}_{-4.60}\,M_{\oplus}$, a radius of $5.62\pm 0.11\,R_{\oplus}$ and an equilibrium temperature of $1136\pm18$\,K, it can be considered as a hot super-Neptune at the edge of the Neptune desert. We simulated planet-formation processes but found almost no successful matches to the observed planet's mass and orbit, suggesting that post-formation dynamical events may have shaped its current state.</description>

      <title>Characterizing planetary systems with SPIRou: Detection of a sub-Neptune in a 6-day period orbit around the M dwarf Gl 410</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03572</link>

Abstract: The search for exoplanets around nearby M dwarfs represents a crucial milestone in the census of planetary systems in the vicinity of our Solar System. Since 2018 our team is carrying a radial-velocity blind search program for planets around nearby M dwarfs with the near-IR spectro-polarimeter and velocimeter SPIRou at the CFHT and the optical velocimeter SOPHIE at the OHP in France. Here we present our results on Gl 410, a 0.55 Msun 480+-150 Myr old active M dwarf distant 12 pc. We used the line-by-line (LBL) technique to measure the RVs with SPIRou and the template matching method with SOPHIE. Three different methods were employed, two based on principal component analysis (PCA), to clean the SPIRou RVs for systematics. We applied Gaussian processes (GP) modeling to correct the SOPHIE RVs for stellar activity. The l1 and apodize sine periodogram analysis was used to search for planetary signals in the SPIRou data taking into account activity indicators. We analyzed TESS data and searched for planetary transits. We report the detection of a M sin(i)=8.4+-1.3 Mearth sub-Neptune planet at a period of 6.020+-0.004 days in circular orbit with SPIRou. The same signal, although with lower significance, was also retrieved in the SOPHIE RV data after correction for activity using a GP trained on SPIRou's longitudinal magnetic field (Bl) measurements. The TESS data indicate that the planet is not transiting. Within the SPIRou wPCA RVs, we find tentative evidence for two additional planetary signals at 2.99 and 18.7 days. In conclusion, infrared RVs are a powerful method to detect extrasolar planets around active M dwarfs. Care should be taken however to correct/filter systematics generated by residuals of the telluric correction or small structures in the detector plane. The LBL technique combined with PCA offers a promising way to reach this objective. Further monitoring of Gl 410 is necessary.</description>

      <title>Hot Rocks Survey III: A deep eclipse for LHS 1140c and a new Gaussian process method to account for correlated noise in individual pixels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-series photometry at mid-infrared wavelengths is becoming a common technique to search for atmospheres around rocky exoplanets. This method constrains the brightness temperature of the planet to determine whether heat redistribution is taking place - indicative of an atmosphere - or whether the heat is reradiated from a low albedo bare rock. By observing at 15$\mu$m we are also highly sensitive to CO$_2$ absorption. We observed three eclipses of the rocky super-Earth LHS 1140c using MIRI/Imaging with the F1500W filter. We found significant variation in the initial settling ramp for these observations and identify a potential trend between detector settling and the previous filter used by MIRI. We analysed our data using aperture photometry but also developed a novel approach which joint-fits pixel light curves directly using a shared eclipse model and a flexible multi-dimensional Gaussian process which models changes in the PSF over time. We demonstrate using simulated data that our method has the ability to weight away from particular pixels which show increased systematics, allowing for the recovery of eclipse depths in a more robust and precise way. Both methods and an independent analysis detect the eclipse at $&gt;5\sigma$ and are highly consistent with a low albedo bare rock. We recover a dayside brightness temperature of $T_\mathrm{day} = 561\pm44$ K, close to the theoretical maximum of $T_\text{day; max} = 537\pm9$ K. We rule out a wide range of atmospheric forward models to $&gt;3\sigma$ including pure CO$_2$ atmospheres with surface pressure $\ge10$ mbar and pure H$_2$O atmospheres with surface pressure $\ge1$ bar. Our strict constraints on potential atmospheric composition, in combination with future observations of the exciting outer planet LHS 1140b, could provide a powerful benchmark to understand atmospheric escape around M dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Light Echoes of Time-resolved Flares and Application to Kepler Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08921v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light echoes of stellar flares provide an intriguing option for exploring protoplanetary disks in young stellar systems. Previous work on light echoes of circumstellar disks made use of delta-function flares for modeling. We present a new model that incorporates echoes produced by extended, time-resolved flares. We then test this model on known disk-bearing stars with Kepler K2 data by estimating disk parameters from possible echo signals. We focus on two stars; the first appears to be a good candidate for use of this echo model, which predicts disk parameters that are consistent with known values. The second star turns out to be more problematic as a result of high brightness variability in its post-peak lightcurve. These two cases show both the promise and limitations of light echoes as a tool for exploring protoplanetary disks in the time domain</description>
