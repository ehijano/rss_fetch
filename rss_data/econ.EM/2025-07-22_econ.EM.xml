      <title>Binary Response Forecasting under a Factor-Augmented Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel factor-augmented forecasting regression model with a binary response variable. We develop a maximum likelihood estimation method for the regression parameters and establish the asymptotic properties of the resulting estimators. Monte Carlo simulation results show that the proposed estimation method performs very well in finite samples. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed model through an application to U.S. recession forecasting. The proposed model consistently outperforms conventional Probit regression across both in-sample and out-of-sample exercises, by effectively utilizing high-dimensional information through latent factors.</description>

      <title>Dyadic data with ordered outcome variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider ordered logit models for directed network data that allow for flexible sender and receiver fixed effects that can vary arbitrarily across outcome categories. This structure poses a significant incidental parameter problem, particularly challenging under network sparsity or when some outcome categories are rare. We develop the first estimation method for this setting by extending tetrad-differencing conditional maximum likelihood (CML) techniques from binary choice network models. This approach yields conditional probabilities free of the fixed effects, enabling consistent estimation even under sparsity. Applying the CML principle to ordered data yields multiple likelihood contributions corresponding to different outcome thresholds. We propose and analyze two distinct estimators based on aggregating these contributions: an Equally-Weighted Tetrad Logit Estimator (ETLE) and a Pooled Tetrad Logit Estimator (PTLE). We prove PTLE is consistent under weaker identification conditions, requiring only sufficient information when pooling across categories, rather than sufficient information in each category. Monte Carlo simulations confirm the theoretical preference for PTLE, and an empirical application to friendship networks among Dutch university students demonstrates the method's value. Our approach reveals significant positive homophily effects for gender, smoking behavior, and academic program similarities, while standard methods without fixed effects produce counterintuitive results.</description>

      <title>Can we have it all? Non-asymptotically valid and asymptotically exact confidence intervals for expectations and linear regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We contribute to bridging the gap between large- and finite-sample inference by studying confidence sets (CSs) that are both non-asymptotically valid and asymptotically exact uniformly (NAVAE) over semi-parametric statistical models. NAVAE CSs are not easily obtained; for instance, we show they do not exist over the set of Bernoulli distributions. We first derive a generic sufficient condition: NAVAE CSs are available as soon as uniform asymptotically exact CSs are. Second, building on that connection, we construct closed-form NAVAE confidence intervals (CIs) in two standard settings -- scalar expectations and linear combinations of OLS coefficients -- under moment conditions only. For expectations, our sole requirement is a bounded kurtosis. In the OLS case, our moment constraints accommodate heteroskedasticity and weak exogeneity of the regressors. Under those conditions, we enlarge the Central Limit Theorem-based CIs, which are asymptotically exact, to ensure non-asymptotic guarantees. Those modifications vanish asymptotically so that our CIs coincide with the classical ones in the limit. We illustrate the potential and limitations of our approach through a simulation study.</description>
