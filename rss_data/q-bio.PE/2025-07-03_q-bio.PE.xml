      <title>A Data-Driven Model Predictive Controller to manage epidemics: The case of SARS-CoV-2 in Mauritius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the benefits of implementing a systematic approach to social isolation policies during epidemics. We develop a mixed integer data-driven model predictive control (MPC) scheme based on an SIHRD model which is identified from available data. The case of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (also known as COVID-19) in Mauritius is used as a reference point with data obtained during the period December 2021 to May 2022. The isolation scheme is designed with the control decision variable taking a finite set of values corresponding to the desired level of isolation. The control input is further restricted to shifting between levels only after a minimum amount of time. The simulation results validate our design, showing that the need for hospitalisation remains within the capacity of the health centres, with the number of deaths considerably reduced by raising the level of isolation for short periods of time with negligible social and economic impact. We also show that the introduction of additional isolation levels results in a smoother containment approach with a considerably reduced hospitalisation burden.</description>

      <title>Coexistence and Extinction in Flow-Kick Systems: An invasion growth rate approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Populations experience a complex interplay of continuous and discrete processes: continuous growth and interactions are punctuated by discrete reproduction events, dispersal, and external disturbances. These dynamics can be modeled by impulsive or flow-kick systems, where continuous flows alternate with instantaneous discrete changes. To study species persistence in these systems, an invasion growth rate theory is developed for flow-kick models with state-dependent timing of kicks and auxiliary variables. The invasion growth rates are Lyapunov exponents characterizing the average per-capita growth of species when rare. Two theorems are proven to characterize permanence i.e. the extinction set is a repellor. The first theorem uses Morse decompositions of the extinction set and requires that there exists a species with a positive invasion growth rate for every invariant measure supported on a component of the Morse decomposition. The second theorem uses invasion growth rates to define invasion graphs whose vertices correspond to communities and directed edges to potential invasions. Provided the invasion graph is acyclic, permanence is fully characterized by the signs of the invasion growth rates. Invasion growth rates are also used to identify the existence of extinction-bound trajectories and attractors that lie on the extinction set. The results are illustrated with three applications: (i) a microbial serial transfer model, (ii) a spatially structured consumer-resource model, and (iii) an empirically parameterized Lotka-Volterra model. Mathematical challenges and promising biological applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>When it pays to teach: a population threshold for dedicated teaching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Teachers hold a prominent place in modern societies, particularly where education is compulsory and widely institutionalized. This ubiquity obscures an underlying question: why do societies designate certain individuals exclusively for the instruction of others? This question is especially enigmatic for dedicated teachers, who invest their labor in cultivating others' skills but do not directly participate in the productive activities for which their students are being trained. To address this puzzle, we develop a simple, mathematically tractable model of teaching and learning in a population with a shared goal. We identify a tradeoff between the size of the workforce and its collective level of expertise; and we analyze the optimal proportion of a population that should serve as teachers across a wide range of scenarios. We show that a population must exceed a critical size before it is beneficial to allocate anyone as a dedicated teacher at all. Subsequently, the peak demand for teachers is achieved at an intermediate population size, and it never surpasses one half of the population. For more complicated tasks, our analysis predicts the optimal allocation of teachers across different levels of expertise. The structure of this teacher allocation is more complex when the population size is large, in agreement with the general size-complexity hypothesis. Our account lays a foundation for understanding the adaptive advantage of dedicated teachers in both human and non-human societies.</description>

      <title>Of lynxes and limetrees: New Insights into the Historical Ecology of the Bavarian Forest on the Threshold of Modernity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the historical ecology of the Bavarian Forest at the threshold of modernity through the lens of a large-scale biodiversity survey conducted in 1845 across the Kingdom of Bavaria. Focusing on the Forestry Office of Zwiesel, the article analyses archival records that document the distribution of animal and tree species during a period of administrative rationalisation and early scientific systematisation. These sources include official correspondence, detailed species inventories, and early distribution maps compiled under the direction of zoologist Johann Andreas Wagner. The study highlights local and regional observations of fauna, such as the Eurasian lynx, capercaillie, and various freshwater fish, and presents new data on historical forest composition, including the presence of rare tree species and venerable specimen trees such as the "Urwaldtanne" and the "Wolframslinde". By integrating historical ecology, environmental history, and digital humanities, the article sheds light on how 19th-century state institutions, scientific actors, and local knowledge contributed to the early documentation of biodiversity. The findings also offer a basis for long-term environmental comparisons and inform current conservation efforts in the region.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic invariants: straightforward from the general Markov to equivariant models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18053v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the last decade, some algebraic tools have been successfully applied to phylogenetic reconstruction. These tools are mainly based on the knowledge of equations describing algebraic varieties associated to phylogenetic trees evolving under Markov processes of molecular substitution, the so called phylogenetic invariants. Although the theory involved allows to explicitly obtain these equations for all equivariant models (which include some of the most popular nucleotide substitution models), practical uses of these algebraic tools have been restricted to the case of the general Markov model. Arguably, one of the reasons for this restriction is that knowledge of linear representation theory is required before making these equations explicit.
  With the aim of enlarging the practical uses of algebraic phylogenetics, in this paper we prove that phylogenetic invariants for trees evolving under equivariant models can be derived from phylogenetic invariants for the general Markov model, without the need of representation theory. Our main result states that the algebraic variety corresponding to a phylogenetic tree evolving under an equivariant model is an irreducible component of the variety corresponding to the same tree under the general Markov model cut with the linear space defined by the model. We also prove that, for any equivariant model, those phylogenetic invariants that are relevant for practical uses (e.g. tree reconstruction) can be simply deduced from a single rank constraint on the matrices obtained by flattening the joint distribution at the leaves of the tree. This condition can be easily tested from singular values of the matrices and extends our results from trees to phylogenetic networks.</description>

      <title>Optimal dosing of anti-cancer treatment under drug-induced plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16391v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While cancer has traditionally been considered a genetic disease, mounting evidence indicates an important role for non-genetic (epigenetic) mechanisms. Common anti-cancer drugs have recently been observed to induce the adoption of non-genetic drug-tolerant cell states, thereby accelerating the evolution of drug resistance. This confounds conventional high-dose treatment strategies aimed at maximal tumor reduction, since high doses can simultaneously promote non-genetic resistance. In this work, we study optimal dosing of anti-cancer treatment under drug-induced cell plasticity. We show that the optimal dosing strategy steers the tumor to a fixed equilibrium composition between sensitive and tolerant cells, while precisely balancing the trade-off between cell kill and tolerance induction. The optimal equilibrium strategy ranges from applying a low dose continuously to applying the maximum dose intermittently, depending on the dynamics of tolerance induction. We finally discuss how our approach can be integrated with in vitro data to derive patient-specific treatment insights.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneously structured compartmental models of epidemiological systems: from individual-level processes to population-scale dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a general modelling framework for compartmental epidemiological systems structured by continuous variables which are linked to the levels of expression of compartment-specific traits. We start by formulating an individual-based model that describes the dynamics of single individuals in terms of stochastic processes. Then we formally derive: (i) the mesoscopic counterpart of this model, which is formulated as a system of integro-differential equations for the distributions of individuals over the structuring-variable domains of the different compartments; (ii) the corresponding macroscopic model, which takes the form of a system of ordinary differential equations for the fractions of individuals in the different compartments and the mean levels of expression of the traits represented by the structuring variables. We employ a reduced version of the macroscopic model to obtain a general formula for the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_0$, in terms of key parameters and functions of the underlying microscopic model, so as to illustrate how such a modelling framework makes it possible to draw connections between fundamental individual-level processes and population-scale dynamics. Finally we apply the modelling framework to case studies based on classical compartmental epidemiological systems, for each of which we report on Monte Carlo simulations of the individual-based model as well as on analytical results and numerical solutions of the macroscopic model.</description>
