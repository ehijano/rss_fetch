      <title>Machine Learning (ML) based Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) for linear and non-linear solid and structural mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple model reduction techniques have been proposed to tackle linear and non linear problems. Intrusive model order reduction techniques exhibit high accuracy levels, however, they are rarely used as a standalone industrial tool, because of the required high level knowledge involved in the construction and usage of these techniques. Moreover, the computation time benefit is compromised for highly nonlinear problems. On the other hand, non-intrusive methods often struggle with accuracy in nonlinear cases, typically requiring a large design of experiment and a large number of snapshots achieve a reliable performance. However, generating the stiffness matrix in a non-intrusive approach presents an optimal way to align accuracy with efficiency, allying the advantages of both intrusive and non-intrusive methods.This work introduces a lightly intrusive model order reduction technique that employs machine learning within a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition framework to achieve this alliance. By leveraging outputs from commercial full-order models, this method constructs a reduced-order model that operates effectively without requiring expert user intervention. The proposed technique has the possibility to approximate linear non affine as well as non linear terms. It is showcased for linear and nonlinear structural mechanics problems.</description>

      <title>Foundation Model for Composite Microstructures: Reconstruction, Stiffness, and Nonlinear Behavior Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06565v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning has unlocked numerous opportunities for materials science, particularly in accelerating the design and analysis of materials. However, a significant challenge lies in the scarcity and high cost of obtaining high-quality materials datasets. While foundation models pre-trained on large datasets have excelled in fields like natural language processing by leveraging latent features through transfer learning, their application in materials science remains limited. Here, we present a foundation model specifically designed for composite materials. Pre-trained on a dataset of short-fiber composites to learn robust latent features, the model accurately predicts homogenized stiffness during transfer learning, even with limited training data. Additionally, our model effectively predicts the material's nonlinear behavior by transferring these learned features to an Interaction-based Material Network, which is a constitutive surrogate model. These results demonstrate the potential of our foundation model to capture complex material behaviors. Our findings validate the feasibility and effectiveness of foundation models in composite materials. We anticipate extending this approach to more complex three-dimensional composite materials, polycrystalline materials, and beyond. Moreover, this framework enables high-accuracy predictions even when experimental data are scarce, paving the way for more efficient and cost-effective materials design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Unifying monitoring and modelling of water concentration levels in surface waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of expected concentrations is essential for effective catchment management, requiring both extensive monitoring and advanced modeling techniques. However, due to limitations in the equation solving capacity, the integration of monitoring and modeling has been suffering suboptimal statistical approaches. This limitation results in models that can only partially leverage monitoring data, thus being an obstacle for realistic uncertainty assessments by overlooking critical correlations between both measurements and model parameters. This study presents a novel solution that integrates catchment monitoring and a unified hieratical statistical catchment modeling that employs a log-normal distribution for residuals within a left-censored likelihood function to address measurements below detection limits. This enables the estimation of concentrations within sub-catchments in conjunction with a source/fate sub-catchment model and monitoring data. This approach is possible due to a model builder R package denoted RTMB. The proposed approach introduces a statistical paradigm based on a hierarchical structure, capable of accommodating heterogeneous sampling across various sampling locations and the authors suggest that this also will encourage further refinement of other existing modeling platforms within the scientific community to improve synergy with monitoring programs. The application of the method is demonstrated through an analysis of nickel concentrations in Danish surface waters.</description>

      <title>Learning Latent Hardening (LLH): Enhancing Deep Learning with Domain Knowledge for Material Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in deep learning and machine learning have improved the ability to model complex, nonlinear relationships, such as those encountered in complex material inverse problems. However, the effectiveness of these methods often depends on large datasets, which are not always available. In this study, the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge of the mechanical behavior of material microstructures is investigated to evaluate the impact on the predictive performance of the models in data-scarce scenarios. To overcome data limitations, a two-step framework, Learning Latent Hardening (LLH), is proposed. In the first step of LLH, a Deep Neural Network is employed to reconstruct full stress-strain curves from randomly selected portions of the stress-strain curves to capture the latent mechanical response of a material based on key microstructural features. In the second step of LLH, the results of the reconstructed stress-strain curves are leveraged to predict key microstructural features of porous materials. The performance of six deep learning and/or machine learning models trained with and without domain knowledge are compared: Convolutional Neural Networks, Deep Neural Networks, Extreme Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, Long Short-Term Memory, and Random Forest. The results from the models with domain-specific information consistently achieved higher $R^2$ values compared to models without prior knowledge. Models without domain knowledge missed critical patterns linking stress-strain behavior to microstructural changes, whereas domain-informed models better identified essential stress-strain features predictive of microstructure. These findings highlight the importance of integrating domain-specific knowledge with deep learning to achieve accurate outcomes in materials science.</description>
