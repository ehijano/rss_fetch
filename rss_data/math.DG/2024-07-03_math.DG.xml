      <title>Deformations of curves with constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that curves of constant curvature satisfy the parametric $C^1$-dense relative $h$-principle in the space of immersed curves with nonvanishing curvature in Euclidean space $R^{n\geq 3}$. It follows that two knots of constant curvature in $R^3$ are isotopic, resp. homotopic, through curves of constant curvature if and only if they are isotopic, resp. homotopic, and their self-linking numbers, resp. self-linking numbers mod $2$, are equal.</description>

      <title>Mabuchi K\"ahler solitons versus extremal K\"ahler metrics and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Yau-Tian-Donaldson type correspondence for $v$-solitons established by Han-Li, we show that a smooth complex $n$-dimensional Fano variety admits a Mabuchi soliton provided it admits an extremal K\"ahler metric whose scalar curvature is strictly less than $2(n+1)$. Combined with previous observations by Mabuchi and Nakamura in the other direction, this gives a characterization of the existence of Mabuchi solitons in terms of the existence of extremal K\"ahler metrics on Fano manifolds. An extension of this correspondence to $v$-solitons is also obtained.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic systolic growth for hyperbolic surfaces in every genus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than thirty years ago, Brooks and Buser-Sarnak constructed sequences of closed hyperbolic surfaces with logarithmic systolic growth in the genus. Recently, Liu and Petri showed that such logarithmic systolic lower bound holds for every genus (not merely for genera in some infinite sequence) using random surfaces. In this article, we show a similar result through a more direct approach relying on the original Brooks/Buser-Sarnak surfaces.</description>

      <title>SKT solvable Lie algebras with codimension two nilradical</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper we study SKT and generalized K\"ahler structures on solvable Lie algebras with (not necessarily abelian) codimension two nilradical. We treat separately the case of $J$-invariant nilradical and non $J$-invariant nilradical. A classification of such SKT Lie algebras in dimension six is provided. In particular, we give a general construction to extend SKT nilpotent Lie algebras to SKT solvable Lie algebras of higher dimension, and we construct new examples of SKT and generalized K\"ahler compact solvmanifolds.</description>

      <title>Sard properties for polynomial maps in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Sard conjecture in sub-Riemannian geometry, and more specifically on Carnot groups, we consider the set of maps defined on a Hilbert space $H$: \[\mathscr{P}_{d}^m(H)=\bigg\{f:H\to \mathbb{R}^m\,\bigg|\, \forall\, E\subset H, \,\dim(E)&lt;\infty \implies f|_{E} \textrm{ is a polynomial map of degree $d$}\bigg\}.
  \] Example of maps belonging to this class are: the map $f:\ell^2\to \mathbb{R}$ constructed by Kukpa as a counterexample for the Sard theorem in infinite dimension; the Endpoint maps of Carnot groups.
  We prove that, for infinite-dimensional subspaces $V \subset H$ satisfying quantitative assumptions on their Kolmogorov $n$-width, the restriction of $f$ on $V$ has the Sard property, i.e. the set of critical values of $f|_{V}$ has measure zero in $\mathbb{R}^m$. We prove various quantitative versions of this result, allowing to study the Sard property also for the case $V=H$. By constructing suitable examples, we prove the sharpness of our $n$-width assumptions.
  We apply these results to sub-Riemannian geometry, proving that on Carnot groups the Sard property holds true for the restriction of the Endpoint map on the set of real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence. This is a more functional-analytic approach to the Sard conjecture that, unlike previous ones, does not resort to reduction to finite-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Li-Yau Conformal Volume and Colding-Minicozzi Entropy of Self-Shrinkers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show the (normalized) Li-Yau conformal volume of a self-shrinker of mean curvature flow in Euclidean space bounds its Colding-Minicozzi entropy from below. This bound is independent of codimension and sharp on planes. As an application we verify a conjecture of Colding-Minicozzi about the entropy of closed self-shrinkers of arbitrary codimension for self-shrinkers that are topologically two-dimensional real projective planes. As part of the proof we introduce two auxiliary functionals which we call stable conformal volume and virtual entropy which should be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Quasiregular curves: Removability of singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a Painlev\'e theorem for bounded quasiregular curves in Euclidean spaces extending removability results for quasiregular mappings due to Iwaniec and Martin. The theorem is proved by extending a fundamental inequality for volume forms to calibrations and proving a Caccioppoli inequality for quasiregular curves.
  We also establish a qualitatively sharp removability theorem for quasiregular curves whose target is a complete Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature bounded from above. As an application, we extend a theorem of Bonk and Heinonen for quasiregular mappings to the setting of quasiregular curves: every non-constant quasiregular $\omega$-curve from $\mathbb{R}^n$ into $( N, \omega )$, where the bounded cohomology class of $\omega$ is in the bounded K\"unneth ideal, has infinite energy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we investigate Gromov-Hausdorff limits of compact surfaces carrying length metrics. More precisely, we consider the case where all surfaces have the same Euler characteristic. We give a complete description of the limit spaces and study their topological properties. Our investigation builds on the results of a previous work which treats the case of closed surfaces.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider a critical Grushin-type problem, which is closely related to the prescribed Webster scalar curvature problems on the CR sphere with cylindrically symmetric curvature. We first prove a non-degeneracy result through local Pohozaev identities, then by using the Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction methods, we construct new type of multi-bubbling solutions with cylindrical symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.02169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spheres are among the most studied examples of compact quantum spaces, described by C*-algebras which are Cuntz-Krieger algebras of a directed graph, as proved by Hong and Szyma\'nski in 2002. About five years earlier, in 1997, Sheu proved that the C*-algebra of a quantum sphere is a groupoid C*-algebra. Here we show that the path groupoid of the directed graph of Hong and Szyma\'nski is isomorphic to the groupoid discovered by Sheu.</description>

      <title>Time functions on Lorentzian length spaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.02693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In general relativity, time functions are crucial objects whose existence and properties are intimately tied to the causal structure of a spacetime and also to the initial value formulation of the Einstein equations. In this work we establish all fundamental classical existence results on time functions in the setting of Lorentzian (pre-)length spaces (including causally plain continuous spacetimes, closed cone fields and even more singular spaces). More precisely, we characterize the existence of time functions by $K$-causality, show that a modified notion of Geroch's volume functions are time functions if and only if the space is causally continuous, and lastly, characterize global hyperbolicity by the existence of Cauchy time functions, and Cauchy sets. Our results thus inevitably show that no manifold structure is needed in order to obtain suitable time functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.11712v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: On symplectic manifolds, we introduce a Morse-type complex with elements generated by pairs of critical points of a Morse function. The differential of the complex consists of gradient flows and an integration of the symplectic structure over spaces of gradient flow lines. Using the Witten deformation method, we prove that the cohomology of this complex is independent of both the Riemannian metric and the Morse function used to define the complex and is in fact isomorphic to the cohomology of differential forms of Tsai, Tseng and Yau (TTY). We also obtain Morse-type inequalities that bound the dimensions of the TTY cohomologies by the number of Morse critical points and the interaction of symplectic structure with the critical points.</description>

      <title>On the symplectic geometry of $A_k$ singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.01814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a complete symplectic classification of $A_k$ Hamiltonians on $\mathbb R^2$, in the analytic and smooth categories. Precisely, consider the pair $(H, \omega)$ consisting of a Hamiltonian and a symplectic structure on $\mathbb R^2$ such that $H$ has an $A_{k-1}$ singularity at the origin with $k\geq 2$. We classify such pairs near the origin, up to fiberwise symplectomorphisms, and up to $H$-preserving symplectomorphisms. The classification is obtained by bringing the pair $(H, \omega)$ to a symplectic normal form $$\big(H = \xi^2 \pm x^k, \ \omega = d (f d \xi)\big), \quad f = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} x^i f_i(x^k),$$ modulo some relations which are explicitly given. We also show that the group of $H$-preserving symplectomorphisms of an $A_{k-1}$ singularity for $k$ odd consists of symplectomorphisms that can be included into a $C^\infty$-smooth (resp., real-analytic) $H$-preserving flow, whereas for $k$ even with $k \ge 4$ the same is true modulo the $\mathbb Z_2$-subgroup generated by the involution $Inv(x,\xi) = (-x,-\xi)$. The paper is concluded with a brief discussion of the conjecture that the symplectic invariants of $A_{k-1}$ singularities are spectrally determined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a framework to classify hyperbolic monopoles with continuous symmetries and find a Structure Theorem, greatly simplifying the construction of all those with spherically symmetry. In doing so, we reduce the problem of finding spherically symmetric hyperbolic monopoles to a problem in representation theory. Additionally, we determine constraints on the structure groups of such monopoles. Using these results, we construct novel spherically symmetric $\mathrm{Sp}(n)$ hyperbolic monopoles.</description>
