      <title>Analyzing Communicability and Connectivity in the Indian Stock Market During Crises</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In financial networks, information does not always follow the shortest path between two nodes but may also take alternate routes. Communicability, a network measure, resolves this complexity and, in diffusion-like processes, provides a reliable measure of the ease with which information flows between nodes. As a result, communicability appears to be an important measure for detecting disturbances in connectivity within financial systems, similar to instability caused by periods of high volatility. This study investigates the evolution of communicability measures in the stock networks during periods of crises, showing how systemic shocks strengthen the pairwise interdependence between stocks in the financial market. In this study, the permutation test reveals that approximately 83.5 per cent of stock pairs were found to be statistically significant at the significance level of 0.001 and have an increase in the shortest communicability path length during the crisis than the normal days, indicating enhanced interdependence and heightened information flow in the market. Furthermore, we show that when employed as features in the classification model, the network shortest path-based measures, along with communicability measures, are able to accurately classify between the times periods of market stability and volatility. Additionally, our results show that the geometric measures perform better in terms of classification accuracy than topological measures. These findings provide important insights into market behaviour during times of increased volatility and advance our understanding of the financial market crisis.</description>
