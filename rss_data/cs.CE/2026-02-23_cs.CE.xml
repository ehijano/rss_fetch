      <title>Domain-Decomposed Lagrangian Data Assimilation for Drifting Sea-Ice Floe Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sea ice dynamics are crucial to the global climate system, yet traditional continuum (e.g., viscous-plastic) models often fail to represent the discrete floe interactions that dominate in the marginal ice zone. Lagrangian discrete element methods (DEMs) resolve floe-scale physics more realistically, but their high particle counts make ensemble data assimilation (DA) more expensive. We consider a highly-simplified floe model and propose a scalable, domain-decomposed DA framework that couples Lagrangian particle observations with an ensemble transform Kalman filter (ETKF) to recover the underlying ocean flow field in a multiscale setting. The Eulerian domain is first partitioned into subdomains. We then impose an ETKF in each subdomain to recover the local fine-scale ocean features. A Gaussian-weighted blending step then reconstructs a globally consistent flow field across subdomain boundaries. Numerical experiments demonstrate consistently better skill scores that are characterised by normalised root mean square error (NRMSE) and pattern correlation coefficients (PCC), compared to the global and expensive DA baseline. Results suggest that the domain-decomposed DA method is an alternative, scalable approach for particle-based sea-ice floe dynamics and ocean flow recovery.</description>

      <title>PINEAPPLE: Physics-Informed Neuro-Evolution Algorithm for Prognostic Parameter Inference in Lithium-Ion Battery Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate, real-time, yet non-destructive estimation of internal states in lithium-ion batteries is critical for predicting degradation, optimizing usage strategies, and extending operational lifespan. Here, we introduce PINEAPPLE (Physics-Informed Neuro-Evolution Algorithm for Prognostic Parameter inference in Lithium-ion battery Electrodes), a novel framework that integrates physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with an evolutionary search algorithm to enable rapid, scalable, and interpretable parameter inference with potential for application to next-generation batteries. The meta-learned PINN utilizes fundamental physics principles to achieve accurate zero-shot prediction of electrode behavior with test errors below 0.1$\%$ while maintaining an order-of-magnitude speed-up over conventional solvers. PINEAPPLE demonstrates robust parameter inference solely from voltage-time discharge curves across multiple batteries from the open-source CALCE repository, recovering the evolution of key internal state parameters such as Li-ion diffusion coefficients across usage cycles. Notably, the inferred cycle-dependent evolution of these parameters exhibit consistent trends across different batteries without any customized degradation physics-embedded heuristic, highlighting the effective regularizing effect and robustness that can be conferred through incorporation of fundamental physics in PINEAPPLE. By enabling computationally efficient, real-time parameter estimation, PINEAPPLE offers a promising route towards the non-destructive, physics-based characterization of inter-cell and intra-cell variability of battery modules and battery packs, thereby unlocking new opportunities for downstream on-the-fly needs in next-generation battery management systems such as individual cell-scale state-of-health diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of different quadrature methods for cut elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quadrature of cut elements is crucial for all Finite Element Methods that do not apply boundary-fitted meshes. It should be efficient, accurate, and robust. Various approaches balancing these requirements have been published, with some available as open-source implementations. This work reviews these open-sources codes and the methods used. Furthermore, benchmarking examples are developed for 2D and 3D geometries. Implicit and explicit boundary descriptions are available for all models. The different examples test the efficiency, accuracy, versatility, and robustness of the codes. Special focus is set on the influence of the input parameter, which controls the desired quadrature order, on the actual integration error. A detailed comparison of the discussed codes is carried out. The benchmarking allows a conclusive comparison and presents a valuable tool for future code development. All tests are published in an accompanying open-source repository.</description>

      <title>Context-Aware Mapping of 2D Drawing Annotations to 3D CAD Features Using LLM-Assisted Reasoning for Manufacturing Automation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.18296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.18296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Manufacturing automation in process planning, inspection planning, and digital-thread integration depends on a unified specification that binds the geometric features of a 3D CAD model to the geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&amp;T) callouts, datum definitions, and surface requirements carried by the corresponding 2D engineering drawing. Although Model-Based Definition (MBD) allows such specifications to be embedded directly in 3D models, 2D drawings remain the primary carrier of manufacturing intent in automotive, aerospace, shipbuilding, and heavy-machinery industries. Correctly linking drawing annotations to the corresponding 3D features is difficult because of contextual ambiguity, repeated feature patterns, and the need for transparent and traceable decisions. This paper presents a deterministic-first, context-aware framework that maps 2D drawing entities to 3D CAD features to produce a unified manufacturing specification. Drawing callouts are first semantically enriched and then scored against candidate features using an interpretable metric that combines type compatibility, tolerance-aware dimensional agreement, and conservative context consistency, along with engineering-domain heuristics. When deterministic scoring cannot resolve an ambiguity, the system escalates to multimodal and constrained large-language-model reasoning, followed by a single human-in-the-loop (HITL) review step. Experiments on 20 real CAD-drawing pairs achieve a mean precision of 83.67%, recall of 90.46%, and F1 score of 86.29%. An ablation study shows that each pipeline component contributes to overall accuracy, with the full system outperforming all reduced variants. By prioritizing deterministic rules, clear decision tracking, and retaining unresolved cases for human review, the framework provides a practical foundation for downstream manufacturing automation in real-world industrial environments.</description>

      <title>StableAML: Machine Learning for Behavioral Wallet Detection in Stablecoin Anti-Money Laundering on Ethereum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global illicit fund flows exceed an estimated $3.1 trillion annually, with stablecoins emerging as a preferred laundering medium due to their liquidity. While decentralized protocols increasingly adopt zero-knowledge proofs to obfuscate transaction graphs, centralized stablecoins remain critical "transparent choke points" for compliance. Leveraging this persistent visibility, this study analyzes an Ethereum dataset and uses behavioral features to develop a robust AML framework. Our findings demonstrate that domain-informed tree ensemble models achieve higher Macro-F1 score, significantly outperforming graph neural networks, which struggle with the increasing fragmentation of transaction networks. The model's interpretability goes beyond binary detection, successfully dissecting distinct typologies: it differentiates the complex, high-velocity dispersion of cybercrime syndicates from the constrained, static footprints left by sanctioned entities. This framework aligns with the industry shift toward deterministic verification, satisfying the auditability and compliance expectations under regulations such as the EU's MiCA and the U.S. GENIUS Act while minimizing unjustified asset freezes. By automating high-precision detection, we propose an approach that effectively raises the economic cost of financial misconduct without stifling innovation.</description>

      <title>PHAST: Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal Dynamics Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real physical systems are dissipative -- a pendulum slows, a circuit loses charge to heat -- and forecasting their dynamics from partial observations is a central challenge in scientific machine learning. We address the \emph{position-only} (q-only) problem: given only generalized positions~$q_t$ at discrete times (momenta~$p_t$ latent), learn a structured model that (a)~produces stable long-horizon forecasts and (b)~recovers physically meaningful parameters when sufficient structure is provided. The port-Hamiltonian framework makes the conservative-dissipative split explicit via $\dot{x}=(J-R)\nabla H(x)$, guaranteeing $dH/dt\le 0$ when $R\succeq 0$. We introduce \textbf{PHAST} (Port-Hamiltonian Architecture for Structured Temporal dynamics), which decomposes the Hamiltonian into potential~$V(q)$, mass~$M(q)$, and damping~$D(q)$ across three knowledge regimes (KNOWN, PARTIAL, UNKNOWN), uses efficient low-rank PSD/SPD parameterizations, and advances dynamics with Strang splitting. Across thirteen q-only benchmarks spanning mechanical, electrical, molecular, thermal, gravitational, and ecological systems, PHAST achieves the best long-horizon forecasting among competitive baselines and enables physically meaningful parameter recovery when the regime provides sufficient anchors. We show that identification is fundamentally ill-posed without such anchors (gauge freedom), motivating a two-axis evaluation that separates forecasting stability from identifiability.</description>

      <title>The Kinematics and Dynamics Theories of a Total Lagrangian Finite Element Analysis Framework for Finite Deformation Multibody Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work presents a Total Lagrangian finite element formulation for deformable body dynamics. We employ the TL-FEA framework to simulate the time evolution of collections of bodies whose motion is constrained by kinematic constraints and which mutually interact through contact and friction. These bodies experience large displacements, large deformations, and large rotations. A systematic approach is proposed for classifying and posing kinematic constraints acting between the bodies present in the system. We derive the governing equations for ANCF beam, ANCF shell, and tetrahedral elements, and present hyperelastic material models including St. Venant-Kirchhoff and Mooney-Rivlin formulations with their corresponding internal force contributions and consistent tangent stiffness matrices. A finite-strain Kelvin-Voigt viscous damping model is incorporated in the TL-FEA formulation for numerical stability.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamically consistent machine learning model for excess Gibbs energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and chemistry, providing a basis for modeling thermodynamic properties of liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures solely from molecular structures is a long-standing challenge. We address this challenge with HANNA, a flexible machine learning model for excess Gibbs energy that integrates physical laws as hard constraints, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent predictions. HANNA is trained on experimental data for vapor-liquid equilibria, liquid-liquid equilibria, activity coefficients at infinite dilution and excess enthalpies in binary mixtures. The end-to-end training on liquid-liquid equilibrium data is facilitated by a surrogate solver. A geometric projection method enables robust extrapolations to multi-component mixtures. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers accurate predictions, while providing a substantially broader domain of applicability than state-of-the-art benchmark methods. The trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive interface is provided on our website, MLPROP.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for uncertainty quantification of tumor growth modeled by a parametric semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the application of a quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method to a class of semi-linear parabolic reaction-diffusion partial differential equations used to model tumor growth. Mathematical models of tumor growth are largely phenomenological in nature, capturing infiltration of the tumor into surrounding healthy tissue, proliferation of the existing tumor, and patient response to therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Considerable inter-patient variability, inherent heterogeneity of the disease, sparse and noisy data collection, and model inadequacy all contribute to significant uncertainty in the model parameters. It is crucial that these uncertainties can be efficiently propagated through the model to compute quantities of interest (QoIs), which in turn may be used to inform clinical decisions. We show that QMC methods can be successful in computing expectations of meaningful QoIs. Well-posedness results are developed for the model and used to show a theoretical error bound for the case of uniform random fields. The theoretical linear error rate, which is superior to that of standard Monte Carlo, is verified numerically. Encouraging computational results are also provided for lognormal random fields, prompting further theoretical development.</description>
