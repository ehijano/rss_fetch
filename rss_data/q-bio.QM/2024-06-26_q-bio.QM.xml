      <title>A large language model for predicting T cell receptor-antigen binding specificity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human immune response depends on the binding of T-cell receptors (TCRs) to antigens (pTCR), which elicits the T cells to eliminate viruses, tumor cells, and other pathogens. The ability of human immunity system responding to unknown viruses and bacteria stems from the TCR diversity. However, this vast diversity poses challenges on the TCR-antigen binding prediction methods. In this study, we propose a Masked Language Model (MLM), referred to as tcrLM, to overcome limitations in model generalization. Specifically, we randomly masked sequence segments and train tcrLM to infer the masked segment, thereby extract expressive feature from TCR sequences. Meanwhile, we introduced virtual adversarial training techniques to enhance the model's robustness. We built the largest TCR CDR3 sequence dataset to date (comprising 2,277,773,840 residuals), and pre-trained tcrLM on this dataset. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that tcrLM achieved AUC values of 0.937 and 0.933 on independent test sets and external validation sets, respectively, which remarkably outperformed four previously published prediction methods. On a large-scale COVID-19 pTCR binding test set, our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art method by at least 8%, highlighting the generalizability of our method. Furthermore, we validated that our approach effectively predicts immunotherapy response and clinical outcomes on a clinical cohorts. These findings clearly indicate that tcrLM exhibits significant potential in predicting antigenic immunogenicity.</description>

      <title>BrainMAE: A Region-aware Self-supervised Learning Framework for Brain Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The human brain is a complex, dynamic network, which is commonly studied using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and modeled as network of Regions of interest (ROIs) for understanding various brain functions. Recent studies utilize deep learning approaches to learn the brain network representation based on functional connectivity (FC) profile, broadly falling into two main categories. The Fixed-FC approaches, utilizing the FC profile which represents the linear temporal relation within the brain network, are limited by failing to capture informative brain temporal dynamics. On the other hand, the Dynamic-FC approaches, modeling the evolving FC profile over time, often exhibit less satisfactory performance due to challenges in handling the inherent noisy nature of fMRI data.
  To address these challenges, we propose Brain Masked Auto-Encoder (BrainMAE) for learning representations directly from fMRI time-series data. Our approach incorporates two essential components: a region-aware graph attention mechanism designed to capture the relationships between different brain ROIs, and a novel self-supervised masked autoencoding framework for effective model pre-training. These components enable the model to capture rich temporal dynamics of brain activity while maintaining resilience to inherent noise in fMRI data. Our experiments demonstrate that BrainMAE consistently outperforms established baseline methods by significant margins in four distinct downstream tasks. Finally, leveraging the model's inherent interpretability, our analysis of model-generated representations reveals findings that resonate with ongoing research in the field of neuroscience.</description>

      <title>Exploring Biomarker Relationships in Both Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Through a Bayesian Network Analysis Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the complex relationships of biomarkers in diabetes is pivotal for advancing treatment strategies, a pressing need in diabetes research. This study applies Bayesian network structure learning to analyze the Shanghai Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes mellitus datasets, revealing complex relationships among key diabetes-related biomarkers. The constructed Bayesian network presented notable predictive accuracy, particularly for Type 2 diabetes mellitus, with root mean squared error (RMSE) of 18.23 mg/dL, as validated through leave-one-domain experiments and Clarke error grid analysis. This study not only elucidates the intricate dynamics of diabetes through a deeper understanding of biomarker interplay but also underscores the significant potential of integrating data-driven and knowledge-driven methodologies in the realm of personalized diabetes management. Such an approach paves the way for more custom and effective treatment strategies, marking a notable advancement in the field.</description>

      <title>Moment-based parameter inference with error guarantees for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of models of biochemical kinetics from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose an inference method for stochastic reaction networks with nonlinear and rational propensities at steady state that provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimisation over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices. Our approach takes observations from the stochastic reaction network and forms moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true stationary moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem), and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common nonlinear biochemical models including the Schl\"ogl model, the toggle switch and post-transcriptional regulation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Aspects, Engineering and Optimization of Bacterial Sensor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bacterial sensor systems can be used for the detection and measurement of molecular signal concentrations. The dynamics of the sensor directly depend on the biological properties of the bacterial sensor cells; manipulation of these features in the wet lab enables the engineering and optimization of the bacterial sensor kinetics. This necessitates the development of biologically meaningful computational models for bacterial sensors comprising a variety of different molecular mechanisms, which further facilitates a systematic and quantitative evaluation of optimization strategies. In this work, we dissect the detection chain of bacterial sensors from a mathematical perspective from which we derive, supported by wet-lab data, a complete computational model for a Streptococcus mutans-based bacterial sensor as a case example. We address the engineering of bacterial sensors by investigating the impact of altered bacterial cell properties on the sensor response characteristics, specifically sensor sensitivity and response signal intensity. This is achieved through a sensitivity analysis targeting both the steady-state and transient sensor response characteristics. Alongside the demonstration of suitability of our methodological approach, our analysis shows that an increase of sensor sensitivity, through a targeted manipulation of bacterial physiology, often comes at the cost of generally diminished sensor response intensity.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Heterogeneous Ecosystem Services With Multi-Label Soft Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and quantifying ecosystem services are crucial for sustainable environmental management, conservation efforts, and policy-making. The advancement of remote sensing technology and machine learning techniques has greatly facilitated this process. Yet, ground truth labels, such as biodiversity, are very difficult and expensive to measure. In addition, more easily obtainable proxy labels, such as land use, often fail to capture the complex heterogeneity of the ecosystem. In this paper, we demonstrate how land use proxy labels can be implemented with a soft, multi-label classifier to predict ecosystem services with complex heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Validation of contact mechanics models for Atomic Force Microscopy via Finite Elements Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we have validated the application of Hertzian contact mechanics models and corrections in the framework of linear elasticity for the analysis of force vs indentation curves acquired using spherical indenters by means of finite elements simulations. We have systematically investigated the impact of both large indentations and vertical spatial confinement (bottom effect) on the accuracy of the nanomechanical analysis performed with the Hertz model for the parabolic indenter compared to the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter.We carried out a comprehensive characterization of the corrections for the Hertz model proposed in the literature in the framework of linearized force vs indentation curves, as well as a validation of a linearized form of the Sneddon model for the spherical indenter and of the combined correction for large indentations and bottom effect.Our results show that the corrected Hertz model in combination with the use of a spherical indenter allows to accurately quantify the Young's modulus of elasticity of linearly elastic samples and represent a powerful toolkit to analyse experimental data acquired using micrometre-sized colloidal probes on samples with variable thickness at arbitrarily large indentations.</description>

      <title>Ranking nodes in bipartite systems with a non-linear iterative map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method based on a non-linear iterative map to evaluate node relevance in bipartite networks. By tuning a single parameter gamma, the method captures different concepts of node importance, including established measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and the fitness-complexity ranking used in economics. The algorithm's flexibility allows for efficient ranking optimization tailored to specific tasks. As an illustrative example, we apply this method to ecological mutualistic networks, where ranking quality can be assessed by the extinction area - the rate at which the system collapses when species are removed in a certain order. The map with the optimal gamma value, which is dataset-specific, surpasses existing ranking methods on this task. Additionally, our method excels in evaluating nestedness, another crucial structural property of ecological systems, requiring specific node rankings. The final part of the paper explores the theoretical aspects of the map, revealing a phase transition at a critical $\gamma$ value dependent on the data structure that can be characterized analytically for random networks. Near the critical point, the map exhibits unique features and a distinctive triangular packing pattern of the adjacency matrix.</description>
