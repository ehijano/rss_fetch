      <title>Supercharging Packet-level Network Simulation of Large Model Training via Memoization and Fast-Forwarding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Packet-level discrete-event simulation (PLDES) is a prevalent tool for evaluating detailed performance of large model training. Although PLDES offers high fidelity and generality, its slow performance has plagued networking practitioners. Existing optimization techniques either simplify the network model, resulting in large errors; or execute it in parallel using multiple processors, with an upper bound on speedup. This paper explores an alternative optimization direction that reduces the computational loads of PLDES while maintaining high fidelity. Our key insight is that, in distributed LLM training, packet-level traffic behaviors often exhibit repetitive contention patterns and steady-states where flow rates stabilize, ignoring these redundant discrete events speeds up the simulation considerably and the error is negligible. We realize this idea by proposing Wormhole, a user-transparent PLDES kernel capable of automatically memoization for unsteady-states and skipping for steady-states. Wormhole adopts network partitioning, state memoization and reuse, and rate-based steady-state identification to accurately determine the periods of each flow's steady-state, while maintaining simulation consistency after fast-forwarding. Experiments demonstrate that Wormhole can achieve a 744x speedup over the original ns-3 (510x for MoE workload), with a bounded error of &lt;1%. Applying current multithreading parallel techniques and Wormhole together allows a 1012x speedup, reducing the simulation time for one GPT-13B training under 128 GPUs from 9 hours to 5 minutes.</description>

      <title>Resource-Efficient RGB-Only Action Recognition for Edge Deployment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Action recognition on edge devices poses stringent constraints on latency, memory, storage, and power consumption. While auxiliary modalities such as skeleton and depth information can enhance recognition performance, they often require additional sensors or computationally expensive pose-estimation pipelines, limiting practicality for edge use. In this work, we propose a compact RGB-only network tailored for efficient on-device inference. Our approach builds upon an X3D-style backbone augmented with Temporal Shift, and further introduces selective temporal adaptation and parameter-free attention. Extensive experiments on the NTU RGB+D 60 and 120 benchmarks demonstrate a strong accuracy-efficiency balance. Moreover, deployment-level profiling on the Jetson Orin Nano verifies a smaller on-device footprint and practical resource utilization compared to existing RGB-based action recognition techniques.</description>

      <title>Mitigating GIL Bottlenecks in Edge AI Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.10582v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deploying Python-based AI agents on resource-constrained edge devices presents a critical runtime optimization challenge: high thread counts are needed to mask I/O latency, yet Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) serializes execution. We demonstrate that naive thread pool scaling causes a "saturation cliff": a performance degradation of &gt;= 20% at overprovisioned thread counts (N &gt;= 512) on edge representative configurations. We present a lightweight profiling tool and adaptive runtime system that uses a Blocking Ratio metric (beta) to distinguish genuine I/O wait from GIL contention. Our library-based solution achieves 96.5% of optimal performance without manual tuning, outperforming multiprocessing (which is limited by ~8x memory overhead on devices with 512 MB-2 GB RAM) and asyncio (which blocks during CPU bound phases). Evaluation across seven edge AI workload profiles, including real ML inference with ONNX Runtime MobileNetV2, demonstrates 93.9% average efficiency. Comparative experiments with Python 3.13t (free-threading) show that while GIL elimination enables ~4x throughput on multi-core edge devices, the saturation cliff persists on single-core devices due to context switching overhead, validating our beta metric for both GIL and no-GIL environments. This work provides a practical optimization strategy for memory-constrained edge AI systems where traditional solutions fail.</description>
