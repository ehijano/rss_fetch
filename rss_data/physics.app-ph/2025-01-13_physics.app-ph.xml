      <title>Tailored Thin Films: Modulating Soft Photonics with Dynamically Tunable Large Area Microstructures via Controlled Thermal Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-assembled nano and micro-structures, particularly those capable of responsive erasure and regeneration, have garnered significant interest for their applications in smart photonics and electronics. However, current techniques for modulating these architectures largely depend on network rearrangement, posing challenges for in situ regeneration. Furthermore, their common fabrication techniques are complex and uncontrolled with the structures formed not being amenable for large area applications, thus compromising their economic viability. Herein, we present a controlled thermal process strategy for fabricating large-area, dynamically tunable, 1D,2D and 3D micro and nanostructures on a wide range of compatible materials including metals, semiconductors and polymers. By tuning the temperature changes in the system, thermal expansion coefficients of thin films and substrates, surface energy, Youngs modulus and thickness of the thin films we achieve robust, uniform, periodic structures over extensive areas on soft and stretchable substrates. The process is further supported by a theoretical model that we developed and validated by experiments and simulations. To showcase the robustness of our approach, we present prototypes of dynamically tunable diffraction gratings, optical diffusers, large-area reflective displays, camouflage devices, out-coupling efficiency enhancers, wearable devices and mechanochromic sensors.</description>

      <title>Biorealistic response in a technology-compatible graphene synaptic transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial synapse is a key element of future brain-inspired neuromorphic computing systems implemented in hardware. This work presents a graphene synaptic transistor based on all-technology-compatible materials that exhibits highly tunable biorealistic behavior. It is shown that the device geometry and interface properties can be designed to maximize the memory window and minimize power consumption. The device exhibits a virtually continuous range of multiple conductance levels, similar to synaptic weighting, which is achieved by gradual injection/emission of electrons into the floating gate and interface traps under the influence of an external electric field. Similar to the biological synapse, the transistor has short-term intrinsic dynamics that affect the long-term state. The temporal injection/emission dynamics of an electronic synapse closely resemble those of its biological counterpart and is exploited to emulate biorealistic behavior using a number of synaptic functions, including paired-pulse facilitation/depression, spike-rate-dependent plasticity, and others. Such a synaptic transistor can serve as a building block in hardware artificial networks for advanced information processing and storage.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Angle-of-Arrival Sensing and Anomalous Deflection with Aperiodically Loaded Patch Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and numerically demonstrate a reconfigurable patch antenna array that enables simultaneous incident wave sensing and anomalous reflection without prior knowledge of the propagation environment. We acquire anomalous reflection by suppressing parasitic scattering through accurate and efficient optimization of induced load currents and by varying impedances of reactive loads. By mitigating parasitic scattering lobes, we demonstrate the feasibility of accurately detecting the incoming illumination angle via the spatial Fourier transform of the optimized load current distribution, facilitated by tunable reactive loads. This approach eliminates the need for additional RF chains, pre-computed data, or calibration measurements. The developed strategy, which integrates arithmetic load optimization with angle-of-arrival sensing, is applicable to general finite-size arrays.</description>

      <title>Plasmonic excitations in graphene layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of fast charged particles with graphene layers can generate electromagnetic modes. This wake effect has been recently proposed for short-wavelength, high-gradient particle acceleration and for obtaining brilliant radiation sources. In this study, the excitation of wakefields produced by a point-like charged particle moving parallel to a multilayer graphene array (which may be supported by an insulated substrate) is studied using the linearized hydrodynamic theory. General expressions for the excited longitudinal and transverse wakefields have been derived. The dependencies of the wakefields on the positions of the layers and the substrate, the velocity and the surface density have been extensively analyzed. This study provides a deeper understanding of the physical phenomena underlying plasmonic excitations in graphene layers, paving the way for potential applications of these structures in particle acceleration, nanotechnology and materials science.</description>

      <title>A reduced-temperature process for preparing atomically clean Si(100) and SiGe(100) surfaces with vapor HF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon processing techniques such as atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) and epitaxial growth require surface preparations that activate oxide desorption (typically &gt;1000 $^{\circ}$C) and promote surface reconstruction toward atomically-clean, flat, and ordered Si(100)-2$\times$1. We compare aqueous and vapor phase cleaning of Si and Si/SiGe surfaces to prepare APAM-ready and epitaxy-ready surfaces at lower temperatures. Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicate that vapor hydrogen fluoride (VHF) cleans dramatically reduce carbon surface contamination and allow the chemically prepared surface to reconstruct at lower temperatures, 600 $^{\circ}$C for Si and 580 $^{\circ}$C for a Si/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ heterostructures, into an ordered atomic terrace structure indicated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). After thermal treatment and vacuum hydrogen termination, we demonstrate STM hydrogen desorption lithography (HDL) on VHF-treated Si samples, creating reactive zones that enable area-selective chemistry using a thermal budget similar to CMOS process flows. We anticipate these results will establish new pathways to integrate APAM with Si foundry processing.</description>

      <title>Large spin accumulation signals in ultrafast magneto-optical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magneto-optical techniques have become essential tools in spintronics, enabling the investigation of spin dynamics in the ultrafast regime. A key challenge in this field has been to accurately isolate the contributions to magneto-optical signals of spin transport phenomena from the local magnetization dynamics. The contribution of transported and accumulated spins was long believed to be orders of magnitude smaller than that of the magnetization and thus previous approaches to disentangle these signals have relied on specific experimental designs, usually including thick metal layers. Here, we present experimental evidence demonstrating that the magneto-optical signal from ultrafast spin accumulations can, under certain conditions, be comparable to or even exceed that of the magnetic layer in a standard ultrafast demagnetization experiment. Our findings provide a new framework for accessing and isolating these spin accumulations, allowing for time and depth dependent probing of transported spin and/or orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <title>Tunable superconductivity coexisting with the anomalous Hall effect in 1T'-WS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides are a family of quasi-two-dimensional materials that display a high technological potential due to their wide range of electronic ground states, e.g., from superconducting to semiconducting, depending on the chemical composition, crystal structure, or electrostatic doping. Here, we unveil that by tuning a single parameter, the hydrostatic pressure P, a cascade of electronic phase transitions can be induced in the few-layer transition metal dichalcogenide 1T'-WS2, including superconducting, topological, and anomalous Hall effect phases. Specifically, as P increases, we observe a dual phase transition: the suppression of superconductivity with the concomitant emergence of an anomalous Hall effect at P=1.15 GPa. Remarkably, upon further increasing the pressure above 1.6 GPa, we uncover a reentrant superconducting state that emerges out of a state still exhibiting an anomalous Hall effect. This superconducting state shows a marked increase in superconducting anisotropy with respect to the phase observed at ambient pressure, suggesting a different superconducting state with a distinct pairing symmetry. Via first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that the system concomitantly transitions into a strong topological phase with markedly different band orbital characters and Fermi surfaces contributing to the superconductivity. These findings position 1T'-WS2 as a unique, tunable superconductor, wherein superconductivity, anomalous transport, and band features can be tuned through the application of moderate pressures.</description>

      <title>The coupling of polarization and oxygen vacancy migration in ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films enables electrically controlled thermal memories above room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06005v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Here we investigate epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 ferroelectric thin films as potential candidates to be used as non-volatile electric-field-modulated thermal memories. The electric-field dependence of the thermal conductivity of metal/Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/YSZ devices is found to be hysteretic, resembling the polarization vs electric field hysteresis loops, being maximum (minimum) at large applied positive (negative) voltages from the top metallic electrode. This dynamic thermal response is compatible with the coupling between the ferroelectric polarization and the oxygen ion migration, in which the oxygen vacancies are the main phonon scattering sources and the polarization acts as an electrically active ion migration barrier that creates the hysteresis. This new mechanism enables two non-volatile thermal states: high (ON) and low (OFF) thermal conductivity, with an ON/OFF ratio of 1.6. Both the ON and OFF states exhibit high stability over time, though the switching speed is limited by ion mobility in the YSZ electrode.</description>

      <title>Room-temperature, continuous-wave Terahertz generation in free-space with an intersubband mid-infrared photomixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a Terahertz photomixer pumped by mid-infrared photons at 10$\mu$m wavelength. The device is based on a dual-antenna architecture, in which a two-dimensional array of mid-infrared patch-antenna resonators is connected to the electrodes of a log-spiral Terahertz antenna. By exploiting intersubband absorption inside an AlGaAs-GaAs multi-quantum-well heterostructure, a photocurrent is coherently generated at the difference frequency between two quantum cascade lasers. The photocurrent drives the antenna electrodes allowing tunable, continuous-wave generation in free-space up to 1 Terahertz at room temperature. By experimentally studying the photomixer frequency response and dark impedance, we demonstrate that the observed power roll-off at high-frequency is limited by the combined effect of the photoexcited carrier's intrinsic lifetime and of the device $RC$ time constant. In the spectral range investigated we obtain, in continuous-wave, mid-infrared $\rightarrow$ Terahertz conversion efficiencies exceeding by orders of magnitude those of unipolar devices exploiting $\chi^{(2)}$ processes.</description>

      <title>Gigahertz directional light modulation with electro-optic metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active metasurfaces promise spatiotemporal control over optical wavefronts, but achieving high-speed modulation with pixel-level control has remained an unmet challenge. While local phase control can be achieved with nanoscale optical confinement, such as in plasmonic nanoparticles, the resulting electrode spacings lead to large capacitance, limiting speed. Here, we demonstrate the operation of a gigahertz-tunable metasurface for beam steering through local control of metasurface elements in a plasmonic-organic hybrid architecture. Our device comprises a corrugated metallic slot array engineered to support plasmonic quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). These plasmonic quasi-BICs provide ideal optical confinement and electrical characteristics for integrating organic electro-optic (OEO) materials like JRD1 and have not been previously utilized in optical metasurfaces. We obtain a quasi-static resonance tunability of 0.4 nm/V, which we leverage to steer light between three diffraction orders and achieve an electro-optic bandwidth of ~4 GHz, with the potential for further speed improvements through scaling rules. This work showcases on-chip spatiotemporal control of light at the sub-micrometer and gigahertz level, opening new possibilities for applications in 3D sensing and high-speed spatial light modulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal multipole center for subwavelength acoustic scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The multipole expansion is a powerful framework for analyzing how subwavelength-size objects scatter waves in optics or acoustics. The calculation of multipole moments traditionally uses the scatterer's center of mass as the reference point. The theoretical foundation of this heuristic convention remains an open question. Here, we challenge this convention by demonstrating that a different, optimal multipole center can yield superior results. The optimal center is crucial -- it allows us to accurately express the scattering response while retaining a minimum number of multipole moments. Our analytical technique for finding the optimal multipole centers of individual scatterers, both in isolation and within finite arrays, is validated through numerical simulations. Our findings reveal that such an optimized positioning significantly reduces quadrupole contributions, enabling more accurate monopole-dipole approximations in acoustic calculations. Our approach also improves the computational efficiency of the T-matrix method, offering practical benefits for metamaterial design and analysis.</description>

      <title>Programmable Magnetic Hysteresis in Orthogonally-Twisted Two-Dimensional CrSBr Magnets via Stacking Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Twisting two-dimensional van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin-textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, we consider pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A-type antiferromagnet CrSBr as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, we fabricate symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures. The magneto-transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist-angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non-volatile magnetic memory at zero-field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin-switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. Our results highlight the combination between twist-angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin-switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest towards the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.</description>

      <title>Machine-learned design principles for enhanced red emission from nitride quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Significant effort has been devoted toward mitigating polarization fields in nitride LEDs, as they are viewed as detrimental to light emission, albeit with limited success for red emission. Here, we show that such fields can unusually enhance the optical oscillator strength of red-emitting nitride quantum wells. This insight is enabled by machine-learned models trained on multi-scale quantum-mechanical simulations, allowing for a global exploration of the quantum-well design space at greatly reduced computational cost. Larger polarization fields correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission, a consequence of the quantum-confined Stark effect enabling thinner quantum wells. This finding has implications for designing efficient red nitride LEDs, which are crucial for miniaturizing polychromatic LED pixels to the micron scale for extended-reality and biomedical applications. More broadly, this work highlights the power of machine learning in accelerating the discovery of unconventional paradigms for semiconductor design.</description>

      <title>Wettability and Color Change of Copper by Controlling Area Fraction of Laser Ablated Surface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this research, wettability control by area fraction of laser ablated surface of copper is presented. The functional surfaces with full wettability control from highly hydrophilic to super-hydrophobic were created on copper by nanosecond (ns) and picosecond (ps) laser irradiation. The area fraction and color change were evaluated by digital image processing of microscopic images of the laser-ablated copper surface. The control of the wetting angle from almost 0 degrees to 132 degrees was achieved for both ps and ns pulses by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. Cassie, Cassie-Baxter, and Wenzel models were adopted to explain the experimental results. For the first time, the wettability and color of copper were controlled by controlling the area fraction of the laser-ablated surface. It is expected that the current results make an impact on the heat exchanger technology of water heat sinks, cooling units, atmospheric water generators, and fog harvesting and impact numerous applications from power plants to solar thermal water systems devices where highly-hydrophilic to super hydrophobic copper can be applied.</description>

      <title>Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17207v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.</description>

      <title>Deterministic printing and heterointegration of single colloidal quantum dot photon sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04177v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Single nanoparticles are essential building blocks for next-generation quantum photonic technologies, however, scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies have remained largely out of reach. Here, we present a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model that exploits nanoscale dielectrophoretics to precisely print single colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with accuracies allowing for fully-additive nanoscale photonics integration. Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.</description>
