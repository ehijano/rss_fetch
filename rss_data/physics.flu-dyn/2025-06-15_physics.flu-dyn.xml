      <title>A Gauge-Theoretic Action Principle for Viscous Incompressible Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel action principle for two dimensional incompressible fluid dynamics that naturally incorporates both vorticity and viscous dissipation via gauge field couplings. The action features a Chern Simons like term, $\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho} A_\mu \partial_\nu A_\rho$, capturing the topological structure of vorticity, alongside a quadratic term $(\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho} \partial_\nu A_\rho)^2$ representing viscous damping. Incompressibility is enforced through a Lagrange multiplier, while coupling to an external potential allows applications in geophysical flows. We derive the equations of motion, recovering the vorticity formulation of the two-dimensional incompressible Navier Stokes equations and explicitly identifying the kinematic viscosity. This gauge theoretic framework leads to a Helmholtz type equation for vorticity linking topological and dissipative phenomena in viscous incompressible fluids. Analysis of Noether symmetries reveals conserved charges arising from gauge invariance and spatial translations, while viscosity explicitly breaks time reversal symmetry within this topological setting. Furthermore, the velocity vorticity gauge correspondence naturally suggests a Lindblad operator structure, providing a pathway toward a quantum description of viscous dissipation and allowing quantization of dissipative hydrodynamics. This framework also highlights how vorticity emerges as a natural Lindblad operator, capturing the transition from coherent rotational motion to thermal disorder as decoherence in the gauge field ensemble.</description>

      <title>A fast mesh-free boundary integral method for two-phase flow with soluble surfactant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an accurate and efficient boundary integral (BI) method for simulating the deformation of drops and bubbles in Stokes flow with soluble surfactant. Soluble surfactant advects and diffuses in bulk fluids while adsorbing and desorbing at interfaces. Since the fluid velocity is coupled to the surfactant concentration, the advection-diffusion equation governing the bulk surfactant concentration $C$ is nonlinear, precluding the Green's function formulation necessary for a BI method. However, in the physically representative large P\'eclet number limit, an analytical reduction of the surfactant dynamics permits a Green's function formulation for $C$ as an Abel-type time-convolution integral at each Lagrangian interface point. A challenge in developing a practical numerical method based on this formulation is the fast evaluation of the time convolution, since the kernel depends on the time history of quantities at the interface, which is only found during the time-stepping process. To address this, we develop a novel, causal version of the Fast Multipole Method that reduces the computational cost from $O(P^2)$ for direct evaluation of the time convolution to $O(P \log_2^2 P)$ per surface grid point, where $P$ is the number of time steps. In the bulk phase, the resulting method is mesh-free and provides an accurate solution to the fully coupled moving interface problem with soluble surfactant. The approach extends naturally to a broader class of advection-diffusion problems in the high P\'eclet number regime.</description>

      <title>Phase-Field Modeling and Energy-Stable Schemes for Osmotic Flow through Semi-Permeable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a thermodynamically consistent phase-field model for simulating fluid transport across semi-permeable membranes, with a particular focus on osmotic pressure effects. The model extends the classical Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard (NSCH) system by introducing an Allen-Cahn-type transmembrane flux governed by chemical potential imbalances, resulting in a strongly coupled system involving fluid motion, solute transport, and interface dynamics. To solve this system efficiently and accurately, we develop high-order, energy-stable numerical schemes. The local discontinuous Galerkin (LDG) method is employed for spatial discretization, offering high-order accuracy and geometric flexibility. For temporal integration, we first construct a first-order decoupled scheme with rigorous energy stability, and then improve temporal accuracy via a semi-implicit spectral deferred correction (SDC) method. Numerical experiments confirm the theoretical properties of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the influence of osmotic pressure and membrane permeability on droplet morphology at equilibrium. The framework offers a robust and versatile tool for modeling transmembrane fluid transport in both biological and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian formulation for the motion of an active spheroidal particle suspended in laminar straight duct flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyse a generalisation of Z\"{o}ttl and Stark's model of active spherical particles [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 218104 (2012)] and prolate spheroidal particles [Eur. Phys. J. E 36(1), 4 (2013)] suspended in cylindrical Poiseuille flow, to particle dynamics in an arbitrary unidirectional steady laminar flow through a straight duct geometry. Our primary contribution is to describe a Hamiltonian formulation of these systems and provide explicit forms of the constants of motions in terms of the arbitrary fluid velocity field. The Hamiltonian formulation provides a convenient and robust approach to the computation of particle orbits whilst also providing new insights into the dynamics, specifically the way in which orbits are trapped within basins defined by a potential well. In addition to considering spherical and prolate spheroidal particles, we also illustrate that the model can be adapted to oblate spheroidal particles.</description>

      <title>Effect of converging shape of container on the velocity of impact-induced focused liquid jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the effect of container shape on the behavior of the impact-induced focused liquid jets by dropping a converging-shaped container (e.g., Kjeldahl flask) partially filled with liquid onto a floor to develop a method for increasing the jet velocity. Note that a similar well-known experiment, Pokrovski's experiment, in which a focused liquid jet is generated in a test tube, is free from the effect of the converging shape. The results showed that the jet was up to about 1.6 times faster in a converging-shaped container than in a test tube, despite the same impact velocity. To understand the mechanism of the increase in the jet velocity, the Laplace equation on the pressure impulse was solved numerically under the boundary condition that the pressure impulse is given at the bottom of the container. The normalized gas-liquid interfacial velocity obtained from the numerical solution of the pressure impulse field agrees well with the normalized jet velocity in experiments, showing that the jets we observed are driven by the pressure impulse generated at the bottom. In addition, numerical solutions of pressure impulse fields in a simpler-shaped container with different degrees of convergence were compared with analytical solutions obtained from a lower-order model of the pressure impulse field. We confirmed that the gas-liquid interfacial velocity of the impact-induced focused liquid jet is governed by changes in both the flow rate and pressure impulse gradient at the central axis of the container caused by changes in the cross-sectional area of the container. We showed that by changing the container shape, we can increase the velocity of the gas-liquid interface after the container impact. This finding is expected to be applied to the ejection and application of high-viscosity liquids as well as to needle-free injection technology using fast focused liquid jets.</description>

      <title>Bubble Dynamics Transformer: Microrheology at Ultra-High Strain Rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates (&gt;1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.</description>

      <title>An approximate Riemann Solver Approach in Physics-Informed Neural Networks for hyperbolic conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study enhances the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for modeling discontinuous solutions in both hydrodynamics and relativistic hydrodynamics. Conventional PINNs, trained with partial differential equation residuals, frequently face convergence issues and lower accuracy near discontinuities. To address these issues, we build on the recently proposed Locally-Linearized PINNs, which improve shock detection by modifying the Jacobian matrix resulting from the linearization of the equations, only in regions where the velocity field exhibits strong compression. However, the original LLPINN framework required a priori knowledge of shock velocities, limiting its practical utility. We present a generalized LLPINN method that dynamically computes shock speeds using neighboring states and applies jump conditions through entropy constraints. Additionally, we introduce Locally-Roe PINNs, which incorporate an approximate Roe Riemann solver to improve shock resolution and conservation properties across discontinuities. These methods are adapted to two-dimensional Riemann problems by using a divergence-based shock detection combined with dimensional splitting, delivering precise solutions. Compared to a high-order WENO solver, our method produces sharper shock transitions but smoother solutions in areas with small-scale vortex structures. Future research will aim to improve the resolution of these small-scale features without compromising the model's ability to accurately capture shocks.</description>

      <title>Achieving Optimal Locomotion using Self-Generated Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An oscillating body floating at the water surface produces a wave-field of self-generated waves. When the oscillation induces a difference in fore-aft wave amplitude squared, these self-generated waves can be used as a mechanism to propel the body horizontally across the surface (Longuet-Higgins and Stewart 1964). The optimisation of this wave-driven propulsion (WDP) is the interest of this work. To study the conditions necessary to produce optimal thrust we will utilise a shallow water set-up where a periodically oscillating pressure source acts as the body. In this framework, an expression for the thrust is derived by relation to the aforementioned difference in fore-aft amplitude squared. The conditions on the source for maximal thrust are explored both analytically and numerically in two optimal control problems. The first case is where a bound is imposed on the norm of the control function to regularise it. Secondly, a more physically motivated case is studied where the power injected by the source is bounded. The body is permitted to have a drift velocity $U$. When scaled with the wave speed $c$, the dimensionless velocity $v=U/c$ divides the study into subcritical, critical and supercritical regimes and the optimal conditions are presented for each. The result in the bounded power case is then used to demonstrate how the modulation of power injected can slowly change the cruising velocity from rest to supercritical velocities.</description>

      <title>Statistical State Dynamics based study of turbulence in Eady fronts. Part 1. Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The streamwise roll and streak structure (RSS) is prominent in observations of the planetary boundary layer in the atmosphere and ocean and in unstratified wall-bounded shear flows. Although the RSS in these systems is structurally similar, the mechanism forming and maintaining the RSS in both remains controversial. This study demonstrates that the same turbulence-sustaining mechanism identified to underlie the RSS in the Statistical State Dynamics (SSD) formulation of unstratified wall-bounded shear flow dynamics (Farrell &amp; Ioannou 2012; Farrell et al. 2016) also operates in the Eady front. We analyze the mechanism by which turbulence and symmetric instability interact to form the RSS in the baroclinic stratified Eady front model by adapting to the Eady front problem the stability analysis of the second order closure of the SSD used previously to study roll formation in unstratified wall-bounded shear flows. Our findings advance mechanistic understanding of RSS formation in the turbulent geostrophic front regime and establish foundational parallels between geophysical turbulent front dynamics and turbulence dynamics in engineering-scale shear flows.</description>

      <title>FIGNN: Feature-Specific Interpretability for Graph Neural Network Surrogate Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents a novel graph neural network (GNN) architecture, the Feature-specific Interpretable Graph Neural Network (FIGNN), designed to enhance the interpretability of deep learning surrogate models defined on unstructured grids in scientific applications. Traditional GNNs often obscure the distinct spatial influences of different features in multivariate prediction tasks. FIGNN addresses this limitation by introducing a feature-specific pooling strategy, which enables independent attribution of spatial importance for each predicted variable. Additionally, a mask-based regularization term is incorporated into the training objective to explicitly encourage alignment between interpretability and predictive error, promoting localized attribution of model performance. The method is evaluated for surrogate modeling of two physically distinct systems: the SPEEDY atmospheric circulation model and the backward-facing step (BFS) fluid dynamics benchmark. Results demonstrate that FIGNN achieves competitive predictive performance while revealing physically meaningful spatial patterns unique to each feature. Analysis of rollout stability, feature-wise error budgets, and spatial mask overlays confirm the utility of FIGNN as a general-purpose framework for interpretable surrogate modeling in complex physical domains.</description>

      <title>Quick starch guide: A perspective on shear thickening in dense non-Brownian suspensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we provide a brief perspective on recent developments in the study of shear thickening in dense suspensions. We give a rapid overview of the state of the art and discuss current models aiming to describe this particular rheology. Although most of the experiments and simulation studies are conducted in "ideal" flows, where the sample is confined without an open boundary condition, we have decided to highlight more realistic flow conditions. We further provide an overview on how to relate the recently proposed constitutive models to these more practical flow conditions like pipe flow or flow down an incline.</description>

      <title>On interdependence of instabilities and average drop sizes in bag breakup</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16241v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A drop exposed to cross flow of air experiences sudden accelerations which deform it rapidly ultimately proceeding to disintegrate it into smaller fragments. In this work, we examine the breakup of a drop as a bag film with a bounding rim resulting from acceleration induced Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities and characterized through the Weber number, \textit{We}, representative of the competition between the disruptive aerodynamic force imparting acceleration and the restorative surface tension force. Our analysis reveals a previously overlooked parabolic dependence ($\sim We^2$) of the combination of dimensionless instability wavelengths $({\bar{\lambda}}_{bag}^2/ {\bar{\lambda}}_{rim}^4 {\bar{\lambda}}_{film})$ developing on different segments of the deforming drop. Further, we extend these findings to deduce the dependence of the average dimensionless drop sizes for the rim, $\langle{\bar{D}}_{rim}\rangle$ and bag film, $\langle{\bar{D}}_{film}\rangle$ individually, on $We$ and see them to decrease linearly for the rim ($\sim We^{-1}$) and quadratically for the bag film ($\sim We^{-2}$). The reported work is expected to have far-reaching implications as it provides unique insights on destabilization and disintegration mechanisms based on theoretical scaling arguments involving the commonly encountered canonical geometries of a toroidal rim and a curved liquid film.</description>

      <title>Existence of three distinct scaling regimes in self-propelled rigid pitching airfoil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of imposed kinematics on the self-propulsion of the NACA0015 symmetric airfoil section subject to sinusoidal pitching. We employ a rotary apparatus capable of achieving self-propulsion. A power-spring-based crank-rocker mechanism actuates the airfoil. Three distinct scaling relations emerge, which relate the self-propulsion Reynolds number $Re_s$ to the frequency Reynolds number $Re_f$, the amplitude of pitching $\theta_0$, and the location of the pitching point, $p$. When pitched near the center, a \textit{linear} scaling emerges with $Re_s \sim Re_f \theta_0$. When pitched near the leading edge, a \textit{power} scaling emerges with $Re_s \sim (1-2p)(Re_f \theta_0)^{3/2}$ for low amplitude pitching and a \textit{separable} scaling emerges with $Re_s \sim (1-2p)^{1/2}Re_f\theta_0^{1/2}$ for moderate to high amplitude pitching. These relations are consistent with the scaling relations derived from balancing inviscid thrust with viscous drag, pressure drag, and enhanced pressure drag for the \textit{power}, \textit{separable}, and \textit{linear} regimes, respectively. We find that different vortical patterns in the wake are directly correlated to the airfoil's self-propulsion speed which essentially determines the spatial separation between the shed vortices. Our findings provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the self-propulsion of rigid pitching airfoils across a wide range of parameters validated experimentally.</description>

      <title>On the development of OpenFOAM solvers for simulating MHD micropolar fluid flows with or without the effect of micromagnetorotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14543v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any micropolar fluid containing magnetic particles, such as blood or ferrofluids, subjected to an external magnetic field experiences a magnetic torque due to the misalignment between particle magnetization and the magnetic field. This effect, known as micromagnetorotation (MMR), remains underexplored in blood flows where erythrocyte magnetization is often neglected. To investigate this, two transient OpenFOAM solvers were developed: epotMicropolarFoam, for incompressible, laminar magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) micropolar flows, and epotMMRFoam, which extends it by incorporating MMR. Both solvers use the PISO algorithm for pressure-velocity coupling and adopt the low magnetic Reynolds number approximation. Micropolar effects are modeled by including the microrotation-vorticity difference in the momentum equation and solving the internal angular momentum equation. In epotMMRFoam, the MMR term is added to this equation, and a constitutive equation for magnetization is also solved. Validation against analytical MHD micropolar Poiseuille flow showed excellent accuracy (error less than 2 percent). Including MMR led to notable reductions in velocity (up to 40 percent) and microrotation (up to 99.9 percent), especially under strong magnetic fields and high hematocrit. Without MMR, magnetic effects were minimal due to the low electrical conductivity of blood. Simulations of 3D MHD artery and 2D MHD aneurysm flows confirmed these findings. In aneurysm geometries, MMR suppressed vortex cores, indicating strong stabilizing and shear-dampening effects. These solvers show high potential for biomedical applications such as magnetic hyperthermia and targeted drug delivery.</description>

Abstract: Transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are essential for many industrial applications, but suffer from high compute costs relative to steady-state simulations. This is due to the need to: (a) reach statistical steadiness by physically advecting errors in the initial field sufficiently far downstream, and (b) gather a sufficient sample of fluctuating flow data to estimate time-averaged quantities of interest. We present a machine learning-based initialization method that aims to reduce the cost of transient solve by providing more accurate initial fields. Through a case study in automotive aerodynamics on a 17M-cell unsteady incompressible RANS simulation, we evaluate three proposed ML-based initialization strategies against existing methods. Here, we demonstrate 50% reductions in time-to-convergence compared to traditional uniform and potential flow-based initializations. Two ML-based initialization strategies are recommended for general use: (1) a hybrid method combining ML predictions with potential flow solutions, and (2) an approach integrating ML predictions with uniform flow. Both strategies enable CFD solvers to achieve convergence times comparable to computationally-expensive steady RANS initializations, while requiring far less wall-clock time to compute the initialization field. Notably, these improvements are achieved using an ML model trained on a different dataset of diverse automotive geometries, demonstrating generalization capabilities relevant to specific industrial application areas. Because this Hybrid-ML workflow only modifies the inputs to an existing CFD solver, rather than modifying the solver itself, it can be applied to existing CFD workflows with relatively minimal changes; this provides a practical approach to accelerating industrial CFD simulations using existing ML surrogate models.</description>
