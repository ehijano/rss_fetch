      <title>Car-following Models and Congestion Control with Followerstopper on a Ring-Road under Known Delay -- Examining Limit Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the IDM microscopic car-following model from a dynamical systems perspective, analyzing the effects of delay on congestion formation. Further, a case of mixed-autonomy is considered by controlling one car with Followerstopper in a ring road setting containing IDM vehicles as human drivers. Specifically, the stop-and-go waves phenomenon in idealized traffic from a dynamical systems perspective is examined. We show that Followerstopper-controlled vehicle is effective at eliminating emergent stop-and-go waves in the IDM traffic simulation. We show through simulation that the uniform flow manifold is unstable for the ring road simulation with IDM vehicles, and that replacing a single car with Followerstopper induces stability, allowing the cars to drive safely at a uniform speed. Additionally, the case of known delay is considered in a mixed-autonomy scenario. Our simulation result shows that while considering a known time delay, traffic waves emerge earlier than in the no-delay case. At the same time, a single-vehicle controlled using Followerstopper controller is able to prevent the emergence of traffic waves even in the presence of delay.</description>

      <title>Pivot-Only Azimuthal Control and Attitude Estimation of Balloon-borne Payloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an attitude estimation and yaw-rate control framework for balloon-borne payloads using pivot-only actuation, motivated by the Taurus experiment. Taurus is a long-duration balloon instrument designed for rapid azimuthal scanning at approximately 30 deg/s using a motorized pivot at the flight-train connection, without a reaction wheel. We model the gondola as a rigid body subject to realistic disturbances and sensing limitations, and implement a Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF) that estimates attitude and gyroscope bias by fusing inertial and vector-camera measurements. A simple PI controller uses the estimated states to regulate yaw rate. Numerical simulations incorporating representative disturbance and measurement noise levels are used to evaluate closed-loop control performance and MEKF behavior under flight-like conditions. Experimental tests on the Taurus gondola validate the pivot-only approach, demonstrating stable high-rate tracking under realistic hardware constraints. The close agreement between simulation and experiment indicates that the simplified rigid-body model captures the dominant dynamics relevant for controller design and integrated estimation-and-control development.</description>

      <title>Taylor-Lagrange Control for Safety-Critical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Taylor-Lagrange Control (TLC) method for nonlinear control systems to ensure the safety and stability through Taylor's theorem with Lagrange remainder. To achieve this, we expand a safety or stability function with respect to time along the system dynamics using the Lie derivative and Taylor's theorem. This expansion enables the control input to appear in the Taylor series at an order equivalent to the relative degree of the function. We show that the proposed TLC provides necessary and sufficient conditions for system safety and is applicable to systems and constraints of arbitrary relative degree. The TLC exhibits connections with existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) and Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) methods, and it further extends the CBF and CLF methods to the complex domain, especially for higher order cases. Compared to High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), TLC is less restrictive as it does not require forward invariance of the intersection of a set of safe sets while HOCBFs do. We employ TLC to reformulate a constrained optimal control problem as a sequence of quadratic programs with a zero-order hold implementation method, and demonstrate the safety of zero-order hold TLC using an event-triggered control method to address inter-sampling effects. Finally, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed TLC method through an adaptive cruise control system and a robot control problem, and compare it with existing CBF methods.</description>

      <title>Bandit-Based Rate Adaptation for a Single-Server Queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of obtaining bounded time-average expected queue sizes in a single-queue system with a partial-feedback structure. Time is slotted; in slot $t$ the transmitter chooses a rate $V(t)$ from a continuous interval. Transmission succeeds if and only if $V(t)\le C(t)$, where channel capacities $\{C(t)\}$ and arrivals are i.i.d. draws from fixed but unknown distributions. The transmitter observes only binary acknowledgments (ACK/NACK) indicating success or failure. Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ denote a sufficiently small lower bound on the slack between the arrival rate and the capacity region. We propose a phased algorithm that progressively refines a discretization of the uncountable infinite rate space and, without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, achieves a $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log^{3.5}(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{3}\big)$ time-average expected queue size uniformly over the horizon. We also prove a converse result showing that for any rate-selection algorithm, regardless of whether $\varepsilon$ is known, there exists an environment in which the worst-case time-average expected queue size is $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{2})$. Thus, while a gap remains in the setting without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, we show that if $\varepsilon$ is known, a simple single-stage UCB type policy with a fixed discretization of the rate space achieves $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{2}\big)$, matching the converse up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Online Full ZVS Optimization for Modular Multi-Active Bridge Converter in MV PET</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-active bridge (MAB) converters, the core of the state-of-the-art medium-voltage power electronic transformers, can flexibly connect multiple DC ports among distributed DC grids and loads, but suffer from hard switching under conventional single phase-shift control, especially under unbalanced voltage conversion ratios and light load conditions. Although some offline methods manage to improve the efficiency through complex optimization structures, there lacks online optimization methods that are simple but effective due to the strong coupling among ports of the converter. By leveraging the time-domain model of the MAB converter under the multiple phase-shift modulation scheme, this paper simplifies the optimization process and proposes an online optimization method that can achieve full zero-voltage switching (ZVS) operation regardless of the load conditions. The proposed method has simple solutions with only voltage conversion ratios involved and can be implemented within a wide operation range without additional sensors or advanced controllers. A four-port MAB converter is constructed as the prototype. The simulation and experimental results have verified the feasibility and superiority of the proposed online strategy in achieving ZVS operation, dynamic response, and efficiency improvement.</description>

      <title>DT-MPC: Synthesizing Derivation-Free Model Predictive Control from Power Converter Netlists via Physics-Informed Neural Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful control strategy for power electronics, but it highly relies on manually-derived and topology-specific analytical models, which is labor-intensive and time-consuming in practical designs. To overcome this bottleneck, this paper introduces a Digital-Twin-based MPC (DT-MPC) framework for generic power converters that can systematically translate a high-level circuit into an objective-aware control policy by leveraging a DT as a high-fidelity system model. Furthermore, a physics-informed neural surrogate predictor is proposed to accelerate predictions by DT and enable real-time operation. A gradient-free simplex search optimizer is also introduced to efficiently handle complex multi-objective optimization. The efficacy of the framework has been validated through a cloud-to-edge deployment on a 1500 W dual active bridge converter. Experimental results show that the synthesized predictive model achieves an inference speed over 7 times faster than real time, the DT-MPC controller outperforms several human-designed counterparts, and the overall framework reduces engineering design time by over 95\%, verifying the superiority of DT-MPC on generalized power converters.</description>

      <title>Congestion Reduction in EV Charger Placement Using Traffic Equilibrium Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Growing EV adoption can worsen traffic conditions if chargers are sited without regard to their impact on congestion. We study how to strategically place EV chargers to reduce congestion using two equilibrium models: one based on congestion games and one based on an atomic queueing simulation. We apply both models within a scalable greedy station-placement algorithm. Experiments show that this greedy scheme yields optimal or near-optimal congestion outcomes in realistic networks, even though global optimality is not guaranteed as we show with a counterexample. We also show that the queueing-based approach yields more realistic results than the congestion-game model, and we present a unified methodology that calibrates congestion delays from queue simulation and solves equilibrium in link-space.</description>

      <title>Realizing Space-oriented Control in Smart Buildings via Word Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for implementing space-oriented control systems in smart buildings. In contrast to conventional device-oriented approaches, which often suffer from issues related to development efficiency and portability, our framework adopts a space-oriented paradigm that leverages natural language processing and word embedding techniques. The proposed framework features a chat-based graphical user interface (GUI) that converts natural language inputs into actionable OpenAI API calls, thereby enabling intuitive space level (e.g., room) control within smart environments. To support efficient embedding-based search and metadata retrieval, the framework integrates a vector database powered by Elasticsearch. This ensures the accurate identification and invocation of appropriate smart building APIs. A prototype implementation has been tested in a smart building environment at the University of Tokyo, demonstrating the feasibility of the approach.</description>

      <title>Braess' Paradoxes in Coupled Power and Transportation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportation electrification introduces strong coupling between the power and transportation systems. In this paper, we generalize the classical notion of Braess' paradox to coupled power and transportation systems, and examine how the cross-system coupling induces new types of Braess' paradoxes. To this end, we model the power and transportation networks as graphs, coupled with charging points connecting to nodes in both graphs. The power system operation is characterized by the economic dispatch optimization, while the transportation system user equilibrium models travelers' route and charging choices. By analyzing simple coupled systems, we demonstrate that capacity expansion in either transportation or power system can deteriorate the performance of both systems, and uncover the fundamental mechanisms for such new Braess' paradoxes to occur. We also provide necessary and sufficient conditions of the occurrences of Braess' paradoxes for general coupled systems, leading to managerial insights for infrastructure planners. For general networks, through characterizing the generalized user equilibrium of the coupled systems, we develop efficient algorithms to detect Braess' paradoxes and novel charging pricing policies to mitigate them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a data-efficient online battery identification method which targets highly informative battery cell data segments based on the driving pattern of the vehicle. We consider the case of a vehicle driving on/off a motorway and construct an Extended Time Regular Expression (ETRE) to detect data segments fitting these driving patterns. Simulation results indicate that by only using up to 10.71% of the data on average, the proposed method provides a low-bias and low-variance estimator under non-negligible current and voltage noise compared to other conventional estimation algorithms.</description>

      <title>AI-Driven Real-Time Kick Classification in Olympic Taekwondo Using Sensor Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Olympic Taekwondo has faced challenges in spectator engagement due to static, defensive gameplay and contentious scoring. Current Protector and Scoring Systems (PSS) rely on impact sensors and simplistic logic, encouraging safe strategies that diminish the sport's dynamism. This paper proposes an AI-powered scoring system that integrates existing PSS sensors with additional accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetic/RFID, and impact force sensors in a sensor fusion framework. The system classifies kicks in real-time to identify technique type, contact location, impact force, and even the part of the foot used. A machine learning pipeline employing sensor fusion and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is detailed, enabling automatic kick technique recognition for scoring. We present a novel kick scoring rubric that awards points based on specific kick techniques (e.g., turning and spinning kicks) to incentivize dynamic attacks. Drawing on a 2024 study achieving 96-98% accuracy, we validate the feasibility of real-time kick classification and further propose enhancements to this methodology, such as ensemble SVM classifiers and expanded datasets, to achieve the high-stakes accuracy required by the sport. We analyze how the proposed system can improve scoring fairness, reduce rule exploitation and illegitimate tactics, encourage more dynamic techniques, and enhance spectator understanding and excitement. The paper includes system design illustrations, a kick scoring table from an AI-augmented rule set, and discusses anticipated impacts on Olympic Taekwondo.</description>

      <title>Improved Directional State Transition Tensors for Accurate Aerocapture Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aerocapture is a unique challenge for semi-analytical propagation because its nonconservative dynamics lead to force magnitudes that vary substantially across the trajectory. State transition tensors (STTs), higher-order Taylor series expansions of the solution flow, have been widely used as a computationally efficient semi-analytical propagation method for orbital scenarios, but have not previously been applied to aerocapture. However, obtaining the higher-order STTs requires integrating exponentially more equations. Directional state transition tensors (DSTTs) mitigate this cost by projecting the state into a reduced-dimension basis. This work develops novel dynamics analysis techniques to identify effective bases for this reduction, including augmented higher-order Cauchy Green tensors tailored to quantities of interest such as apoapsis radius. Results show that DSTTs constructed along these bases significantly reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy in apoapsis and energy prediction. In particular, certain of these DSTTs outperform traditional DSTTs in nonlinear perturbation propagation for key state subsets and quantities of interest. These results establish STTs and DSTTs as practical tools for aerocapture performance analysis to enable robust guidance and navigation.</description>

      <title>Feasible-Set Reshaping for Constraint Qualification in Optimization-Based Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel feasible-set reshaping technique to optimization-based control with ensured constraint qualification. In our problem setting, the feasible set of admissible control inputs depends on the real-time state of the plant, and the linear independence constraint qualification (LICQ) may not be satisfied in some regions of interest. By feasible-set reshaping, we project the constraints of the original feasible set onto an appropriately chosen constant matrix with its rows forming a positive span of the space of the optimization variable. It is proved that the reshaped feasible set is nonempty and satisfies LICQ, as long as the original feasible set is nonempty. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by constructing Lipschitz continuous quadratic-program-based (QP-based) controllers based on the reshaped feasible sets.</description>

      <title>Quadratic-Programming-based Control of Multi-Robot Systems for Cooperative Object Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the control problem of steering a group of spherical mobile robots to cooperatively transport a spherical object. By controlling the movements of the robots to exert appropriate contact (pushing) forces, it is desired that the object follows a velocity command. To solve the problem, we first treat the robots' positions as virtual control inputs of the object, and propose a velocity-tracking controller based on quadratic programming (QP), enabling the robots to cooperatively generate desired contact forces while minimizing the sum of the contact-force magnitudes. Then, we design position-tracking controllers for the robots. By appropriately designing the objective function and the constraints for the QP, it is guaranteed that the QP admits a unique solution and the QP-based velocity-tracking controller is Lipschitz continuous. Finally, we consider the closed-loop system as an interconnection of two subsystems, corresponding to the velocity-tracking error of the object and the position-tracking error of the robots, and employ nonlinear small-gain techniques for stability analysis. The effectiveness of the proposed design is demonstrated through numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: The transition to electric transportation is a key enabler for intelligent and sustainable cities; however, inadequate charging infrastructure remains a major barrier to large-scale electric vehicle (EV) adoption. This paper presents a scalable Electric Road System (ERS) architecture that enables Dynamic Wireless Charging (DWC) of EVs during motion. The proposed framework integrates inductive charging coils embedded in road pavement, real-time vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, and adaptive energy management coordinated with smart grid systems. Modular road segments with a standardized charging process are employed to ensure scalability across urban corridors and interoperability among different EV platforms. System performance is evaluated using a co-simulation framework combining MATLAB-based power analysis with traffic inputs generated in SUMO. Key performance metrics include charging efficiency, energy cost per kilometer, and battery lifecycle improvement. Simulation results indicate a potential reduction in range anxiety and an increase in battery lifespan due to frequent shallow charging cycles. The study further discusses deployment challenges, policy considerations, and energy distribution strategies aligned with climate-resilient urban development. A case study of a tier-1 Indian city is presented to analyze the cost-benefit trade-offs of retrofitting high-density urban corridors with ERS. The proposed framework provides a practical foundation for next-generation EV infrastructure planning in smart cities.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Approach for Microgrid Probabilistic Forecasting and Robust Operation via Decision-focused Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High penetration of renewable energy sources (RES) introduces significant uncertainty and intermittency into microgrid operations, posing challenges to economic and reliable scheduling. To address this, this paper proposes an end-to-end decision-focused framework that jointly optimizes probabilistic forecasting and robust operation for microgrids. A multilayer encoder-decoder (MED) probabilistic forecasting model is integrated with a two-stage robust optimization (TSRO) model involving direct load control (DLC) through a differentiable decision pathway, enabling gradient-based feedback from operational outcomes to improve forecasting performance. Unlike conventional sequential approaches, the proposed method aligns forecasting accuracy with operational objectives by directly minimizing decision regret via a surrogate smart predict-then-optimize (SPO) loss function. This integration ensures that probabilistic forecasts are optimized for downstream decisions, enhancing both economic efficiency and robustness. Case studies on modified IEEE 33-bus and 69-bus systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior forecasting accuracy and operational performance, reducing total and net operation costs by up to 18% compared with conventional forecasting and optimization combinations. The results verify the effectiveness and scalability of the end-to-end decision-focused approach for resilient and cost-efficient microgrid management under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Lexicographic Multi-Objective Stochastic Shortest Path with Mixed Max-Sum Costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Stochastic Shortest Path (SSP) problem for autonomous systems with mixed max-sum cost aggregations under Linear Temporal Logic constraints. Classical SSP formulations rely on sum-aggregated costs, which are suitable for cumulative quantities such as time or energy but fail to capture bottleneck-style objectives such as avoiding high-risk transitions, where performance is determined by the worst single event along a trajectory. Such objectives are particularly important in safety-critical systems, where even one hazardous transition can be unacceptable. To address this limitation, we introduce max-aggregated objectives that minimize the bottleneck cost, i.e., the maximum one-step cost along a trajectory. We show that standard Bellman equations on the original state space do not apply in this setting and propose an augmented MDP with a state variable tracking the running maximum cost, together with a value iteration algorithm. We further identify a cyclic policy phenomenon, where zero-marginal-cost cycles prevent goal reaching under max-aggregation, and resolve it via a finite-horizon formulation. To handle richer task requirements, linear temporal logic specifications are translated into deterministic finite automata and combined with the system to construct a product MDP. We propose a lexicographic value iteration algorithm that handles mixed max-sum objectives under lexicographic ordering on this product MDP. Gridworld case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>High Order Control Lyapunov Function - Control Barrier Function - Quadratic Programming Based Autonomous Driving Controller for Bicyclist Safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical challenge in the development of advanced autonomous driving systems in smart cities. Among vulnerable road users, bicyclists present unique characteristics that make their safety both critical and also manageable. Vehicles often travel at significantly higher relative speeds when interacting with bicyclists as compared to their interactions with pedestrians which makes collision avoidance system design for bicyclist safety more challenging. Yet, bicyclist movements are generally more predictable and governed by clear traffic rules as compared to the sudden and sometimes erratic pedestrian motion, offering opportunities for model-based control strategies. To address bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments, this study proposes and develops a High Order Control Lyapunov Function High Order Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming (HOCLF HOCBF QP) control framework. Through this framework, CLFs constraints guarantee system stability so that the vehicle can track its reference trajectory, whereas CBFs constraints ensure system safety by letting vehicle avoiding potential collisions region with surrounding obstacles. Then by solving a QP problem, an optimal control command that simultaneously satisfies stability and safety requirements can be calculated. Three key bicyclist crash scenarios recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are recreated and used to comprehensively evaluate the proposed autonomous driving bicyclist safety control strategy in a simulation study. Simulation results demonstrate that the HOCLF HOCBF QP controller can help the vehicle perform robust, and collision-free maneuvers, highlighting its potential for improving bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments.</description>

      <title>A Rule-Aware Prompt Framework for Structured Numeric Reasoning in Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12794v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely on high-dimensional numeric telemetry and explicit operating rules to maintain safe and efficient operation. Recent large language models (LLMs) are increasingly considered as decision-support components in such systems, yet most deployments focus on textual inputs and do not directly address rule-grounded reasoning over numeric measurements. This paper proposes a rule-aware prompt framework that systematically encodes CPS domain context, numeric normalization, and decision rules into a modular prompt architecture for LLMs. The framework decomposes prompts into five reusable modules, including role specification, CPS domain context, numeric normalization, rule-aware reasoning, and output schema, and exposes an interface for plugging in diverse rule sets. A key design element is separating rule specification from the representation of normalized numeric deviations, which enables concise prompts that remain aligned with domain rules. We analyze how different normalization strategies and prompt configurations influence rule adherence, interpretability, and token efficiency. The framework is model-agnostic and applicable across CPS domains. To illustrate its behavior, we instantiate it on numeric anomaly assessment in an IEEE 118-bus electric power transmission network and evaluate several prompting and adaptation regimes. The results show that rule-aware, z-score-based value blocks and a hybrid LLM-detector architecture can substantially improve consistency with CPS rules and anomaly detection performance while reducing token usage, providing a reusable bridge between numeric telemetry and general-purpose LLMs.</description>

      <title>Distributed Reinforcement Learning using Local Smart Meter Data for Voltage Regulation in Distribution Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Centralised reinforcement learning (RL) for voltage magnitude regulation in distribution networks typically involves numerous agent-environment interactions and power flow (PF) calculations, inducing computational overhead and privacy concerns over shared data. Thus, we propose a distributed RL algorithm to regulate voltage magnitude. First, a dynamic Thevenin equivalent model is integrated within smart meters (SM), enabling local voltage magnitude estimation using local SM data for RL agent training, and mitigating the dependency of synchronised data collection and centralised PF calculations. To mitigate estimation errors induced by Thevenin model inaccuracies, a voltage magnitude correction strategy that combines piecewise functions and neural networks is introduced. The piecewise function corrects the large errors of estimated voltage magnitude, while a neural network mimics the grid's sensitivity to control actions, improving action adjustment precision. Second, a coordination strategy is proposed to refine local RL agent actions online, preventing voltage magnitude violations induced by excessive actions from multiple independently trained agents. Case studies on energy storage systems validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach, demonstrating its potential to improve voltage regulation in distribution networks.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity increase of 3D printed, self-sensing, carbon fibers structures with conductive filament matrix due to flexural loading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The excellent structural and piezoresistive properties of continuous carbon fiber make it suitable for both structural and sensing applications. This work studies the use of 3D printed, continuous carbon fiber reinforced beams as self-sensing structures. It is demonstrated how the sensitivity of these carbon fiber strain gauges can be increased irreversibly by means of a pretreatment by ``breaking-in'' the sensors with a large compressive bending load. The increase in the gauge factor is attributed to local progressive fiber failure, due to the combination of the thermal residual stress from the printing process and external loading. The coextrusion of conductive filament around the carbon fibers is demonstrated as a means of improving the reliability, noise and electrical connection of the sensors. A micrograph of the sensor cross section shows that the conductive filament contacts the various carbon fiber bundles. All-in-all, the use of ``breaking-in'' carbon fiber strain gauges in combination with coextrusion of conductive filament hold promises for 3D printed structural sensors with a high sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Data-driven Supervisory Control under Attacks via Spectral Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technological advancements facilitating the rapid development of cyber-physical systems (CPS) also render such systems vulnerable to cyber attacks with devastating effects. Supervisory control is a commonly used control method to neutralize attacks on CPS. The supervisor strives to confine the (symbolic) paths of the system to a desired language via sensors and actuators in a closed control loop, even when attackers can manipulate the symbols received by the sensors and actuators. Currently, supervisory control methods face limitations when effectively identifying and mitigating unknown, broad-spectrum attackers. In order to capture the behavior of broad-spectrum attacks on both sensing and actuation channels we model the plant, supervisors, and attackers with finite-state transducers (FSTs). Our general method for addressing unknown attackers involves constructing FST models of the attackers from spectral analysis of their input and output symbol sequences recorded from a history of attack behaviors observed in a supervisory control loop. To construct these FST models, we devise a novel learning method based on the recorded history of attack behaviors. A supervisor is synthesized using such models to neutralize the attacks.</description>

      <title>CapOptix: An Options-Framework for Capacity Market Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12871v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity markets are under increasing pressure to maintain reliability amidst rising renewable penetration, demand variability, and occasional price shocks. Traditional capacity market designs often fall short in addressing this by relying on expected-value metrics of energy unserved, which overlook risk exposure in such systems. In this work, we present CapOptix, a capacity pricing framework that interprets capacity commitments as reliability options, i.e., financial derivatives of wholesale electricity prices. CapOptix characterizes the capacity premia charged by accounting for structural price shifts modeled by the Markov Regime Switching Process. We apply the framework to historical price data from multiple electricity markets and compare the resulting premium ranges with existing capacity remuneration mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Heavy-Duty Electric Vehicles Contribution for Frequency Response in Power Systems with V2G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of heavy-duty electric vehicles (EVs) with Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) capability offers a promising solution to enhance grid stability by providing primary frequency response in power systems. This paper investigates the potential of heavy-duty EVs to support the California power grid under different charging strategies: immediate, delayed, and constant minimum power charging. Simulation results demonstrate that both V2G-capable EVs and non-V2G modes have great potential to provide primary frequency response, with V2G-capable EVs exhibiting especially strong contributions. The study highlights the influence of charging strategies, control modes, and grid conditions on EV contributions to grid stability, emphasizing their critical role in mitigating the adverse effects of renewable energy penetration.</description>

      <title>On the embedding transformation for optimal control of multi-mode switched systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops an embedding-based approach to solve switched optimal control problems (SOCPs) with an arbitrary number of subsystems. Initially, the discrete switching signal is represented by a set of binary variables, encoding each mode in binary format. An embedded optimal control problem (EOCP) is then formulated by replacing these binary variables with continuous embedded variables that can take intermediate values between zero and one. Although embedding allows SOCPs to be addressed using conventional techniques, the optimal solutions of EOCPs often yield intermediate values for binary variables, which may not be feasible for the original SOCP. To address this challenge, a modified EOCP (MEOCP) is introduced by adding a concave auxiliary cost function of appropriate dimensionality to the main cost function. This addition ensures that the optimal solution of the EOCP is bang-bang, and as a result, feasible for the original SOCP.</description>

      <title>Information-Optimal Formation Geometry Design for Multimodal UAV Cooperative Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficacy of UAV swarm cooperative perception fundamentally depends on three-dimensional (3D) formation geometry, which governs target observability and sensor complementarity. In the literature, the exploitation of formation geometry and its impact on UAV sensing have rarely been studied, which can significantly degrade multimodal cooperative perception at scenarios where heterogeneous payloads (vision cameras and LiDAR) should be geometrically arranged to exploit their complementary strengths while managing communication interference and hardware budgets. To bridge this critical gap, we propose an information-theoretic optimization framework that allocation of UAVs and multimodal sensors, configures formation geometries, and flight control. The UAV-sensor allocation is optimized by the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) determinant maximization. Under this framework we introduce an equivalent formation transition strategy that enhances field-of-view (FOV) coverage without compromising perception accuracy and communication interference. Furthermore, we design a novel Lyapunov-stable flight control scheme with logarithmic potential fields to generate energy-efficient trajectories for formation transitions. Extensive simulations demonstrate our formation-aware design achieves 25.0\% improvement in FOV coverage, 104.2\% enhancement in communication signal strength, and 47.2\% reduction in energy consumption compared to conventional benchmarks. This work establishes that task-driven geometric configuration represents a foundational rather than incidental component in next-generation UAV swarm systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To address system frequency challenges driven by the integration of renewable generation, advanced control strategies are designed at the device level to provide effective frequency support following disturbances. However, typically relying on energy-based performance metrics, these methods cannot guarantee the system frequency constraints such as frequency nadir and maximum Rate-of-Change-of-Frequency (RoCoF). Moreover, locally-designed frequency support cannot minimize the overall system cost to maintain frequency stability. On the other hand, the concept of frequency-constrained system scheduling is introduced, which incorporates frequency dynamic constraints into the system economic optimization, so that frequency requirements can be maintained with minimum cost. However, these works rely on analytical approximations of the frequency dynamic metrics, which are mathematically complicated and tend to be over-conservative for the approximation of IBR headroom requirements.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models for Power System Applications: A Comprehensive Literature Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13004v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This comprehensive literature review examines the emerging applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in power system engineering. Through a systematic analysis of recent research published between 2020 and 2025, we explore how LLMs are being integrated into various aspects of power system operations, planning, and management. The review covers key application areas including fault diagnosis, load forecasting, cybersecurity, control and optimization, system planning, simulation, and knowledge management. Our findings indicate that while LLMs show promising potential in enhancing power system operations through their advanced natural language processing and reasoning capabilities, significant challenges remain in their practical implementation. These challenges include limited domain-specific training data, concerns about reliability and safety in critical infrastructure, and the need for enhanced explainability. The review also highlights emerging trends such as the development of power system-specific LLMs and hybrid approaches combining LLMs with traditional power engineering methods. We identify crucial research directions for advancing the field, including the development of specialized architectures, improved security frameworks, and enhanced integration with existing power system tools. This survey provides power system researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive overview of the current state of LLM applications in the field and outlines future pathways for research and development.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many multi-agent systems, communication is limited by bandwidth, latency, and energy constraints. Designing controllers that achieve coordination and safety with minimal communication is critical for scalable and reliable deployment. This paper presents a method for designing controllers that minimize inter-agent communication in multi-agent systems while satisfying safety and coordination requirements, while conforming to communication delay constraints. The control synthesis problem is cast as a rank minimization problem, where a convex relaxation is obtained via system level synthesis. Simulation results on various tasks, including trajectory tracking with relative and heterogeneous sensing, demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces inter-agent transmission compared to baseline approaches.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the ongoing energy transition, shared mobility service providers are emerging actors in electrical power systems which aim to shift combustion-based mobility to electric paradigm. In the meantime, Energy Communities are deployed to enhance the local usage of distributed renewable production. As both ators share the same goal of satisfying the demand at the lowest cost, they could take advantage of their complementarity and coordinate their decisions to enhance each other operation. This paper presents an original Mixed-Integer Second Order Cone Programming long-term Electric Vehicle fleet planning optimization problem that integrates the coordination with a Renewable Energy Community and Vehicle-to-Grid capability. This model is used to assess the economic, energy, and grid performances of their collaboration in a 21 buses low-voltage distribution network. Key results show that, both actors coordination can help reducing the yearly cost up to 11.3 % compared to their stand-alone situation and that it may reduce the stress on the substation transformer by 46 % through the activation of the inherent EVs flexibility when subject to peak penalties from the grid operator.</description>

      <title>Plant Equivalent Controller Realizations for Attack-Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As cyber-physical systems (CPSs) become more dependent on data and communication networks, their vulnerability to false data injection (FDI) attacks has raised significant concerns. Among these, stealthy attacks, those that evade conventional detection mechanisms, pose a critical threat to closed-loop performance. This paper introduces a controller-oriented method to enhance CPS resiliency against such attacks without compromising nominal closed-loop behavior. Specifically, we propose the concept of plant equivalent controller (PEC) realizations, representing a class of dynamic output-feedback controllers that preserve the input-output behavior of a given base controller while exhibiting distinct robustness properties in the presence of disturbances and sensor attacks. To quantify and improve robustness, we employ reachable set analysis to assess the impact of stealthy attacks on the closed-loop dynamics. Building on this analysis, we provide mathematical tools (in terms of linear matrix inequalities) to synthesize the optimal PEC realization that minimizes the reachable set under peak-bounded disturbances. The proposed framework thus provides systematic analysis and synthesis tools to enhance the attack resilience of CPSs while maintaining the desired nominal performance. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on the quadruple-tank process subject to stealthy sensor attacks.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Material Volume Fractions in a Microwave Resonant Cavity Sensor Using Convolutional Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A non-destructive, real-time method for estimating the volume fraction of a dielectric mixture inside a resonant cavity is presented. A convolutional neural network (CNN)-based approach is used to estimate the fractional composition of two-phase dielectric mixtures inside a resonant cavity using scattering parameter (S-parameter) measurements. A rectangular cavity sensor with a strip feed structure is characterized using a vector network analyzer (VNA) from 0.01--20~GHz. The CNN is trained using both simulated and experimentally measured S-parameters and achieves high predictive accuracy even without de-embedding or filtering, demonstrating robustness to measurement imperfections. The simulation results achieve a coefficient of determination ($R^2$)=0.99 using $k$-fold cross-validation, while the experimental model using raw data achieves an $R^2=0.94$ with a mean absolute error (MAE) below 6\%. Data augmentation further improves the accuracy of the experimental prediction to above $R^2=0.998$ (MAE$&lt;$0.72\%). The proposed method enables rapid, non-destructive, accurate, low-cost, and real-time estimation of material fractions, illustrating strong potential for sensing applications in microwave material characterization.</description>

      <title>An End-to-End Neural Network Transceiver Design for OFDM System with FPGA-Accelerated Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution toward sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks demands high-performance transceiver architectures capable of handling complex and dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) receivers rely on cascaded discrete Fourier transform (DFT) and demodulation blocks, which are prone to inter-stage error propagation and suboptimal global performance. In this work, we propose two neural network (NN) models DFT-Net and Demodulation-Net (Demod-Net) to jointly replace the IDFT/DFT and demodulation modules in an OFDM transceiver. The models are trained end-to-end (E2E) to minimize bit error rate (BER) while preserving operator equivalence for hybrid deployment. A customized DFT-Demodulation Net Accelerator (DDNA) is further developed to efficiently map the proposed networks onto field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platforms. Leveraging fine-grained pipelining and block matrix operations, DDNA achieves high throughput and flexibility under stringent latency constraints. Experimental results show that the DL-based transceiver consistently outperforms the conventional OFDM system across multiple modulation schemes. With only a modest increase in hardware resource usage, it achieves approximately 1.5 dB BER gain and up to 66\% lower execution time.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Worker Assembly Line Rebalancing with Spatial and Ergonomic Considerations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the Assembly Line Rebalancing Problem in manual assembly systems where multiple workers operate in parallel within the same station - an industrially relevant scenario that remains insufficiently explored in the literature. A multi-objective optimization model is proposed that incorporates task reassignment, worker allocation, ergonomic evaluation, and explicit spatial feasibility through work-area constraints. The formulation minimizes deviations from the current configuration while promoting balanced workload and ergonomic conditions among workers. Computational experiments on synthetic problem instances demonstrate that the model consistently generates feasible and human-centered reconfigurations across varying cycle-time conditions, highlighting its potential as a decision-support tool for industrial rebalancing in flexible production environments.</description>

      <title>Neural Control Barrier Functions for Signal Temporal Logic Specifications with Input Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) provides a powerful framework to describe complex tasks involving temporal and logical behavior in dynamical systems. In this work, we address the problem of synthesizing controllers for continuous-time systems under STL specifications with input constraints. We propose a neural network-based framework for synthesizing time-varying control barrier functions (TVCBF) and their corresponding controllers for systems to fulfill STL specifications while respecting input constraints. We formulate barrier conditions incorporating the spatial and temporal logic of the given STL specification. Additionally, we introduce a validity condition to provide formal safety guarantees across the entire state space. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several simulation studies considering different STL tasks.</description>

      <title>QoS-Aware State-Augmented Learnable Framework for 5G NR-U/Wi-Fi Coexistence: Impact of Parameter Selection and Enhanced Collision Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlicensed spectrum supports diverse traffic with stringent Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements. In NR-U/Wi-Fi coexistence,the values of MAC parameters critically influence delay, collision behavior, and airtime fairness and efficiency. In this paper, we investigate the impact of (i) cost scaling and violation modeling, (ii) choice of MAC parameters, and (iii) an enhanced collision resolution scheme for the Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) mechanism on the performance of a state-augmented constrained reinforcement learning controller for NR-U/Wi-Fi coexistence. Coexistence control is formulated as a constrained Markov decision process with an explicit delay constraint for high-priority traffic and fairness as the optimization goal. Our simulation results show three key findings: (1) signed, threshold-invariant cost scaling with temporal smoothing stabilizes learning and strengthens long-term constraint adherence; (2) use of the contention window parameter for control provides smoother adaptation and better delay compliance than other MAC parameters; and (3) enhanced LBT significantly reduces collisions and improves airtime efficiency. These findings provide practical insights for achieving robust, QoS-aware coexistence control.</description>

      <title>Balancing Timeliness and Privacy in Discrete-Time Updating Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the trade-off between Age of Information (AoI) and maximal leakage (MaxL) in discrete-time status updating systems. A source generates time-stamped update packets that are processed by a server that delivers them to a monitor. An adversary, who eavesdrops on the server-monitor link, wishes to infer the timing of the underlying source update sequence. The server must balance the timeliness of the status information at the monitor against the timing information leaked to the adversary. We consider a model with Bernoulli source updates under two classes of Last-Come-First-Served (LCFS) service policies: (1) Coupled policies that tie the server's deliveries to the update arrival process in a preemptive queue; (2) Decoupled (dumping) policies in which the server transmits its freshest update according to a schedule that is independent of the update arrivals. For each class, we characterize the structure of the optimal policy that minimizes AoI for a given MaxL rate. Our analysis reveals that decoupled dumping policies offer a superior age-leakage trade-off to coupled policies. When subject to a MaxL constraint, we prove that the optimal dumping strategy is achieved by dithering between two adjacent deterministic dump periods.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) enables smart manufacturing by leveraging real-time data, AI models, and intelligent control systems. This paper presents a state-of-the-art analysis on the emerging field of DTs in the context of milling. The critical aspects of DT are explored through the lens of virtual models of physical milling, data flow from physical milling to virtual model, and feedback from virtual model to physical milling. Live data streaming protocols and virtual modeling methods are highlighted. A case study showcases the transformative capability of a real-time machine learning-driven live DT of tool-work contact in a milling process. Future research directions are outlined to achieve the goals of Industry 4.0 and beyond.</description>

      <title>Impact analysis of hidden faults in nonlinear control systems using output-to-output gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked control systems (NCSs) are vulnerable to faults and hidden malfunctions in communication channels that can degrade performance or even destabilize the closed loop. Classical metrics in robust control and fault detection typically treat impact and detectability separately, whereas the output-to-output gain (OOG) provides a unified measure of both. While existing results have been limited to linear systems, this paper extends the OOG framework to nonlinear NCSs with quadratically constrained nonlinearities, considering false-injection attacks that can also manipulate sensor measurements through nonlinear transformations. Specifically, we provide computationally efficient linear matrix inequality conditions and complementary frequency-domain tests that yield explicit upper bounds on the OOG of this class of nonlinear systems. Furthermore, we derive frequency-domain conditions for absolute stability of closed-loop systems, generalizing the Yakubovich quadratic criterion.</description>

      <title>Identification of Technical Design Constraints and Considerations for Transmission Grid Expansion Planning Projects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large-scale deployment of renewable energy sources, particularly offshore wind, requires large-scale transmission grid expansion projects to transmit the produced low-carbon power to the main demand centers. However, the planning and design of such complex projects currently lack a transparent and systematic process that system operators can follow when considering such investments in their grids. This paper identifies and classifies the main technical design constraints and considerations relevant to the planning of transmission grid expansion projects, and more specifically, electrical energy hubs. Seven key areas of interest are identified, namely network integration, HVDC technologies, costs (CAPEX, OPEX, and space requirements), electricity market design, future proofness and modular expandability, reliability-availability-maintainability, and sustainability. Each area of interest is analyzed in terms of its technical and operational relevance, with technical design constraints and considerations derived from such analysis. In addition, a hierarchical classification of the identified constraints and considerations (and therefore areas of interest) is introduced, distinguishing them between three criticality classes, namely hard constraints, main drivers, and key considerations. The dependencies between the different areas are discussed, too. Therefore, this work provides system operators and policymakers with a structured basis to support a transparent planning methodology with clear decision hierarchies for investments in transmission grid expansion projects.</description>

      <title>An $H_2$-norm approach to performance analysis of networked control systems under multiplicative routing transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of networked control systems subject to multiplicative routing transformations that alter measurement pathways without directly injecting signals. Such transformations, arising from faults or adversarial actions, modify the feedback structure and can degrade performance while remaining stealthy. An $H_2$-norm framework is proposed to quantify the impact of these transformations by evaluating the ratio between the steady-state energies of performance and residual outputs. Equivalent linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations are derived for computational assessment, and analytical upper bounds are established to estimate the worst-case degradation. The results provide structural insight into how routing manipulations influence closed-loop behavior and reveal conditions for stealthy multiplicative attacks.</description>

      <title>Competent Discrete Time Modeling For analogue controlled PWM Converter Considering State-Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ever since R.D.Middlebrook proposed the state space averaging notion. The small signal model has been widely used as a design tool to tune control parameters. As Moore's law is continuing and the AI chip's high demand for power consumption and dynamic response, the control bandwidth needs to be boosted. However, the average model has two basic assumptions: the low-frequency assumption, the small ripple assumption. In high-bandwidth design, these two assumptions are violated. In order to solve this, various methods have been proposed. This paper gives a comprehensive overview of the existing small signal model for PWM converters from the following perspectives: 1. model fidelity, 2. analytical tractability. 3. complexity of the derivation process and result 4.generality.</description>

      <title>Bidding Aggregated Flexibility in European Electricity Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bidding flexibility in day-ahead and intraday auctions would enable decentralized flexible resources, such as electric vehicles and heat pumps, to efficiently align their consumption with the intermittent generation of renewable energy. However, because these resources are individually too small to participate in those auctions directly, an aggregator (e.g., a utility) must act on their behalf. This requires aggregating many decentralized resources, which is a computationally challenging task. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient and highly accurate method that is readily applicable to European day-ahead and intraday auctions. Distinct from existing methods, we aggregate only economically relevant power profiles, identified through price forecasts. The resulting flexibility is then conveyed to the market operator via exclusive groups of block bids. We evaluate our method for a utility serving the Swiss town of Losone, where flexibility from multiple heat pumps distributed across the grid must be aggregated and bid in the Swiss day-ahead auction. Results show that our method aggregates accurately, achieving 98% of the theoretically possible cost savings. This aggregation accuracy remains stable even as the number of heat pumps increases, while computation time grows only linearly, demonstrating strong scalability.</description>

      <title>Model Discovery and Graph Simulation: A Lightweight Gateway to Chaos Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11176v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chaos engineering reveals resilience risks but is expensive and operationally risky to run broadly and often. Model-based analyses can estimate dependability, yet in practice they are tricky to build and keep current because models are typically handcrafted. We claim that a simple connectivity-only topological model - just the service-dependency graph plus replica counts - can provide fast, low-risk availability estimates under fail-stop faults. To make this claim practical without hand-built models, we introduce model discovery: an automated step that can run in CI/CD or as an observability-platform capability, synthesizing an explicit, analyzable model from artifacts teams already have (e.g., distributed traces, service-mesh telemetry, configs/manifests) - providing an accessible gateway for teams to begin resilience testing. As a proof by instance on the DeathStarBench Social Network, we extract the dependency graph from Jaeger and estimate availability across two deployment modes and five failure rates. The discovered model closely tracks live fault-injection results; with replication, median error at mid-range failure rates is near zero, while no-replication shows signed biases consistent with excluded mechanisms. These results create two opportunities: first, to triage and reduce the scope of expensive chaos experiments in advance, and second, to generate real-time signals on the system's resilience posture as its topology evolves, preserving live validation for the most critical or ambiguous scenarios.</description>

Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers -- Score Based Diffusions, Bridge Diffusions and Path Integral Diffusions -- match a target at terminal time, but the real leverage comes from choosing the schedule that governs the intermediate-time dynamics. We develop a path-wise schedule -- selection gramework for Harmonic PID with a time-varying stiffness, exploiting Piece-Wise-Constant(PWC) parametrizations and a simple hierarchical refinement. We introduce schedule-sensitive Quality-of-Sampling (QoS) diagnostics. Assuming a Gaussian-Mixture (GM) target, we retain closed-form Green functions' ration and numerically stable, Neural-Network free oracles for predicted-state maps and score. Experiments in 2D show that QoS driven PWC schedules consistently improve early-exit fidelity, tail accuracy, conditioning of the dynamics, and speciation (label-selection) timing at fixed integration budgets.</description>

      <title>Generative Stochastic Optimal Transport: Guided Harmonic Path-Integral Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Guided Harmonic Path-Integral Diffusion (GH-PID), a linearly-solvable framework for guided Stochastic Optimal Transport (SOT) with a hard terminal distribution and soft, application-driven path costs. A low-dimensional guidance protocol shapes the trajectory ensemble while preserving analytic structure: the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations remain linear, the optimal score admits an explicit Green-function ratio, and Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) terminal laws yield closed-form expressions. This enables stable sampling and differentiable protocol learning under exact terminal matching.
  We develop guidance-centric diagnostics -- path cost, centerline adherence, variance flow, and drift effort -- that make GH-PID an interpretable variational ansatz for empirical SOT. Three navigation scenarios illustrated in 2D: (i) Case A: hand-crafted protocols revealing how geometry and stiffness shape lag, curvature effects, and mode evolution; (ii) Case B: single-task protocol learning, where a PWC centerline is optimized to minimize integrated cost; (iii) Case C: multi-expert fusion, in which a commander reconciles competing expert/teacher trajectories and terminal beliefs through an exact product-of-experts law and learns a consensus protocol. Across all settings, GH-PID generates geometry-aware, trust-aware trajectories that satisfy the prescribed terminal distribution while systematically reducing integrated cost.</description>

      <title>Traversability Aware Autonomous Navigation for Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous navigation in unstructured environments requires robots to assess terrain difficulty in real-time and plan paths that balance efficiency with safety. This thesis presents a traversability-aware navigation framework for the M4 robot platform that uses learned terrain analysis to generate energy-efficient paths avoiding difficult terrain.Our approach uses FAST-LIO for real-time localization, generating 2.5D elevation maps from LiDAR point clouds. A CNN-based model processes these elevation maps to estimate traversability scores, which are converted into navigation costs for path planning. A custom A* planner incorporates these costs alongside geometric distance and energy consumption to find paths that trade modest distance increases for substantial terrain quality improvements. Before system development, a platform-agnostic study compared LiDAR-based and camera-based SLAM using OptiTrack ground truth. Point cloud comparison through ICP alignment and cloud-to-mesh distance analysis demonstrated that LiDAR-based mapping achieves centimeter-level precision essential for elevation mapping, while camera-based approaches exhibited significantly higher geometric error. These findings directly resulted in the selection of LiDAR as the primary sensor to generate elevation maps. The complete pipeline integrates FAST-LIO localization, GPU-accelerated elevation mapping, CNN-based traversability estimation, and Nav2 navigation with a custom traversability-aware planner. Experimental results demonstrate that the system successfully avoids low traversability regions and accepts a few longer paths to achieve a reduction in terrain cost. This work establishes a foundation for intelligent terrain-aware navigation applicable to multi-modal robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>VLSA: Vision-Language-Action Models with Plug-and-Play Safety Constraint Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generalizing across diverse robotic manipulation tasks. However, deploying these models in unstructured environments remains challenging due to the critical need for simultaneous task compliance and safety assurance, particularly in preventing potential collisions during physical interactions. In this work, we introduce a Vision-Language-Safe Action (VLSA) architecture, named AEGIS, which contains a plug-and-play safety constraint (SC) layer formulated via control barrier functions. AEGIS integrates directly with existing VLA models to improve safety with theoretical guarantees, while maintaining their original instruction-following performance. To evaluate the efficacy of our architecture, we construct a comprehensive safety-critical benchmark SafeLIBERO, spanning distinct manipulation scenarios characterized by varying degrees of spatial complexity and obstacle intervention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, AEGIS achieves a 59.16% improvement in obstacle avoidance rate while substantially increasing the task execution success rate by 17.25%. To facilitate reproducibility and future research, we make our code, models, and the benchmark datasets publicly available at https://vlsa-aegis.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Modified Hybrid A* Collision-Free Path-Planning for Automated Reverse Parking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parking a vehicle in tight spaces is a challenging task to perform due to the scarcity of feasible paths that are also collision-free. This paper presents a strategy to tackle this kind of maneuver with a modified Hybrid-A* path-planning algorithm that combines the feasibility guarantee inherent in the standard Hybrid A* algorithm with the addition of static obstacle collision avoidance. A kinematic single-track model is derived to describe the low-speed motion of the vehicle, which is subsequently used as the motion model in the Hybrid A* path-planning algorithm to generate feasible motion primitive branches. The model states are also used to reconstruct the vehicle centerline, which, in conjunction with an inflated binary occupancy map, facilitates static obstacle collision avoidance functions. Simulation study and animation are set up to test the efficacy of the approach, and the proposed algorithm proves to consistently provide kinematically feasible trajectories that are also collision-free.</description>

      <title>Goal Reaching with Eikonal-Constrained Hierarchical Quasimetric Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) mitigates the difficulty of reward design by framing tasks as goal reaching rather than maximizing hand-crafted reward signals. In this setting, the optimal goal-conditioned value function naturally forms a quasimetric, motivating Quasimetric RL (QRL), which constrains value learning to quasimetric mappings and enforces local consistency through discrete, trajectory-based constraints. We propose Eikonal-Constrained Quasimetric RL (Eik-QRL), a continuous-time reformulation of QRL based on the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE). This PDE-based structure makes Eik-QRL trajectory-free, requiring only sampled states and goals, while improving out-of-distribution generalization. We provide theoretical guarantees for Eik-QRL and identify limitations that arise under complex dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce Eik-Hierarchical QRL (Eik-HiQRL), which integrates Eik-QRL into a hierarchical decomposition. Empirically, Eik-HiQRL achieves state-of-the-art performance in offline goal-conditioned navigation and yields consistent gains over QRL in manipulation tasks, matching temporal-difference methods.</description>

      <title>Fractional Calculus in Optimal Control and Game Theory: Theory, Numerics, and Applications -- A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many physical, biological, and engineered systems exhibit memory effects that challenge Markovian models. Fractional calculus provides nonlocal operators to capture hereditary dynamics. This survey connects modeling, analysis, and controller/game design for systems with memory. We unify notation for Caputo, Riemann-Liouville, and Grunwald-Letnikov derivatives and relate them to practical approximations, including diffusive (sum-of-exponentials) state augmentation and frequency-domain realizations (e.g., Oustaloup). We review fractional extensions of the calculus of variations and the Pontryagin maximum principle, and dynamic-programming formulations with memory, including path-dependent HJB for optimal control and HJI for zero-sum games. We cover design tools such as LQR, MPC, and fractional-order PID, as well as fractional differential games with Nash, Stackelberg, and minimax equilibria. Computational approaches are compared across time-domain schemes, frequency-domain approximations, and diffusive augmentations, highlighting accuracy-complexity trade-offs and remedies for the curse of history (windowing and sum-of-exponentials). We conclude with applications and open problems on equilibria with memory, Isaacs-type conditions, constraint handling, and scalable solvers.</description>

      <title>Measuring What Matters: Scenario-Driven Evaluation for Trajectory Predictors in Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Being able to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents is essential for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems in dynamic situations. While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Asynchronous Semantics in Trace-Discovered Resilience Models: A Case Study on the OpenTelemetry Demo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While distributed tracing and chaos engineering are becoming standard for microservices, resilience models remain largely manual and bespoke. We revisit a trace-discovered connectivity model that derives a service dependency graph from traces and uses Monte Carlo simulation to estimate endpoint availability under fail-stop service failures. Compared to earlier work, we (i) derive the graph directly from raw OpenTelemetry traces, (ii) attach endpoint-specific success predicates, and (iii) add a simple asynchronous semantics that treats Kafka edges as non-blocking for immediate HTTP success. We apply this model to the OpenTelemetry Demo ("Astronomy Shop") using a GitHub Actions workflow that discovers the graph, runs simulations, and executes chaos experiments that randomly kill microservices in a Docker Compose deployment. Across the studied failure fractions, the model reproduces the overall availability degradation curve, while asynchronous semantics for Kafka edges change predicted availabilities by at most about 10^(-5) (0.001 percentage points). This null result suggests that for immediate HTTP availability in this case study, explicitly modeling asynchronous dependencies is not warranted, and a simpler connectivity-only model is sufficient.</description>

      <title>Unifying Quadrotor Motion Planning and Control by Chaining Different Fidelity Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many aerial tasks involving quadrotors demand both instant reactivity and long-horizon planning. High-fidelity models enable accurate control but are too slow for long horizons; low-fidelity planners scale but degrade closed-loop performance. We present Unique, a unified MPC that cascades models of different fidelity within a single optimization: a short-horizon, high-fidelity model for accurate control, and a long-horizon, low-fidelity model for planning. We align costs across horizons, derive feasibility-preserving thrust and body-rate constraints for the point-mass model, and introduce transition constraints that match the different states, thrust-induced acceleration, and jerk-body-rate relations. To prevent local minima emerging from nonsmooth clutter, we propose a 3D progressive smoothing schedule that morphs norm-based obstacles along the horizon. In addition, we deploy parallel randomly initialized MPC solvers to discover lower-cost local minima on the long, low-fidelity horizon. In simulation and real flights, under equal computational budgets, Unique improves closed-loop position or velocity tracking by up to 75% compared with standard MPC and hierarchical planner-tracker baselines. Ablations and Pareto analyses confirm robust gains across horizon variations, constraint approximations, and smoothing schedules.</description>

Abstract: Quantum state tomography is a core task in quantum system identification. Real experimental conditions often deviate from nominal designs, introducing errors in both the measurement devices and the Hamiltonian governing the system's dynamics. In this paper, we investigate the robustness of quantum state tomography against such perturbations in both static and dynamic settings using linear regression estimation. We derive explicit bounds that quantify how bounded errors in the measurement devices and the Hamiltonian affect the mean squared error (MSE) upper bound in each scenario. Numerical simulations for qubit systems illustrate how these bounds scale with resources.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Optimization Parameter Tuning Framework for a Lyapunov Based Path Following Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameter tuning in real-world experiments is constrained by the limited evaluation budget available on hardware. The path-following controller studied in this paper reflects a typical situation in nonlinear geometric controller, where multiple gains influence the dynamics through coupled nonlinear terms. Such interdependence makes manual tuning inefficient and unlikely to yield satisfactory performance within a practical number of trials. To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that treats the closed-loop system as a black box and selects controller gains using a Gaussian-process surrogate. BO offers model-free exploration, quantified uncertainty, and data-efficient search, making it well suited for tuning tasks where each evaluation is costly. The framework is implemented on Honda's AI-Formula three-wheeled robot and assessed through repeated full-lap experiments on a fixed test track. The results show that BO improves controller performance within 32 trials, including 15 warm-start initial evaluations, indicating that it can efficiently locate high-performing regions of the parameter space under real-world conditions. These findings demonstrate that BO provides a practical, reliable, and data-efficient tuning approach for nonlinear path-following controllers on real robotic platforms.</description>

      <title>From Information Freshness to Semantics of Information and Goal-oriented Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12758v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless networks must support real-time, data-driven cyber-physical systems in which communication is tightly coupled with sensing, inference, control, and decision-making. Traditional communication paradigms centered on accuracy, throughput, and latency are increasingly inadequate for these systems, where the value of information depends on its semantic relevance to a specific task. This paper provides a unified exposition of the progression from classical distortion-based frameworks, through information freshness metrics such as the Age of Information (AoI) and its variants, to the emerging paradigm of goal-oriented semantics-aware communication. We organize and systematize existing semantics-aware metrics, including content- and version-aware measures, context-dependent distortion formulations, and history-dependent error persistence metrics that capture lasting impact and urgency. Within this framework, we highlight how these metrics address the limitations of purely accuracy- or freshness-centric designs, and how they collectively enable the selective generation and transmission of only task-relevant information. We further review analytical tools based on Markov decision process (MDP) and Lyapunov optimization methods that have been employed to characterize optimal or near-optimal timing and scheduling policies under semantic performance criteria and communication constraints. By synthesizing these developments into a coherent framework, the paper clarifies the design principles underlying goal-oriented, semantics-aware communication systems. It illustrates how they can significantly improve efficiency, reliability, and task performance. The presented perspective aims to serve as a bridge between information-theoretic, control-theoretic, and networking viewpoints, and to guide the design of semantic communication architectures for 6G and beyond.</description>

      <title>KANEL\'E: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Efficient LUT-based Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Low-latency, resource-efficient neural network inference on FPGAs is essential for applications demanding real-time capability and low power. Lookup table (LUT)-based neural networks are a common solution, combining strong representational power with efficient FPGA implementation. In this work, we introduce KANEL\'E, a framework that exploits the unique properties of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for FPGA deployment. Unlike traditional multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), KANs employ learnable one-dimensional splines with fixed domains as edge activations, a structure naturally suited to discretization and efficient LUT mapping. We present the first systematic design flow for implementing KANs on FPGAs, co-optimizing training with quantization and pruning to enable compact, high-throughput, and low-latency KAN architectures. Our results demonstrate up to a 2700x speedup and orders of magnitude resource savings compared to prior KAN-on-FPGA approaches. Moreover, KANEL\'E matches or surpasses other LUT-based architectures on widely used benchmarks, particularly for tasks involving symbolic or physical formulas, while balancing resource usage across FPGA hardware. Finally, we showcase the versatility of the framework by extending it to real-time, power-efficient control systems.</description>

      <title>MPC-Guided Safe Reinforcement Learning and Lipschitz-Based Filtering for Structured Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern engineering systems, such as autonomous vehicles, flexible robotics, and intelligent aerospace platforms, require controllers that are robust to uncertainties, adaptive to environmental changes, and safety-aware under real-time constraints. RL offers powerful data-driven adaptability for systems with nonlinear dynamics that interact with uncertain environments. RL, however, lacks built-in mechanisms for dynamic constraint satisfaction during exploration. MPC offers structured constraint handling and robustness, but its reliance on accurate models and computationally demanding online optimization may pose significant challenges. This paper proposes an integrated MPC-RL framework that combines stability and safety guarantees of MPC with the adaptability of RL. During training, MPC defines safe control bounds that guide the RL component and that enable constraint-aware policy learning. At deployment, the learned policy operates in real time with a lightweight safety filter based on Lipschitz continuity to ensure constraint satisfaction without heavy online optimizations. The approach, which is validated on a nonlinear aeroelastic wing system, demonstrates improved disturbance rejection, reduced actuator effort, and robust performance under turbulence. The architecture generalizes to other domains with structured nonlinearities and bounded disturbances, offering a scalable solution for safe artificial-intelligence-driven control in engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Iterative Tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Manufacturing Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manufacturing processes are often perturbed by drifts in the environment and wear in the system, requiring control re-tuning even in the presence of repetitive operations. This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Generation of Smooth Paths with Curvature Guarantees by Mollification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most path following and trajectory tracking algorithms in mobile robotics require the desired path or trajectory to be defined by at least twice continuously differentiable functions to guarantee key properties such as global convergence, especially for nonholonomic robots like unicycles with speed constraints. Consequently, these algorithms typically exclude continuous but non-differentiable paths, such as piecewise functions. Despite this exclusion, such paths provide convenient high-level inputs for describing robot missions or behavior. While techniques such as spline interpolation or optimization-based methods are commonly used to smooth non-differentiable paths or create feasible ones from sequences of waypoints, they either can produce unnecessarily complex trajectories or are computationally expensive. In this work, we present a method to regularize non-differentiable functions and generate feasible paths through mollification. Specifically, we approximate an arbitrary path with a differentiable function that can converge to it with arbitrary precision. Additionally, we provide a systematic method for bounding the curvature of generated paths, which we demonstrate by applying it to paths resulting from linking a sequence of waypoints with segments. The proposed approach is computationally efficient, enabling real-time implementation on microcontrollers and compatibility with standard trajectory tracking and path following algorithms.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Material Point Method for the Control of Deformable Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the deformation of flexible objects is challenging due to their non-linear dynamics and high-dimensional configuration space. This work presents a differentiable Material Point Method (MPM) simulator targeted at control applications. We exploit the differentiability of the simulator to optimize a control trajectory in an active damping problem for a hyperelastic rope. The simulator effectively minimizes the kinetic energy of the rope around 2$\times$ faster than a baseline MPPI method and to a 20% lower energy level, while using about 3% of the computation time.</description>

      <title>Temporal parallelisation of continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori trajectory estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a parallel-in-time method for computing continuous-time maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) trajectory estimates of the states of partially observed stochastic differential equations (SDEs), with the goal of improving computational speed on parallel architectures. The MAP estimation problem is reformulated as a continuous-time optimal control problem based on the Onsager-Machlup functional. This reformulation enables the use of a previously proposed parallel-in-time solution for optimal control problems, which we adapt to the current problem. The structure of the resulting optimal control problem admits a parallel solution based on parallel associative scan algorithms. In the linear Gaussian special case, it yields a parallel Kalman-Bucy filter and a parallel continuous-time Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother. These linear computational methods are further extended to nonlinear continuous-time state-space models through Taylor expansions. We also present the corresponding parallel two-filter smoother. The graphics processing unit (GPU) experiments on linear and nonlinear models demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves a significant speedup in computations while maintaining the accuracy of sequential algorithms.</description>

      <title>Evaluating the Navigation Capabilities of a Modified COAST Guidewire Robot in an Anatomical Phantom Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the issues that arise due to the manual navigation of guidewires in endovascular interventions, research in medical robotics has taken a strong interest in developing robotically steerable guidewires, which offer the possibility of enhanced maneuverability and navigation, as the tip of the guidewire can be actively steered. The COaxially Aligned STeerable (COAST) guidewire robot has the ability to generate a wide variety of motions including bending motion with different bending lengths, follow-the-leader motion, and feedforward motion. In our past studies, we have explored different designs of the COAST guidewire robot and developed modeling, control, and sensing strategies for the COAST guidewire robot. In this study, the performance of a modified COAST guidewire robot is evaluated by conducting navigation experiments in an anatomical phantom model with pulsatile flow. The modified COAST guidewire robot is a simplified version of the COAST guidewire robot and consists of two tubes as opposed to three tubes. Through this study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified COAST guidewire robot in navigating the tortuous phantom vasculature.</description>

      <title>Inverse Optimal Control for Linear Quadratic Tracking with Unknown Target States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17247v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse optimal control for the linear quadratic tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system. By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a multi-agent formation control example.</description>

      <title>Learning Dissipative Chaotic Dynamics with Boundedness Guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00976v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chaotic dynamics, commonly seen in weather systems and fluid turbulence, are characterized by their sensitivity to initial conditions, which makes accurate prediction challenging. Recent approaches have focused on developing data-driven models that attempt to preserve invariant statistics over long horizons since many chaotic systems exhibit dissipative behaviors and ergodicity. Despite the recent progress in such models, they are still often prone to generating unbounded trajectories, leading to invalid statistics evaluation. To address this fundamental challenge, we introduce a modular framework that provides formal guarantees of trajectory boundedness for neural network chaotic dynamics models. Our core contribution is a dissipative projection layer that leverages control-theoretic principles to ensure the learned system is dissipative. Specifically, our framework simultaneously learns a dynamics emulator and an energy-like function, where the latter is used to construct an algebraic dissipative constraint within the projection layer. Furthermore, the learned invariant level set provides an outer estimate for the system's strange attractor, which is known to be difficult to characterize due to its complex geometry. We demonstrate our model's ability to produce bounded long-horizon forecasts that preserve invariant statistics for chaotic dynamical systems, including Lorenz 96 and a reduced-order model of the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Modularized Neural Network for Advanced Building Control by Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05397v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) provides a promising solution for building energy modeling and can serve as a virtual environment to enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents to interact and learn. However, challenges remain in efficiently integrating physics priors, evaluating the effectiveness of physics constraints, balancing model accuracy and physics consistency, and enabling real-world implementation. To address these gaps, this study introduces a Physics-Informed Modularized Neural Network (PI-ModNN), which incorporates physics priors through a physics-informed model structure, loss functions, and hard constraints. A new evaluation metric called "temperature response violation" is developed to quantify the physical consistency of data-driven building dynamic models under varying control inputs and training data sizes. Additionally, a physics prior evaluation framework based on rule importance is proposed to assess the contribution of each individual physics prior, offering guidance on selecting appropriate PIML techniques. Results indicate that incorporating physical priors does not always improve model performance; inappropriate priors may decrease model accuracy and consistency. However, hard constraints are effective in enforcing model consistency. Furthermore, we present a general workflow for developing control-oriented PIML models and integrating them with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Following this framework, a case study implementing DRL in an office space over three months demonstrates potential energy savings of 31.4%. Finally, we provide a general guideline for integrating data-driven models with advanced building control through a four-step evaluation framework, paving the way for reliable and scalable deployment of advanced building controls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a real-time hybrid controller scheme to detect and mitigate False-Data Injection (FDI) attacks on Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC). Our method uses sensor redundancy to create equivalent controller realizations, each driven by distinct sensor subsets but producing identical control inputs when no attack occurs. By comparing control signals and measurements via majority voting, the scheme identifies compromised sensors in real-time and switches to a healthy controller. The hybrid controller uses attack-dependent flow and jump sets, and resets compromised controllers' states. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach.</description>

      <title>Can Carbon-Aware Electric Load Shifting Reduce Emissions? An Equilibrium-Based Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing number of electric loads, such as hydrogen producers or data centers, can be characterized as carbon-sensitive, meaning that they are willing to adapt the timing and/or location of their electricity usage in order to minimize carbon footprints. However, the emission reduction efforts of these carbon-sensitive loads rely on carbon intensity information such as average carbon emissions, and it is unclear whether load shifting based on these signals effectively reduces carbon emissions. To address this open question, we design a carbon-aware equilibrium model, which expands the commonly used equilibrium model for standard (carbon-agnostic) electricity market clearing to include carbon-sensitive consumers that adapt their consumption based on average carbon emission signals and carbon costs. This analysis represents an idealized situation for carbon-sensitive consumers, where their carbon preferences are reflected directly in the market clearing, and contrasts with current practice, where carbon emission signals only become known to consumers a posteriori (i.e., after the market has already been cleared). Furthermore, we extend our model to consider temporal load shifting and time-varying maximum renewable generations. We employ illustrative three-bus examples and numerical simulations on the IEEE RTS-GMLC system to reveal the limitations of the widely adopted average carbon emission signal for guiding carbon emission reduction. Our model offers a novel perspective for evaluating the effectiveness of different carbon signals and contributes to new carbon signal design.</description>

Our analysis considers the broadest class to date of payoff mechanisms with first-order modifications, capable of modeling bounded rationality and anticipatory effects, averaging, or Pad\'{e} delay approximations. We propose a framework that, for the first time, combines two nonstandard system-theoretic passivity notions. Our results hold for discontinuous best response dynamics alongside continuous learning rules, significantly extending prior work.</description>

      <title>BioGAP-Ultra: A Modular Edge-AI Platform for Wearable Multimodal Biosignal Acquisition and Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing demand for continuous physiological monitoring and human-machine interaction in real-world settings calls for wearable platforms that are flexible, low-power, and capable of on-device intelligence. This work presents BioGAP-Ultra, an advanced multimodal biosensing platform that supports synchronized acquisition of diverse electrophysiological and hemodynamic signals such as EEG, EMG, ECG, and PPG while enabling embedded AI processing at state-of-the-art energy efficiency. BioGAP-Ultra is a major extension of our previous BioGAP design aimed at meeting the rapidly growing requirements of wearable biosensing applications. It features (i) increased on-device storage (x2 SRAM, x4 FLASH), (ii) improved wireless connectivity (supporting up to 1.4 Mbit/s bandwidth, x4 higher than BioGAP), (iii) enhanced number of signal modalities (from 3 to 5) and analog input channels (x2). Further, it is accompanied by a real-time visualization and analysis software suite that supports the hardware design, providing access to raw data and real-time configurability on a mobile phone. Finally, we demonstrate the system's versatility through integration into various wearable form factors: an EEG-PPG headband consuming 32.8 mW, an EMG sleeve at 26.7 mW, and an ECG-PPG chestband requiring only 9.3 mW for continuous acquisition and streaming, tailored for diverse biosignal applications. To showcase its edge-AI capabilities, we further deploy two representative on-device applications: (1) ECG-PPG-based PAT estimation at 8.6 mW, and (2) EMG-ACC-based classification of reach-and-grasp motion phases, achieving 79.9 % $\pm$ 5.7 % accuracy at 23.6 mW. All hardware and software design files are also released open-source with a permissive license.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model predictive control (MPC) framework for nonlinear stochastic systems that ensures safety guarantee with high probability. Unlike most existing stochastic MPC schemes, our method adopts a set-erosion that converts the probabilistic safety constraint into a tractable deterministic safety constraint on a smaller safe set over deterministic dynamics. As a result, our method is compatible with any off-the-shelf deterministic MPC algorithm. The key to the effectiveness of our method is a tight bound on the stochastic fluctuation of a stochastic trajectory around its nominal version. Our method is scalable and can guarantee safety with high probability level (e.g., 99.99%), making it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications involving complex nonlinear dynamics. Rigorous analysis is conducted to establish a theoretical safety guarantee, and numerical experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed MPC method.</description>

Abstract: Data centers play an increasingly critical role in societal digitalization, yet their rapidly growing energy demand poses significant challenges for sustainable operation. To enhance the energy efficiency of geographically distributed data centers, this paper formulates a multi-period optimization model that captures the interdependence of electricity, heat, and data flows. The optimization of such integrated multi-domain flows inherently involves mixed-integer formulations and the access to proprietary or sensitive datasets, which correspondingly exacerbate computational complexity and raise data-privacy concerns. To address these challenges, an adaptive federated learning-to-optimization approach is proposed, accounting for the heterogeneity of datasets across distributed data centers. To safeguard privacy, cryptography techniques are leveraged in both the learning and optimization processes. A model acceptance criterion with convergence guarantee is developed to improve learning performance and filter out potentially contaminated data, while a verifiable double aggregation mechanism is further proposed to simultaneously ensure privacy and integrity of shared data during optimization. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach preserves the privacy and integrity of shared data, achieves near-optimal performance, and exhibits high computational efficiency, making it suitable for large-scale data center optimization under privacy constraints.</description>

      <title>On Structural Properties of Risk-Averse Optimal Stopping Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01022v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish structural properties of optimal stopping problems under time-consistent dynamic (coherent) risk measures, focusing on value function monotonicity and the existence of control limit (threshold) optimal policies. While such results are well developed for risk-neutral (expected-value) models, they remain underexplored in risk-averse settings. Coherent risk measures typically lack the tower property and are subadditive rather than additive, complicating structural analysis. We show that value function monotonicity mirrors the risk-neutral case. Moreover, if the risk envelope associated with each coherent risk measure admits a minimal element, the risk-averse optimal stopping problem reduces to an equivalent risk-neutral formulation. We also develop a general procedure for identifying control limit optimal policies and use it to derive practical, verifiable conditions on the risk measures and MDP structure that guarantee their existence. We illustrate the theory and verify these conditions through optimal stopping problems arising in operations, marketing, and finance.</description>

      <title>Spacecraft Angular Rate Estimation via Event-Based Camera Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a method for determining spacecraft angular rates using event-based camera sensing. This is achieved by analyzing the temporal distribution of brightness events triggered by the apparent motion of stars. The location and polarity of the events are used to infer the apparent motion field of the stars, which is, in turn, employed to estimate the observer angular velocity in the camera frame. This can be converted to the spacecraft angular rates provided an attitude reference. The method is validated through numerical simulation for a synthetic dataset of event streams generated on random spacecraft pointing and rates conditions. The accuracy of the method is assessed, demonstrating its potential to complement or replace conventional rate sensors in spacecraft systems using event camera sensing.</description>

      <title>Cyber-Resilient Data-Driven Event-Triggered Secure Control for Autonomous Vehicles Under False Data Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a cyber-resilient secure control framework for autonomous vehicles (AVs) subject to false data injection (FDI) threats as actuator attacks. The framework integrates data-driven modeling, event-triggered communication, and fractional-order sliding mode control (FSMC) to enhance the resilience against adversarial interventions. A dynamic model decomposition (DMD)-based methodology is employed to extract the lateral dynamics from real-world data, eliminating the reliance on conventional mechanistic modeling. To optimize communication efficiency, an event-triggered transmission scheme is designed to reduce the redundant transmissions while ensuring system stability. Furthermore, an extended state observer (ESO) is developed for real-time estimation and mitigation of actuator attack effects. Theoretical stability analysis, conducted using Lyapunov methods and linear matrix inequality (LMI) formulations, guarantees exponential error convergence. Extensive simulations validate the proposed event-triggered secure control framework, demonstrating substantial improvements in attack mitigation, communication efficiency, and lateral tracking performance. The results show that the framework effectively counteracts actuator attacks while optimizing communication-resource utilization, making it highly suitable for safety-critical AV applications.</description>

      <title>A Unified Low-rank ADI Framework with Shared Linear Solves for Simultaneously Solving Multiple Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The alternating direction implicit (ADI) methods are computationally efficient and numerically effective tools for computing low-rank solutions of large-scale linear matrix equations. It is known in the literature that the low-rank ADI method for Lyapunov equations is a Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithm that implicitly performs model order reduction. It recursively enforces interpolation at the mirror images of the ADI shifts and places the poles of the reduced-order models at the ADI shifts. In this paper, we show that the low-rank ADI methods for Sylvester and Riccati equations are also Petrov-Galerkin projection algorithms that implicitly perform model order reduction. These methods likewise enforce interpolation at the mirror images of the ADI shifts; however, they do not place the poles at the mirror images of the interpolation points. Instead, their pole placement ensures that the projected Sylvester and Riccati equations they implicitly solve admit a unique solution.
  By observing that the ADI methods for Lyapunov, Sylvester, and Riccati equations differ only in pole placement and not in their interpolatory nature, we show that the shifted linear solves-which constitute the bulk of the computational cost-can be shared. The pole-placement step involves only small-scale operations and is therefore inexpensive. We propose a unified ADI framework that requires only two shifted linear solves per iteration to simultaneously solve six Lyapunov equations, one Sylvester equation, and ten Riccati equations, thus substantially increasing the return on investment for the computational cost spent on the linear solves. All operations needed to extract the individual solutions from these shared linear solves are small-scale and inexpensive. Three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed ADI framework.</description>

      <title>Estimating Hormone Concentrations in the Pituitary-Thyroid Feedback Loop from Irregularly Sampled Measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Model-based control techniques have recently been investigated for the recommendation of medication dosages to address thyroid diseases. These techniques often rely on knowledge of internal hormone concentrations that cannot be measured from blood samples. Moreover, the measurable concentrations are typically only obtainable at irregular sampling times. In this work, we empirically verify a notion of sample-based detectability that accounts for irregular sampling of the measurable concentrations on two pituitary-thyroid loop models representing patients with hypo- and hyperthyroidism, respectively, and include the internal concentrations as states. We then implement sample-based moving horizon estimation for the models, and test its performance on virtual patients across a range of sampling schemes. Our study shows robust stability of the estimator across all scenarios, and that more frequent sampling leads to less estimation error in the presence of model uncertainty and misreported dosages.</description>

      <title>An Input-Output Data-Driven Dissipativity Approach for Compositional Stability Certification of Interconnected LTI MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11468v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an input-output data-driven framework for certifying the stability of interconnected multiple-input-multiple-output linear time-invariant discrete-time systems via QSR-dissipativity. That is, by using measured input-output trajectories of each subsystem, we verify dissipative properties and extract local passivity indices without requiring an explicit model identification. These passivity indices are then used to derive conditions under which the equilibrium of the interconnected system is stable. In particular, the framework identifies how the lack of passivity in some subsystems can be compensated by surpluses in others. The proposed approach enables a compositional stability analysis by combining subsystem-level conditions into a criterion valid for the overall interconnected system. We illustrate via a numerical case study, how to compute channel-wise passivity indices and infer stability guarantees directly from data with the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Computing with an Electro-Optic Analog Memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.16515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In neuromorphic photonic systems, device operations are typically governed by analog signals, necessitating digital-to-analog converters (DAC) and analog-to-digital converters (ADC). However, data movement between memory and these converters in conventional von Neumann architectures incur significant energy costs. We propose an analog electronic memory co-located with photonic computing units to eliminate repeated long-distance data movement. Here, we demonstrate a monolithically integrated neuromorphic photonic circuit with on-chip capacitive analog memory and evaluate its performance in machine learning for in situ training and inference using the MNIST dataset. Our analysis shows that integrating analog memory into a neuromorphic photonic architecture can achieve over 26x power savings compared to conventional SRAM-DAC architectures. Furthermore, maintaining a minimum analog memory retention-to-network-latency ratio of 100 maintains &gt;90% inference accuracy, enabling leaky analog memories without substantial performance degradation. This approach reduces reliance on DACs, minimizes data movement, and offers a scalable pathway toward energy-efficient, high-speed neuromorphic photonic computing.</description>

      <title>Optimal Rates of Convergence for Entropy Regularization in Discounted Markov Decision Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04163v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the error introduced by entropy regularization in infinite-horizon discrete discounted Markov decision processes. We show that this error decreases exponentially in the inverse regularization strength, both in a weighted KL-divergence and in value with a problem-specific exponent. This is in contrast to previously known estimates, of the order $O(\tau)$, where $\tau$ is the regularization strength. We provide a lower bound that matches our upper bound up to a polynomial term, thereby characterizing the exponential convergence rate for entropy regularization. Our proof relies on the observation that the solutions of entropy-regularized Markov decision processes solve a gradient flow of the unregularized reward with respect to a Riemannian metric common in natural policy gradient methods. This correspondence allows us to identify the limit of this gradient flow as the generalized maximum entropy optimal policy, thereby characterizing the implicit bias of this gradient flow, which corresponds to a time-continuous version of the natural policy gradient method. We use our improved error estimates to show that for entropy-regularized natural policy gradient methods, the overall error decays exponentially in the square root of the number of iterations, improving over existing sublinear guarantees. Finally, we extend our analysis to settings beyond the entropy. In particular, we characterize the implicit bias regarding general convex potentials and their resulting generalized natural policy gradients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07903v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in head-mounted wearable technology are revolutionizing the field of biopotential measurement, but the integration of these technologies into practical, user-friendly devices remains challenging due to issues with design intrusiveness, comfort, and data privacy. To address these challenges, this paper presents GAPses, a novel smart glasses platform designed for unobtrusive, comfortable, and secure acquisition and processing of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG) signals. We introduce a direct electrode-electronics interface with custom dry soft electrodes to enhance comfort for long wear. An integrated parallel ultra-low-power RISC-V processor (GAP9, Greenwaves Technologies) processes data at the edge, thereby eliminating the need for continuous data streaming through a wireless link, enhancing privacy, and increasing system reliability in adverse channel conditions. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the designed prototype through validation in a number of EEG-based interaction tasks, including alpha waves, steady-state visual evoked potential analysis, and motor movement classification. Furthermore, we demonstrate an EEG-based biometric subject recognition task, where we reach a sensitivity and specificity of 98.87% and 99.86% respectively, with only 8 EEG channels and an energy consumption per inference on the edge as low as 121 $\mu J$. Moreover, in an EOG-based eye movement classification task, we reach an accuracy of 96.68% on 11 classes, resulting in an information transfer rate of 94.78 bit/min, which can be further increased to 161.43 bit/min by reducing the accuracy to 81.43%. The deployed implementation has an energy consumption of 40 $\mu J$ per inference and a total system power of only 12.4 mW, of which only 1.61% is used for classification, allowing for continuous operation of more than 22 h with a small 75 mAh battery.</description>

      <title>Variational Bayesian Inference for Multiple Extended Targets or Unresolved Group Targets Tracking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15226v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a method for tracking multiple extended targets or unresolvable group targets in a clutter environment. Firstly, based on the Random Matrix Model (RMM), the joint state of the target is modeled as the Gamma Gaussian Inverse Wishart (GGIW) distribution. Considering the uncertainty of measurement origin caused by the clutters, we adopt the idea of probabilistic data association and describe the joint association event as an unknown parameter in the joint prior distribution. Then the Variational Bayesian Inference (VBI) is employed to approximately solve the non-analytical posterior distribution. Furthermore, to ensure the practicability of the proposed method, we further provide two potential lightweight schemes to reduce its computational complexity. One of them is based on clustering, which effectively prunes the joint association events. The other is a simplification of the variational posterior through marginal association probabilities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by simulation and real data experiments, and we show that the proposed method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Major Space Weather Risks Identified via Coupled Physics-Engineering-Economic Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Space weather poses an important but under-quantified threat to critical infrastructure, the economy, and society. While extreme geomagnetic storms are recognized as potential global catastrophes, their socio-economic impacts remain poorly quantified. Here we present a novel physics-engineering-economic framework that links geophysical drivers of geomagnetic storms to power grid geoelectric fields, transformer vulnerability, and macroeconomic consequences. Using the United States as an example, we estimate daily economic losses from transformer thermal heating of 1.37 billion USD (95 percent confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.58 billion USD) for a 100-year geomagnetic storm, with power outages affecting 4.1 million people and 101,000 businesses. A 250-year event could raise losses to 2.09 billion USD per day (95 percent confidence interval: 1.84 to 2.34 billion USD), disrupting power for more than 6 million people and 155,000 businesses. Crucially, the framework is scalable and transferable, offering a template for assessing space weather risk to critical infrastructure in other countries. This integrative approach provides the first end-to-end quantification of space weather socio-economic impacts, bridging space physics through to policy-relevant metrics. Our results demonstrate that coupled socio-economic modeling of space weather is both feasible and essential, enabling evidence-based decision making in infrastructure protection and global risk management.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.11849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce LocoMamba, a vision-driven cross-modal DRL framework built on selective state-space models, specifically leveraging Mamba, that achieves near-linear-time sequence modeling, effectively captures long-range dependencies, and enables efficient training with longer sequences. First, we embed proprioceptive states with a multilayer perceptron and patchify depth images with a lightweight convolutional neural network, producing compact tokens that improve state representation. Second, stacked Mamba layers fuse these tokens via near-linear-time selective scanning, reducing latency and memory footprint, remaining robust to token length and image resolution, and providing an inductive bias that mitigates overfitting. Third, we train the policy end-to-end with Proximal Policy Optimization under terrain and appearance randomization and an obstacle-density curriculum, using a compact state-centric reward that balances progress, smoothness, and safety. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with static and moving obstacles as well as uneven terrain. Compared with state-of-the-art baselines, our method achieves higher returns and success rates with fewer collisions, exhibits stronger generalization to unseen terrains and obstacle densities, and improves training efficiency by converging in fewer updates under the same compute budget.</description>

      <title>SuperGen: An Efficient Ultra-high-resolution Video Generation System with Sketching and Tiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17756v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models have recently achieved remarkable success in generative tasks (e.g., image and video generation), and the demand for high-quality content (e.g., 2K/4K videos) is rapidly increasing across various domains. However, generating ultra-high-resolution videos on existing standard-resolution (e.g., 720p) platforms remains challenging due to the excessive re-training requirements and prohibitively high computational and memory costs. To this end, we introduce SUPERGEN, an efficient tile-based framework for ultra-high-resolution video generation. SUPERGEN features a novel training-free algorithmic innovation with tiling to successfully support a wide range of resolutions without additional training efforts while significantly reducing both memory footprint and computational complexity. Moreover, SUPERGEN incorporates a tile-tailored, adaptive, region-aware caching strategy that accelerates video generation by exploiting redundancy across denoising steps and spatial regions. SUPERGEN also integrates cache-guided, communication-minimized tile parallelism for enhanced throughput and minimized latency. Evaluations show that SUPERGEN maximizes performance gains while achieving high output quality across various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Fixed Horizon Linear Quadratic Covariance Steering in Continuous Time with Hilbert-Schmidt Terminal Cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and solve the fixed horizon linear quadratic covariance steering problem in continuous time with a terminal cost measured in Hilbert-Schmidt (i.e., Frobenius) norm error between the desired and the controlled terminal covariances. For this problem, the necessary conditions of optimality become a coupled matrix ODE two-point boundary value problem. To solve this system of equations, we design a matricial recursive algorithm and prove its convergence. The proposed algorithm and its analysis make use of the linear fractional transforms parameterized by the state transition matrix of the associated Hamiltonian matrix. To illustrate the results, we provide two numerical examples: one with a two dimensional and another with a six dimensional state space.</description>

      <title>Quantum Encrypted Control of Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03434v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Encrypted control has been extensively studied to ensure the confidentiality of system states and control inputs for networked control systems. This paper presents a computationally efficient encrypted control framework for networked systems enabled by quantum communication. A quantum channel between sensors and actuators is used to generate identical secret keys, whose security is further enhanced through quantum key distribution. These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources.</description>

      <title>AI-Assisted Game Management Decisions: A Fuzzy Logic Approach to Real-Time Soccer Substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04480v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In elite soccer, substitution decisions entail significant financial and sporting consequences yet remain heavily reliant on intuition or predictive models that merely mimic historical biases. This paper introduces a Fuzzy Logic based Decision Support System (DSS) designed for real time, prescriptive game management. Unlike traditional Machine Learning approaches that encounter a predictive ceiling by attempting to replicate human behavior, our system audits performance through an objective, rule based inference engine. We propose a methodological advancement by reformulating the PlayeRank metric into a Cumulative Mean with Role Aware Normalization, eliminating the play time exposure bias inherent in cumulative sum models to enable accurate intra match comparison. The system integrates this refined metric with physiological proxies (fatigue) and contextual variables (disciplinary risk modulated by tactical role) to calculate a dynamic Substitution Priority (P final). Validation via a case study of the 2018 FIFA World Cup match between Brazil and Belgium demonstrates the system's ecological validity: it not only aligned with expert consensus on executed substitutions (for example Gabriel Jesus) but, crucially, identified high risk scenarios ignored by human decision makers. Specifically, the model flagged the "FAGNER Paradox" - a maximum priority defensive risk - minutes before a critical yellow card, and detected the "Lukaku Paradox", where an isolated assist masked a severe drop in participation. These results confirm that Fuzzy Logic offers a transparent, explainable, and superior alternative to black box models for optimizing real time tactical decisions.</description>
