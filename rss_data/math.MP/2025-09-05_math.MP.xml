      <title>Analysis of nonlinear resonances in resonator crystals: Tight-binding approximation and existence of subwavelength soliton-like solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a mathematical framework for elucidating physical mechanisms for confining waves at subwavelength scales in periodic systems of nonlinear resonators. A discrete approximation in terms of the linear capacitance operator is provided to characterize the nonlinear subwavelength resonances. Moreover, the existence of subwavelength soliton-like localized waves in periodic systems of nonlinear resonators is proven. As a by-product, a tight-binding approximation of the capacitance operator is shown to be valid for crystals of subwavelength resonators. Both full- and half-space crystals are considered. The framework developed in this work opens the door to the study of topological properties of periodic lattices of subwavelength nonlinear resonators, such as the emergence of nonlinearity-induced topological edge states, and to elucidate the interplay between nonlinearity and disorder.</description>

      <title>Simple analyticity criteria for repulsive multi-body potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a simple, explicit lower bound on the radius of a zero-free disk for Gibbs point processes defined by finite-range, repulsive multi-body interactions. Our lower bound improves on those previously known, and we demonstrate that it is essentially sharp in the generality with which our arguments apply. The key ingredient is a multi-body generalization of integral identities for point densities of Gibbs point processes in the spirit of earlier work of Michelen and Perkins.</description>

      <title>Sharp Polynomial Velocity Decay Bounds for Multidimensional Periodic Schr\"odinger Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate periodic Schr\"odinger operators in arbitrary dimensions in the large coupling regime. Our results establish that both the Lieb--Robinson velocity and the asymptotic velocity decay at an inverse polynomial rate in the coupling, with the precise exponent determined by the period of the underlying potential. In particular, we obtain sharp polynomial decay rates that capture the precise dependence on the periodic structure.</description>

      <title>Triangle UD integrals in the position space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.3420</link>
      <description>arXiv:0803.3420v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   We investigate triangle UD ladder integrals in the position space. The investigation is necessary to find an all-order in loop solution for an auxiliary Lcc correlator in Wess-Zumino-Landau gauge of the maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory and to present correlators of dressed mean gluons in terms of it in all loops. We show that triangle UD ladder diagrams in the position space can be expressed in terms of the same UD functions Phi^(L) in terms of which they were represented in the momentum space, for an arbitrary number of rungs.</description>

      <title>Rigidity aspects of a cosmological singularity theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00524v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving a singularity theorem in General Relativity by Galloway and Ling we show the following (cf.\ Theorem 1): If a globally hyperbolic spacetime $M$ satisfying the null energy condition contains a closed, spacelike Cauchy surface $(V,g,K)$ (with metric $g$ and extrinsic curvature $K$) which is 2-convex (meaning that the sum of the lowest two eigenvalues of $K$ is non-negative), then either $M$ is past null geodesically incomplete, or $V$ is a spherical space, or $V$ or some finite cover is a surface bundle over the circle, with totally geodesic fibers. Moreover, (cf.\ Theorem 2) if $(V,g,K)$ admits a $U(1)$ isometry group with corresponding Killing vector $\xi$, we can relax the convexity requirement in terms of a decomposition of $K$ with respect to the directions parallel and orthogonal to $\xi$. Finally, (cf. Propositions 1-3) in the special cases that $V$ is either non-orientable, or non-prime, or an orientable Haken manifold with vanishing second homology, we obtain stronger statements in both Theorems without passing to covers.</description>

      <title>Absence of eigenvalues of electromagnetic Dirac operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we develop the method of multipliers for electromagnetic Dirac operators and establish sufficient conditions on the magnetic and electric fields that guarantee the absence of point spectrum. Our results can be viewed as a generalization of those obtained by Cossetti, Fanelli and Krej\v{c}i\v{r}\'ik (2020), which treated the purely magnetic case. We also emphasize that, in the massless case, our approach covers Coulomb-type potentials of the form $V(x) = \frac{1}{|x|} \big(\nu \mathbb{I} + \mu \beta + i \delta \beta \big(\boldsymbol{\alpha}\cdot \frac{x}{|x|} \big) \big).$</description>

      <title>Stabilization-free virtual element method for 2D third medium contact</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The third medium contact has been proven to be an effective approach for simulating contact problems involving large deformations. Unlike traditional contact algorithms, the third medium contact introduces a third medium between two contacting bodies, thereby avoiding the complex treatment of the contact constraints. The approach has been successfully applied in different applications in the framework of the finite element method (FEM). As a generalization of the finite element method, the virtual element method (VEM) can handle arbitrary polygonal elements, providing greater flexibility for modeling third medium contact. However, due to the introduction of the projection operator, VEM requires additional stabilization terms to control the rank of the stiffness matrix. Moreover, the regularization term in the third medium contact formulation requires a second-order numerical scheme, which further complicates the application of VEM to such problems. In this work, the stabilization-free virtual element method (SFVEM) is developed and applied to solve the third medium contact problems. Different from the traditional VEM, SFVEM does not require additional stabilization terms, which simplifies the construction of the regularization term in third medium contact. Building upon the traditional second-order FEM framework, we present the specific format of SFVEM for solving third medium contact, including the construction of high-order projection operator and the tangent stiffness matrix. Numerical examples are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of SFVEM in solving complex 2D third medium contact problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Stability of multi-solitons for $1$d Supercritical NLS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the one-dimensional $L^2$ supercritical nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation \begin{equation} i\partial_{t}\psi+\partial^{2}_{x}\psi+\vert \psi\vert^{2k}\psi=0 \text{, $k&gt;2$}. \end{equation} It is well known that solitary waves for this equation are unstable. In the pioneering work of Krieger and Schlag \cite{KriegerSchlag}, the asymptotic stability of a solitary wave was established on a codimension-one center-stable manifold. In the present paper, using linear estimates developed for one-dimensional matrix charge transfer models in our previous work, \cite{dispanalysis1}, we prove asymptotic stability of multi-solitons on a finite-codimension manifold for $k&gt;\frac{11}{4}$, provided that the soliton velocities are sufficiently separated.</description>

      <title>Long-term stability of driven quantum systems and the time-dependent Bloch equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03639v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study looks at the finite-dimensional adiabatic evolution influenced by weak perturbations, extending the analysis to the asymptotic time limit. Beginning with the fundamentals of adiabatic transformations and time-dependent effective Hamiltonians, we intuitively derive the Bloch equation. Our investigation of the solutions of the Bloch equation underscores the critical role of initial conditions and the assured existence of solutions, revealing the intricate link between leakage phenomena and the Bloch transformation. Numerical and analytical evaluations demonstrate that the leakage can remain small eternally. That is, a system that starts in a particular eigenspace of the strong generator remains in the same respective eigenspace for arbitrary long times with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\gamma^{-1})$, where $\gamma$ describes the ratio between the strength of the system's strong Hamiltonian and the perturbation.</description>

      <title>Is There an Exact Magnetic-Moment for Charged Particle Motion in a Homogeneous, Time-Dependent Magnetic Field?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nonperturbative guiding-center model provides an exact alternative to full-orbit simulations of charged particle dynamics in situations where traditional guiding-center theory may fail. We demonstrate that the charged particle motion in a homogeneous, time-varying magnetic field is a solvable example of the nonperturbative guiding-center model. This entails showing that the exact magnetic moment of Qin and Davidson can be constructed to be asymptotic to the adiabatic invariant series of Kruskal. In contrast to the perturbative invariant, the exact invariant contains information about parametric resonances. These resonances destroy the conservation of the usual magnetic moment over very long times. This refutes some previous claims about the all-time invariance of the magnetic moment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In physics geometrical connections are the mean to create models with local symmetries (gauge connections), as well as general diffeomorphisms invariance (affine connections). Here we study the irreducible tensor decomposition of connections on the tangent bundle of an affine manifold as used in the polynomial affine model of gravity. This connection is the most general linear connection, which allows us to build metric independent, diffeomorphism invariant models. This set up includes parts of the connection that are associated with conformal and projective transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lie-Poisson electrodynamics describes a semi-classical approximation of noncommutative $U(1)$ gauge theories with Lie-algebra-type noncommutativities. We obtain a gauge-invariant local classical action with the correct commutative limit for a generic Lie-Poisson gauge model. At the semi-classical level, our results provide a relatively simple solution to the old problem of constructing an admissible Lagrangian formulation for the $U(1)$ gauge theory on the four-dimensional $\kappa$-Minkowski space-time. In particular, we derive an explicit expression for the classical action which yields the deformed Maxwell equations previously proposed in JHEP 11 (2023) 200 for this noncommutativity on general grounds.</description>

      <title>Quadrature Domains and the Faber Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a framework for reconstructing any simply connected bounded or unbounded, quadrature domain $\Omega$ from its quadrature function $h$. Using the Faber transform, we derive formulae directly relating $h$ to the Riemann map for $\Omega$. Through this approach, we obtain a complete classification of one point quadrature domains with complex charge. We proceed to develop a theory of weighted quadrature domains with respect to weights of the form $\rho_a(w)=|w|^{2(a-1)}$ when $a &gt; 0$ ("power-weighted" quadrature domains) and the limiting case of $a=0$ ("log-weighted" quadrature domains). We obtain Faber transform formulae for reconstructing these from their respective quadrature functions as well. Several examples are presented throughout to illustrate this approach both in the simply connected setting and in the presence of rotational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Integrability and lattice discretizations of all Topological Defect Lines in minimal CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss in this paper the lattice discretizations of all topological defect lines (TDLs) for diagonal, minimal CFTs, using integrable restricted solid-on-solid (RSOS) models. For these CFTs, the TDLs can be labeled by the Kac labels. In the case of $(1,s)$ TDLs, lines that are exactly topological on the lattice can be obtained using the centralizer of the underlying Temperley-Lieb algebra, all the other lines become topological in the continuum limit only. Our general construction relies on insertions of rows/columns of faces with modified spectral parameters, and can therefore be studied using integrability techniques. We determine the regions of spectral parameters realizing the different $(r,s)$ TDLs, and in particular calculate analytically all the associated eigenvalues (and degeneracy factors). We also show how fusion of TDLs can be obtained from fusion hierarchies in the algebraic approach to the Bethe-ansatz. All our results are checked numerically in detail for several minimal CFTs.</description>

      <title>DGLAP-BFKL duality from QCD to quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DGLAP integro-differential equation can be solved by applying certain map in the complex plane of Mellin moments. It may be re-written as Schr\"odinger equation for $n$ particles. By applying another map in the complex plane of Mellin moment we may re-write the DGLAP equation as a dual DGLAP equation. Regge limit of the dual DGLAP equation coincides with BFKL integro-differential equation which in turn is the Regge limit of optic theorem in quantum field theory and may be re-written as another Schr\"odinger equation. This means that the BFKL equation and the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation may be solved by the proposed method of complex mapping in the complex plane of Mellin moments. This approach may be useful in solving tasks related to quantum communication processes.</description>

      <title>The limiting law of the Discrete Gaussian level-lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the $(2+1)$D Discrete Gaussian (ZGFF, integer-valued Gaussian free field) model in an $L\times L$ box above a hard floor. Bricmont, El-Mellouki and Fr\"ohlich (1986) established that, at low enough temperature, this random surface exhibits entropic repulsion: the floor propels the average height to be poly-logarithmic in $L$. The second author, Martinelli and Sly (2016) showed that, for all but exceptional values of $L$, the surface has a plateau whose height concentrates on an explicit integer $H(L)$, and fills nearly the full square. It was conjectured there that the boundary of this plateau -- the top level-line of the surface -- should have random fluctuations of $L^{1/3+o(1)}$.
  We confirm this conjecture of [LMS16] and further recover the limiting law of the top level-line: there exists an explicit sequence $N=L^{1-o(1)}$ such that the distance of the top level-line from $I$, the interval of length $N^{2/3}$ centered along the side boundary, converges, after rescaling it by $N^{1/3}$ and the width of the interval by $N^{2/3}$, to a Ferrari--Spohn diffusion. In particular, the level-line fluctuations at, say, the center of $I$, have a limit law involving the Airy function rescaled by $N^{1/3}$. This gives the first example of one of the $(2+1)$D $|\nabla \phi|^p$ models (approximating 3D Ising and crystal formation) where a Ferrari--Spohn limit law of its level-lines is confirmed (ZGFF is the case $p=2$).
  More generally, we find the joint limit law of any finite number of top level-lines: rescaling their distances from the side boundary, each by its $(N_n^{2/3},N_n^{1/3})$, yields a product of Ferrari--Spohn laws. These new results extend to the full universality class of $|\nabla\phi|^p$ models for any fixed $p&gt;1$.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo simulation of random circuit sampling in quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop Monte Carlo methods for sampling random states and corresponding bit strings in qubit systems. To this end, we derive exact probability density functions that yield the Porter-Thomas distribution in the limit of large systems. We apply these functions in importance sampling algorithms and demonstrate efficiency for qubit systems with 70, 105, 1000, and more than one million ($2^{20}$) qubits. In particular, we simulate the output of recent quantum computations without noise on a PC with minimal computational cost. I would therefore argue that random circuit sampling can be conveniently performed on classical computers.</description>

      <title>Infinite temperature at zero energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a family of static, geometrically local Hamiltonians that inherit eigenstate properties of periodically-driven (Floquet) systems. Our construction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping between quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is given periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields Hamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite temperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum -- including the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable Floquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at infinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of local Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the first such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous subsystems.</description>

      <title>Further results for the two-loop Lcc vertex in the Landau gauge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0703138</link>
      <description>arXiv:hep-th/0703138v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   In the previous paper hep-th/0604112 we calculated the first of the five planar two-loop diagrams for the Lcc vertex of the general non-Abelian Yang-Mills theory, the vertex which allows us in principle to obtain all other vertices via the Slavnov-Taylor identity. The integrand of this first diagram has a simple Lorentz structure. In this letter we present the result for the second diagram, whose integrand has a complicated Lorentz structure. The calculation is performed in the D-dimensional Euclidean position space. We initially perform one of the two integrations in the position space and then reduce the Lorentz structure to D-dimensional scalar single integrals. Some of the latter are then calculated by the uniqueness method, others by the Gegenbauer polynomial technique. The result is independent of the ultraviolet and the infrared scale. It is expressed in terms of the squares of spacetime intervals between points of the effective fields in the position space -- it includes simple powers of these intervals, as well as logarithms and polylogarithms thereof, with some of the latter appearing within the Davydychev integral J(1,1,1). Concerning the rest of diagrams, we present the result for the contributions correponding to third, fourth and fifth diagrams without giving the details of calculation. The full result for the Lcc correlator of the effective action at the planar two-loop level is written explicitly for maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory.</description>

Abstract: We review ergodic properties of one-dimensional incommensurate bilayer materials, especially the convergence of the density of states in the large-volume limit, from the perspective of the theory of ergodic Schr\"odinger operators. More precisely, we first provide a short introduction to ergodic Schr\"odinger operators as a unifying concept in spectral theory at a level accessible for nonspecialists. We then present two natural tight-binding models of incommensurate bilayer materials in one dimension and prove convergence of their density of states measures in the large volume limit using ideas from the theory of ergodic Schr\"odinger operators.</description>

      <title>Spectrum and Resonances of Stark Hamiltonians with $\delta$--Shell Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Stark Hamiltonian with a $\delta$--interaction supported on a hypersphere, with boundary strength $\alpha\in L^\infty(S_a)$. Using the framework of quasi boundary triples, we construct self--adjoint realizations and derive a Krein--type resolvent formula. For $F\neq0$ we prove $\sigma(H_{F,\alpha})=\sigma_{\mathrm{ac}}(H_{F,\alpha})=\mathbb R$ by transferring a strict Mourre estimate from the free Stark operator and by the compactness of the boundary coupling. Resonances are defined by complex distortion in the field direction and characterized as zeros of a boundary regularized Fredholm determinant. In $d=3$ and small $F$, bound states at $F=0$ continue to resonances with widths of order $\exp(-c/F)$, governed by an Agmon--type distance. A brief comparison with the free Stark case is also given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The random current representation of the Ising model, along with a related path expansion, has been a source of insight on the stochastic geometric underpinning of the ferromagnetic model's phase structure and critical behavior in different dimensions. This representation is extended in this work to systems with a mild amount of frustration, such as generated by disorder operators and external field of mixed signs. Further examples of the utility of stochastic geometric representations are presented here in the context of the deconfinement transition of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge model -- particularly in three dimensions -- and in streamlined proofs of correlation inequalities with wide-ranging applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09469v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the global existence and exponential decay of mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems in $L^p$-phase spaces on the framework of real hyperbolic manifold $\mathbb{H}^d(\mathbb{R})$, where $d \geqslant 2$ and $1&lt;p\leq d$. We consider a couple of Ebin-Marsden's Laplace and Laplace-Beltrami operators associated with the corresponding linear system which provides a vectorial matrix semigoup. First, we show the existence and the uniqueness of the bounded mild solution for the linear system by using dispersive and smoothing estimates of the vectorial matrix semigroup. Next, using the fixed point arguments, we can pass from the linear system to the semilinear system to establish the existence of the bounded mild solutions. By using Gronwall's inequality, we establish the exponential stability of such solutions. Finally, we give an application of stability to the existence of periodic mild solutions for the Boussinesq systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum intersection numbers and the Gromov-Witten invariants of $\mathbb{CP}^1$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16464v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of a quantum tau-function for a natural quantization of the KdV hierarchy was introduced in a work of Dubrovin, Gu\'er\'e, Rossi, and the second author. A certain natural choice of a quantum tau-function was then described by the first author, the coefficients of the logarithm of this series are called the quantum intersection numbers. Because of the Kontsevich-Witten theorem, a part of the quantum intersection numbers coincides with the classical intersection numbers of psi-classes on the moduli spaces of stable algebraic curves. In this paper, we relate the quantum intersection numbers to the stationary relative Gromov-Witten invariants of $(\mathbb{CP}^1,0,\infty)$ with an insertion of a Hodge class. Using the Okounkov-Pandharipande approach to such invariants (with the trivial Hodge class) through the infinite wedge formalism, we then give a short proof of an explicit formula for the ``purely quantum'' part of the quantum intersection numbers, found by the first author, which in particular relates these numbers to the one-part double Hurwitz numbers.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic delocalization of low temperature 3D Ising and Potts interfaces above a hard floor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06079v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the entropic repulsion of the low temperature 3D Ising and Potts interface in an $n\times n \times n$ box with blue boundary conditions on its bottom face (the hard floor), and red boundary conditions on its other five faces. For Ising, Frohlich and Pfister proved in 1987 that the typical interface height above the origin diverges (non-quantitatively), via correlation inequalities special to the Ising model; no such result was known for Potts. We show for both the Ising and Potts models that the entropic repulsion fully overcomes the potentially attractive interaction with the floor, and obtain a logarithmically diverging lower bound on the typical interface height. This is complemented by a conjecturally sharp upper bound of $\lfloor \xi^{-1}\log n\rfloor$ where $\xi$ is the rate function for a point-to-plane non-red connection under the infinite volume red measure. The proof goes through a coupled random-cluster interface to overcome the potential attractive interaction with the boundary, and a coupled fuzzy Potts model to reduce the upper bound to a simpler setting where the repulsion is attained by conditioning a no-floor interface to lie in the upper half-space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous diffusion is the fundamental ansatz of phenomenological theories of passive scalar turbulence, and has been confirmed numerically and experimentally to an extraordinary extent. The purpose of this survey is to discuss our recent result, in which we construct a class of incompressible vector fields that have many of the properties observed in a fully turbulent velocity field, and for which the associated scalar advection-diffusion equation generically displays anomalous diffusion. Our main contribution is to propose an analytical framework in which to study anomalous diffusion via a backward cascade of renormalized eddy viscosities.</description>

According to this approach, which is illustrated through several examples, the B\"acklund transformations are determined by basic invariants of the exploited nonlocal pseudosymmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a general necessary condition for a spin chain with SO(3) spin-rotation symmetry to be gapped. Specifically, we prove that the ground state(s) of an SO(3)-symmetric gapped spin chain must be spin singlet(s), and the expectation value of a twisting operator asymptotically approaches unity in the thermodynamic limit, where finite-size corrections are inversely proportional to the system size. This theorem provides (i) supporting evidence for various conjectured gapped phases, and (ii) a sufficient criterion for identifying gapless spin chains. We verify our theorem by numerical simulations for a variety of spin models and show that it offers a novel efficient way to identify gapless phases in spin chains with spin-rotation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of chiral nematics in a channel and sudden contraction geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11933v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of chirality, viscous effects, and confinement geometry on the flow dynamics and defect structures of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) using numerical simulations. As chiral strength increases, $\pi$-twist defects form at low chirality and progressively organize into hexagonal domains resembling blue phase--like (BP-like) structures at higher chirality. At sufficiently high chirality and aspect ratios, skyrmion-like configurations emerge, indicating the formation of dynamic analogs of equilibrium phases under flow. Sudden contraction geometries reveal how aspect ratio and elastic interactions promote flow disturbances and defect development. Analyses of velocity and scalar order parameter ($S$) distributions demonstrate strong coupling between molecular alignment and hydrodynamic fields, with localized vortices forming around $\tau^-$ defects in regions of low $S$ and velocity. Temporal evaluations of velocity fluctuations uncover chaotic flow regimes at low Ericksen numbers, characterized by irregular defect motion and skewed probability density functions. These findings offer new insights into CLC structure formation and flow behavior, with potential applications in defect engineering, microfluidics, soft robotics, and photonic materials.</description>

      <title>Characteristic equations of linearized $\lambda R$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A detailed Hamilton-Jacobi analysis for linearized $\lambda R$ gravity is developed. The model is constructed by rewriting linearized gravity in terms of a parameter $\lambda$ and new variables. The set of all hamiltonians is identified successfully, and the fundamental differential is established. The non-involutive hamiltonians are eliminated, and the Hamilton-Jacobi generalized brackets are calculated. Such brackets are used to report the characteristic equations, and the counting of the number of degrees of freedom is performed. We fixed the gauge to indicate an intimate closeness between the model under study and linearized gravity.</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of states in orbifolds of products of $N=2$ Superconformal ADE Minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit construction of fields in orbifolds of products of $N=(2,2)$ minimal models, developed by A. Belavin, V. Belavin and S. Parkhomenko to include minimal models with D and E-type modular invariants. It is shown that spectral flow twisting by the elements of admissible group $G_{\text{adm}}$, which is used in the construction of the orbifold, is consistent with the nondiagonal pairing of D and E-type minimal models. We obtain the complete set of fields of the orbifold from the mutual locality and other requirements of the conformal bootstrap. The collection of mutually local primary fields is labeled by the elements of dual group $G^{*}_{\text{adm}}$. The permutation of $G_{\text{adm}}$ and $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ is given by the mirror spectral flow construction of the fields and maps the space of states of the original $G_{\text{adm}}$ orbifold onto the space of states of $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ orbifold. We show that this transformation is by construction a mirror isomorphism of spaces of states. Thus, mirror isomorphism of states is built into the construction. We illustrate our approach for the orbifolds of $\textbf{A}_{2}\textbf{E}_7^{3}$ model.</description>

      <title>Exceptional point rings and $PT$-symmetry in the non-Hermitian XY model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct $\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of 4.</description>

      <title>An integration of Lie-Leibniz triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the group version of a Lie-Leibniz triple, which we call a Lie group-rack triple. We define a Lie group-rack triple whose tangent structure is a Lie-Leibniz triple, which is a generalization of an augmented Lie rack whose tangent structure is an augmented Leibniz algebra. We show that any finite-dimensional Lie-Leibniz triple can be integrated to a local Lie group-rack triple by generalizing the integration procedure of an augmented Leibniz algebra into an augmented Lie rack.</description>

      <title>Quantum-group-invariant $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$ models: Bethe ansatz and finite-size spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00610v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum integrable spin chain models associated with the Jimbo R-matrix based on the quantum affine algebra $D^{(2)}_{n+1}$, subject to quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions parameterized by two discrete variables $p=0,\dots, n$ and $\varepsilon = 0, 1$. We develop the analytical Bethe ansatz for the previously unexplored case $\varepsilon = 1$ with any $n$, and use it to investigate the effects of different boundary conditions on the finite-size spectrum of the quantum spin chain based on the rank-$2$ algebra $D^{(2)}_3$. Previous work on this model with periodic boundary conditions has shown that it is critical for the range of anisotropy parameters $0&lt;\gamma&lt;\pi/4$, where its scaling limit is described by a non-compact CFT with continuous degrees of freedom related to two copies of the 2D black hole sigma model. The scaling limit of the model with quantum-group-invariant boundary conditions depends on the parameter $\varepsilon$: similarly as in the rank-$1$ $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, we find that the symmetry of the lattice model is spontaneously broken, and the spectrum of conformal weights has both discrete and continuous components, for $\varepsilon=1$. For $p=1$, the latter coincides with that of the $D^{(2)}_2$ chain, which should correspond to a non-compact brane related to one black hole CFT in the presence of boundaries. For $\varepsilon=0$, the spectrum of conformal weights is purely discrete.</description>

      <title>Multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with compactly supported initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03246v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The KPZ fixed point is a universal limiting space-time random field for the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. While the joint law of the KPZ fixed point at a fixed time has been studied extensively, the multipoint distributions of the KPZ fixed point in the general space-time plane are much less well understood. More explicitly, formulas were only available for the narrow wedge initial condition arXiv:1906.01053, arXiv:1907.09876 and the flat initial condition arXiv:1907.09876 for the multipoint distributions, and the half-Brownian and Brownian initial conditions arXiv:2010.07357v1, arXiv:2504.19975 for the two-point distributions.
  In this paper, we obtain the first formula for the space-time joint distributions of the KPZ fixed point with general initial conditions of compact support. The formula is obtained through taking $1:2:3$ KPZ scaling limit of the multipoint distribution formulas for the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP). A key novelty is a probabilistic representation, inspired by arXiv:1701.00018, of the kernel encoding the initial condition for TASEP, which was first defined through an implicit characterization in arXiv:1907.09876. Moreover, we also verify that the equal time degenerated version of our formula matches the path integral formula in arXiv:1701.00018 for the KPZ fixed point.</description>
