      <title>Optimizing Downlink C-NOMA Transmission with Movable Antennas: A DDPG-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes a downlink C-NOMA scenario where a base station (BS) is deployed to serve a pair of users equipped with movable antenna (MA) technology. The user with better channel conditions with the BS will be able to transmit the signal to the other user providing an extra transmission resource and enhancing performance. Both users are equipped with a receiving MA each and a transmitting MA for the relaying user. In this regard, we formulate an optimization problem with the objective of maximizing the achievable sum rate by jointly determining the beamforming vector at the BS, the transmit power at the device and the positions of the MAs while meeting the quality of service (QoS) constraints. Due to the non-convex structure of the formulated problem and the randomness in the channels we adopt a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) approach, a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm capable of dealing with continuous state and action spaces. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of the presented model compared to the other benchmark schemes showing gains reaching 45% compared to the NOMA enabled MA scheme and 60% compared to C-NOMA model with fixed antennas. The solution approach showed 93% accuracy compared to the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Multi-platoon car-following models with flexible platoon sizes and communication levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend a single platoon car-following (CF) model to some multi-platoon CF models for connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) with flexible platoon size and communication level. Specifically, we consider forward and backward communication methods between platoons with delays. Some general results of linear stability are mathematically proven, and numerical simulations are performed to illustrate the effects of platoon sizes and communication levels, as well as to demonstrate the potential for stabilizing human-driven vehicles (HDVs) in mixed traffic conditions. The simulation results are consistent with theoretical analysis, and demonstrate that in the ring road scenario, CAV platoons can stabilize certain percentage of HDVs. This paper can provide suggestions for the design of communication system of autonomous vehicles (AVs), and management of mixed traffic flow of CAVs and HDVs.</description>

      <title>Survey of Moving Target Defense in Power Grids: Design Principles, Tradeoffs, and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Moving target defense (MTD) in power grids is an emerging defense technique that has gained prominence in the recent past. It aims to solve the long-standing problem of securing the power grid against stealthy attacks. The key idea behind MTD is to introduce periodic/event-triggered controlled changes to the power grid's SCADA network/physical plant, thereby invalidating the knowledge attackers use for crafting stealthy attacks. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of this topic and classify the different ways in which MTD is implemented in power grids. We further introduce the guiding principles behind the design of MTD, key performance metrics, and the associated trade-offs in MTD and identify the future development of MTD for power grid security.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Truncated Singular Value Decomposition for Koopman Operator-Based Lane Change Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling complex dynamic systems is crucial for enhancing vehicle performance and safety, especially in the context of autonomous driving. Recently, popular methods such as Koopman operators and their approximators, known as Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition (EDMD), have emerged for their effectiveness in transforming strongly nonlinear system behavior into linear representations. This allows them to be integrated with conventional linear controllers. To achieve this, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), specifically truncated SVD, is employed to approximate Koopman operators from extensive datasets efficiently. This study evaluates different basis functions used in EDMD and ranks for truncated SVD for representing lane change behavior models, aiming to balance computational efficiency with information loss. The findings, however, suggest that the technique of truncated SVD does not necessarily achieve substantial reductions in computational training time and results in significant information loss.</description>

      <title>Towards Event-Triggered NMPC for Efficient 6G Communications: Experimental Results and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Networked control systems enable real-time control and coordination of distributed systems, leveraging the low latency, high reliability, and massive connectivity offered by 5G and future 6G networks. Applications include autonomous vehicles, robotics, industrial automation, and smart grids. Despite networked control algorithms admitting nominal stability guarantees even in the presence of delays and packet dropouts, their practical performance still heavily depends on the specific characteristics and conditions of the underlying network. To achieve the desired performance while efficiently using communication resources, co-design of control and communication is pivotal. Although periodic schemes, where communication instances are fixed, can provide reliable control performance, unnecessary transmissions, when updates are not needed, result in inefficient usage of network resources. In this paper, we investigate the potential for co-design of model predictive control and network communication. To this end, we design and implement an event-triggered nonlinear model predictive controller for stabilizing a Furuta pendulum communicating over a tailored open radio access network 6G research platform. We analyze the control performance as well as network utilization under varying channel conditions and event-triggering criteria. Our results show that the event-triggered control scheme achieves similar performance to periodic control with reduced communication demand.</description>

      <title>Impact of number of elements on the directivity of planar array of monopole antenna</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This research investigates how the number of elements affects the monopole antenna's planar array's directivity. This study also takes into account the antenna's effect on the whole field it radiates. The monopole antennas are arranged in a planar configuration with all the components in their proper locations using the Hadamard matrix approach. Each matrix's directivities and array factors were calculated, and a MATLAB tool was used to simulate the radiation pattern. A range of elements from 4 X 4 to 50 X 50 planar layouts were taken into consideration during the investigation. Increasing the number of elements improves the directivity. Increasing the number of elements in the planar array resulted in a great improvement in directivity, as seen by the computed and simulated results. Consequently, by increasing the antenna's directivity, a greater number of elements influences the overall field emitted.</description>

      <title>On Adaptive Frequency Sampling for Data-driven MOR Applied to Antenna Responses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency domain sweeps of array antennas are well-known to be time-intensive, and different surrogate models have been used to improve the performance. Data-driven model order reduction algorithms, such as the Loewner framework and vector fitting, can be integrated with these adaptive error estimates, in an iterative algorithm, to reduce the number of full-wave simulations required to accurately capture the requested frequency behavior of multiport array antennas. In this work, we propose two novel adaptive methods exploiting a block matrix function which is a key part of the Loewner framework generating system approach. The first algorithm leverages an inherent matrix parameter freedom in the block matrix function to identify frequency points with large errors, whereas the second utilizes the condition number of the block matrix function. Both methods effectively provide frequency domain error estimates, essential for improved performance. Numerical experiments on multiport array antenna S-parameters demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms within the Loewner framework.</description>

      <title>A History-Guided Regional Partitioning Evolutionary Optimization for Solving the Flexible Job Shop Problem with Limited Multi-load Automated Guided Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a flexible job shop environment, using Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) to transport jobs and process materials is an important way to promote the intelligence of the workshop. Compared with single-load AGVs, multi-load AGVs can improve AGV utilization, reduce path conflicts, etc. Therefore, this study proposes a history-guided regional partitioning algorithm (HRPEO) for the flexible job shop scheduling problem with limited multi-load AGVs (FJSPMA). First, the encoding and decoding rules are designed according to the characteristics of multi-load AGVs, and then the initialization rule based on the branch and bound method is used to generate the initial population. Second, to prevent the algorithm from falling into a local optimum, the algorithm adopts a regional partitioning strategy. This strategy divides the solution space into multiple regions and measures the potential of the regions. After that, cluster the regions into multiple clusters in each iteration, and selects individuals for evolutionary search based on the set of clusters. Third, a local search strategy is designed to improve the exploitation ability of the algorithm, which uses a greedy approach to optimize machines selection and transportation sequence according to the characteristics of FJSPMA. Finally, a large number of experiments are carried out on the benchmarks to test the performance of the algorithm. Compared with multiple advanced algorithms, the results show that the HRPEO has a better advantage in solving FJSPMA.</description>

      <title>Dual Pricing to Prioritize Renewable Energy and Consumer Preferences in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electricity markets currently fail to incorporate preferences of buyers, treating polluting and renewable energy sources as having equal social benefit under a system of uniform clearing prices. Meanwhile, renewable energy is prone to curtailment due to transmission constraints, forcing grid operators to reduce or shut down renewable energy production despite its availability and need. This paper proposes a ``dual pricing mechanism" which allows buyers to bid both their willingness to pay for electricity, and additionally, their preference for green energy. Designed for use in deregulated electricity markets, this mechanism prioritizes the dispatch of more renewable energy sources according to consumer preferences. Traditional uniform clearing prices, which treat all energy sources equally, do not reflect the growing share of green energy in the power grid and the environmental values of consumers. By allowing load-serving entities to bid their willingness to pay for renewable energy directly into the clearing market, our proposed framework generates distinct pricing signals for green and ``black" electricity.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic tracking control of dynamic reference over homomorphically encrypted data with finite modulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a tracking control problem, in which the dynamic controller is encrypted with an additively homomorphic encryption scheme and the output of a process tracks a dynamic reference asymptotically. Our paper is motivated by the following problem: When dealing with both asymptotic tracking and dynamic reference, we find that the control input is generally subject to overflow issues under a finite modulus, though the dynamic controller consists of only integer coefficients. First, we provide a new controller design method such that the coefficients of the tracking controller can be transformed into integers leveraging the zooming-in factor of dynamic quantization.
  By the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we represent the control input as linear combination of the previous control inputs. Leveraging the property above, we design an algorithm on the actuator side such that it can restore the control input from the lower bits under a finite modulus. A lower bound of the modulus is also provided.
  As an extension of the first result, we further solve the problem of unbounded internal state taking place in the actuator. In particular, the actuator can restore the correct control input under the same modulus.
  A simulation example is provided to verify the control schemes proposed in our paper.</description>

      <title>Path Following Model Predictive Control of a Coupled Autonomous Underwater Vehicle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The operation of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) faces challenges in following predetermined waypoints due to coupled motions under environmental disturbances. To address this, a 3D path following guidance and control system is developed in this work based on the line-of-sight (LOS) guidance method. Conventionally, the 3D path following problem is transformed into heading and depth control problems, assuming that the motion of the vehicle is decoupled in horizontal and depth coordinates. The proposed control system design avoids this simplifying assumption by transforming the problem into a 3D position and orientation tracking problem. This design is achieved by computing a 2D horizontal coordinate based on the desired heading and then computing a corresponding LOS depth coordinate. A model predictive controller (MPC) is then implemented using the 3D LOS coordinate and the computed orientation vector. The MPC obtains a robust control by solving a minimax optimisation problem considering the effects of unknown ocean disturbances. The effectiveness of the proposed guidance and control system is demonstrated through the simulation of a prototype AUV system. Numerical results show that the AUV can follow predetermined waypoints in the presence of time-varying disturbances, and the system is steered at a constant surge speed that is proportional to the radius of the circle of acceptance used to implement the guidance system.</description>

      <title>Safe Decentralized Multi-Agent Control using Black-Box Predictors, Conformal Decision Policies, and Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of safe control in decentralized multi-agent robotic settings, where agents use uncertain black-box models to predict other agents' trajectories. We use the recently proposed conformal decision theory to adapt the restrictiveness of control barrier functions-based safety constraints based on observed prediction errors. We use these constraints to synthesize controllers that balance between the objectives of safety and task accomplishment, despite the prediction errors. We provide an upper bound on the average over time of the value of a monotonic function of the difference between the safety constraint based on the predicted trajectories and the constraint based on the ground truth ones. We validate our theory through experimental results showing the performance of our controllers when navigating a robot in the multi-agent scenes in the Stanford Drone Dataset.</description>

      <title>Robust and efficient data-driven predictive control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a robust and efficient data-driven predictive control (eDDPC) scheme which is more sample efficient (requires less offline data) compared to existing schemes, and is also computationally efficient. This is done by leveraging an alternative data-based representation of the trajectories of linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. The proposed scheme relies only on using (short and potentially irregularly measured) noisy input-output data, the amount of which is independent of the prediction horizon. To account for measurement noise, we provide a novel result that quantifies the uncertainty between the true (unknown) restricted behavior of the system and the estimated one from noisy data. Furthermore, we show that the robust eDDPC scheme is recursively feasible and that the resulting closed-loop system is practically stable. Finally, we compare the performance of this scheme to existing ones on a case study of a four tank system.</description>

      <title>Robust Deep Reinforcement Learning for Volt-VAR Optimization in Active Distribution System under Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based Volt-VAR optimization (VVO) methods have been widely studied for active distribution networks (ADNs). However, most of them lack safety guarantees in terms of power injection uncertainties due to the increase in distributed energy resources (DERs) and load demand, such as electric vehicles. This article proposes a robust deep reinforcement learning (RDRL) framework for VVO via a robust deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm. This algorithm can effectively manage hybrid action spaces, considering control devices like capacitors, voltage regulators, and smart inverters. Additionally, it is designed to handle uncertainties by quantifying uncertainty sets with conformal prediction and modeling uncertainties as adversarial attacks to guarantee safe exploration across action spaces. Numerical results on three IEEE test cases demonstrate the sample efficiency and safety of the proposed robust DDPG against uncertainties compared to the benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Criticality and Safety Margins for Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State of the art reinforcement learning methods sometimes encounter unsafe situations. Identifying when these situations occur is of interest both for post-hoc analysis and during deployment, where it might be advantageous to call out to a human overseer for help. Efforts to gauge the criticality of different points in time have been developed, but their accuracy is not well established due to a lack of ground truth, and they are not designed to be easily interpretable by end users. Therefore, we seek to define a criticality framework with both a quantifiable ground truth and a clear significance to users. We introduce true criticality as the expected drop in reward when an agent deviates from its policy for n consecutive random actions. We also introduce the concept of proxy criticality, a low-overhead metric that has a statistically monotonic relationship to true criticality. Safety margins make these interpretable, when defined as the number of random actions for which performance loss will not exceed some tolerance with high confidence. We demonstrate this approach in several environment-agent combinations; for an A3C agent in an Atari Beamrider environment, the lowest 5% of safety margins contain 47% of agent losses; i.e., supervising only 5% of decisions could potentially prevent roughly half of an agent's errors. This criticality framework measures the potential impacts of bad decisions, even before those decisions are made, allowing for more effective debugging and oversight of autonomous agents.</description>

      <title>Causality-based Subject and Task Fingerprints using fMRI Time-series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a revived interest in system neuroscience causation models due to their unique capability to unravel complex relationships in multi-scale brain networks. In this paper, our goal is to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of using a causality-based approach for fMRI fingerprinting. Specifically, we propose an innovative method that utilizes the causal dynamics activities of the brain to identify the unique cognitive patterns of individuals (e.g., subject fingerprint) and fMRI tasks (e.g., task fingerprint). The key novelty of our approach stems from the development of a two-timescale linear state-space model to extract 'spatio-temporal' (aka causal) signatures from an individual's fMRI time series data. To the best of our knowledge, we pioneer and subsequently quantify, in this paper, the concept of 'causal fingerprint.' Our method is well-separated from other fingerprint studies as we quantify fingerprints from a cause-and-effect perspective, which are then incorporated with a modal decomposition and projection method to perform subject identification and a GNN-based (Graph Neural Network) model to perform task identification. Finally, we show that the experimental results and comparisons with non-causality-based methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. We visualize the obtained causal signatures and discuss their biological relevance in light of the existing understanding of brain functionalities. Collectively, our work paves the way for further studies on causal fingerprints with potential applications in both healthy controls and neurodegenerative diseases.</description>

      <title>iWalker: Imperative Visual Planning for Walking Humanoid Robot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humanoid robots, with the potential to perform a broad range of tasks in environments designed for humans, have been deemed crucial for the basis of general AI agents. When talking about planning and controlling, although traditional models and task-specific methods have been extensively studied over the past few decades, they are inadequate for achieving the flexibility and versatility needed for general autonomy. Learning approaches, especially reinforcement learning, are powerful and popular nowadays, but they are inherently "blind" during training, relying heavily on trials in simulation without proper guidance from physical principles or underlying dynamics. In response, we propose a novel end-to-end pipeline that seamlessly integrates perception, planning, and model-based control for humanoid robot walking. We refer to our method as iWalker, which is driven by imperative learning (IL), a self-supervising neuro-symbolic learning framework. This enables the robot to learn from arbitrary unlabeled data, significantly improving its adaptability and generalization capabilities. In experiments, iWalker demonstrates effectiveness in both simulated and real-world environments, representing a significant advancement toward versatile and autonomous humanoid robots.</description>

      <title>CurricuLLM: Automatic Task Curricula Design for Learning Complex Robot Skills using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curriculum learning is a training mechanism in reinforcement learning (RL) that facilitates the achievement of complex policies by progressively increasing the task difficulty during training. However, designing effective curricula for a specific task often requires extensive domain knowledge and human intervention, which limits its applicability across various domains. Our core idea is that large language models (LLMs), with their extensive training on diverse language data and ability to encapsulate world knowledge, present significant potential for efficiently breaking down tasks and decomposing skills across various robotics environments. Additionally, the demonstrated success of LLMs in translating natural language into executable code for RL agents strengthens their role in generating task curricula. In this work, we propose CurricuLLM, which leverages the high-level planning and programming capabilities of LLMs for curriculum design, thereby enhancing the efficient learning of complex target tasks. CurricuLLM consists of: (Step 1) Generating sequence of subtasks that aid target task learning in natural language form, (Step 2) Translating natural language description of subtasks in executable task code, including the reward code and goal distribution code, and (Step 3) Evaluating trained policies based on trajectory rollout and subtask description. We evaluate CurricuLLM in various robotics simulation environments, ranging from manipulation, navigation, and locomotion, to show that CurricuLLM can aid learning complex robot control tasks. In addition, we validate humanoid locomotion policy learned through CurricuLLM in real-world. The code is provided in https://github.com/labicon/CurricuLLM</description>

      <title>Adaptive Knowledge-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm for Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problems with Multiple Parallel Batch Processing Stages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parallel batch processing machines have extensive applications in the semiconductor manufacturing process. However, the problem models in previous studies regard parallel batch processing as a fixed processing stage in the machining process. This study generalizes the problem model, in which users can arbitrarily set certain stages as parallel batch processing stages according to their needs. A Hybrid Flow Shop Scheduling Problem with Parallel Batch Processing Machines (PBHFSP) is solved in this paper. Furthermore, an Adaptive Knowledge-based Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm (AMOEA/D) is designed to simultaneously optimize both makespan and Total Energy Consumption (TEC). Firstly, a hybrid initialization strategy with heuristic rules based on knowledge of PBHFSP is proposed to generate promising solutions. Secondly, the disjunctive graph model has been established based on the knowledge to find the critical-path of PBHFS. Then, a critical-path based neighborhood search is proposed to enhance the exploitation ability of AMOEA/D. Moreover, the search time is adaptively adjusted based on learning experience from Q-learning and Decay Law. Afterward, to enhance the exploration capability of the algorithm, AMOEA/D designs an improved population updating strategy with a weight vector updating strategy. These strategies rematch individuals with weight vectors, thereby maintaining the diversity of the population. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with state-of-the-art algorithms. The experimental results show that the AMOEA/D is superior to the comparison algorithms in solving the PBHFSP.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Ca{\Sigma}oS, the first MATLAB software specifically designed for nonlinear sum-of-squares optimization. A symbolic polynomial algebra system allows to formulate parametrized sum-of-squares optimization problems and facilitates their fast, repeated evaluations. To that extent, we make use of CasADi's symbolic framework and realize concepts of monomial sparsity, linear operators (including duals), and functions between polynomials. Ca{\Sigma}oS currently provides interfaces to the conic solvers SeDuMi, Mosek, and SCS as well as methods to solve quasiconvex optimization problems (via bisection) and nonconvex optimization problems (via sequential convexification). Numerical examples for benchmark problems including region-of-attraction and reachable set estimation for nonlinear dynamic systems demonstrate significant improvements in computation time compared to existing toolboxes.. Ca{\Sigma}oS is available open-source at https://github.com/ ifr-acso/casos.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automated driving has become more and more popular due to its potential to eliminate road accidents by taking over driving tasks from humans. One of the remaining challenges is to follow a planned path autonomously, especially when uncertainties in self-localizing or understanding the surroundings can influence the decisions made by autonomous vehicles, such as calculating how much they need to steer to minimize tracking errors. In this paper, a modified geometric pure pursuit path-tracking algorithm is proposed, taking into consideration such uncertainties using the unscented transform. The algorithm is tested through simulations for typical road geometries, such as straight and circular lines.</description>

Abstract: Tracked vehicles are used in complex scenarios, where motion planning and navigation can be very complex. They have complex dynamics, with many parameters that are difficult to identify and that change significantly based on the operating conditions. We propose a simple pseudo-kinematic model, where the intricate dynamic effects underlying the vehicle's motion are captured in a small set of velocity-dependent parameters. This choice enables the development of a Lyapunov-based trajectory controller with guaranteed performance and small computation time. We demonstrate the correctness of our approach with both simulation and experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18681v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Novel solutions for pseudometrics quantifying deviation from topological conjugacy between dynamical systems are presented. Deviation from conjugacy is quantified in a Pareto optimal sense that accounts for spectral properties of Koopman operators as well as trajectory geometry. Theoretical justification is provided for computing such pseudometrics in Koopman eigenfunction space rather than observable space. Furthermore, it is shown deriving the pseudometrics from unitary transformations is sufficient to recover a value of zero if two systems are topologically conjugate. Therefore the pseudometrics for quantifying deviation from conjugacy are based on analytical solutions for unitary transformations in Koopman eigenfunction space. Finally, geometric considerations for the Pareto optimality problem associated with deviation from conjugacy are used to develop pseudometrics that account for all possible solutions given just two Pareto points based on analytical solutions.</description>

      <title>Transparency evaluation for the Kinematic Design of the Harnesses through Human-Exoskeleton Interaction Modeling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.18755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lower Limb Exoskeletons (LLEs) are wearable robots that provide mechanical power to the user. Human-exoskeleton (HE) connections must preserve the user's natural behavior during the interaction, avoiding undesired forces. Therefore, numerous works focus on their minimization. Given the inherent complications of repeatedly prototyping and experimentally testing a device, modeling the exoskeleton and its physical interaction with the user emerges as a valuable approach for assessing the design effects. This paper proposes a novel method to compare different exoskeleton configurations with a flexible simulation tool. This approach contemplates simulating the dynamics of the device, including its interaction with the wearer, to evaluate multiple connection mechanism designs along with the kinematics and actuation of the LLE. This evaluation is based on the minimization of the interaction wrenches through an optimization process that includes the impedance parameters at the interfaces as optimization variables and the similarity of the LLE's joint variables trajectories with the motion of the wearer's articulations. Exploratory tests are conducted using the Wearable Walker LLE in different configurations and measuring the interaction forces. Experimental data are then compared to the optimization outcomes, proving that the proposed method provides contact wrench estimations consistent with the collected measurements and previous outcomes from the literature.

      <description>arXiv:2409.18768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a useful paradigm for training policies that solve tasks involving complex motions. In practice, the successful application of LfD requires overcoming error accumulation during policy execution, i.e. the problem of drift due to errors compounding over time and the consequent out-of-distribution behaviours. Existing works seek to address this problem through scaling data collection, correcting policy errors with a human-in-the-loop, temporally ensembling policy predictions or through learning the parameters of a dynamical system model. In this work, we propose and validate an alternative approach to overcoming this issue. Inspired by reservoir computing, we develop a novel neural network layer that includes a fixed nonlinear dynamical system with tunable dynamical properties. We validate the efficacy of our neural network layer on the task of reproducing human handwriting motions using the LASA Human Handwriting Dataset. Through empirical experiments we demonstrate that incorporating our layer into existing neural network architectures addresses the issue of compounding errors in LfD. Furthermore, we perform a comparative evaluation against existing approaches including a temporal ensemble of policy predictions and an Echo State Networks (ESNs) implementation. We find that our approach yields greater policy precision and robustness on the handwriting task while also generalising to multiple dynamics regimes and maintaining competitive latency scores.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we depart from the widely-used gradient descent-based hierarchical federated learning (FL) algorithms to develop a novel hierarchical FL framework based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Within this framework, we propose two novel FL algorithms, which both use ADMM in the top layer: one that employs ADMM in the lower layer and another that uses the conventional gradient descent-based approach. The proposed framework enhances privacy, and experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms compared to the conventional algorithms in terms of learning convergence and accuracy. Additionally, gradient descent on the lower layer performs well even if the number of local steps is very limited, while ADMM on both layers lead to better performance otherwise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing scale and complexity of safety-critical control systems underscore the need to evolve current control architectures aiming for the unparalleled performances achievable through state-of-the-art optimization and machine learning algorithms. However, maintaining closed-loop stability while boosting the performance of nonlinear control systems using data-driven and deep-learning approaches stands as an important unsolved challenge. In this paper, we tackle the performance-boosting problem with closed-loop stability guarantees. Specifically, we establish a synergy between the Internal Model Control (IMC) principle for nonlinear systems and state-of-the-art unconstrained optimization approaches for learning stable dynamics. Our methods enable learning over arbitrarily deep neural network classes of performance-boosting controllers for stable nonlinear systems; crucially, we guarantee L_p closed-loop stability even if optimization is halted prematurely, and even when the ground-truth dynamics are unknown, with vanishing conservatism in the class of stabilizing policies as the model uncertainty is reduced to zero. We discuss the implementation details of the proposed control schemes, including distributed ones, along with the corresponding optimization procedures, demonstrating the potential of freely shaping the cost functions through several numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Personalised Outfit Recommendation via History-aware Transformers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00289v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the history-aware transformer (HAT), a transformer-based model that uses shoppers' purchase history to personalise outfit predictions. The aim of this work is to recommend outfits that are internally coherent while matching an individual shopper's style and taste. To achieve this, we stack two transformer models, one that produces outfit representations and another one that processes the history of purchased outfits for a given shopper. We use these models to score an outfit's compatibility in the context of a shopper's preferences as inferred from their previous purchases. During training, the model learns to discriminate between purchased and random outfits using 3 losses: the focal loss for outfit compatibility typically used in the literature, a contrastive loss to bring closer learned outfit embeddings from a shopper's history, and an adaptive margin loss to facilitate learning from weak negatives. Together, these losses enable the model to make personalised recommendations based on a shopper's purchase history.
  Our experiments on the IQON3000 and Polyvore datasets show that HAT outperforms strong baselines on the outfit Compatibility Prediction (CP) and the Fill In The Blank (FITB) tasks. The model improves AUC for the CP hard task by 15.7% (IQON3000) and 19.4% (Polyvore) compared to previous SOTA results. It further improves accuracy on the FITB hard task by 6.5% and 9.7%, respectively. We provide ablation studies on the personalisation, constrastive loss, and adaptive margin loss that highlight the importance of these modelling choices.</description>

      <title>On Game Based Distributed Decision Approach for Multi-agent Optimal Coverage Problem with Application to Constellations Reconfiguration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the optimal coverage problem (OCP) for multi-agent systems with decentralized optimization. A game based distributed decision approach for the the multi-agent OCP is proposed. The equivalence between the equilibrium of the game and the extreme value of the global performance objective is strictly proved. Then, a distributed algorithm only using local information to obtain the global near-optimal coverage is developed, and its convergence is proved. Finally, the proposed method is applied to maximize the covering time of a satellite constellation for a target. The simulation results under different scenarios show our method costs much less computation time under some level index than traditional centralized optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are vital in modern traffic management and optimization, significantly enhancing traffic efficiency and safety. Recently, diffusion models have emerged as transformative tools for addressing complex challenges within ITS. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of diffusion models for ITS, covering both theoretical and practical aspects. First, we introduce the theoretical foundations of diffusion models and their key variants, including conditional diffusion models and latent diffusion models, highlighting their suitability for modeling complex, multi-modal traffic data and enabling controllable generation. Second, we outline the primary challenges in ITS and the corresponding advantages of diffusion models, providing readers with a deeper understanding of the intersection between ITS and diffusion models. Third, we offer a multi-perspective investigation of current applications of diffusion models in ITS domains, including autonomous driving, traffic simulation, trajectory prediction, and traffic safety. Finally, we discuss state-of-the-art diffusion model techniques and highlight key ITS research directions that warrant further investigation. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for ITS, thereby advancing their future applications in the transportation domain.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Guided Online Data Selection for Scalable Data-Driven Safety Filters in Uncertain Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As the use of autonomous robots expands in tasks that are complex and challenging to model, the demand for robust data-driven control methods that can certify safety and stability in uncertain conditions is increasing. However, the practical implementation of these methods often faces scalability issues due to the growing amount of data points with system complexity, and a significant reliance on high-quality training data. In response to these challenges, this study presents a scalable data-driven controller that efficiently identifies and infers from the most informative data points for implementing data-driven safety filters. Our approach is grounded in the integration of a model-based certificate function-based method and Gaussian Process (GP) regression, reinforced by a novel online data selection algorithm that reduces time complexity from quadratic to linear relative to dataset size. Empirical evidence, gathered from successful real-world cart-pole swing-up experiments and simulated locomotion of a five-link bipedal robot, demonstrates the efficacy of our approach. Our findings reveal that our efficient online data selection algorithm, which strategically selects key data points, enhances the practicality and efficiency of data-driven certifying filters in complex robotic systems, significantly mitigating scalability concerns inherent in nonparametric learning-based control methods.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quasi-Newton Method for Multi-Agent Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a distributed quasi-Newton (DQN) method, which enables a group of agents to compute an optimal solution of a separable multi-agent optimization problem locally using an approximation of the curvature of the aggregate objective function. Each agent computes a descent direction from its local estimate of the aggregate Hessian, obtained from quasi-Newton approximation schemes using the gradient of its local objective function. Moreover, we introduce a distributed quasi-Newton method for equality-constrained optimization (EC-DQN), where each agent takes Karush-Kuhn-Tucker-like update steps to compute an optimal solution. In our algorithms, each agent communicates with its one-hop neighbors over a peer-to-peer communication network to compute a common solution. We prove convergence of our algorithms to a stationary point of the optimization problem. In addition, we demonstrate the competitive empirical convergence of our algorithm in both well-conditioned and ill-conditioned optimization problems, in terms of the computation time and communication cost incurred by each agent for convergence, compared to existing distributed first-order and second-order methods. Particularly, in ill-conditioned problems, our algorithms achieve a faster computation time for convergence, while requiring a lower communication cost, across a range of communication networks with different degrees of connectedness.</description>

      <title>MARec: Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For many recommender systems, the primary data source is a historical record of user clicks. The associated click matrix is often very sparse, as the number of users x products can be far larger than the number of clicks. Such sparsity is accentuated in cold-start settings, which makes the efficient use of metadata information of paramount importance. In this work, we propose a simple approach to address cold-start recommendations by leveraging content metadata, Metadata Alignment for cold-start Recommendation. We show that this approach can readily augment existing matrix factorization and autoencoder approaches, enabling a smooth transition to top performing algorithms in warmer set-ups. Our experimental results indicate three separate contributions: first, we show that our proposed framework largely beats SOTA results on 4 cold-start datasets with different sparsity and scale characteristics, with gains ranging from +8.4% to +53.8% on reported ranking metrics; second, we provide an ablation study on the utility of semantic features, and proves the additional gain obtained by leveraging such features ranges between +46.8% and +105.5%; and third, our approach is by construction highly competitive in warm set-ups, and we propose a closed-form solution outperformed by SOTA results by only 0.8% on average.</description>

      <title>TOP-Nav: Legged Navigation Integrating Terrain, Obstacle and Proprioception Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15256v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Legged navigation is typically examined within open-world, off-road, and challenging environments. In these scenarios, estimating external disturbances requires a complex synthesis of multi-modal information. This underlines a major limitation in existing works that primarily focus on avoiding obstacles. In this work, we propose TOP-Nav, a novel legged navigation framework that integrates a comprehensive path planner with Terrain awareness, Obstacle avoidance and close-loop Proprioception. TOP-Nav underscores the synergies between vision and proprioception in both path and motion planning. Within the path planner, we present and integrate a terrain estimator that enables the robot to select waypoints on terrains with higher traversability while effectively avoiding obstacles. In the motion planning level, we not only implement a locomotion controller to track the navigation commands, but also construct a proprioception advisor to provide motion evaluations for the path planner. Based on the close-loop motion feedback, we make online corrections for the vision-based terrain and obstacle estimations. Consequently, TOP-Nav achieves open-world navigation that the robot can handle terrains or disturbances beyond the distribution of prior knowledge and overcomes constraints imposed by visual conditions. Building upon extensive experiments conducted in both simulation and real-world environments, TOP-Nav demonstrates superior performance in open-world navigation compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Piecewise Affine Systems Based on Switching ADMM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for distributed model predictive control (MPC) for piecewise affine (PWA) systems. Existing approaches rely on solving mixed-integer optimization problems, requiring significant computation power or time. We propose a distributed MPC scheme that requires solving only convex optimization problems. The key contribution is a novel method, based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, for solving the non-convex optimal control problem that arises due to the PWA dynamics. We present a distributed MPC scheme, leveraging this method, that explicitly accounts for the coupling between subsystems by reaching agreement on the values of coupled states. Stability and recursive feasibility are shown under additional assumptions on the underlying system. Two numerical examples are provided, in which the proposed controller is shown to significantly improve the CPU time and closed-loop performance over existing state-of-the-art approaches.</description>

      <title>Experimenting with Adaptive Bitrate Algorithms for Virtual Reality Streaming over Wi-Fi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interactive Virtual Reality (VR) streaming over Wi-Fi networks encounters significant challenges due to bandwidth fluctuations caused by channel contention and user mobility. Adaptive BitRate (ABR) algorithms dynamically adjust the video encoding bitrate based on the available network capacity, aiming to maximize image quality while mitigating congestion and preserving the user's Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we experiment with ABR algorithms for VR streaming using Air Light VR (ALVR), an open-source VR streaming solution. We extend ALVR with a comprehensive set of metrics that provide a robust characterization of the network's state, enabling more informed bitrate adjustments. To demonstrate the utility of these performance indicators, we develop and test the Network-aware Step-wise ABR algorithm for VR streaming (NeSt-VR). Results validate the accuracy of the newly implemented network performance metrics and demonstrate NeSt-VR's video bitrate adaptation capabilities.</description>

      <title>SustainDC -- Benchmarking for Sustainable Data Center Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07841v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has driven an exponential increase in computational demand, leading to massive data centers that consume significant amounts of energy and contribute to climate change. This makes sustainable data center control a priority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments for benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data centers (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as workload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management, with multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects of each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their performance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid carbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant opportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms. Given the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform for the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for achieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world challenges.</description>

      <title>Enabling On-Chip High-Frequency Adaptive Linear Optimal Control via Linearized Gaussian Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unpredictable and complex aerodynamic effects pose significant challenges to achieving precise flight control, such as the downwash effect from upper vehicles to lower ones. Conventional methods often struggle to accurately model these interactions, leading to controllers that require large safety margins between vehicles. Moreover, the controller on real drones usually requires high-frequency and has limited on-chip computation, making the adaptive control design more difficult to implement. To address these challenges, we incorporate Gaussian process (GP) to model the adaptive external aerodynamics with linear model predictive control. The GP is linearized to enable real-time high-frequency solutions. Moreover, to handle the error caused by linearization, we integrate end-to-end Bayesian optimization during sample collection stages to improve the control performance. Experimental results on both simulations and real quadrotors show that we can achieve real-time solvable computation speed with acceptable tracking errors.</description>
