      <title>Parallel Repetition for $3$-Player XOR Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a $3$-$\mathsf{XOR}$ game $\mathcal{G}$, the verifier samples a challenge $(x,y,z)\sim \mu$ where $\mu$ is a probability distribution over $\Sigma\times\Gamma\times\Phi$, and a map $t\colon \Sigma\times\Gamma\times\Phi\to\mathcal{A}$ for a finite Abelian group $\mathcal{A}$ defining a constraint. The verifier sends the questions $x$, $y$ and $z$ to the players Alice, Bob and Charlie respectively, receives answers $f(x)$, $g(y)$ and $h(z)$ that are elements in $\mathcal{A}$ and accepts if $f(x)+g(y)+h(z) = t(x,y,z)$. The value, $\mathsf{val}(\mathcal{G})$, of the game is defined to be the maximum probability the verifier accepts over all players' strategies.
  We show that if $\mathcal{G}$ is a $3$-$\mathsf{XOR}$ game with value strictly less than $1$, whose underlying distribution over questions $\mu$ does not admit Abelian embeddings into $(\mathbb{Z},+)$, then the value of the $n$-fold repetition of $\mathcal{G}$ is exponentially decaying. That is, there exists $c=c(\mathcal{G})&gt;0$ such that $\mathsf{val}(\mathcal{G}^{\otimes n})\leq 2^{-cn}$. This extends a previous result of [Braverman-Khot-Minzer, FOCS 2023] showing exponential decay for the GHZ game. Our proof combines tools from additive combinatorics and tools from discrete Fourier analysis.</description>

      <title>Refining asymptotic complexity bounds for nonconvex optimization methods, including why steepest descent is $o(\epsilon^{-2})$ rather than $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the standard ``telescoping sum'' argument ubiquitous in the final steps of analyzing evaluation complexity of algorithms for smooth nonconvex optimization, and obtain a refined formulation of the resulting bound as a function of the requested accuracy $\epsilon$. While bounds obtained using the standard argument typically are of the form $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-\alpha})$ for some positive $\alpha$, the refined results are of the form $o(\epsilon^{-\alpha})$. We then explore to which known algorithms our refined bounds are applicable and finally describe an example showing how close the standard and refined bounds can be.</description>

      <title>Character Complexity: A Novel Measure for Quantum Circuit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, quantifying circuit complexity remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces \textit{character complexity}, a novel measure that bridges group-theoretic concepts with practical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation theory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a surprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This new measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum algorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical computational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for character complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of quantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors with respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum algorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the theoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools for the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance, character complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient quantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Avoshifts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An avoshift is a subshift where for each set $C$ from a suitable family of subsets of the shift group, the set of all possible valid extensions of a globally valid pattern on $C$ to the identity element is determined by a bounded subpattern. This property is shared (for various families of sets $C$) by for example cellwise quasigroup shifts, TEP subshifts, and subshifts of finite type with a safe symbol. In this paper we concentrate on avoshifts on polycyclic groups, when the sets $C$ are what we call ``inductive intervals''. We show that then avoshifts are a recursively enumerable subset of subshifts of finite type. Furthermore, we can effectively compute lower-dimensional projective subdynamics and certain factors (avofactors), and we can decide equality and inclusion for subshifts in this class. These results were previously known for group shifts, but our class also covers many non-algebraic examples as well as many SFTs without dense periodic points. The theory also yields new proofs of decidability of inclusion for SFTs on free groups, and SFTness of subshifts with the topological strong spatial mixing property.</description>

      <title>Work-Efficient Parallel Counting via Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of estimating the partition function $Z(\beta) = \sum_{x \in \Omega} \exp[-\beta \cdot H(x)]$ of a Gibbs distribution defined by a Hamiltonian $H(\cdot)$. It is well known that the partition function $Z(\beta)$ can be well approximated by the simulated annealing method, assuming a sampling oracle that can generate samples according to the Gibbs distribution of any given inverse temperature $\beta$. This method yields the most efficient reductions from counting to sampling, including:
  $\bullet$ classic non-adaptive (parallel) algorithms with sub-optimal cost [DFK89; Bez+08];
  $\bullet$ adaptive (sequential) algorithms with near-optimal cost [SVV09; Hub15; Kol18; HK23].
  In this paper, we give an algorithm that achieves efficiency in both parallelism and total work. Specifically, it provides a reduction from counting to sampling using near-optimal total work and logarithmic depth of computation. Consequently, it gives work-efficient parallel counting algorithms for several important models, including the hardcore and Ising models in the uniqueness regime.</description>

      <title>Control by Adding Players to Change or Maintain the Shapley-Shubik or the Penrose-Banzhaf Power Index in Weighted Voting Games Is Complete for NP^PP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09953v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Weighted voting games are a well-known and useful class of succinctly representable simple games that have many real-world applications, e.g., to model collective decision-making in legislative bodies or shareholder voting. Among the structural control types being analyzing, one is control by adding players to weighted voting games, so as to either change or to maintain a player's power in the sense of the (probabilistic) Penrose-Banzhaf power index or the Shapley-Shubik power index. For the problems related to this control, the best known lower bound is PP-hardness, where PP is "probabilistic polynomial time," and the best known upper bound is the class NP^PP, i.e., the class NP with a PP oracle. We optimally raise this lower bound by showing NP^PP-hardness of all these problems for the Penrose-Banzhaf and the Shapley-Shubik indices, thus establishing completeness for them in that class. Our proof technique may turn out to be useful for solving other open problems related to weighted voting games with such a complexity gap as well.</description>

      <title>Topics in Algebra of Synchronous Games, Algebraic Graph Identities and Quantum NP-hardness Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the correspondence between a synchronous game and its associated game algebra. We slightly develop the work of Helton et al.[HMPS17] by proposing results on algebraic and locally commuting graph identities. Based on the theoretical works on noncommutative Nullstellens\"atze [BWHK23], we build computational tools involving Gr\"obner basis methods and semidefinite programming to check the existence of perfect strategies with specific models. We prove the equivalence between the hereditary and $C$-star models proposed in [HMPS17]. We also extend Ji's reduction $\texttt{3-SAT}\text{-star} \leq_p \texttt{3-Coloring}\text{-star}$ [Ji13] and exhibit another instance of quantum-version NP-hardness reduction $\texttt{3-SAT}\text{-star} \leq_p \texttt{Clique}\text{-star}$.</description>

Abstract: We show that Edge Multiway Cut (also called Multiterminal Cut) and Node Multiway Cut are NP-complete on graphs of maximum degree $3$ (also known as subcubic graphs). This improves on a previous degree bound of $11$. Our NP-completeness result holds even for subcubic graphs that are planar.</description>

      <title>Weighted Automata and Logics Meet Computational Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10810v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complexity classes such as $\#\mathbf{P}$, $\oplus\mathbf{P}$, $\mathbf{GapP}$, $\mathbf{OptP}$, $\mathbf{NPMV}$, or the class of fuzzy languages realised by polynomial-time fuzzy nondeterministic Turing machines, can all be described in terms of a class $\mathbf{NP}[S]$ for a suitable semiring $S$, defined via weighted Turing machines over $S$ similarly as $\mathbf{NP}$ is defined via the classical nondeterministic Turing machines. Other complexity classes of decision problems can be lifted to the quantitative world using the same recipe as well, and the resulting classes relate to the original ones in the same way as weighted automata or logics relate to their unweighted counterparts. The article surveys these too-little-known connexions between weighted automata theory and computational complexity theory implicit in the existing literature, suggests a systematic approach to the study of weighted complexity classes, and presents several new observations strengthening the relation between both fields. In particular, it is proved that a natural extension of the Boolean satisfiability problem to weighted propositional logic is complete for the class $\mathbf{NP}[S]$ when $S$ is a finitely generated semiring. Moreover, a class of semiring-valued functions $\mathbf{FP}[S]$ is introduced for each semiring $S$ as a counterpart to the class $\mathbf{P}$, and the relations between $\mathbf{FP}[S]$ and $\mathbf{NP}[S]$ are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09301v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove non asymptotic total variation estimates for the kinetic Langevin algorithm in high dimension when the target measure satisfies a Poincar\'e inequality and has gradient Lipschitz potential. The main point is that the estimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non kinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension dependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\sqrt n)$.</description>

      <title>Regenerative Ulam-von Neumann Algorithm: An Innovative Markov chain Monte Carlo Method for Matrix Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16661v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an extension of the classical Ulan-von Neumann Markov chain Monte-Carlo algorithm for the computation of the matrix inverse. The algorithm presented in this paper, termed as \emph{regenerative Ulam-von Neumann algorithm}, utilizes the regenerative structure of classical, non-truncated Neumann series defined by a non-singular matrix and produces an unbiased estimator of the matrix inverse. Furthermore, the accuracy of the proposed algorithm depends on a single parameter that controls the total number of Markov transitions simulated thus avoiding the challenge of balancing between the total number of Markov chain replications and its corresponding length as in the classical Ulam-von Neumann algorithm. To efficiently utilize the Markov chain transition samples in the calculation of the regenerative quantities, the proposed algorithm quantifies automatically the contribution of each Markov transition to all regenerative quantities by a carefully designed updating scheme that utilized three separate matrices containing the current weights, total weights, and regenerative cycle count, respectively. A probabilistic analysis of the performance of the algorithm, including the variance of the estimator, is provided. Finally, numerical experiments verify the qualitative effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</description>
