      <title>No TiO detected in the hot Neptune-desert planet LTT-9779 b in reflected light at high spectral resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LTT-9779 b is an inhabitant of the hot Neptune desert and one of only a few planets with a measured high albedo. Characterising the atmosphere of this world is the key to understanding what processes dominate in creating the hot Neptune desert. We aim to characterise the reflected light of LTT-9779 b at high spectral resolution to break the degeneracy between clouds and atmospheric metallicity. This is key to interpreting its mass loss history which may illuminate how it kept its place in the desert. We use the high resolution cross-correlation spectroscopy technique on four half-nights of ESPRESSO observations in 4-UT mode (16.4-m effective mirror) to constrain the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b. We do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b despite these data having the expected sensitivity at the level 100 ppm. Injection tests on the post-eclipse data indicate that TiO should have been detected for a range of different equilibrium chemistry models. Therefore this non-detection suggests TiO depletion in the western hemisphere however, this conclusion is sensitive to temperature which impacts the chemistry in the upper atmosphere and the reliability of the line list. Additionally, we are able to constrain the top of the western cloud deck to $P_{\text{top, western}}&lt;10^{-2.0}$ bar and the top of the eastern cloud deck $P_{\text{top, eastern}}&lt;10^{-0.5}$ bar, which is consistent with the predicted altitude of MgSiO$_3$ and Mg$_2$SiO$_4$ clouds from JWST NIRISS/SOSS. While we do not detect the reflected light spectrum of LTT-9779 b, we have verified that this technique can be used in practice to characterise the high spectral resolution reflected light of exoplanets so long as their spectra contain a sufficient number of deep spectral lines. Therefore this technique may become an important cornerstone of exoplanet characterisation with the ELT and beyond.</description>

      <title>Isolating the gravitational influence of Uranus's winds requires close passages inward of the rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Close orbits by a Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP) could be used to deduce Uranus's multipolar gravity field to higher precision and angular degree than the J2 and J4 currently measured from ground-based ring occultations and the Voyager 2 flyby. We examine Jn sensitivity limits obtained from simulations of candidate UOP trajectories, pairing these with Uranus interior and wind models to perform retrievals from the gravity moments. We consider zonal wind profiles derived from recent feature-tracking data, assuming that zonal winds extend into the planet along cylinders, with a radial decay function similar to those that explain Jupiter and Saturn gravity. Present knowledge of J2 and J4 permits a fairly wide range of possible wind depths in Uranus, up to 1,800 km or 7% by radius. Measuring additional gravity moments is essential to separate this unknown wind depth from other interior properties of interest, but J6 is found to be too dominated by bulk rotation to be a useful probe of the wind depth. Odd moments arising from Uranus's observed north-south asymmetric flow are strong functions of the wind depth, but the usefulness of J3 is hindered by its sensitivity to present uncertainties in the wind profile. The even moment J8, or the odd moments J5 and J7, are the best probes of the depth of Uranus's winds. J8, and most likely J5 and J7, are measurable in a highly inclined orbit making &gt;~10 pericenter passages inward of the $\zeta$ ring, approximately 1,000-2,500 km above Uranus's cloud tops.</description>

      <title>Conservation laws in non-inertial frames and non-conservation of energy of relative motion in two-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of systems of multiple gravitationally interacting bodies is often studied in a frame attached to one of the objects (e.g. a central star in a planetary system). As this frame is generally non-inertial, indirect forces appear in the equations describing the motion of bodies relative to the reference object. According to the convention adopted in celestial mechanics, the associated indirect acceleration is defined to be different for every object under consideration, whereas the gravitational coupling between each body and the reference object is described via the effective two-body potential, which does not obey the equivalence principle. Here we point out that a slightly different and more physically motivated definition of the indirect acceleration provides significant benefits when interpreting relative motion in a non-inertial frame. First, the indirect acceleration ends up being the same for all objects in the system. Second, the non-conservation of momentum, angular momentum, and energy of the whole system in a non-inertial frame naturally follow from the action of the indirect acceleration on the system as an external force. We also argue that the vis viva integral of the classical two-body problem should not be interpreted as a statement of energy conservation. In fact, the energy of relative motion is not conserved due to the work done on the two-body system by the indirect force. These results can be useful for interpreting dynamics in various astrophysical contexts, in particular the physics of disc-planet coupling.</description>

      <title>WATSON-Net: Vetting, Validation, and Analysis of Transits from Space Observations with Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. As the number of detected transiting exoplanet candidates continues to grow, the need for robust and scalable automated tools to prioritize or validate them has become increasingly critical. Among the most promising solutions, deep learning models offer the ability to interpret complex diagnostic metrics traditionally used in the vetting process. Aims. In this work, we present WATSON-Net, a new open-source neural network classifier and data preparation package designed to compete with current state-of-the-art tools for vetting and validation of transiting exoplanet signals from space-based missions. Methods. Trained on Kepler Q1-Q17 DR25 data using 10-fold cross-validation, WATSON-Net produces ten independent models, each evaluated on dedicated validation and test sets. The ten models are calibrated and prepared to be extensible for TESS data by standardizing the input pipeline, allowing for performance assessment across different space missions. Results. For Kepler targets, WATSON-Net achieves a recall-at-precision of 0.99 (R@P0.99) of 0.903, ranking second, with only the ExoMiner network performing better (R@P0.99 = 0.936). For TESS signals, WATSON-Net emerges as the best-performing non-fine-tuned machine learning classifier, achieving a precision of 0.93 and a recall of 0.76 on a test set comprising confirmed planets and false positives. Both the model and its data preparation tools are publicly available in the dearwatson Python package, fully open-source and integrated into the vetting engine of the SHERLOCK pipeline.</description>

      <title>Numerical Simulation of Impact Cratering and Induced Seismic Waves in Sand Targets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impact cratering plays a crucial role in shaping the surfaces of small bodies, satellites, and planets, providing insights into their formation and the history of the Solar System. Small bodies are often covered with low-cohesion regolith. Using sand as a model of regolith, we constructed a numerical model for simulating impact on a sand target to investigate the mechanisms of crater formation and impact-induced seismic waves. Soda-lime glass and quartz sand targets were used for comparison. The developed sand model successfully reproduced the sound velocity measured in an experimental study. Using the new sand model, the crater formation was simulated using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics with a material strength parameter. The crater radius and $\pi$-scaling law derived from the numerical simulation were consistent with the experimental study. The vertical acceleration around the surface of the crater was consistent with the experimentally measured acceleration for the impact-induced seismic wave. The developed model can provide insight for predicting the size of craters on unknown small bodies.</description>

      <title>Rapid-response characterization of near-Earth asteroid 2024 YR4 during a Torino Scale 3 alert</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 27 December 2024, near-Earth object (NEO) 2024 YR$_4$ was discovered by the ATLAS survey and identified as a virtual impactor. A few weeks later, it eventually reached level 3 on the Torino Scale and was the first and only asteroid to be ever classified at that level. Here we report an intensive observational campaign combining time-series photometry in the visible, broadband visible and near-infrared colors, and low-resolution visible reflectance spectroscopy to assess its physical properties. Fourier analysis of the lightcurves yields a synodic rotation period of $P = 19.46341 \pm 0.00008$ min, placing 2024 YR$_4$ among the fast rotators, even if such rotation is common for objects of similar $H$ magnitude. Its visible and near-infrared colors and spectra are most consistent with an Sq or K taxonomic classification, though some ambiguity remains. Finally, its phase curve exhibits a notably shallow slope ($G = 0.51 \pm 0.11$), from which we derive an absolute magnitude of $H_\mathrm{R} = 23.82\pm0.09$ mag. After color correction and taking into account other models for the phase function, we report an absolute magnitude of $H_\mathrm{V} = 24.14\pm0.25$ mag. These characterizations, rotation period, taxonomy, and surface properties, would have been crucial for risk assessment and mitigation planning had the initially high impact probability scenario been confirmed, underscoring the importance for planetary defense of a rapid, coordinated international response.</description>

      <title>Adsorption and condensation of molecules on astrophysical dust grain surfaces: Ab-initio calculalations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The adsorption of volatile molecules onto dust grain surfaces fundamentally influences dust-related processes, including condensation of gas-phase molecules, dust coagulation, and planet formation in protoplanetary disks. Using advanced {\it ab-initio} density functional theory with r$^2$SCAN+rVV10 van der Waals functionals, we calculate adsorption energies of H$_2$, H$_2$O, and CO on carbonaceous (graphene, amorphous carbon) and silicate (MgSiO$_3$) surfaces. Results reveal fundamentally different adsorption mechanisms: weak physisorption on carbonaceous surfaces ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.1-0.2~{\rm eV}$) versus strong chemisorption on silicates ($|\Delta\epsilon_{\rm ad}|\sim 0.5-1.5~{\rm eV}$) via coordination bonds. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations incorporating these energies demonstrate divergent surface evolution: carbonaceous grains exhibit distinct condensation radius compared to silicates, while the cocrystal of H$_2$O and CO significantly increases the desorption temperature of CO. The actual radii of gas-phase molecule depletion could thus be a comprehensive result of temperatures, chemical compositions, and even evolution tracks. Meanwhile, silicates maintain chemisorbed molecular coatings throughout most disk regions. Such dichotomy in surface coverage could also provide a natural mechanism for carbon depletion in inner planetary systems.</description>

      <title>Global Distribution of the Key Species on the Surface of Europa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The icy surface of Europa is continuously bombarded by ions and electrons from Jupiter's magnetosphere. The bombardment of the particles dissociates water molecules on the surface of Europa and introduces impurities to the icy surface. Such processes lead to the generation of the non-water species on the surface of Europa. Such processes lead to the generation of the nonwater species on the surface of Europa. These chemical species are closely related to the chemistry of the icy crust and the subsurface ocean, as well as Europa's habitability. However, our knowledge of the global distribution of these species is limited due to the sparse satellite and telescope observations on Europa. In this study, we combine a Europa plasma model and a chemical-transport model to simulate the global distribution of the key nonwater species on the surface of Europa. The initial results from our model agree well with the existing observations on the distributions of H2SO4 and SO2 but they show a significant discrepancy with the observed distribution of H2O2. Sensitivity tests on the reaction rate coefficients indicate that the simulated global distribution of all three species fit the observations well if the reaction rate coefficients in the ice are reduced by one order of magnitude. This finding provides a useful constraint on the rate coefficient of the chemical reactions in the ice. Furthermore, our model predicts that the O2 on the surface ice of Europa is concentrated on the leading hemisphere. The simulated global distribution of the key species on Europa may provide useful guidance for future missions to Europa, such as Europa Clipper and JUICE.</description>

      <title>Abiogenesis on Different Star Types; a Dissipative Photochemical Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The thermodynamic dissipation theory for the origin of life asserts a thermodynamic imperative for the origin of life, suggesting that the fundamental molecules of life originated as self-organized molecular photon dissipative structures (chromophores or pigments) that proliferated over the ocean surface to absorb and dissipate into heat the Archean solar soft UV-C (205-285 nm) and UV-B light ($&lt;$320 nm) of our G-type star. Shorter wavelength hard UV-C light ($&lt;$205 nm) may, depending on atmospheric conditions, have reached Earth's surface and ionized and dissociated or otherwise degraded these carbon-based pigment molecules (as probably occurred on Mars after losing most of its atmosphere). Here we assess the possibility for an abiogenesis of life similar to ours through molecular photon dissipative structuring on planets similar to early Earth but orbiting different star types at distances normalized to the solar constant. Emission spectra of star types are analyzed to determine the ratio of integrated photon fluxes in the soft UV-C wavelength (dissipative structuring) to hard UV-C wavelength (degradation) regions. Our analysis suggests that star types favorable to the dissipative structuring of life, potentially evolving towards complex life forms such as bacteria, are only the F, G and high mass K-types, with intelligent life only possible on G-type stars. Low mass K and M-type stars are highly unlikely to harbor life. Biosignatures related to the thermodynamic imperative of photon dissipation are proposed.</description>

      <title>CoronaGraph Instrument Reference stars for Exoplanets (CorGI-REx) I. Preliminary Vetting and Implications for the Roman Coronagraph and Habitable Worlds Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08862v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The upcoming Roman Coronagraph will be the first high-contrast instrument in space capable of high-order wavefront sensing and control technologies, a critical technology demonstration for the proposed Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) that aims to directly image and characterize habitable exoEarths. The nominal Roman Coronagraph observing plan involves alternating observations of a science target and a bright, nearby reference star. High contrast is achieved using wavefront sensing and control, also known as "digging a dark hole", where performance depends on the properties of the reference star, requiring V&lt;3, a resolved stellar diameter &lt;2 mas, and no stellar multiplicity. The imposed brightness and diameter criteria limit the sample of reference star candidates to high-mass main sequence and post-main sequence objects, where multiplicity rates are high. A future HWO coronagraph may have similarly restrictive criteria in reference star selection. From an exhaustive literature review of 95 stars, we identify an initial list of 40 primary and 18 reserve reference star candidates relevant to both the Roman Coronagraph and HWO. We present results from an initial survey of these candidates with high-resolution adaptive optics imaging and speckle interferometry and identify no new companions. We discuss the need for higher-contrast observations to sufficiently vet these reference star candidates prior to Roman Coronagraph observations along with the implications of reference star criteria on observation planning for Roman and HWO.</description>

Abstract: To support the development of the data processing pipeline and the scientific performance assessment for the Cool Planet Imaging Coronagraph (CPI-C) on the China Space Station Telescope (CSST), we have developed the end-to-end instrument simulation program, CPISM. This paper details the core modules of CPISM that simulate the CPI-C instrument, focusing on the simulation of the high-contrast imaging optical system and the visible-band science camera. We modeled key optical components, such as the transmission apodizing filter, the wavefront corrector, and the focal plane mask using the HCIPy package. A $10^{-8}$ contrast dark hole region, consistent with design specifications, was simulated using the Electric Field Conjugation (EFC) optimization method, and broadband observation effects were considered. For the science camera, which is an electron multiplying charge-coupled device (EMCCD), we established a detailed model encompassing photon collection, charge transfer, electron multiplication (EM), and readout processes, based on test data. This model simulates complex instrumental features including dark current, charge transfer efficiency, clock-induced charge, multiplication noise factor, and various readout effects like striping and drift. We also proposed and validated an improved statistical model for the EM process to enhance simulation efficiency. CPISM can generate simulated images containing rich instrumental details, closely similar to the expected real observational data, thus laying the foundation for the development and verification of CPI-C data processing algorithms and preparations for future scientific research.</description>

      <title>Radio Burst from a Stellar Coronal Mass Ejection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09289v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive expulsions of magnetised plasma from a star, and are the largest contributors to space weather in the Solar System. CMEs are theorized to play a key role in planetary atmospheric erosion, especially for planets that are close to their host star. However, such a conclusion remains controversial as there has not been an unambiguous detection of a CME from a star outside of our Sun. Previous stellar CME studies have only inferred the presence of a CME through the detection of other types of stellar eruptive events. A signature of a fast CME is a Type II radio burst, which is emitted from the shock wave produced as the CME travels through the stellar corona into interplanetary space. Here we report an analogue to a Type II burst from the early M dwarf StKM 1-1262. The burst exhibits identical frequency, time, and polarisation properties to fundamental plasma emission from a solar Type II burst. We demonstrate the rate of such events with similar radio luminosity from M dwarfs are 0.84$^{+1.94}_{-0.69} \times$10$^{-3}$ per day per star. Our detection implies that we are no longer restricted to extrapolating the solar CME kinematics and rates to other stars, allowing us to establish the first observational limits on the impact of CMEs on exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Occurrence rate of stellar Type II radio bursts from a 100 star-year search for coronal mass ejections</title>

Abstract: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are major drivers of space weather in the Solar System, but their occurrence rate on other stars is unknown. A characteristic (deca-)metric radio burst with a time-frequency drift, known as a Type II radio burst, is a key observational signature of CMEs. We searched a total of 107 years of stellar data using time-frequency spectra that targeted all known stars within 100 parsecs in the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) up to May 2023. This resulted in the largest unbiased search for circularly polarised stellar Type II metric radio bursts to date, with a typical 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of 2.5 mJy for an integration time of 1 minute. We detected two drifting stellar radio bursts: the published 2-minute burst from the M dwarf StKM 1-1262 and a new 13-minute burst from the M dwarf LP 215-56. The new burst is characterised by a drift rate of $-0.060^{+0.002}_{-0.002}$ MHz s$^{-1}$, an average Stokes V flux density of $-4.5^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$ mJy, and a temporal duration of $63^{+31}_{-11}$ seconds. We constrained the occurrence rate of drifting stellar bursts by calculating Poisson upper and lower limits based on the two drifting bursts. We also fitted a cumulative burst luminosity distribution to the data using the burst detections and the non-detections; this yielded a power law index ($\alpha$) of $-0.7^{+0.9}_{-0.6}$ and a normalisation point (N) of one burst per year with $E&gt;6.8\times10^{13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$. We find an agreement between this and the cumulative luminosity distribution of decametric SOHO/LASCO solar Type II data ($\alpha = -0.81 \pm 0.06 \pm 0.02$), which suggests that the current scarcity of detected stellar Type II bursts is likely due to limited sensitivity rather than to the intrinsic rarity of these events. Additionally, we identify 19 circularly polarised stellar radio bursts without a time-frequency drift.</description>

      <title>Second Generation Planet Formation in Post-AGB Discs: Testing the Role of Gravitational Instability</title>

Abstract: Post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) binary stars are evolved systems that host circumbinary discs formed through mass loss during late stage binary interactions. Their structural, morphological, kinematic, and chemical similarities to planet-forming discs suggest that these systems may act as sites of "second generation" planet formation. In this study, we assess whether the disc instability mechanism -- a proposed pathway for rapid, giant planet formation in some protoplanetary discs - can operate in post-AGB discs; motivated by their short lifetimes. Using the Toomre criterion under well motivated assumptions for disc structure and size, mass, and thermal properties, we assess the conditions for gravitational instability. We first benchmark our analytical framework using well studied protoplanetary disc systems (including HL Tauri, Elias 2-27, GQ Lupi) before applying the same analysis to observed post-AGB discs. We find that post-AGB discs are generally gravitationally stable at present, due primarily to their low masses. Using viscous disk theory, we find that the discs were stable against collapse even in the past, when their masses were potentially higher. In contrast, several protoplanetary discs analysed in the same way show that they likely experienced gravitationally unstable phases early on. We also find that higher viscosity parameters are better aligned with expected post-AGB disc lifetimes. Finally, we revisit the planet formation scenario proposed for the post-common envelope system NN Ser, first carried out by Schleicher and Dreizler and we show that gravitational instability could be feasible under specific, high disc mass assumptions. Overall, our results provide the first systematic theoretical assessment of gravitational instability in post-AGB discs, demonstrating that this mechanism is unlikely to dominate second generation planet formation in these systems.</description>

      <title>Using simultaneous mass accretion and external photoevaporation rates for d203-504 to constrain disc evolution processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12535v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We cannot understand planet formation without understanding disc evolutionary processes. However, there is currently ambiguity about how protoplanetary discs transport angular momentum (e.g. via viscosity or winds) and the relative contributions and interplay of different dispersal mechanisms. A key difficulty is that for any given system only a handful of disc parameters are usually available to constrain theoretical models. Recent observations of the d203-504 disc in Orion, have yielded values of the stellar accretion rate, external photoevaporative mass loss rate, stellar mass and the disc size and mass. In particular, having the combination of accretion rate and external photoevaporative rate is new. Using this unique combination of observables, we run a suite of disc evolution simulations to constrain which scenarios can match the observed values. We explore both viscous and MHD wind-driven discs, finding that they best match observations when the angular momentum transport $\alpha$ parameter is $3\times10^{-4}\leq\alpha_{\nu}\leq2\times10^{-3}$ for viscous discs, and $2\times10^{-3}\leq\alpha_{\rm DW}\leq10^{-2}$ for MHD wind-driven discs, consistent with other estimates in the literature. As well constraining the disc properties and evolution, the d203-504 disc allows us to define a new irradiation age, since in order to match observations, it was required that the disc had only just appeared in the extreme UV environment it is currently exposed to (a known issue for proplyds referred to as the proplyd lifetime problem). This indicates that it is either very young, i.e. &lt;0.1 Myr, or it has been shielded until recently, which would have protected the planet forming reservoir and helped facilitate planet growth despite it now residing in a harsh UV environment.</description>
