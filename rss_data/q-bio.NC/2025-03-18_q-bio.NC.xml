      <title>When neural implant meets multimodal LLM: A dual-loop system for neuromodulation and naturalistic neuralbehavioral research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12334v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel dual-loop system that synergistically combines responsive neurostimulation (RNS) implants with artificial intelligence-driven wearable devices for treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and enabling naturalistic brain research. In PTSD Therapy Mode, an implanted closed-loop neural device monitors amygdala activity and provides on-demand stimulation upon detecting pathological theta oscillations, while an ensemble of wearables (smart glasses, smartwatches, smartphones) uses multimodal large language model (LLM) analysis of sensory data to detect environmental or physiological PTSD triggers and deliver timely audiovisual interventions. Logged events from both the neural and wearable loops are analyzed to personalize trigger detection and progressively transition patients to non-invasive interventions. In Neuroscience Research Mode, the same platform is adapted for real-world brain activity capture. Wearable-LLM systems recognize naturalistic events (social interactions, emotional situations, compulsive behaviors, decision making) and signal implanted RNS devices (via wireless triggers) to record synchronized intracranial data during these moments. This approach builds on recent advances in mobile intracranial EEG recording and closed-loop neuromodulation in humans (BRAIN Initiative, 2023) (Mobbs et al., 2021). We discuss how our interdisciplinary system could revolutionize PTSD therapy and cognitive neuroscience by enabling 24/7 monitoring, context-aware intervention, and rich data collection outside traditional labs. The vision is a future where AI-enhanced devices continuously collaborate with the human brain, offering therapeutic support and deep insights into neural function, with the resulting real-world context rich neural data, in turn, accelerating the development of more biologically-grounded and human-centric AI.</description>

      <title>Central and Central-Parietal EEG Signatures of Parkinson's Disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates EEG as a potential early biomarker by applying deep learning techniques to resting-state EEG recordings from 31 subjects (15 with PD and 16 healthy controls). EEG signals were rigorously preprocessed to remove tremor artifacts, then converted to wavelet-based images by grouping spatially adjacent electrodes into triplets for convolutional neural network (CNN) classification. Our analysis across different brain regions and frequency bands showed distinct spatial-spectral patterns of PD-related neural oscillations. We identified high classification accuracy (74%) in the gamma band (40-62.4 Hz) for central-parietal electrodes (CP1, Pz, CP2), and 76% accuracy using central electrodes (C3, Cz, C4) with full-spectrum 0.4-62.4 Hz. In particular, we observed pronounced right-hemisphere involvement, specifically in parieto-occipital regions. Unlike previous studies that achieved higher accuracies by potentially including tremor artifacts, our approach isolates genuine neurophysiological alterations in cortical activity. These findings suggest that specific EEG-based oscillatory patterns, especially central-parietal gamma activity, may provide diagnostic information for PD, potentially before the onset of motor symptoms.</description>

      <title>A Reservoir-based Model for Human-like Perception of Complex Rhythm Pattern</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12509v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rhythm is a fundamental aspect of human behaviour, present from infancy and deeply embedded in cultural practices. Rhythm anticipation is a spontaneous cognitive process that typically occurs before the onset of actual beats. While most research in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence has focused on metronome-based rhythm tasks, studies investigating the perception of complex musical rhythm patterns remain limited. To address this gap, we propose a hierarchical oscillator-based model to better understand the perception of complex musical rhythms in biological systems. The model consists of two types of coupled neurons that generate oscillations, with different layers tuned to respond to distinct perception levels. We evaluate the model using several representative rhythm patterns spanning the upper, middle, and lower bounds of human musical perception. Our findings demonstrate that, while maintaining a high degree of synchronization accuracy, the model exhibits human-like rhythmic behaviours. Additionally, the beta band neuronal activity in the model mirrors patterns observed in the human brain, further validating the biological plausibility of the approach.</description>

      <title>Combined impact of grey and superficial white matter abnormalities: implications for epilepsy surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-resistant focal epilepsy is associated with abnormalities in the brain in both grey matter (GM) and superficial white matter (SWM). However, it is unknown if both types of abnormalities are important in supporting seizures. Here, we test if surgical removal of GM and/or SWM abnormalities relates to post-surgical seizure outcome in people with temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE).
  We analyzed structural imaging data from 143 TLE patients (pre-op dMRI and pre-op T1-weighted MRI) and 97 healthy controls. We calculated GM volume abnormalities and SWM mean diffusivity abnormalities and evaluated if their surgical removal distinguished seizure outcome groups post-surgically.
  At a group level, GM and SWM abnormalities were most common in the ipsilateral temporal lobe and hippocampus in people with TLE. Analyzing both modalities together, compared to in isolation, improved surgical outcome discrimination (GM AUC = 0.68, p &lt; 0.01, WM AUC = 0.65, p &lt; 0.01; Union AUC = 0.72, p &lt; 0.01, Concordance AUC = 0.64, p = 0.04). Additionally, 100% of people who had all concordant abnormal regions resected had ILAE$_{1,2}$ outcomes.
  These findings suggest that regions identified as abnormal from both diffusion-weighted and T1-weighted MRIs are involved in the epileptogenic network and that resection of both types of abnormalities may enhance the chances of living without disabling seizures.</description>

      <title>Impact of Data Patterns on Biotype identification Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   Background: Patient stratification in brain disorders remains a significant challenge, despite advances in machine learning and multimodal neuroimaging. Automated machine learning algorithms have been widely applied for identifying patient subtypes (biotypes), but results have been inconsistent across studies. These inconsistencies are often attributed to algorithmic limitations, yet an overlooked factor may be the statistical properties of the input data. This study investigates the contribution of data patterns on algorithm performance by leveraging synthetic brain morphometry data as an exemplar.
  Methods: Four widely used algorithms-SuStaIn, HYDRA, SmileGAN, and SurrealGAN were evaluated using multiple synthetic pseudo-patient datasets designed to include varying numbers and sizes of clusters and degrees of complexity of morphometric changes. Ground truth, representing predefined clusters, allowed for the evaluation of performance accuracy across algorithms and datasets.
  Results: SuStaIn failed to process datasets with more than 17 variables, highlighting computational inefficiencies. HYDRA was able to perform individual-level classification in multiple datasets with no clear pattern explaining failures. SmileGAN and SurrealGAN outperformed other algorithms in identifying variable-based disease patterns, but these patterns were not able to provide individual-level classification.
  Conclusions: Dataset characteristics significantly influence algorithm performance, often more than algorithmic design. The findings emphasize the need for rigorous validation using synthetic data before real-world application and highlight the limitations of current clustering approaches in capturing the heterogeneity of brain disorders. These insights extend beyond neuroimaging and have implications for machine learning applications in biomedical research.</description>

      <title>Computational identification of ketone metabolism as a key regulator of sleep stability and circadian dynamics via real-time metabolic profiling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metabolism plays a crucial role in sleep regulation, yet its effects are challenging to track in real time. This study introduces a machine learning-based framework to analyze sleep patterns and identify how metabolic changes influence sleep at specific time points. We first established that sleep periods in Drosophila melanogaster function independently, with no causal relationship between different sleep episodes. Using gradient boosting models and explainable artificial intelligence techniques, we quantified the influence of time-dependent sleep features. Causal inference and autocorrelation analyses further confirmed that sleep states at different times are statistically independent, providing a robust foundation for exploring metabolic effects on sleep. Applying this framework to flies with altered monocarboxylate transporter 2 expression, we found that changes in ketone transport modified sleep stability and disrupted transitions between day and night sleep. In an Alzheimers disease model, metabolic interventions such as beta hydroxybutyrate supplementation and intermittent fasting selectively influenced the timing of day to night transitions rather than uniformly altering sleep duration. Autoencoder based similarity scoring and wavelet analysis reinforced that metabolic effects on sleep were highly time dependent. This study presents a novel approach to studying sleep-metabolism interactions, revealing that metabolic states exert their strongest influence at distinct time points, shaping sleep stability and circadian transitions.</description>

      <title>Intra-neuronal attention within language models Relationships between activation and semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the ability of perceptron-type neurons in language models to perform intra-neuronal attention; that is, to identify different homogeneous categorical segments within the synthetic thought category they encode, based on a segmentation of specific activation zones for the tokens to which they are particularly responsive. The objective of this work is therefore to determine to what extent formal neurons can establish a homomorphic relationship between activation-based and categorical segmentations. The results suggest the existence of such a relationship, albeit tenuous, only at the level of tokens with very high activation levels. This intra-neuronal attention subsequently enables categorical restructuring processes at the level of neurons in the following layer, thereby contributing to the progressive formation of high-level categorical abstractions.</description>

      <title>Functional Brain-to-Brain Transformation with No Shared Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Combining Functional MRI (fMRI) data across different subjects and datasets is crucial for many neuroscience tasks. Relying solely on shared anatomy for brain-to-brain mapping is inadequate. Existing functional transformation methods thus depend on shared stimuli across subjects and fMRI datasets, which are often unavailable. In this paper, we propose an approach for computing functional brain-to-brain transformations without any shared data, a feat not previously achieved in functional transformations. This presents exciting research prospects for merging and enriching diverse datasets, even when they involve distinct stimuli that were collected using different fMRI machines of varying resolutions (e.g., 3-Tesla and 7-Tesla). Our approach combines brain-to-brain transformation with image-to-fMRI encoders, thus enabling to learn functional transformations on visual stimuli to which subjects were never exposed. Furthermore, we demonstrate the applicability of our method for improving image-to-fMRI encoding of subjects scanned on older low-resolution 3T fMRI datasets, by using a new high-resolution 7T fMRI dataset (scanned on different subjects and different stimuli).</description>

      <title>Identifying the impact of local connectivity patterns on dynamics in excitatory-inhibitory networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06802v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks of excitatory and inhibitory (EI) neurons form a canonical circuit in the brain. Seminal theoretical results on dynamics of such networks are based on the assumption that synaptic strengths depend on the type of neurons they connect, but are otherwise statistically independent. Recent synaptic physiology datasets however highlight the prominence of specific connectivity patterns that go well beyond what is expected from independent connections. While decades of influential research have demonstrated the strong role of the basic EI cell type structure, to which extent additional connectivity features influence dynamics remains to be fully determined. Here we examine the effects of pairwise connectivity motifs on the linear dynamics in EI networks using an analytical framework that approximates the connectivity in terms of low-rank structures. This low-rank approximation is based on a mathematical derivation of the dominant eigenvalues of the connectivity matrix and predicts the impact on responses to external inputs of connectivity motifs and their interactions with cell-type structure. Our results reveal that a particular pattern of connectivity, chain motifs, have a much stronger impact on dominant eigenmodes than other pairwise motifs. An overrepresentation of chain motifs induces a strong positive eigenvalue in inhibition-dominated networks and generates a potential instability that requires revisiting the classical excitation-inhibition balance criteria. Examining effects of external inputs, we show that chain motifs can on their own induce paradoxical responses where an increased input to inhibitory neurons leads to a decrease in their activity due to the recurrent feedback. These findings have direct implications for the interpretation of experiments in which responses to optogenetic perturbations are measured and used to infer the dynamical regime of cortical circuits.</description>

      <title>The impact of motor and non-motor symptoms fluctuations on health-related quality of life in people with functional motor disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Objective: To assess the effect of overall, between- and within-day subjectively rated fluctuations in motor and non-motor symptoms in people with functional motor disorder (FMD) on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Background: FMD is a complex condition characterized by fluctuating motor and non-motor symptoms that may negatively impact HRQoL. Methods: Seventy-seven patients (54 females, mean age 45.4 (SD 10.4) years) with a clinically established diagnosis of FMD, including weakness, completed symptom diaries, rating the severity of motor and non-motor symptoms (i.e., pain, fatigue, mood, cognitive difficulties) on a 10-point numerical scale three times daily for seven consecutive days. HRQoL was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire. For the analysis, fluctuation magnitude was defined in terms of the variability in self-reported symptom scores. Results: The mental component of SF-36 was jointly predicted by the overall severity scores (t(74) = -3.61, P &lt; 0.001) and overall general fluctuations (t(74) = -2.98, P = 0.004). The physical SF-36 was found to be related only to the overall symptom severity scores (t(74) = -7.09, P &lt; 0.001), but not to the overall fluctuations. The assessment of the impact of different components showed that the mental component of SF-36 was significantly influenced by the combined effect of average fatigue (t(73) = -3.86, P &lt; 0.001), between-day cognitive symptoms fluctuations (t(73) = -3.22, P = 0.002), and within-day mood fluctuations (t(73) = -2.48, P = 0.015). Conclusions: This study demonstrated the impact of self-reported symptom fluctuations across multiple motor and non-motor domains on mental but not physical HRQoL in FMD and highlighted the importance of assessing and managing fluctuations in clinical practice.</description>

      <title>Population Transformer: Learning Population-level Representations of Neural Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03044v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a self-supervised framework that learns population-level codes for arbitrary ensembles of neural recordings at scale. We address key challenges in scaling models with neural time-series data, namely, sparse and variable electrode distribution across subjects and datasets. The Population Transformer (PopT) stacks on top of pretrained temporal embeddings and enhances downstream decoding by enabling learned aggregation of multiple spatially-sparse data channels. The pretrained PopT lowers the amount of data required for downstream decoding experiments, while increasing accuracy, even on held-out subjects and tasks. Compared to end-to-end methods, this approach is computationally lightweight, while achieving similar or better decoding performance. We further show how our framework is generalizable to multiple time-series embeddings and neural data modalities. Beyond decoding, we interpret the pretrained and fine-tuned PopT models to show how they can be used to extract neuroscience insights from large amounts of data. We release our code as well as a pretrained PopT to enable off-the-shelf improvements in multi-channel intracranial data decoding and interpretability. Code is available at https://github.com/czlwang/PopulationTransformer.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics and fractal geometry in ring lattice systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the complex dynamics and fractal attractors that emerge from a 60-dimensional ring lattice system of electrically coupled nonchaotic Rulkov neurons. Although networks of chaotic Rulkov neurons are well studied, systems of nonchaotic Rulkov neurons have not been extensively explored due to the piecewise complexity of the nonchaotic Rulkov map. We find rich dynamics emerge from the electrical coupling of regular spiking Rulkov neurons, including chaotic spiking, synchronized chaotic bursting, and complete chaos. By varying the electrical coupling strength between the neurons, we also discover general trends in the maximal Lyapunov exponent across different regimes of the ring lattice system. By means of the Kaplan-Yorke conjecture, we also examine the fractal geometry of the ring system's high-dimensional chaotic attractors and find various correlations and differences between the fractal dimensions of the attractors and the chaotic dynamics on them.</description>

      <title>Training Large Neural Networks With Low-Dimensional Error Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20580v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Training deep neural networks typically relies on backpropagating high dimensional error signals a computationally intensive process with little evidence supporting its implementation in the brain. However, since most tasks involve low-dimensional outputs, we propose that low-dimensional error signals may suffice for effective learning. To test this hypothesis, we introduce a novel local learning rule based on Feedback Alignment that leverages indirect, low-dimensional error feedback to train large networks. Our method decouples the backward pass from the forward pass, enabling precise control over error signal dimensionality while maintaining high-dimensional representations. We begin with a detailed theoretical derivation for linear networks, which forms the foundation of our learning framework, and extend our approach to nonlinear, convolutional, and transformer architectures. Remarkably, we demonstrate that even minimal error dimensionality on the order of the task dimensionality can achieve performance matching that of traditional backpropagation. Furthermore, our rule enables efficient training of convolutional networks, which have previously been resistant to Feedback Alignment methods, with minimal error. This breakthrough not only paves the way toward more biologically accurate models of learning but also challenges the conventional reliance on high-dimensional gradient signals in neural network training. Our findings suggest that low-dimensional error signals can be as effective as high-dimensional ones, prompting a reevaluation of gradient-based learning in high-dimensional systems. Ultimately, our work offers a fresh perspective on neural network optimization and contributes to understanding learning mechanisms in both artificial and biological systems.</description>
