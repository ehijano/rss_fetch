      <title>Electron spin dynamics guide cell motility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diverse organisms exploit the geomagnetic field (GMF) for migration. Migrating birds employ an intrinsically quantum mechanical mechanism for detecting the geomagnetic field: absorption of a blue photon generates a radical pair whose two electrons precess at different rates in the magnetic field, thereby sensitizing cells to the direction of the GMF. In this work, using an in vitro injury model, we discovered a quantum-based mechanism of cellular migration. Specifically, we show that migrating cells detect the GMF via an optically activated, electron spin-based mechanism. Cell injury provokes acute emission of blue photons, and these photons sensitize muscle progenitor cells to the magnetic field. We show that the magnetosensitivity of muscle progenitor cells is (a) activated by blue light, but not by green or red light, and (b) disrupted by the application of an oscillatory field at the frequency corresponding to the energy of the electron-spin/magnetic field interaction. A comprehensive analysis of protein expression reveals that the ability of blue photons to promote cell motility is mediated by activation of calmodulin calcium sensors. Collectively, these data suggest that cells possess a light-dependent magnetic compass driven by electron spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Controlling tissue size by active fracture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03126v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groups of cells, including clusters of cancerous cells, multicellular organisms, and developing organs, may both grow and break apart. What physical factors control these fractures? In these processes, what sets the eventual size of clusters? We develop a framework for understanding cell clusters that can fragment due to cell motility using an active particle model. We compute analytically how the break rate of cell-cell junctions depends on cell speed, cell persistence, and cell-cell junction properties. Next, we find the cluster size distributions, which differ depending on whether all cells can divide or only the cells on the edge of the cluster divide. Cluster size distributions depend solely on the ratio of the break rate to the growth rate - allowing us to predict how cluster size and variability depend on cell motility and cell-cell mechanics. Our results suggest that organisms can achieve better size control when cell division is restricted to the cluster boundaries or when fracture can be localized to the cluster center. Our results link the general physics problem of a collective active escape over a barrier to size control, providing a quantitative measure of how motility can regulate organ or organism size.</description>

      <title>A model for boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tissue deformations during morphogenesis can be active, driven by internal processes, or passive, resulting from stresses applied at their boundaries. Here, we introduce the Drosophila hindgut primordium as a model for studying boundary-driven tissue morphogenesis. We characterize its deformations and show that its complex shape changes can be a passive consequence of the deformations of the active regions of the embryo that surround it. First, we find an intermediate characteristic triangular shape in the 3D deformations of the hindgut. We construct a minimal model of the hindgut primordium as an elastic ring deformed by active midgut invagination and germ band extension on an ellipsoidal surface, which robustly captures the symmetry-breaking into this triangular shape. We then quantify the 3D kinematics of the tissue by a set of contours and discover that the hindgut deforms in two stages: an initial translation on the curved embryo surface followed by a rapid breaking of shape symmetry. We extend our model to show that the contour kinematics in both stages are consistent with our passive picture. Our results suggest that the role of in-plane deformations during hindgut morphogenesis is to translate the tissue to a region with anisotropic embryonic curvature and show that uniform boundary conditions are sufficient to generate the observed nonuniform shape change. Our work thus provides a possible explanation for the various characteristic shapes of blastopore-equivalents in different organisms and a framework for the mechanical emergence of global morphologies in complex developmental systems.</description>

      <title>Stiffness and force production of outer hair cells in simple model systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cochlear outer hair cells (OHCs) have two mechanosensitive elements: the hair bundle with mechanotrasducer channels and the piezoelectric lateral wall of the cell body. The present report examines how these elements interact with each other by incorporating OHCs into the simplest local cochlear models. In the frequency range, typically above 1 kHz, where capacitive conductance is greater than the ionic conductance, hair bundle (HB) conductance drives the piezoelectric cell body and amplified oscillation by countering viscous drag, while the cell body increases its stiffness owing to strain-induced polarization, elevating the resonance frequency. Since HB sensitivity is essential for amplification, the resonance is not pure piezoelectric, but semi-piezoelectric. In the lower frequency range, typically lower than 100 Hz, strain induced polarization contributes to drag and the HB sensitivity increases cell body stiffness.</description>

      <title>Selective Tweezing and Immobilization of Colloids for Dexterous Manipulation of Biological Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The assembly of arbitrary 3D structures using nano- to micron-scale colloidal building blocks has broad applications in photonics, electronics, and biology. Combining optical tweezers (OT) with two-photon polymerization (TPP) enables 3D selective tweezing and immobilization of colloids (STIC) without requiring specialized particle functionalization. Unlike traditional approaches, we demonstrate that high-repetition-rate femtosecond laser pulses, rather than continuous-wave lasers, allow optical tweezing at intensities below the TPP threshold. This dual functionality enables both OT and TPP using a single laser source. This platform was applied on S. aureus cells into desired configurations, highlighting its potential for advanced cell patterning. TPP was further used to fabricate intricate 3D microstructures, including microgrooves and cylindrical constructs, facilitating spatially resolved studies of single-cell dynamics and interactions. This work highlights the potential of STIC as a versatile tool for advanced biological applications, including tissue engineering and microbial research.</description>

      <title>Evolution of human cognition required Einstein's gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe an unexpected anthropic fine-tuning of gravity: human cognition arose on Earth only because the laws of gravity included gravitational waves. Their link is the heat from decays of the radioactive isotopes U-238 and Th-232, which were synthesized mainly in rare explosive mergers of binary neutron stars, brought about by the loss of orbital energy to gravitational radiation. This heat, released in Earth's interior, has (1) maintained plate tectonics and (2) likely helped keep Earth's iron core molten. The core's magnetic field has protected all life from annihilation by the solar wind. More surprisingly, relative brain size, a proxy for cognition, has seen two sharp increases, first for mammals and then for humans, both attributed by evolutionary biologists to adaptations to major climatic changes caused by specific tectonic events. After the second event, the joining of North and South America, human brain size grew from chimpanzee levels to modern ones. If the laws of gravity had not included gravitational waves, humans would not be capable of studying the laws of gravity.</description>

      <title>Bacterial Turbulence in Shear Thinning Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collective motion of bacteria, commonly referred to as bacterial turbulence, is well understood in Newtonian fluids. However, studies on complex fluids have predominantly focused on viscoelastic effects. In our experiments, we employed Ficoll and Methocel polymers to compare the impacts of Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids on bacterial turbulence. We reported various physical properties, including energy and enstrophy, and observed that the shear-thinning effect is significantly suppressed in high-concentration bacterial suspensions. This suppression is largely attributed to the disruption of chain-like polymer structures around bacterial flagella due to strong interbacterial interactions in dense suspensions. To validate this hypothesis, we conducted experiments across bacterial concentrations (within the range where bacterial turbulence forms) and verified the findings using theoretical calculations based on the modified Resistive Force Theory (RFT).</description>

      <title>Surface tension-driven boundary growth in tumour spheroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03344v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing experimental evidence highlights the relevant role of mechanics in the physiology of solid tumours, even in their early stages. While most of the mathematical models describe tumour growth as a volumetric increase of mass in the bulk, in vitro experiments on tumour spheroids have demonstrated that cell proliferation occurs in a thin layer at the boundary of the cellular aggregate. In this work, we investigate how elasticity and surface tension interact during the development of tumour spheroids. We model the spheroid as a hyperelastic material undergoing boundary accretion, where the newly created cells are deformed by the action of surface tension. This growth leads to a frustrated reference configuration, resulting in the appearance of residual stress. Our theoretical framework is validated using experimental results from the literature. Like fully developed tumours, spheroids open when subjected to radial cuts. Remarkably, this behaviour is observed even in newly formed spheroids, which lack residual stress. Through both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, we show that this phenomenon is driven by elastocapillary interactions, where the residual stress developed in grown spheroids amplifies the tumour opening. Our model's outcomes align with experimental observations and allow us to estimate the surface tension acting on tumour spheroids.</description>
