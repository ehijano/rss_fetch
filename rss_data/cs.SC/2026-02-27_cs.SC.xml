      <title>Quadratization of Autonomous Partial Differential Equations: Theory and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratization for partial differential equations (PDEs) is a process that transforms a nonquadratic PDE into a quadratic form by introducing auxiliary variables. This symbolic transformation has been used in diverse fields to simplify the analysis, simulation, and control of nonlinear and nonquadratic PDE models. This paper presents a rigorous definition of PDE quadratization, theoretical results for the PDE quadratization problem of spatially one-dimensional PDEs-including results on existence and complexity-and introduces QuPDE, an algorithm based on symbolic computation and discrete optimization that outputs a quadratization for any spatially one-dimensional polynomial or rational PDE. This algorithm is the first computational tool to find quadratizations for PDEs to date. We demonstrate QuPDE's performance by applying it to fourteen nonquadratic PDEs in diverse areas such as fluid mechanics, space physics, chemical engineering, and biological processes. QuPDE delivers a low-order quadratization in each case, uncovering quadratic transformations with fewer auxiliary variables than those previously discovered in the literature for some examples, and finding quadratizations for systems that had not been transformed to quadratic form before.</description>

      <title>Coalgebraic analysis of social systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The algebraic analysis of social systems, or algebraic social network analysis, refers to a collection of methods designed to extract information about the structure of a social system represented as a directed graph. Central among these are methods to determine the roles that exist within a given system, and the positions. The analysis of roles and positions is highly developed for social systems that involve only pairwise interactions among actors - however, in contemporary social network analysis it is increasingly common to use models that can take into account higher-order interactions as well. In this paper we take a category-theoretic approach to the question of how to lift role and positional analysis from graphs to hypergraphs, which can accommodate higher-order interactions. We use the framework of universal coalgebra - a 'theory of systems' with origins in computer science and logic - to formalize the main concepts of role and positional analysis and extend them to a large class of structures that includes both graphs and hypergraphs. As evidence for the validity of our definitions, we prove a very general functoriality theorem that specializes, in the case of graphs, to a folkloric observation about the compatibility of positional and role analysis.</description>

      <title>Oracle-Based Multistep Strategy for Solving Polynomial Systems Over Finite Fields and Algebraic Cryptanalysis of the Aradi Cipher</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09950v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The multistep solving strategy consists in a divide-and-conquer approach: when a multivariate polynomial system is computationally infeasible to solve directly, one variable is assigned over the elements of the base finite field, and the procedure is recursively applied to the resulting simplified systems. In a previous work by the same authors (among others), this approach proved effective in the algebraic cryptanalysis of the Trivium cipher. In this paper, we present a new formulation of the corresponding algorithm based on a Depth-First Search strategy, along with a novel complexity analysis leveraging tree structures. We also introduce the notion of an ``oracle function'', which is intended to determine whether evaluating a new variable is required to simplify the current polynomial system. This notion allows us to unify all previously proposed variants of the multistep strategy, including the classical hybrid approach, by appropriately selecting the oracle function. Finally, we employ the multistep solving strategy in the cryptanalysis of the NSA's recently introduced low-latency block cipher Aradi, achieving a first full-round algebraic attack that exposes structural features in its symbolic model.</description>
