      <title>Non-perturbative correction on the black hole geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we use the holographic principle to obtain a modified metric of black holes that reproduces the exponentially corrected entropy. The exponential correction of the black hole entropy comes from non-perturbative corrections. It interprets as a quantum effect which affects black hole thermodynamics especially in the infinitesimal scales. Hence, it may affect black hole stability at the final stage. Then, we study modified thermodynamics due to the non-perturbative corrections and calculate thermodynamics quantities of several non-rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum sensitivities in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalar-tensor theories have a long history as possible phenomenological alternatives to General Relativity, but are known to potentially produce deviations from the (strong) equivalence principle in systems involving self-gravitating objects, as a result of the presence of an additional gravitational scalar field besides the tensor modes of General Relativity. We describe here a novel mechanism whereby the equivalence principle is violated for an isolated rotating neutron star, if the gravitational scalar field is changing in time far from the system. We show that the neutron star rotational period changes due to an effective coupling ("angular momentum sensitivity") to the gravitational scalar, and compute that coupling for viable equations of state for nuclear matter. We comment on the relevance of our findings for testing scalar-tensor theories and models of ultralight dark matter with pulsar timing observations, a topic that we tackle in a companion paper.</description>

      <title>Slowly rotating anisotropic relativistic stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to a study of the equilibrium configurations of slowly rotating anisotropic stars in the framework of general relativity. For that purpose, we provide the equations of structure where the rotation is treated to second order in the angular velocity. These equations extend those first derived by Hartle for slowly rotating isotropic stars. As an application of the new formalism, we study the rotational properties of Bowers-Liang fluid spheres. A result of particular interest is that the ellipticity and mass quadrupole moment are negative for certain highly anisotropic configurations, thus such systems are prolate rather than oblate. Furthermore, for configurations with high anisotropy, and compactness close to their critical value, quantities like the moment of inertia, change of mass, and mass quadrupole moment approach to the corresponding Kerr black hole values, similar to other ultracompact systems like sub-Buchdahl Schwarzschild stars and analytic rotating gravastars.</description>

      <title>Generic autonomous system approach to interacting dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore an autonomous system analysis of dark energy models with interactions between dark energy and cold dark matter in a general systematic approach to cosmological fluids. We investigate two types of models such as local and non-local ones. In particular, a local form of interaction is directly proportional to only the energy density, while a non-local interaction is directly proportional to the energy density as well as the Hubble parameter. As a consequence, it is explicitly demonstrated that in both cases there exist the stability points in terms of cosmological parameters. This work aims at obtaining acceleration and stability using interaction models without modifying the matter or geometric component of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Generalized free energy and thermodynamic phases of black holes in the gauged Kaluza-Klein theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of the generalized (off-shell) free energy, we explore the phase emergence and corresponding phase transitions of charged dilaton $\text{AdS}$ black holes in the gauged Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory where the KK vector field is gauged such that the fermionic fields are charged under the U(1)$_{\text{KK}}$ gauge group. The black hole solutions are asymptotic to the AdS$_D$ geometry and can be realized as the dimensional reduction of the gauged supergravities on the compact internal manifolds, leading to the restriction as $4\leq D\leq 7$. By studying the behavior of the generalized free energy under the change of the ensemble temperature, we determine the thermodynamic phases and the corresponding phase transitions of black holes. This is confirmed by investigating the heat capacity at the constant pressure and the on-shell free energy. In the canonical ensemble, the thermodynamics of black holes can be classified into three different classes as follows: (i) $D=4$, (ii) $D=5$, and (iii) $D=6,7$. Whereas, in the grand canonical ensemble, the thermodynamics of black holes is independent of the number of spacetime dimensions and the pressure, but depends on the chemical potential $\Phi$. The thermodynamic behavior of black holes can be classified into three different classes as follows: (i) $\Phi&lt;1$, (ii) $\Phi&gt;1$, and (iii) $\Phi=1$.</description>

      <title>Parameter Constraints on Traversable Wormholes within Beyond Horndeski Theories through Quasi-Periodic Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: {\it Hunting} compact astrophysical objects such as black holes and wormholes, as well as testing gravity theories, are important issues in relativistic astrophysics. In this sense, theoretical and observational studies of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in (micro)quasars become helpful in exploring their central object, which can be a black hole or a wormhole. In the present work, we study the throat properties of traversable wormholes beyond Horndeski theory. Also, we investigate the circular motion of test particles orbiting the wormhole. We analyze the test particle's effective potential and angular momentum for circular orbits. Frequencies of radial and vertical oscillations of the particles around stable circular orbits have also been studied and applied in explaining the quasiperiodic oscillations mechanism in the relativistic precession (RP) model. Finally, we obtain constraint values for the parameters of Horndeski gravity and the mass of the wormhole candidates using QPOs observed in the microquasars GRO J1655-40, GRS 1915+105 \&amp; XTE J1550-564 and at the center of Milky Way galaxy through Monte-Carlo-Markovian-Chain (MCMC) analyses.</description>

      <title>Radial perturbations of Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes in slow rotation up to second order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider slowly rotating Ellis-Bronnikov wormholes and investigate their radial perturbations ($\mathrm{l}=0$), expanding up to second order in rotation. We present the detailed derivations in the general case, including symmetric and non-symmetric wormholes. The calculations show that the unstable mode present in the static case becomes less unstable with increasing rotation, until it reaches zero and then disappears. This indicates that wormhole solutions may become linearly mode stable at sufficiently fast rotation.</description>

      <title>Regular Friedmann Universes and Matter Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a very simple procedure to construct non-singular cosmological models for flat Friedmann universes filled with minimally coupled scalar fields or by tachyon Born-Infeld-type fields. Remarkably, for the minimally coupled scalar field and the tachyon field, the regularity of the cosmological evolution, or in other words, the existence of bounce, implies the necessity of the transition between scalar fields with standard kinetic terms to those with phantom ones. In both cases, the potentials in the vicinity of the point of the transition have a non-analyticity of the cusp form that is characterized by the same exponent and is equal to 2/3. If, in the tachyon models evolution, the pressure changes its sign, then another transformation of the Born-Infeld-type field occurs: the tachyon transforms into a pseudotachyon, and vice versa. We also undertake an analysis of the stability of the cosmological evolution in our models; we rely on the study of the speed of sound squared.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a uniqueness theorem for the charged Nariai black holes and ultracold black holes in four dimensions. In particular, we show that an analytic solution to four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell theory with a positive cosmological constant containing a static extremal Killing horizon with spherical cross-sections of large radius (compared to the cosmological scale), must be locally isometric to the extremal Reissner-Nordstr\"om-de Sitter black hole or its near-horizon geometry. The theorem generalises to extremal static horizons with small radius, establishing uniqueness of cold black holes for generic values of the radius.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the near horizon structure of the extremal spacelike stretched black holes, exact solutions of topologically massive gravity. We show that the algebra of improved canonical generator is realized as a single centrally extended Virasoro algebra. We obtain the entropy of the solution by using the Cardy formula and compare the results with the corresponding non-extremal case.</description>

      <title>Inflation and reheating in quadratic metric-affine gravity with derivative couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of metric-affine theories of gravity, where both the metric and connection are treated as independent variables, we consider actions quadratic in the Ricci scalar curvature coupled non-minimally to a scalar field through derivative couplings. Our analysis delves into the inflationary predictions, revealing their consistency with the latest observational constraints across a wide range of parameters. This compatibility permits adjustments such as an increase in the spectral index and a reduction in the tensor-to-scalar ratio. While we do not propose a specific reheating mechanism, our analysis demonstrates that within the quadratic model of inflation, the maximum reheating temperature can reach $\sim 3\times10^{15}\, {\rm GeV}$.</description>

      <title>Negative pressure as a quantum effect in free-streaming in the cosmological background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of energy density and pressure of a free real scalar quantum field after its decoupling from a thermal bath in the spatially flat Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker space-time by solving the Klein-Gordon equation both analytically and numerically for different predetermined scale factor functions $a(t)$. The energy density and pressure, defined by subtracting the vacuum expectation values at the decoupling time, feature corrections with respect to the classical free-streaming solution of the relativistic Boltzmann equation. We show that if the expansion rate is comparable or larger than $mc^2/\hbar$ or $KT_0/\hbar$ where $m$ is the mass and $T_0$ the decoupling temperature, both energy density and pressure gets strong quantum corrections which substantially modify their classical dependence on the scale factor $a(t)$ and drive pressure to large negative values. For a minimally coupled field with a very low mass in an expanding de Sitter universe quantum corrections are dominant driving pressure and energy density to become asymptotically constant with an equation of state $p/\varepsilon \simeq -1$, thereby mimicking a cosmological constant. For a minimally coupled massless field, quantum corrections are asymptotically dominant for any accelerated expansion.</description>

      <title>Towards a Consistent Calculation of the Lunar Response to Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves (GWs) by lunar seismic measurement urges us to have a clear understanding of the response of the moon to passing GWs. In this paper, we clarify the relationship between two seemly different response functions which have been derived previously using two different methods, one taking the field-theory approach and the other using the tidal force induced by GWs. We revisit their derivation and prove, by both analytical arguments and numerical calculations, that the two response functions are equivalent. Their apparent difference can be attributed to the choice of different coordinates. Using the correct response function, we calculate the sensitivities (to GWs) of several designed lunar seismometers, and find that the sensitivity curves between $10^{-3}$ and $0.1$ Hz are much flatter than the previous calculations based on normal-mode model. Our results will help clarifying the scientific objectives of lunar GW observation, as well as provide important constraints on the design of lunar GW detectors.</description>

      <title>Scalarization of isolated black holes in scalar Gauss-Bonnet theory in the fixing-the-equations approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most promising avenues to perform numerical evolutions in theories beyond General Relativity is the fixing-the-equations approach, a proposal in which new ``driver'' equations are added to the evolution equations in a way that allows for stable numerical evolutions. In this direction, we extend the numerical relativity code SpECTRE to evolve a ``fixed'' version of scalar Gauss-Bonnet theory in the decoupling limit, a phenomenologically interesting theory that allows for hairy black hole solutions in vacuum. We focus on isolated black hole systems both with and without linear and angular momentum, and propose a new driver equation to improve the recovery of such stationary solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the latter by numerically evolving black holes that undergo spontaneous scalarization using different driver equations. Finally, we evaluate the accuracy of the obtained solutions by comparing with the original unaltered theory.</description>

      <title>A general framework for cyclic and fine-tuned causal models and their compatibility with space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12128v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causal modelling is a tool for generating causal explanations of observed correlations and has led to a deeper understanding of correlations in quantum networks. Existing frameworks for quantum causality tend to focus on acyclic causal structures that are not fine-tuned i.e., where causal connections between variables necessarily create correlations between them. However, fine-tuned causal models (which permit causation without correlation) play a crucial role in cryptography, and cyclic causal models can be used to model physical processes involving feedback and may also be relevant in exotic solutions of general relativity. Here we develop a causal modelling framework capable of dealing with these general scenarios. The key feature of our framework is that it allows operational and relativistic notions of causality to be independently defined and for connections between them to be established in a theory-independent manner. The framework first gives an operational way to study causation that allows for cyclic, fine-tuned and non-classical causal influences. We then consider how a causal model can be embedded in a space-time structure (modelled as a partial order) and propose a compatibility condition for ensuring that the embedded causal model does not allow signalling outside the space-time future. We identify several distinct classes of causal loops that can arise in our framework, showing that compatibility with a space-time can rule out only some of them. We discuss conditions for preventing superluminal signalling within arbitrary (and possibly cyclic) causal structures and consider models of causation in post-quantum theories admitting so-called jamming correlations. Finally, this work introduces the concept of a "higher-order affects relation", which is useful for causal discovery in fined-tuned causal models.</description>

      <title>Impossibility of superluminal signalling in Minkowski space-time does not rule out causal loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.12887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.12887v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Causality is fundamental to science, but it appears in several different forms. One is relativistic causality, which is tied to a space-time structure and forbids signalling outside the future. A second is an operational notion of causation that considers the flow of information between physical systems and interventions on them. In [Vilasini and Colbeck, Phys. Rev. A. 106, 032204 (2022)], we propose a framework for characterising when a causal model can coexist with relativistic principles such as no superluminal signalling, while allowing for cyclic and non-classical causal influences and the possibility of causation without signalling. In a theory without superluminal causation, both superluminal signalling and causal loops are not possible in Minkowski space-time. Here we demonstrate that if we only forbid superluminal signalling, superluminal causation remains possible and show the mathematical possibility of causal loops that can be embedded in a Minkowski space-time without leading to superluminal signalling. The existence of such loops in the given space-time could in principle be operationally verified using interventions. This establishes that the physical principle of no superluminal signalling is not by itself sufficient to rule out causal loops between Minkowski space-time events. Interestingly, the conditions required to rule out causal loops in a space-time depend on the dimension. Whether such loops are possible in three spatial dimensions remains an important open question.</description>

      <title>An Improved Framework for Computing Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We combine the observable-based formalism (KMOC), the analytic properties of the scattering amplitude, generalised unitarity and the heavy-mass expansion with a newly introduced IBP reduction for Fourier integrals, to provide an efficient framework for computing scattering waveforms. We apply this framework to the scattering of two charged massive bodies in classical electrodynamics. Our work paves the way for the computation of the analytic one-loop waveform in General Relativity.</description>

      <title>On harvesting physical predictions from asymptotically safe quantum field theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>

      <title>Effect of Earth's Oblateness on Black Hole Imaging Through Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth-based Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) has made rapid advances in imaging black holes. However, due to the limitations imposed on terrestrial VLBI by the Earth's finite size and turbulent atmosphere, it is imperative to have a space-based component in future VLBI missions. Herein, this paper investigates the effect of Earth's oblateness, also known as the $J_{2}$ effect, on orbiters in Earth-Space and Space-Space VLBI. The paper provides an extensive discussion on how the $J_{2}$ effect can directly impact orbit selection for black hole observations and how through informed choices of orbital parameters, the effect can be used to the mission's advantage, a fact that has not been addressed in existing space-VLBI investigations. We provide a comprehensive study of how the orbital parameters of several current space VLBI proposals will vary specifically due to the $J_{2}$ effect. For black hole accretion flow targets of interest, we have demonstrated how the $J_{2}$ effect leads to modest increase in shorter baseline coverage, filling gaps in the $(u,v)$ plane. Subsequently, we construct a simple analytical formalism that allows isolation of the impact of the $J_{2}$ effect on the $(u,v)$ plane without requiring computationally intensive orbit propagation simulations. By directly constructing $(u,v)$ coverage using the $J_{2}$ affected and invariant equations of motion, we obtain distinct coverage patterns for M87* and SgrA* that show extremely dense coverage on short baselines as well as long term orbital stability on longer baselines.</description>

      <title>GR as a classical spin-2 theory?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The self-interaction spin-2 approach to general relativity (GR) has been extremely influential in the particle physics community. Leaving no doubt regarding its heuristic value, we argue that a view of the metric field of GR as nothing but a stand-in for a self-coupling field in flat spacetime runs into a dilemma: either the view is physically incomplete in so far as it requires recourse to GR after all, or it leads to an absurd multiplication of alternative viewpoints on GR rendering any understanding of the metric field as nothing but a spin-2 field in flat spacetime unjustified.</description>

      <title>The neutron decay anomaly, neutron stars and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discrepancies in different measurements of the lifetime of isolated neutrons could be resolved by considering an extra neutron decay channel into dark matter, with a branching ratio of the order of $O(1$\%). Although the decay channel into a dark fermion $\chi$ plus visible matter has been already experimentally excluded, a dark decay with either a scalar or dark photon remains still a possibility. In particular, a model with a fermion mass $m_\chi\approx 1$ GeV and a scalar $m_\phi \approx O(\rm{MeV})$ could provide not only the required branching ratio to explain the anomaly but also a good dark matter (DM) candidate with the right thermal abundance today. Although the interaction DM-neutron will affect the formation of neutron stars, the combined effect of the dark matter self-interactions mediated by the light scalar and an effective repulsive interaction with the neutrons induced by the scalar-Higgs coupling would allow heavy enough neutron stars. The combined constraints from neutron lifetime, dark matter abundance, neutron star and Higgs physics, and Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, restrict the light scalar mass to the range $2 m_e &lt; m_\phi &lt; 2 m_e + 0.0375$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Axi-majoron for almost everything</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08675v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The details of the minimal cosmological standard model (MCSM) proposed in Ref. [1] are discussed. The model is based on the scale-symmetry and the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry with a key assumption that the latter is broken only in the gravity sector in a scale-invariant manner. We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong CP-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous non-perturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Iso-curvature perturbations of axi-majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either inflationary Affleck-Dine mechanism or spontaneous leptogenesis thanks to the PQ-number asymmetry, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter can be purely cold axi-majorons from the mis-alignment contribution only with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves are expected to have information about some masse parameters of the left-handed and the right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by at least a long-lived right-handed neutrino species.</description>

      <title>On the non-perturbative bulk Hilbert space of JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What is the bulk Hilbert space of quantum gravity? In this paper, we resolve this problem in 2d JT gravity, both with and without matter, providing the first example of an explicit definition of a non-perturbative Hilbert space specified in terms of metric variables. The states are wavefunctions of the length and matter state, but with a non-trivial and highly degenerate inner product. We explicitly identify the null states, and discuss their importance for defining operators non-perturbatively. To highlight the power of the formalism we developed, we study the non-perturbative effects for two bulk linear operators that may serve as proxies for the experience of an observer falling into a two-sided black hole: one captures the length of an Einstein-Rosen bridge and the other captures the center-of-mass collision energy between two particles falling from opposite sides. We track the behavior of these operators up to times of order $e^{S_\text{BH}}$, at which point the wavefunction spreads to the complete set of eigenstates of these operators. If these observables are indeed good proxies for the experience of an infalling observer, our results indicate an O(1) probability of detecting a firewall at late times that is self-averaging and universal.</description>

      <title>About the (in)equivalence between holonomic versus non-holonomic theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.05721v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the scenarios in which a holonomic versus a non-holonomic frame description of gravity theories are equivalent. It turns out that classically, the equivalence holds in a way that is independent of the particular dynamics and/or spacetime dimension. This includes general metric-affine dynamics. A global bundle-theoretical investigation is carried out, uncovering the equivalence principle as the culprit. The equivalence holds as long as the equivalence principle holds. This is not something to be expected when non-invertible configurations of the vielbein field are taken into account. In such case, the gauge-theoretical description of gravity unsolders from spacetime, and one has to decide if gravity is spacetime geometry or an internal gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Second-order cosmological perturbations produced by scalar-scalar coupling during inflation stage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08261v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the perturbations up to the 2nd-order for a power-law inflation driven by a scalar field in synchronous coordinates. We present the 1st-order solutions, and analytically solve the 2nd-order perturbed Einstein equation and scalar field equation, give the 2nd-order solutions for all the scalar, vector, and tensor metric perturbations, as well as the perturbed scalar field. During inflation, the 1st-order tensor perturbation is a wave and is decoupled from other perturbations, the scalar metric perturbation and the perturbed scalar field are coupled waves, propagating at the speed of light, differing from those in the dust and relativistic fluid models. The 1st-order vector perturbation is not wave and just decreases during inflation. The 2nd-order perturbed Einstein equation is similar in structure to the 1st-order one, but various products of the 1st-order perturbations occur as the effective source, among which the scalar-scalar coupling is considered in this paper. The solutions of all the 2nd-order perturbations consist of a homogeneous part similar to the 1st-order solutions, and an inhomogeneous part in a form of integrations of the effective source. The 2nd-order vector perturbation is also a wave since the effective source is composed of the 1st-order waves. We perform the residual gauge transformations between synchronous coordinates up to the 2nd-order, and identify the 1st-order and 2nd-order gauge modes.</description>

      <title>Non-Singular Gravitational Collapse through Modified Heisenberg Algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of cut-off physics, in the form of a modified algebra inspired by Polymer Quantum Mechanics and by the Generalized Uncertainty Principle representation, on the collapse of a spherical dust cloud. We analyze both the Newtonian formulation, originally developed by Hunter, and the general relativistic formulation, that is the Oppenheimer-Snyder model; in both frameworks we find that the collapse is stabilized to an asymptotically static state above the horizon, and the singularity is removed. In the Newtonian case, by requiring the Newtonian approximation to be valid, we find lower bounds of the order of unity (in Planck units) for the deformation parameter of the modified algebra. We then study the behaviour of small perturbations on the non-singular collapsing backgrounds, and find that for certain range of the parameters (the polytropic index for the Newtonian case and the sound velocity in the relativistic setting) the collapse is stable to perturbations of all scales, and the non-singular super-Schwarzschild configurations have physical meaning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08127v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit and improve the analytic study arXiv:1804.03462 of spherically symmetric but dynamical black holes in Einstein's gravity coupled to a real scalar field. We introduce a series expansion in a small parameter $\epsilon$ that implements slow time dependence. At the leading order, the generic solution is a quasi-stationary Schwarzschild-de Sitter (SdS) metric, i.e. one where time-dependence enters only through the mass and cosmological constant parameters of SdS. The two coupled ODEs describing the leading order time dependence are solved up to quadrature for an arbitrary scalar potential. Higher order corrections can be consistently computed, as we show by explicitly solving the Einstein equations at the next to leading order as well. We comment on how the quasi-stationary expansion we introduce here is equivalent to the non-relativistic $1/c$ expansion.</description>

Abstract: In view of recent interest in high-frequency detectors, broad features of gravitational wave signals from phase transitions taking place soon after inflation are summarized. The influence of the matter domination era that follows the slow-roll stage is quantified in terms of two equilibration rates. Turning to the highest-frequency part of the spectrum, we show how it is constrained by the fact that the bubble distance scale must exceed the mean free path.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.05284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a topological gauge theory with underlying Cartan geometry $G/H$ and principal $H$-bundle. The topological action is constructed as a linear combination of the Euler and Pontrjagin numbers coming from entries of the curvature $\bar{\Omega}$ of a Cartan connection.
  As an example we show that for $G = SO(4,1)$ (respectively $SO(3,2)$) for $\Lambda_0 &gt; 0$, (respectively $\Lambda_0 &lt; 0$) and $H=SO(3,1)$, a very particular linear combination yields the Holst + Euler and Pontrjagin of the curvature $R$ of the spin connection + Nieh-Yan + bare cosmological constant $\Lambda_0$ terms. Additionally, in this construction, the coupling constants of these different terms are inherently linked together.
  The other example treated is the one of the M\"obius group $G= SO(4,2) /\{\pm I\}$ and $H = CO(4,2) \ltimes \mathbb{R}^{3,1}$. By considering a constraint on the "pair of frames" $(\alpha,\beta)$ we retrieve an action comprising all terms compatible with diffeomorphism invariance and local Lorentz invariance described in the previous example + kinetic term for a scalar field $+$ an interaction of that scalar field with the Torsion $T$, the scalar field being related to dilation.
  Finally, in both examples, we study the equations of motion associated to the total (Gauge + Matter) action. It is especially shown that one of the solutions in the M\"obius case consists of Einstein's equations modified by the Holst and Nieh-Yan terms with an additional source term for curvature depending on specific variations of spin density of matter.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notions of static regular of type (I) and type (II) and show that they are sufficient conditions for local well-posedness of solving asymptotically flat, static vacuum metrics with prescribed Bartnik boundary data. We then show that hypersurfaces in a very general open and dense family of hypersurfaces are static regular of type (II). As applications, we confirm Bartnik's static vacuum extension conjecture for a large class of Bartnik boundary data, including those that can be far from Euclidean and have large ADM masses, and give many new examples of static vacuum metrics with intriguing geometry.</description>

      <title>The Penrose Inequality as a Constraint on the Low Energy Limit of Quantum Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.00013v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct initial data violating the Anti-deSitter Penrose inequality using scalars with various potentials. Since a version of the Penrose inequality can be derived from AdS/CFT, we argue that it is a new swampland condition, ruling out holographic UV completion for theories that violate it. We produce exclusion plots on scalar couplings violating the inequality, and we find no violations for potentials from string theory. In the special case where the dominant energy condition holds, we use GR techniques to prove the AdS Penrose inequality in all dimensions, assuming spherical, planar, or hyperbolic symmetry. However, our violations show that this result cannot be generically true with only the null energy condition, and we give an analytic sufficient condition for violation of the Penrose inequality, constraining couplings of scalar potentials. Like the Breitenlohner-Freedman bound, this gives a necessary condition for the stability of AdS.</description>

Abstract: We study the space and properties of global and local observables for radiation emitted in the scattering of a massive scalar field in gauge and gravitational plane-wave backgrounds, in both the quantum and classical theory. We first compute the radiated momentum and angular momentum flow, demonstrating that they are good local observables determined by the amplitude and phase of the waveform. We then focus on the corresponding global observables, which in the gravitational case requires dealing with the collinear divergence of the gravitational Compton cross-section. We show using the KLN theorem that we can obtain an infrared-finite cross-section only by summing over forward scattering diagrams; this suggests dressing the initial state in the direction collinear to the plane wave in order to be able to compute observables integrated over the celestial sphere. Finally, we explore the high-energy behaviour of our observables. We find that classical global observables generically exhibit a power-law mass divergence in electrodynamics and a logarithmic mass divergence in gravity, even when radiation reaction is included. We then show explicitly how this is consistently resolved in the full quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Constraining dark energy cosmologies with spatial curvature using Supernovae JWST forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12292v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological tensions, in particular, to infer the local value of the Hubble constant $H_0$, have developed new independent techniques to constrain cosmological parameters in several cosmologies. Moreover, even when the concordance Cosmological Constant Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model has been well constrained with local observables, its physics has shown deviations from a flat background. Therefore, to explore a possible deviation from a flat $\Lambda$CDM model that could explain the $H_0$ value in tension with other techniques, in this paper we study new cosmological constraints in spatial curvature dark energy models. Additionally, to standard current Supernovae Type Ia (SNIa) catalogs, we extend the empirical distance ladder method through an SNIa sample using the capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to forecast SNIa up to $z \sim 6$, with information on the star formation rates at high redshift. Furthermore, we found that our constraints provide an improvement in the statistics associated with $\Omega_{m}$ when combining SNIa Pantheon and SNIa Pantheon+ catalogs with JW forecasting data.</description>

      <title>Prospects for Taiji to detect a gravitational-wave background from cosmic strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations have presented compelling evidence for a stochastic signal at nanohertz frequencies, potentially originating from cosmic strings. Cosmic strings are linear topological defects that can arise during phase transitions in the early Universe or as fundamental strings in superstring theory. This paper focuses on investigating the detection capabilities of Taiji, a planned space-based gravitational wave detector, for the gravitational wave background generated by cosmic strings. By analyzing simulated Taiji data and utilizing comprehensive Bayesian parameter estimation techniques, we demonstrate a significant improvement in precision compared to the NANOGrav 15-year data, surpassing it by an order of magnitude. This highlights the enhanced measurement capabilities of Taiji. Consequently, Taiji can serve as a valuable complementary tool to pulsar timing arrays in validating and exploring the physics of cosmic strings in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Particle detector models from path integrals of localized quantum fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16083v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Schwinger-Keldysh path integral, we draw a connection between localized quantum field theories and more commonly used models of local probes in Relativistic Quantum Information (RQI). By integrating over and then tracing out the inaccessible modes of the localized field being used as a probe, we show that, at leading order in perturbation theory, the dynamics of any finite number of modes of the probe field is exactly that of a finite number of harmonic-oscillator Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detectors. The equivalence is valid for a rather general class of input states of the probe-target field system, as well as for any arbitrary number of modes included as detectors. The path integral also provides a closed-form expression which gives us a systematic way of obtaining the corrections to the UDW model at higher orders in perturbation theory due to the existence of the additional modes that have been traced out. This approach vindicates and extends a recently proposed bridge between detector-based and field-theory-based measurement frameworks for quantum field theory [T. R. Perche et al., Particle detectors from localized quantum field theories, Phys. Rev. D 109, 045013 (2024)], and also points to potential connections between particle detector models in RQI and other areas of physics where path integral methods are more commonplace -- in particular, the Wilsonian approach to the renormalization group and effective field theories.</description>

      <title>(Multi-field) Natural Inflation and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00741v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a detailed study of natural inflation with a periodic non-minimal coupling, which is a well-motivated inflationary model that admits an explicit UV completion. We demonstrate that this construction can satisfy the most recent observational constraints from Planck and the BICEP/Keck collaborations. We also compute the corresponding relic gravitational wave background due to tensor perturbations and show that future space-borne interferometers, such as DECIGO, BBO and ALIA, may be able to detect it. Next, we extend this analysis and establish the validity of these results in a multi-field model featuring an additional $R^2$ term in the action, which allows us to interpolate between natural and scalaron (a.k.a.~Starobinsky) inflation. We investigate the conditions under which the aforementioned future interferometers will have the capability to differentiate between pure natural inflation and natural-scalaron inflation. The latter analysis could open the door to distinguishing between single-field and multi-field inflation through gravitational wave observations in more general contexts.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Bound Waveforms from Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the aim of computing bound waveforms from scattering amplitudes, we explore gravitational two-body dynamics using the Schwinger-Dyson equations and Bethe-Salpeter recursion. We show that the tree-level scattering waveform admits a natural analytic continuation, in rapidity, to the bound waveform, which we confirm from an independent calculation, in the Post-Newtonian expansion, of the time-domain multipoles at large eccentricity. We demonstrate consistency of this scattering-to-bound map with the Damour-Deruelle prescription for orbital elements in the quasi-Keplerian parametrization (which enters into the evaluation of the multipoles) and with the analytic continuation, in the binding energy, of radiated energy and angular momentum at 3PM.</description>
