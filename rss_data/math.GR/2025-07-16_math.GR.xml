      <title>Orders of commutators and Products of conjugacy classes in finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group, let $x\in G$ and let $p$ be a prime. We prove that the commutator $[x,g]$ is a $p$-element for every $g\in G$ if and only if $x$ is central modulo $O_p(G),$ where $O_p(G)$ denotes the largest normal $p$-subgroup of $G$. This result simultaneously generalizes some variants of both the Baer-Suzuki theorem and Glauberman's $Z_p^*$-theorem. Furthermore, we show that if $x\in G$ is a $p$-element and there exists an integer $m\ge 1$ such that for all $g\in G$, either $[x,g]=1$ or the order of $[x,g] $ is $m$ for every $g\in G$, then the subgroup generated by the conjugacy class of $G$ containing $x$ is solvable. As an application, we confirm a conjecture of Beltr\'an, Felipe and Melchor, which states that if $K$ is a conjugacy class of $G$ such that the product $K^{-1}K=1\cup D\cup D^{-1}$ for some conjugacy class $D$ of $G$, then the subgroup generated by $K$ is solvable.</description>

Abstract: We study the restriction of the absolute order on a Coxeter group $W$ to an interval $[1,w]_T$, where $w\in W$ is an involution. We characterize and classify those involutions $w$ for which $[1,w]_T$ is a lattice, using the notion of involutive parabolic subgroups.</description>

      <title>Bassian-Finite Abelian Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new class of Abelian groups which lies strictly between the classes of co-Hopfian groups and Dedekind-finite groups, calling these groups {\it Bassian-finite}. We prove the surprising fact that in the torsion case the Bassian-finite property coincides with the co-Hopficity, thus extending a recent result by Chekhlov-Danchev-Keef in Siber. Math. J. (2026), and we construct a torsion-free Bassian-finite group which is {\it not} co-Hopfian as well as a Dedekind-finite group which is {\it not} Bassian-finite. Some other closely relevant things are also established. E.g., we extend a construction of a countable Butler group that is {\it not} completely decomposable, due to Arnold-Rangaswamy in Boll. Un. Mat. Ital. (2007), to find a Butler group of countably infinite rank which is Bassian-finite, but {\it not} completely decomposable.</description>

      <title>The existence of suitable sets in locally compact strongly topological gyrogroups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of a topological gyrogroup $G$ is said to be a {\it suitable set} for $G$ if the identity element $0$ is the unique accumulation point of $S$ and $\langle S\rangle$ is dense in $G$. In this paper, it is proved that every locally compact strongly topological gyrogroup has a suitable set, which gives an affirmative answer to a question posed by F. Lin, et al. in \cite{key14}.</description>

      <title>Strongly topologically orderable gyrogroups with a suitable set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A discrete subset $S$ of a topologically gyrogroup $G$ is called a {\it suitable set} for $G$ if $S\cup \{1\}$ is closed and the subgyrogroup generated by $S$ is dense in $G$, where $1$ is the identity element of $G$. In this paper, we mainly prove that every strongly topologically orderable gyrogroup is either metrizable or has a totally ordered local base $\mathcal{H}$ at the identity element, consisting of clopen $L$-gyrosubgroups, such that $gyr[x, y](H)=H$ for any $x, y\in G$ and $H\in \mathcal{H}$. Moreover, we prove that every strongly topologically orderable gyrogroup is hereditarily paracompact. Furthermore, we show that every locally compact or not totally disconnected strongly topologically orderable gyrogroup contains a suitable set. Finally, we prove that if a strongly topologically orderable gyrogroup has a (closed) suitable set, then its dense subgyrogroup also has a (closed) suitable set.</description>

      <title>Closed Form Time Derivatives of the Equations of Motion of Rigid Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.11076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derivatives of equations of motion(EOM) describing the dynamics of rigid body systems are becoming increasingly relevant for the robotics community and find many applications in design and control of robotic systems. Controlling robots, and multibody systems comprising elastic components in particular, not only requires smooth trajectories but also the time derivatives of the control forces/torques, hence of the EOM. This paper presents the time derivatives of the EOM in closed form up to second-order as an alternative formulation to the existing recursive algorithms for this purpose, which provides a direct insight into the structure of the derivatives. The Lie group formulation for rigid body systems is used giving rise to very compact and easily parameterized equations.</description>

      <title>Normal covering numbers for $S_n$ and $A_n$ and additive combinatorics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The normal covering number $\gamma(G)$ of a finite group $G$ is the minimum number of proper subgroups whose conjugates cover the group. We give various estimates for $\gamma(S_n)$ and $\gamma(A_n)$ depending on the arithmetic structure of $n$. In particular we determine the limsups over $\gamma(S_n) / n$ and $\gamma(A_n) / n$ over the sequences of even and odd integers, as well as the liminf of $\gamma(S_n) / n$ over even integers. In general we explain how the values of $\gamma(S_n) / n$ and $\gamma(A_n) / n$ are related to problems in additive combinatorics. These results answer most of the questions posed by Bubboloni, Praeger, and Spiga as Problem 20.17 of the Kourovka Notebook.</description>

      <title>Canonical Join Representations and Join-irreducible elements of Garside shadows in Coxeter groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22599v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish some combinatorial properties of elements in Coxeter groups. Firstly, we generalise Reading's theorem on the canonical join representations of elements in finite Coxeter groups to all Coxeter groups. Secondly, we show that for any element $x$ in a Coxeter group $W$ and root $\beta$ in its inversion set $\Phi(x)$, the set of elements $y \in W$ satisfying $\Phi(y) \cap \Phi(x) = \{ \beta \} $ is convex in the weak order and admits a unique minimal representative. This is strongly connected to determining the cone type of the inverse of $x$ and leads to efficient computational methods to determine whether arbitrary elements of $W$ have the same cone type. We also give a characterisation of the join-irreducible elements of two important classes of Garside shadows in Coxeter groups. Finally, we apply our results to explicitly describe the set of ultra-low elements in various families of Coxeter groups, thereby verifying a conjecture of Parkinson and the author for these groups. We give explicit descriptions and counts of the join-irreducible elements of the minimal Garside shadow in these cases.</description>

      <title>On groups with square-free gcd of character degree and codegree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a finite group and $\chi$ be an irreducible character of $G$. The codegree of $\chi$ is defined as $\chi^c(1) =\frac{|G: \ker\chi|}{\chi(1)}$. In a paper by Gao, Wang, and Chen, it was shown that $G$ cannot satisfy the condition that $\gcd(\chi(1),\chi^c(1))$ is prime for all $\chi\in\text{Irr}(G)^\#$. We generalize this theorem by solving one of Guohua Qian's unsolved problems on character codegrees. Qian inquires about the structure of non-solvable finite groups with square-free $\gcd$ instead. We prove that if $G$ is such that $\gcd(\chi(1),\chi^c(1))$ is square-free for every irreducible character $\chi$, then $G/\text{Sol}(G)$ is isomorphic to one among a particular list of almost simple groups.</description>

      <title>On bireversible automata and commensurators of groups in automorphisms of their Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $G$ is a finitely generated group and $X$ is a Cayley graph of $G$, denote by $\mathcal{C}_1^X(G)$ the subgroup of all automorphisms of $X$ commensurating $G$ and fixing the vertex corresponding to the identity. Building on the work of Macedo\'{n}ska, Nekrashevych and Sushchansky, we observe that $\mathcal{C}_1^X(G)$ can be expressed as a directed union of groups generated by bireversible automata. We use this to to show that every cyclic subgroup of $\mathcal{C}_1^X(G)$ is undistorted and to obtain a necessary condition on $G$ for $\mathcal{C}_1^X(G)$ not to be locally finite. As a consequence, we prove that several families of groups cannot be generated by bireversible automata and show that the set of groups generated by bireversible automata is strictly contained in the set of groups generated by invertible and reversible automata.</description>

      <title>Finite Groups of Symplectic Automorphisms of Supersingular K3 surfaces in Odd Characteristics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14499v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2009, Dolgachev-Keum showed that finite groups of tame symplectic automorphisms of K3 surfaces in positive characteristics are subgroups of the Mathieu group of degree 23. In this paper, we utilize lattice-theoretic methods to investigate symplectic actions of finite groups G on K3 surfaces in odd characteristics. For supersingular K3 surfaces with Artin invariants at least two, we develop a new machinery called p-root pairs to constrain possible symplectic finite group actions (without the assumption of tameness). The concept of p-root pair is closely related to root systems and Weyl groups. In particular, we provide alternative proof for many results by Dolgachev-Keum and give an upper bound for the exponent of p in |G|.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01806v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that orbit equivalence relations arising from essentially free ergodic probability measure preserving actions of Zariski dense discrete subgroups of simple algebraic groups are strongly prime. As a consequence, we prove the existence and the uniqueness of a prime factorization for orbit equivalence relations arising from direct products of higher rank lattices. This extends and strengthens Zimmer's primeness result for equivalence relations arising from actions of lattices in simple Lie groups. The proof of our main result relies on a combination of ergodic theory of algebraic group actions and Popa's intertwining theory for equivalence relations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain an operator algebraic characterization of the noncommutative Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $\operatorname{L}(\Gamma) \subset \operatorname{L}(\Gamma \curvearrowright B)$ associated with an admissible probability measure $\mu \in \operatorname{Prob}(\Gamma)$ for which the $(\Gamma, \mu)$-Furstenberg-Poisson boundary $(B, \nu_B)$ is uniquely $\mu$-stationary. This is a noncommutative generalization of Nevo-Sageev's structure theorem [NS11]. We apply this result in combination with previous works to provide further evidence towards Connes' rigidity conjecture for higher rank lattices.</description>

      <title>Good involutions of conjugation subquandles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08090v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Posed by Taniguchi, the classification of quandles with good involutions is a difficult question with applications to surface-knot theory. We address this question for subquandles of conjugation quandles, including all core quandles. We also study good involutions of faithful racks. In particular, we obtain sharp bounds on the number of good involutions of racks in these families.
  As an application of our results, we implement group-theoretic algorithms that compute all good involutions of conjugation quandles and core quandles; we provide data for those up to order 23. As another application, we construct infinite families of connected, noninvolutive symmetric quandles.
  We also classify symmetric and Legendrian racks, quandles, and kei up to order 8 using a computer search. Finally, we exhibit an equivalence of categories between racks and Legendrian racks that induces an equivalence between involutory racks, Legendrian kei, and symmetric kei.</description>
