      <title>The haloes that reionized the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the reionization of the Universe due to haloes that host galaxies undergoing bursts of star formation. By comparing the recent results from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) with the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation EAGLE at $z\ge 6$, we find that bursty galaxies have specific star formation rate, sSFR $&gt;10^{-2}$ Myr$^{-1}$, and magnitude, $M_{\rm UV}\leq -17$. Most of them reside in haloes of mass $\sim 10^9$ M$_\odot$ and some in more massive haloes. We then construct the models of escape fraction and find that a skewed Gaussian function with a flat tail towards the high mass end best describes the mean dependence of escape fraction on halo mass, considering the haloes hosting bursty galaxies as the primary drivers of reionization. We implement the models of escape fraction in the code 21cmFAST to study the progress of reionization and derive the evolution of the mean ionized fraction that agrees well with observations. We also calculate the brightness temperature, spin temperature, and kinetic temperature and further study the spatial fluctuations in these quantities to gain insights into the progress of reionization. We compute the 21 cm power spectrum and predict a peak in power at $180$ MHz corresponding to redshift, $z\approx6.8$, that is testable by the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA). Our findings suggest that the Universe was reionized by the haloes of $\sim 10^{9}$ M$_\odot$, with haloes more massive than that also provided an essential contribution.</description>

      <title>LASY: LAser manipulations made eaSY</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using realistic laser profiles for simulations of laser-plasma interaction is critical to reproduce experimental measurements, but the interface between experiments and simulations can be challenging. Similarly, start-to-end simulations with different codes may require error-prone manipulations to convert between different representations of a laser pulse. In this work, we propose LASY, an open-source Python library to simplify these workflows. Developed through an international collaboration between experimental, theoretical and computational physicists, LASY can be used to initialize a laser profile from an experimental measurement, from a simulation, or from analytics, manipulate it, and write it into a file in compliance with the openPMD standard. This profile can then be used as an input of a simulation code.</description>

      <title>Microscopic derivation of the thin film equation using the Mori-Zwanzig formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12253v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hydrodynamics of thin films is typically described using phenomenological models whose connection to the microscopic particle dynamics is a subject of ongoing research. Existing methods based on density functional theory provide a good description of static thin films, but are not sufficient for understanding nonequilibrium dynamics. In this work, we present a microscopic derivation of the thin film equation using the Mori-Zwanzig projection operator formalism. This method allows to directly obtain the correct gradient dynamics structure along with microscopic expressions for the mobility and the free energy. Our results are verified against molecular dynamics simulations for both simple fluids and polymers.</description>

      <title>Role of Helium Bubbles and Voids on the Property of Nanocrystalline Tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript embarks on an inquiry into the influence of helium implantation on nanocrystalline tungsten, a contender for plasma-facing components (PFCs) in nuclear fusion reactors. The study underscores the inevitability of helium retention in tungsten due to the anticipated high flux of helium atoms from D-T fusion reactions in future reactors such as ITER and DEMO. This retention, potentially culminating in surface blistering and grain boundary embrittlement, propels an investigation into the helium's preferential substitutional configuration over interstitial within tungsten's lattice, leading to cavity and bubble formation. Atomistic tensile testing simulations, exploiting a helium-specific interatomic potential, dissect the ramifications of helium concentration and voids on tungsten's mechanical properties across grain sizes of 10nm and 15nm. The presence of helium at grain boundaries instigates detachment, influencing structural behaviors under strain. Notably, the study reveals a dichotomy in helium's effect: benign at concentrations up to the critical point, beyond which significant embrittlement and elastic softening occur, corroborating with theoretical predictions on helium-induced grain boundary embrittlement. This nuanced exploration delineates the intricate dance between helium implantation levels, grain size, and the ensuing mechanical property alterations in nanocrystalline tungsten, casting light on its viability and endurance as a PFC material under the rigorous conditions forecasted in fusion reactors.</description>

      <title>Primary Defect Production in Doped Iron Grain Boundaries during Low Energy Collision Cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the intricate interactions between grain boundaries (GBs) and irradiation-induced defects in nanocrystalline iron, highlighting the role of dopants like copper. Utilizing molecular dynamics simulations, the research delineates how GB properties, such as GB energy and defect formation energies, influence the formation and evolution of defects in low energy collision cascades. It reveals that GBs not only augment defect production but also show a marked preference for interstitials over vacancies, a behavior significantly modulated by the cascade's proximity to the GB. The presence of dopants is shown to alter GB properties, affecting both the rate and type of defect production, thereby underscoring the complex interplay between GB characteristics, dopant elements, and defect dynamics. Moreover, the investigation uncovers that the structural characteristics of GBs play a crucial role in cascade evolution and defect generation, with certain GB configurations undergoing reconfiguration in response to cascades. For instance, the reconfiguration of one pure Fe twist GB suggests that GB geometry can significantly influence defect generation mechanisms. These findings point to the potential of GB engineering in developing materials with enhanced radiation tolerance, advocating for a nuanced approach to material design. By tailoring GB properties and selectively introducing dopant elements, materials can be optimized to exhibit superior resistance to radiation-induced damage, offering insights for applications in nuclear reactors and other radiation-prone environments.</description>

      <title>The Role of Temperature on Irradiation Defect Evolution near Surfaces and Grain Boundaries in Tungsten</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the impact of temperature on defect dynamics in tungsten, emphasizing its application in nuclear fusion reactors as Plasma Facing Components (PFCs). Through atomistic simulations, the research elucidates the intricate interplay of defect production, annihilation, and redistribution under irradiation at room (300K) and elevated temperatures (1000K). It demonstrates that higher temperatures significantly increase the number and mobility of defects, leading to a substantial rise in the total number of surviving Frenkel Pairs (FPs), with a notable preference for surface distribution. This redistribution is attributed to energy gradient-driven relocation processes, enhanced by the defects' increased mobility at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the study reveals that elevated temperatures promote biased accumulation of interstitial defects in grain boundaries, especially in configurations that facilitate efficient interstitial migration, indicating a strategy for minimizing lattice interstitial accumulation under irradiation. These findings underscore the critical role of temperature in modulating irradiation-induced defect dynamics in tungsten, providing valuable insights for designing and selecting materials with optimized irradiation resistance for use in extreme conditions of nuclear fusion reactors. The research suggests a material design approach that accounts for temperature effects to enhance the durability and performance of nuclear fusion materials.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Defect Production during Successive Displacement Cascades on a Tungsten Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12261v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study delves into the complex mechanisms of defect production and accumulation in nanocrystalline tungsten under irradiation, with a particular focus on the interplay between grain boundaries and free surfaces. Through molecular dynamics simulations, the research explores how grain boundaries act as sinks for irradiation-induced defects, a critical aspect in designing nanomaterials with enhanced radiation tolerance. The investigation leverages a novel Modified Wigner-Seitz Analysis to accurately quantify defect trends amidst dynamic surface reconstruction, providing a nuanced understanding of defect distribution in response to irradiation. This methodology underscores the intricate relationship between defect dynamics and the nano-scale structure of materials, specifically highlighting the role of interfaces in mediating these dynamics. The findings reveal a complex balance between defect production, surface interactions, and the influence of pre-existing defects and temperature on the primary defect production process. Surfaces are shown to amplify defect production due to biased accumulation of interstitials, alongside suppressed defect recombination, emphasizing the nuanced nature of defect dynamics in irradiated materials. This research contributes significantly to the fundamental understanding of defect formation and evolution in irradiated tungsten, offering insights that are instrumental in the development of nanomaterials poised for applications in extreme irradiation environments, such as fusion reactors, thereby advancing the field of materials science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Fast and accurate nonadiabatic molecular dynamics enabled through variational interpolation of correlated electron wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We build on the concept of eigenvector continuation to develop an efficient multi-state method for the rigorous and smooth interpolation of a small training set of many-body wavefunctions through chemical space at mean-field cost. The inferred states are represented as variationally optimal linear combinations of the training states transferred between the many-body basis of different nuclear geometries. We show that analytic multi-state forces and nonadiabatic couplings from the model enable application to nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, developing an active learning scheme to ensure a compact and systematically improvable training set. This culminates in application to the nonadiabatic molecular dynamics of a photoexcited 28-atom hydrogen chain, with surprising complexity in the resulting nuclear motion. With just 22 DMRG calculations of training states from the low-energy correlated electronic structure at different geometries, we infer the multi-state energies, forces and nonadiabatic coupling vectors at 12,000 geometries with provable convergence to high accuracy along an ensemble of molecular trajectories, which would not be feasible with a brute force approach. This opens up a route to bridge the timescales between accurate single-point correlated electronic structure methods and timescales of relevance for photo-induced molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>NSGAN: A Non-Dominant Sorting Optimisation-Based Generative Adversarial Design Framework for Alloy Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The design and discovery of new materials is fundamental to advancing scientific and technological innovation. The recent emergence of the materials genome concept holds great promise in revolutionising materials science by enabling the systematic utilisation of data for efficient prediction and optimisation of superior materials. However, the materials genome approach can be stymied by the vast complexity of design spaces, which often demand substantial computational resources and sophisticated data processing capabilities. To address these challenges, this work introduces a novel generative design framework called the non-dominant sorting optimisation-based generative adversarial networks (NSGAN). Capitalising on the synergies of genetic algorithms (GA) and generative adversarial networks (GANs), NSGAN provides a robust and efficient approach for tackling high-dimensional multi-objective optimisation design problems. To validate the efficacy of the proposed framework, we applied the model to a comprehensive dataset of aluminium alloys. Additionally, an online tool was created as a supplementary resource, offering a brief introduction to this innovative method for the wider scientific community. This study explores the potential of a predictive and data-driven approach in material design, indicating a promising pathway for widespread applications in the field of materials science.</description>

      <title>Surrogate models for vibrational entropy based on a spatial decomposition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12744v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The temperature-dependent behavior of defect densities within a crystalline structure is intricately linked to the phenomenon of vibrational entropy. Traditional methods for evaluating vibrational entropy are computationally intensive, limiting their practical utility. We show that total entropy can be decomposed into atomic site contributions and rigorously estimate the locality of site entropy. This analysis suggests that vibrational entropy can be effectively predicted using a surrogate model for site entropy. We employ machine learning to develop such a surrogate models employing the Atomic Cluster Expansion model. We supplement our rigorous analysis with an empirical convergence study. In addition we demonstrate the performance of our method for predicting vibrational formation entropy and attempt frequency of the transition rates, on point defects such as vacancies and interstitials.</description>

      <title>Active learning for effective Hamiltonian of super-large-scale atomic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first-principles-based effective Hamiltonian is widely used to predict and simulate the properties of ferroelectrics and relaxor ferroelectrics. However, the parametrization method of the effective Hamiltonian is complicated and hardly can resolve the systems with complex interactions and/or complex components. Here, we developed an on-the-fly active machine learning approach to parametrize the effective Hamiltonian based on Bayesian linear regression. The parametrization is completed in molecular dynamics simulations, with the energy, forces and stress predicted at each step along with their uncertainties. First-principles calculations are executed when the uncertainties are large to retrain the parameters. This approach provides a universal and automatic way to compute the effective Hamiltonian parameters for any considered systems including complex systems which previous methods can not handle. The form of the effective Hamiltonian is also revised to include some complex terms. BaTiO3, CsPbI3 and SrTiO3/PbTiO3 surface are taken as examples to show the accurateness of this approach comparing with conventional first-principles parametrization method.</description>

      <title>A theoretical framework for learning through structural plasticity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11735v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A growing body of research indicates that structural plasticity mechanisms are crucial for learning and memory consolidation. Starting from a simple phenomenological model, we exploit a mean-field approach to develop a theoretical framework of learning through this kind of plasticity, capable of taking into account several features of the connectivity and pattern of activity of biological neural networks, including probability distributions of neuron firing rates, selectivity of the responses of single neurons to multiple stimuli, probabilistic connection rules and noisy stimuli. More importantly, it describes the effects of stabilization, pruning and reorganization of synaptic connections. This framework is used to compute the values of some relevant quantities used to characterize the learning and memory capabilities of the neuronal network in training and testing procedures as the number of training patterns and other model parameters vary. The results are then compared with those obtained through simulations with firing-rate-based neuronal network models.</description>
