      <title>Adaptively Robust and Sparse K-means Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While K-means is known to be a standard clustering algorithm, it may be compromised due to the presence of outliers and high-dimensional noisy variables. This paper proposes adaptively robust and sparse K-means clustering (ARSK) to address these practical limitations of the standard K-means algorithm. We introduce a redundant error component for each observation for robustness, and this additional parameter is penalized using a group sparse penalty. To accommodate the impact of high-dimensional noisy variables, the objective function is modified by incorporating weights and implementing a penalty to control the sparsity of the weight vector. The tuning parameters to control the robustness and sparsity are selected by Gap statistics. Through simulation experiments and real data analysis, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method to existing algorithms in identifying clusters without outliers and informative variables simultaneously.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Federated Learning with Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: Algorithm and Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel and efficient Bayesian federated learning algorithm, namely, the Federated Averaging stochastic Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (FA-HMC), for parameter estimation and uncertainty quantification. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees of FA-HMC on non-iid distributed data sets, under the strong convexity and Hessian smoothness assumptions. Our analysis investigates the effects of parameter space dimension, noise on gradients and momentum, and the frequency of communication (between the central node and local nodes) on the convergence and communication costs of FA-HMC. Beyond that, we establish the tightness of our analysis by showing that the convergence rate cannot be improved even for continuous FA-HMC process. Moreover, extensive empirical studies demonstrate that FA-HMC outperforms the existing Federated Averaging-Langevin Monte Carlo (FA-LD) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Sparse high-dimensional linear mixed modeling with a partitioned empirical Bayes ECM algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12285v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-dimensional longitudinal data is increasingly used in a wide range of scientific studies. To properly account for dependence between longitudinal observations, statistical methods for high-dimensional linear mixed models (LMMs) have been developed. However, few packages implementing these high-dimensional LMMs are available in the statistical software R. Additionally, some packages suffer from scalability issues. This work presents an efficient and accurate Bayesian framework for high-dimensional LMMs. We use empirical Bayes estimators of hyperparameters for increased flexibility and an Expectation-Conditional-Minimization (ECM) algorithm for computationally efficient maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) estimation of parameters. The novelty of the approach lies in its partitioning and parameter expansion as well as its fast and scalable computation. We illustrate Linear Mixed Modeling with PaRtitiOned empirical Bayes ECM (LMM-PROBE) in simulation studies evaluating fixed and random effects estimation along with computation time. A real-world example is provided using data from a study of lupus in children, where we identify genes and clinical factors associated with a new lupus biomarker and predict the biomarker over time. Supplementary materials are available online.</description>

      <title>A hybrid tau-leap for simulating chemical kinetics with applications to parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of efficiently simulating stochastic models of chemical kinetics. The Gillespie Stochastic Simulation algorithm (SSA) is often used to simulate these models, however, in many scenarios of interest, the computational cost quickly becomes prohibitive. This is further exasperated in the Bayesian inference context when estimating parameters of chemical models, as the intractability of the likelihood requires multiple simulations of the underlying system. To deal with issues of computational complexity in this paper, we propose a novel hybrid $\tau$-leap algorithm for simulating well-mixed chemical systems. In particular, the algorithm uses $\tau$-leap when appropriate (high population densities), and SSA when necessary (low population densities, when discrete effects become non-negligible). In the intermediate regime, a combination of the two methods, which leverages the properties of the underlying Poisson formulation, is employed. As illustrated through a number of numerical experiments the hybrid $\tau$ offers significant computational savings when compared to SSA without however sacrificing the overall accuracy. This feature is particularly welcomed in the Bayesian inference context, as it allows for parameter estimation of stochastic chemical kinetics at reduced computational cost.</description>
