      <title>Extended Convolution Bounds on the Fr\'{e}chet Problem: Robust Risk Aggregation and Risk Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide extended convolution bounds for the Fr\'{e}chet problem and discuss related implications in quantitative risk management. First, we establish a new form of inequality for the Range-Value-at-Risk (RVaR). Based on this inequality, we obtain bounds for robust risk aggregation with dependence uncertainty for (i) RVaR, (ii) inter-RVaR difference and (iii) inter-quantile difference, and provide sharpness conditions. These bounds are called extended convolution bounds, which not only complement the results in the literature (convolution bounds in Blanchet et al. (2025)) but also offer results for some variability measures. Next, applying the above inequality, we study the risk sharing for the averaged quantiles (corresponding to risk sharing for distortion risk measures with special inverse S-shaped distortion functions), which is a non-convex optimization problem. We obtain the expression of the minimal value of the risk sharing and the explicit expression for the corresponding optimal allocation, which is comonotonic risk sharing for large losses and counter-comonotonic risk sharing for small losses or large gains. Finally, we explore the dependence structure for the optimal allocations, showing that the optimal allocation does not exist if the risk is not bounded from above.</description>

      <title>Standardized Threat Taxonomy for AI Security, Governance, and Regulatory Compliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21901v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accelerating deployment of artificial intelligence systems across regulated sectors has exposed critical fragmentation in risk assessment methodologies. A significant "language barrier" currently separates technical security teams, who focus on algorithmic vulnerabilities (e.g., MITRE ATLAS), from legal and compliance professionals, who address regulatory mandates (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF). This disciplinary disconnect prevents the accurate translation of technical vulnerabilities into financial liability, leaving practitioners unable to answer fundamental economic questions regarding contingency reserves, control return-on-investment, and insurance exposure. To bridge this gap, this research presents the AI System Threat Vector Taxonomy, a structured ontology designed explicitly for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA). The framework categorizes AI-specific risks into nine critical domains: Misuse, Poisoning, Privacy, Adversarial, Biases, Unreliable Outputs, Drift, Supply Chain, and IP Threat, integrating 53 operationally defined sub-threats. Uniquely, each domain maps technical vectors directly to business loss categories (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, Legal, Reputation), enabling the translation of abstract threats into measurable financial impact. The taxonomy is empirically validated through an analysis of 133 documented AI incidents from 2025 (achieving 100% classification coverage) and reconciled against the main AI risk frameworks. Furthermore, it is explicitly aligned with ISO/IEC 42001 controls and NIST AI RMF functions to facilitate auditability.</description>

      <title>The Risk-Adjusted Intelligence Dividend: A Quantitative Framework for Measuring AI Return on Investment Integrating ISO 42001 and Regulatory Exposure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Organizations investing in artificial intelligence face a fundamental challenge: traditional return on investment calculations fail to capture the dual nature of AI implementations, which simultaneously reduce certain operational risks while introducing novel exposures related to algorithmic malfunction, adversarial attacks, and regulatory liability. This research presents a comprehensive financial framework for quantifying AI project returns that explicitly integrates changes in organizational risk profiles. The methodology addresses a critical gap in current practice where investment decisions rely on optimistic benefit projections without accounting for the probabilistic costs of AI-specific threats including model drift, bias-related litigation, and compliance failures under emerging regulations such as the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and ISO/IEC 42001. Drawing on established risk quantification methods, including annual loss expectancy calculations and Monte Carlo simulation techniques, this framework enables practitioners to compute net benefits that incorporate both productivity gains and the delta between pre-implementation and post-implementation risk exposures. The analysis demonstrates that accurate AI investment evaluation requires explicit modeling of control effectiveness, reserve requirements for algorithmic failures, and the ongoing operational costs of maintaining model performance. Practical implications include specific guidance for establishing governance structures, conducting phased validations, and integrating risk-adjusted metrics into capital allocation decisions, ultimately enabling evidence-based AI portfolio management that satisfies both fiduciary responsibilities and regulatory mandates.</description>

      <title>Factors Influencing Cryptocurrency Prices: Evidence from Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22782v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper examines factors that influence prices of most common five cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, and Monero over 2010-2018 using weekly data. The study employs ARDL technique and documents several findings. First, cryptomarket-related factors such as market beta, trading volume, and volatility appear to be significant determinant for all five cryptocurrencies both in short- and long-run. Second, attractiveness of cryptocurrencies also matters in terms of their price determination, but only in long-run. This indicates that formation (recognition) of the attractiveness of cryptocurrencies are subjected to time factor. In other words, it travels slowly within the market. Third, SP500 index seems to have weak positive long-run impact on Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litcoin, while its sign turns to negative losing significance in short-run, except Bitcoin that generates an estimate of -0.20 at 10% significance level. Lastly, error-correction models for Bitcoin, Etherem, Dash, Litcoin, and Monero show that cointegrated series cannot drift too far apart, and converge to a long-run equilibrium at a speed of 23.68%, 12.76%, 10.20%, 22.91%, and 14.27% respectively.</description>

      <title>The Quantum Network of Assets: A Non-Classical Framework for Market Correlation and Structural Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.21515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical correlation matrices capture only linear and pairwise co-movements, leaving higher-order, nonlinear, and state-dependent interactions of financial markets unrepresented. This paper introduces the Quantum Network of Assets (QNA), a density-matrix based framework that embeds cross-asset dependencies into a quantum-information representation. The approach does not assume physical quantum effects but uses the mathematical structure of density operators, entropy, and mutual information to describe market organisation at a structural level.
  Within this framework we define two structural measures: the Entanglement Risk Index (ERI), which summarises global non-separability and the compression of effective market degrees of freedom, and the Quantum Early-Warning Signal (QEWS), which tracks changes in entropy to detect latent information build-up. These measures reveal dependency geometry that classical covariance-based tools cannot capture.
  Using NASDAQ-100 data from 2024-2025, we show that quantum entropy displays smoother evolution and clearer regime distinctions than classical entropy, and that ERI rises during periods of structural tightening even when volatility remains low. Around the 2025 US tariff announcement, QEWS shows a marked pre-event increase in structural tension followed by a sharp collapse after the announcement, indicating that structural transitions can precede price movements without implying predictive modelling.
  QNA therefore provides a structural diagnostic of market fragility, regime shifts, and latent information flow. The framework suggests new directions for systemic risk research by linking empirical asset networks with tools from quantum information theory.</description>
