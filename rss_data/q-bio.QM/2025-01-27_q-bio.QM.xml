      <title>Normalization and selecting non-differentially expressed genes improve machine learning modelling of cross-platform transcriptomic data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normalization is a critical step in quantitative analyses of biological processes. Recent works show that cross-platform integration and normalization enable machine learning (ML) training on RNA microarray and RNA-seq data, but no independent datasets were used in their studies. Therefore, it is unclear how to improve ML modelling performance on independent RNA array and RNA-seq based datasets. Inspired by the house-keeping genes that are commonly used in experimental biology, this study tests the hypothesis that non-differentially expressed genes (NDEG) may improve normalization of transcriptomic data and subsequently cross-platform modelling performance of ML models. Microarray and RNA-seq datasets of the TCGA breast cancer were used as independent training and test datasets, respectively, to classify the molecular subtypes of breast cancer. NDEG (p&gt;0.85) and differentially expressed genes (DEG, p&lt;0.05) were selected based on the p values of ANOVA analysis and used for subsequent data normalization and classification, respectively. Models trained based on data from one platform were used for testing on the other platform. Our data show that NDEG and DEG gene selection could effectively improve the model classification performance. Normalization methods based on parametric statistical analysis were inferior to those based on nonparametric statistics. In this study, the LOG_QN and LOG_QNZ normalization methods combined with the neural network classification model seem to achieve better performance. Therefore, NDEG-based normalization appears useful for cross-platform testing on completely independent datasets. However, more studies are required to examine whether NDEG-based normalization can improve ML classification performance in other datasets and other omic data types.</description>

      <title>Classification of Major Depressive Disorder Using Vertex-Wise Brain Sulcal Depth, Curvature, and Thickness with a Deep and a Shallow Learning Model</title>

Abstract: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a complex psychiatric disorder that affects the lives of hundreds of millions of individuals around the globe. Even today, researchers debate if morphological alterations in the brain are linked to MDD, likely due to the heterogeneity of this disorder. The application of deep learning tools to neuroimaging data, capable of capturing complex non-linear patterns, has the potential to provide diagnostic and predictive biomarkers for MDD. However, previous attempts to demarcate MDD patients and healthy controls (HC) based on segmented cortical features via linear machine learning approaches have reported low accuracies. Here, we used globally representative data from the ENIGMA-MDD working group containing 7,012 participants from 30 sites (N=2,772 MDD and N=4,240 HC), which allows a comprehensive analysis with generalizable results. Based on the hypothesis that integration of vertex-wise cortical features can improve classification performance, we evaluated the classification of a DenseNet and a Support Vector Machine (SVM), with the expectation that the former would outperform the latter. We found that both classifiers exhibited close to chance performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 51%; SVM: 53%), when estimated on unseen sites. Slightly higher classification performance (balanced accuracy DenseNet: 58%; SVM: 55%) was found when the cross-validation folds contained subjects from all sites, indicating site effect. In conclusion, the integration of vertex-wise morphometric features and the use of the non-linear classifier did not lead to the differentiability between MDD and HC. Our results support the notion that MDD classification on this combination of such features and classifiers is unfeasible. Perhaps more sophisticated integration of multimodal information may lead to a higher performance in this diagnostic task.</description>

      <title>Motif-aware Attribute Masking for Molecular Graph Pre-training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attribute reconstruction is used to predict node or edge features in the pre-training of graph neural networks. Given a large number of molecules, they learn to capture structural knowledge, which is transferable for various downstream property prediction tasks and vital in chemistry, biomedicine, and material science. Previous strategies that randomly select nodes to do attribute masking leverage the information of local neighbors However, the over-reliance of these neighbors inhibits the model's ability to learn from higher-level substructures. For example, the model would learn little from predicting three carbon atoms in a benzene ring based on the other three but could learn more from the inter-connections between the functional groups, or called chemical motifs. In this work, we propose and investigate motif-aware attribute masking strategies to capture inter-motif structures by leveraging the information of atoms in neighboring motifs. Once each graph is decomposed into disjoint motifs, the features for every node within a sample motif are masked. The graph decoder then predicts the masked features of each node within the motif for reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on eight molecular property prediction datasets and demonstrate its advantages.</description>

      <title>Open reaction-diffusion systems: bridging probabilistic theory and simulations across scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reaction-diffusion processes are the foundational model for a diverse range of complex systems, ranging from biochemical reactions to social agent-based phenomena. The underlying dynamics of these systems occur at the individual particle/agent level, and in realistic applications, they often display interaction with their environment through energy or material exchange with a reservoir. This requires intricate mathematical considerations, especially in the case of material exchange since the varying number of particles/agents results in ``on-the-fly'' modification of the system dimension. In this work, we first overview the probabilistic description of reaction-diffusion processes at the particle level, which readily handles varying number of particles. We then extend this model to consistently incorporate interactions with macroscopic material reservoirs. Based on the resulting expressions, we bridge the probabilistic description with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions for linear and nonlinear reaction-diffusion systems, as well as for an archetypal open reaction-diffusion system. Using these mathematical bridges across scales, we finally develop numerical schemes for open reaction-diffusion systems, which we implement in two illustrative examples. This work establishes a methodological workflow to bridge particle-based probabilistic descriptions with macroscopic concentration-based descriptions of reaction-diffusion in open settings, laying the foundations for a multiscale theoretical framework upon which to construct theory and simulation schemes that are consistent across scales.</description>
