      <title>Learning dynamical systems with hit-and-run random feature maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show how random feature maps can be used to forecast dynamical systems with excellent forecasting skill. We consider the tanh activation function and judiciously choose the internal weights in a data-driven manner such that the resulting features explore the nonlinear, non-saturated regions of the activation function. We introduce skip connections and construct a deep variant of random feature maps by combining several units. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, we introduce localization where we learn local maps, employing conditional independence. Our modified random feature maps provide excellent forecasting skill for both single trajectory forecasts as well as long-time estimates of statistical properties, for a range of chaotic dynamical systems with dimensions up to 512. In contrast to other methods such as reservoir computers which require extensive hyperparameter tuning, we effectively need to tune only a single hyperparameter, and are able to achieve state-of-the-art forecast skill with much smaller networks.</description>

      <title>Introduction to the Usage of Open Data from the Large Hadron Collider for Computer Scientists in the Context of Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning techniques have evolved rapidly in recent years, significantly impacting various scientific fields, including experimental particle physics. To effectively leverage the latest developments in computer science for particle physics, a strengthened collaboration between computer scientists and physicists is essential. As all machine learning techniques depend on the availability and comprehensibility of extensive data, clear data descriptions and commonly used data formats are prerequisites for successful collaboration. In this study, we converted open data from the Large Hadron Collider, recorded in the ROOT data format commonly used in high-energy physics, to pandas DataFrames, a well-known format in computer science. Additionally, we provide a brief introduction to the data's content and interpretation. This paper aims to serve as a starting point for future interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists and physicists, fostering closer ties and facilitating efficient knowledge exchange.</description>

      <title>Moment-based parameter inference with error guarantees for stochastic reaction networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inferring parameters of models of biochemical kinetics from single-cell data remains challenging because of the uncertainty arising from the intractability of the likelihood function of stochastic reaction networks. Such uncertainty falls beyond current error quantification measures, which focus on the effects of finite sample size and identifiability but lack theoretical guarantees when likelihood approximations are needed. Here, we propose a method for the inference of parameters of stochastic reaction networks that works for both steady-state and time-resolved data and is applicable to networks with non-linear and rational propensities. Our approach provides bounds on the parameters via convex optimisation over sets constrained by moment equations and moment matrices by taking observations to form moment intervals, which are then used to constrain parameters through convex sets. The bounds on the parameters contain the true parameters under the condition that the moment intervals contain the true moments, thus providing uncertainty quantification and error guarantees. Our approach does not need to predict moments and distributions for given parameters (i.e., it avoids solving or simulating the forward problem), and hence circumvents intractable likelihood computations or computationally expensive simulations. We demonstrate its use for uncertainty quantification, data integration and prediction of latent species statistics through synthetic data from common non-linear biochemical models including the Schl\"ogl model and the toggle switch, a model of post-transcriptional regulation at steady state, and a birth-death model with time-dependent data.</description>
