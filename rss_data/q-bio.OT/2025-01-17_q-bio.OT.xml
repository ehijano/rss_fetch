      <title>An Asymptotic Analysis of Bivalent Monoclonal Antibody-Antigen Binding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ligand-receptor interactions are fundamental to many biological processes. For example in antibody-based immunotherapies, the dynamics of an antibody binding with its target antigen directly influence the potency and efficacy of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies. In this paper, we present an asymptotic analysis of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of bivalent antibody-antigen binding in the context of mAb cancer therapies, highlighting the added complexity associated with bivalency of the antibody. To understand what drives the complex temporal dynamics of bivalent antibody-antigen binding, we construct asymptotic approximations to the model's solutions at different timescales and antibody concentrations that are in good agreement with numerical simulations of the full model. We show how the dynamics differ between two scenarios; a region where unbound antigens are abundant, and one where the number of unbound antigens is small such that the dominant balance within the model equations changes. Of particular importance to the potency and efficacy of mAb treatments are the values of quantities such as antigen occupancy and bound antibody number. We use the results of our asymptotic analysis to approximate the long-time values of these quantities that could be combined with experimental data to facilitate parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>The Genomic Code: The genome instantiates a generative model of the organism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How does the genome encode the form of the organism? What is the nature of this genomic code? Inspired by recent work in machine learning and neuroscience, we propose that the genome encodes a generative model of the organism. In this scheme, by analogy with variational autoencoders, the genome comprises a connectionist network, embodying a compressed space of latent variables, with weights that get encoded by the learning algorithm of evolution and decoded through the processes of development. The generative model analogy accounts for the complex, distributed genetic architecture of most traits and the emergent robustness and evolvability of developmental processes, while also offering a conception that lends itself to formalisation.</description>

      <title>A new perspective on brain stimulation interventions: Optimal stochastic tracking control of brain network dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Network control theory (NCT) has recently been utilized in neuroscience to facilitate our understanding of brain stimulation effects. A particularly useful branch of NCT is optimal control, which focuses on applying theoretical and computational principles of control theory to design optimal strategies to achieve specific goals in neural processes. However, most existing research focuses on optimally controlling brain network dynamics from the original state to a target state at a specific time point. In this paper, we present the first investigation of introducing optimal stochastic tracking control strategy to synchronize the dynamics of the brain network to a target dynamics rather than to a target state at a specific time point. We utilized fMRI data from healthy groups, and cases of stroke and post-stroke aphasia. For all participants, we utilized a gradient descent optimization method to estimate the parameters for the brain network dynamic system. We then utilized optimal stochastic tracking control techniques to drive original unhealthy dynamics by controlling a certain number of nodes to synchronize with target healthy dynamics. Results show that the energy associated with optimal stochastic tracking control is negatively correlated with the intrinsic average controllability of the brain network system, while the energy of the optimal state approaching control is significantly related to the target state value. For a 100-dimensional brain network system, controlling the five nodes with the lowest tracking energy can achieve relatively acceptable dynamics control effects. Our results suggest that stochastic tracking control is more aligned with the objective of brain stimulation interventions, and is closely related to the intrinsic characteristics of the brain network system, potentially representing a new direction for future brain network optimal control research.</description>
