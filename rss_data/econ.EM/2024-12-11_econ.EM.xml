      <title>Large Language Models: An Applied Econometric Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are being used in economics research to form predictions, label text, simulate human responses, generate hypotheses, and even produce data for times and places where such data don't exist. While these uses are creative, are they valid? When can we abstract away from the inner workings of an LLM and simply rely on their outputs? We develop an econometric framework to answer this question. Our framework distinguishes between two types of empirical tasks. Using LLM outputs for prediction problems (including hypothesis generation) is valid under one condition: no "leakage" between the LLM's training dataset and the researcher's sample. Using LLM outputs for estimation problems to automate the measurement of some economic concept (expressed by some text or from human subjects) requires an additional assumption: LLM outputs must be as good as the gold standard measurements they replace. Otherwise estimates can be biased, even if LLM outputs are highly accurate but not perfectly so. We document the extent to which these conditions are violated and the implications for research findings in illustrative applications to finance and political economy. We also provide guidance to empirical researchers. The only way to ensure no training leakage is to use open-source LLMs with documented training data and published weights. The only way to deal with LLM measurement error is to collect validation data and model the error structure. A corollary is that if such conditions can't be met for a candidate LLM application, our strong advice is: don't.</description>

      <title>Inference after discretizing unobserved heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a linear panel data model with nonseparable two-way unobserved heterogeneity corresponding to a linear version of the model studied in Bonhomme et al. (2022). We show that inference is possible in this setting using a straightforward two-step estimation procedure inspired by existing discretization approaches. In the first step, we construct a discrete approximation of the unobserved heterogeneity by (k-means) clustering observations separately across the individual ($i$) and time ($t$) dimensions. In the second step, we estimate a linear model with two-way group fixed effects specific to each cluster. Our approach shares similarities with methods from the double machine learning literature, as the underlying moment conditions exhibit the same type of bias-reducing properties. We provide a theoretical analysis of a cross-fitted version of our estimator, establishing its asymptotic normality at parametric rate under the condition $\max(N,T)=o(\min(N,T)^3)$. Simulation studies demonstrate that our methodology achieves excellent finite-sample performance, even when $T$ is negligible with respect to $N$.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning the Macroeconomic Effects of Financial Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to learn the nonlinear impulse responses to structural shocks using neural networks, and apply it to uncover the effects of US financial shocks. The results reveal substantial asymmetries with respect to the sign of the shock. Adverse financial shocks have powerful effects on the US economy, while benign shocks trigger much smaller reactions. Instead, with respect to the size of the shocks, we find no discernible asymmetries.</description>

      <title>Automatic Doubly Robust Forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes the automatic Doubly Robust Random Forest (DRRF) algorithm for estimating the conditional expectation of a moment functional in the presence of high-dimensional nuisance functions. DRRF combines the automatic debiasing framework using the Riesz representer (Chernozhukov et al., 2022) with non-parametric, forest-based estimation methods for the conditional moment (Athey et al., 2019; Oprescu et al., 2019). In contrast to existing methods, DRRF does not require prior knowledge of the form of the debiasing term nor impose restrictive parametric or semi-parametric assumptions on the target quantity. Additionally, it is computationally efficient for making predictions at multiple query points and significantly reduces runtime compared to methods such as Orthogonal Random Forest (Oprescu et al., 2019). We establish the consistency and asymptotic normality results of DRRF estimator under general assumptions, allowing for the construction of valid confidence intervals. Through extensive simulations in heterogeneous treatment effect (HTE) estimation, we demonstrate the superior performance of DRRF over benchmark approaches in terms of estimation accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>High-frequency and heteroskedasticity identification in multicountry models: Revisiting spillovers of monetary shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.03158v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the international transmission of monetary policy and central bank information shocks originating from the United States and the euro area. Employing a panel vector autoregression, we use macroeconomic and financial variables across several major economies to address both static and dynamic spillovers. To identify structural shocks, we introduce a novel approach that combines external instruments with heteroskedasticity-based identification and sign restrictions. Our results suggest significant spillovers from European Central Bank and Federal Reserve policies to each other's economies, global aggregates, and other countries. These effects are more pronounced for central bank information shocks than for pure monetary policy shocks, and the dominance of the US in the global economy is reflected in our findings.</description>

      <title>Inference for Regression with Variables Generated by AI or Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15585v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has become common practice for researchers to use AI-powered information retrieval algorithms or other machine learning methods to estimate variables of economic interest, then use these estimates as covariates in a regression model. We show both theoretically and empirically that naively treating AI- and ML-generated variables as "data" leads to biased estimates and invalid inference. We propose two methods to correct bias and perform valid inference: (i) an explicit bias correction with bias-corrected confidence intervals, and (ii) joint maximum likelihood estimation of the regression model and the variables of interest. Through several applications, we demonstrate that the common approach generates substantial bias, while both corrections perform well.</description>

      <title>Principal Component Copulas for Capital Modelling and Systemic Risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13195v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of copulas that we call Principal Component Copulas (PCCs). This class combines the strong points of copula-based techniques with principal component-based models, which results in flexibility when modelling tail dependence along the most important directions in high-dimensional data. We obtain theoretical results for PCCs that are important for practical applications. In particular, we derive tractable expressions for the high-dimensional copula density, which can be represented in terms of characteristic functions. We also develop algorithms to perform Maximum Likelihood and Generalized Method of Moment estimation in high-dimensions and show very good performance in simulation experiments. Finally, we apply the copula to the international stock market in order to study systemic risk. We find that PCCs lead to excellent performance on measures of systemic risk due to their ability to distinguish between parallel market movements, which increase systemic risk, and orthogonal movements, which reduce systemic risk. As a result, we consider the PCC promising for internal capital models, which financial institutions use to protect themselves against systemic risk.</description>
