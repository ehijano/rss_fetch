      <title>Matrix concentration inequalities for dependent binary random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove Bernstein-type matrix concentration inequalities for linear combinations with matrix coefficients of binary random variables satisfying certain $\ell_\infty$-independence assumptions, complementing recent results by Kaufman, Kyng and Solda. For random variables with the Stochastic Covering Property or Strong Rayleigh Property we prove estimates for general functions satisfying certain direction aware matrix bounded difference inequalities, generalizing and strengthening earlier estimates by the first-named author and Polaczyk.
  We also demonstrate a general decoupling inequality for a class of Banach-space valued quadratic forms in negatively associated random variables and combine it with the matrix Bernstein inequality to generalize results by Tropp, Chr\'etien and Darses, and Ruetz and Schnass, concerning the operator norm of a random submatrix of a deterministic matrix, drawn by uniform sampling without replacements or rejective sampling, to submatrices given by general Strong Rayleigh sampling schemes.</description>

      <title>Uniform estimates for random matrix products and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For certain natural families of topologies, we study continuity and stability of statistical properties of random walks on linear groups over local fields. We extend large deviation results known in the Archimedean case to non-Archimedean local fields and also demonstrate certain large deviation estimates for heavy tailed distributions unknown even in the Archimedean case. A key technical result, which may be of independent interest, establishes lower semi-continuity for the gap between the first and second Lyapunov exponents. As applications, we are able to obtain a key technical step towards a localization proof for heavy tailed Anderson models (the full proof appearing in a companion article), and show continuity/stability (taking the geometric data as input) of various statistical data associated to hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Littlewood--Paley--Stein Square Functions for the Fractional Discrete Laplacian on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the boundedness of ``vertical'' Littlewood--Paley--Stein square functions for the nonlocal fractional discrete Laplacian on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$, where the underlying graphs are not locally finite. When $q\in[2,\infty)$, we prove the $l^q$ boundedness of the square function by exploring the corresponding Markov jump process and applying the martingale inequality. When $q\in (1,2]$, we consider a modified version of the square function and prove its $l^q$ boundedness through a careful in on the generalized carr\'{e} du champ operator. A counterexample is constructed to show that it is necessary to consider the modified version. Moreover, we extend the study to a class of nonlocal Schr\"{o}dinger operators for $q\in (1,2]$.</description>

      <title>Weak convergence of stochastic integrals with applications to SPDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide sufficient conditions for sequences of random fields of the form $\int_{D} f(x,y) \theta_n(y) dy$ to weakly converge, in the space of continuous functions over $D$, to integrals with respect to the Brownian sheet, $\int_{D} f(x,y)W(dy)$, where $D \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ is a rectangular domain, $x \in D$, $f$ is a function satisfying some integrability conditions and $\{\theta_n\}_n$ is a sequence of stochastic processes whose integrals $\int_{[0,x]}\theta_n(y)dy$ converge in law to the Brownian sheet (in the sense of the finite dimensional distribution convergence). We then apply these results to stablish the weak convergence of solutions of the stochastic Poisson equation.</description>

      <title>Entropic bounds for conditionally Gaussian vectors and applications to neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using entropic inequalities from information theory, we provide new bounds on the total variation and 2-Wasserstein distances between a conditionally Gaussian law and a Gaussian law with invertible covariance matrix. We apply our results to quantify the speed of convergence to Gaussian of a randomly initialized fully connected neural network and its derivatives - evaluated in a finite number of inputs - when the initialization is Gaussian and the sizes of the inner layers diverge to infinity. Our results require mild assumptions on the activation function, and allow one to recover optimal rates of convergence in a variety of distances, thus improving and extending the findings of Basteri and Trevisan (2023), Favaro et al. (2023), Trevisan (2024) and Apollonio et al. (2024). One of our main tools are the quantitative cumulant estimates established in Hanin (2024). As an illustration, we apply our results to bound the total variation distance between the Bayesian posterior law of the neural network and its derivatives, and the posterior law of the corresponding Gaussian limit: this yields quantitative versions of a posterior CLT by Hron et al. (2022), and extends several estimates by Trevisan (2024) to the total variation metric.</description>

      <title>Generalized Space Time Fractional Skellam Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Generalized Space-Time Fractional Skellam Process (GSTFSP) and the Generalized Space Fractional Skellam Process (GSFSP). We investigate their distributional properties including the probability generating function (p.g.f.), probability mass function (p.m.f.), fractional moments, mean, variance, and covariance. The governing state differential equations for these processes are derived, and their increment processes are examined. We establish recurrence relations for the state probabilities of GSFSP and related processes. Furthermore, we obtain the transition probabilities, $n^{th}$-arrival times, and first passage times of these processes. The asymptotic behavior of the tail probabilities is analyzed, and limiting distributions as well as infinite divisibility of GSTFSP and GSFSP are studied. We provide the weighted sum representations for these processes and derive their characterizations. Also, we establish the martingale characterization for GSTFSP, GSFSP and related processes. In addition, we introduce the running average processes of GSFSP and its special cases, and obtain their compound Poisson representations. Finally, the p.m.f. of GSTFSP and simulated sample paths for GSTFSP and GSFSP are plotted.</description>

      <title>Quasi-stationarity of the Dyson Brownian Motion With Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the ergodic behavior of a system of particules, subject to collisions, before it exits a fixed subdomain of its state space. This system is composed of several one-dimensional ordered Brownian particules in interaction with electrostatic repulsions, which is usually referred as the (generalized) Dyson Brownian motion. The starting points of our analysis are the work [E. C{\'e}pa and D. L{\'e}pingle, 1997 Probab. Theory Relat. Fields] which provides existence and uniqueness of such a system subject to collisions via the theory of multivalued SDEs and a Krein-Rutman type theorem derived in [A. Guillin, B. Nectoux, L. Wu, 2020 J. Eur. Math. Soc.].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a limit theorem for a new model of 3-dimensional random walk in an inhomogeneous lattice with random orientations. This model can be seen as a 3dimensional version of the Matheron and de Marsily model [12]. This new model leads us naturally to the study of iterated random walk in random scenery, which is a new process that can be described as a random walk in random scenery evolving in a second random scenery. We use the french acronym PAPAPA for this new process and answer a question about its stochastic behaviour asked about twenty years ago by St{\'e}phane Le Borgne.</description>

      <title>Measure Theory of Conditionally Independent Random Function Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The next evaluation point $x_{n+1}$ of a random function $\mathbf f = (\mathbf f(x))_{x\in \mathbb X}$ (a.k.a. stochastic process or random field) is often chosen based on the filtration of previously seen evaluations $\mathcal F_n := \sigma(\mathbf f(x_0),\dots, \mathbf f(x_n))$. This turns $x_{n+1}$ into a random variable $X_{n+1}$ and thereby $\mathbf f(X_{n+1})$ into a complex measure theoretical object. In applications, like geostatistics or Bayesian optimization, the evaluation locations $X_n$ are often treated as deterministic during the calculation of the conditional distribution $\mathbb P(\mathbf f(X_{n+1}) \in A \mid \mathcal F_n)$. We provide a framework to prove that the results obtained by this treatment are typically correct. We also treat the more general case where $X_{n+1}$ is not 'previsible' but independent from $\mathbf f$ conditional on $\mathcal F_n$ and the case of noisy evaluations.</description>

      <title>On the Asymptotics of the Connectivity Probability of Erdos-Renyi Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the exact asymptotic behavior of the connectivity probability in the Erdos-Renyi graph G(n,p), under different asymptotic assumptions on the edge probability p=p(n). We propose a novel approach based on the analysis of inhomogeneous random walks to derive this probability. We show that the problem of graph connectivity can be reduced to determining the probability that an inhomogeneous random walk with Poisson-distributed increments, conditioned to form a bridge, is actually an excursion</description>

      <title>Holley--Stroock uniqueness method for the $\varphi^4_2$ dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The approach initiated by Holley--Stroock establishes the uniqueness of invariant measures of Glauber dynamics of lattice spin systems from a uniform log-Sobolev inequality. We use this approach to prove uniqueness of the invariant measure of the $\varphi^4_2$ SPDE up to the critical temperature (characterised by finite susceptibility). The approach requires three ingredients: a uniform log-Sobolev inequality (which is already known), a propagation speed estimate, and a crude estimate on the relative entropy of the law of the finite volume dynamics at time $1$ with respect to the finite volume invariant measure. The last two ingredients are understood very generally on the lattice, but the proofs do not extend to SPDEs, and are here established in the instance of the $\varphi^4_2$ dynamics.</description>

      <title>A counterexample to a conjecture by Salez and Youssef</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Remarkable progress has been made in recent years to establish log-Sobolev type inequalities under the assumption of discrete Ricci curvature bounds. More specfically, Salez and Youssef have proven that the log-Sobolev constant can be lower bounded by the Bakry Emery curvature lower bound divided by the logarithm of the sparsity parameter. They conjectured that the same holds true when replacing Bakry Emery by Ollivier curvature which is often times easier to compute in practice. In this paper, we show that this conjecture is wrong by giving a counter example on birth death chains of increasing length.</description>

      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of sub--quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, {we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm} for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>

      <title>Controlled stochastic processes for simulated annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulated annealing solves global optimization problems by means of a random walk in a cooling energy landscape based on the objective function and a temperature parameter. However, if the temperature is decreased too quickly, this procedure often gets stuck in suboptimal local minima. In this work, we consider the cooling landscape as a curve of probability measures. We prove the existence of a minimal norm velocity field which solves the continuity equation, a differential equation that governs the evolution of the aforementioned curve. The solution is the weak gradient of an integrable function, which is in line with the interpretation of the velocity field as a derivative of optimal transport maps. We show that controlling stochastic annealing processes by superimposing this velocity field would allow them to follow arbitrarily fast cooling schedules. Here we consider annealing processes based on diffusions and piecewise deterministic Markov processes. Based on convergent optimal transport-based approximations to this control, we design a novel interacting particle--based optimization method that accelerates annealing. We validate this accelerating behaviour in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Bregman-Wasserstein divergence: geometry and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.05833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Bregman-Wasserstein divergence is the optimal transport cost when the underlying cost function is given by a Bregman divergence, and arises naturally in fields such as statistics and machine learning. We establish fundamental properties of the Bregman-Wasserstein divergence and propose a novel generalized transport geometry that promotes the Bregman geometry to the space of probability distributions. We provide a probabilistic interpretation involving exponential families and define generalized displacement interpolations compatible with the Bregman geometry. These interpolations are used to derive a generalized Pythagorean inequality, which is of independent interest. Furthermore, we construct a generalized dualistic geometry that lifts the differential geometry of the Bregman divergence to an infinite-dimensional statistical manifold. On the computational side, we demonstrate how Bregman-Wasserstein optimal transport maps can be estimated using neural approaches, establish the well-posedness of Bregman-Wasserstein barycenters, and relate them to Bayesian learning. Finally, we introduce the Bregman-Wasserstein JKO scheme for discretizing Riemannian Wasserstein gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Quantitative and stable limits of high-frequency statistics of L\'evy processes: a Stein's method approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.05885v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish inequalities for assessing the distance between the distribution of errors of partially observed high-frequency statistics of multidimensional L\'evy processes and that of a mixed Gaussian random variable. Furthermore, we provide a general result guaranteeing stable functional convergence. Our arguments rely on a suitable adaptation of the Stein's method perspective to the context of mixed Gaussian distributions, specifically tailored to the framework of high-frequency statistics.</description>

      <title>Quantum and Probabilistic Computers Rigorously Powerful than Traditional Computers, and Derandomization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.09549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.09549v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the techniques used in our previous work to show that there exists a probabilistic Turing machine running within time $O(n^k)$ for all $k\in\mathbb{N}_1$ accepting a language $L_d$ which is different from any language in $\mathcal{P}$, and then further to prove that $L_d\in\mathcal{BPP}$, thus separating the complexity class $\mathcal{BPP}$ from the class $\mathcal{P}$ (i.e., $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{BPP}$).
  Since the complexity class $\mathcal{BQP}$ of $bounded$ $error$ $quantum$ $polynomial$-$time$ contains the complexity class $\mathcal{BPP}$ (i.e., $\mathcal{BPP}\subseteq\mathcal{BQP}$), we thus confirm the widespread-belief conjecture that quantum computers are $rigorously$ $powerful$ than traditional computers (i.e., $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{BQP}$).
  We further show that (1). $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{RP}$; (2). $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\text{co-}\mathcal{RP}$; (3). $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{ZPP}$. Previously, whether the above relations hold or not are long-standing open questions in complexity theory.
  Meanwhile, the result of $\mathcal{P}\subsetneq\mathcal{BPP}$ shows that $randomness$ plays an essential role in probabilistic algorithm design. In particular, we go further to show that:
  (1). The number of random bits used by any probabilistic algorithm which accepts the language $L_d$ can not be reduced to $O(\log n)$;
  (2). There exits no efficient (complexity-theoretic) {\em pseudorandom generator} (PRG) $$ G:\{0,1\}^{O(\log n)}\rightarrow \{0,1\}^n; $$
  (3). There exists no quick HSG $H:k(n)\rightarrow n$ such that $k(n)=O(\log n)$.</description>

      <title>Random minimum spanning tree and dense graph limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11705v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A theorem of Frieze from 1985 asserts that the total weight of the minimum spanning tree of the complete graph $K_n$ whose edges get independent weights from the distribution $UNIFORM[0,1]$ converges to Ap\'ery's constant in probability, as $n\to\infty$. We generalize this result to sequences of graphs $G_n$ that converge to a graphon $W$. Further, we allow the weights of the edges to be drawn from different distributions (subject to moderate conditions). The limiting total weight $\kappa(W)$ of the minimum spanning tree is expressed in terms of a certain branching process defined on $W$, which was studied previously by Bollob\'as, Janson and Riordan in connection with the giant component in inhomogeneous random graphs.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic independence for random permutations from surface groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18637v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an orientable hyperbolic surface of genus $g\geq 2$ with a marked point $o$, and let $\Gamma$ be an orientable hyperbolic surface group isomorphic to $\pi_{1}(X,o)$. Consider the space $\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$ which corresponds to $n$-sheeted covers of $X$ with labeled fiber. Given $\gamma\in\Gamma$ and a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$, what is the expected number of fixed points of $\phi(\gamma)$?
  Formally, let $F_{n}(\gamma)$ denote the number of fixed points of $\phi(\gamma)$ for a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We think of $F_{n}(\gamma)$ as a random variable on the space $\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We show that an arbitrary fixed number of products of the variables $F_{n}(\gamma)$ are asymptotically independent as $n\to\infty$ when there are no obvious obstructions. We also determine the limiting distribution of such products. Additionally, we examine short cycle statistics in random permutations of the form $\phi(\gamma)$ for a uniformly random $\phi\in\text{Hom}(\Gamma,S_{n})$. We show a similar asymptotic independence result and determine the limiting distribution.</description>

      <title>Smooth linear eigenvalue statistics on random covers of compact hyperbolic surfaces -- A central limit theorem and almost sure RMT statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.18663v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study smooth linear spectral statistics of twisted Laplacians on random $n$-covers of a fixed compact hyperbolic surface $X$. We consider two aspects of such statistics. The first is the fluctuations of such statistics in a small energy window around a fixed energy level when averaged over the space of all degree $n$ covers of $X$. The second is the energy variance of a typical surface.
  In the first case, we show a central limit theorem. Specifically, we show that the distribution of such fluctuations tends to a Gaussian with variance given by the corresponding quantity for the Gaussian Orthogonal/Unitary Ensemble (GOE/GUE). In the second case, we show that the energy variance of a typical random $n$-cover is that of the GOE/GUE. In both cases, we consider a double limit where first we let $n$, the covering degree, go to $\infty$ then let $L\to \infty$ where $1/L$ is the window length.</description>

      <title>Gaussian measure on the dual of $\mathrm{U}(N)$, random partitions, and topological expansion of the partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08393v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a Gaussian measure with parameter $q\in(0,1)$ on the dual of the unitary group of size $N$: we prove that a random highest weight under this measure is the coupling of two independent $q$-uniform random partitions $\alpha,\beta$ and a random highest weight of $\mathrm{U}(1)$. We prove deviation inequalities for the $q$-uniform measure, and use them to show that the coupling of random partitions under the Gaussian measure vanishes in the limit $N\to\infty$. We also prove that the partition function of this measure admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of $1/N$, and that this expansion is topological, in the sense that its coefficients are related to the enumeration of ramified coverings of elliptic curves. It provides a rigorous proof of the gauge/string duality for the Yang-Mills theory on a 2D torus with gauge group $\mathrm{U}(N),$ advocated by Gross and Taylor \cite{GT,GT2}.</description>

      <title>A systematic path to non-Markovian dynamics II: Probabilistic response of nonlinear multidimensional systems to Gaussian colored noise excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The probabilistic characterization of non-Markovian responses to nonlinear dynamical systems under colored excitation is an important issue, arising in many applications. Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.</description>

      <title>Kullback-Leibler Barycentre of Stochastic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem where an agent aims to combine the views and insights of different experts' models. Specifically, each expert proposes a diffusion process over a finite time horizon. The agent then combines the experts' models by minimising the weighted Kullback--Leibler divergence to each of the experts' models. We show existence and uniqueness of the barycentre model and prove an explicit representation of the Radon--Nikodym derivative relative to the average drift model. We further allow the agent to include their own constraints, resulting in an optimal model that can be seen as a distortion of the experts' barycentre model to incorporate the agent's constraints. We propose two deep learning algorithms to approximate the optimal drift of the combined model, allowing for efficient simulations. The first algorithm aims at learning the optimal drift by matching the change of measure, whereas the second algorithm leverages the notion of elicitability to directly estimate the value function. The paper concludes with an extended application to combine implied volatility smile models that were estimated on different datasets.</description>

      <title>Exponential convergence of general iterative proportional fitting procedures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20264v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the success of Sinkhorn's algorithm for entropic optimal transport, we study convergence properties of iterative proportional fitting procedures (IPFP) used to solve more general information projection problems. We establish exponential convergence guarantees for the IPFP whenever the set of probability measures which is projected onto is defined through constraints arising from linear function spaces. This unifies and extends recent results from multi-marginal, adapted and martingale optimal transport. The proofs are based on strong convexity arguments for the dual problem, and the key contribution is to illuminate the role of the geometric interplay between the subspaces defining the constraints. In this regard, we show that the larger the angle (in the sense of Friedrichs) between the linear function spaces, the better the rate of contraction of the IPFP.</description>

      <title>Stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and Sinkhorn semigroups for log-concave models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15963v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we obtain several new results and developments in the study of entropic optimal transport problems (a.k.a. Schr\"odinger problems) with general reference distributions and log-concave target marginal measures. Our approach combines transportation cost inequalities
  with the theory of Riccati matrix difference equations arising in filtering and optimal control theory. This methodology is partly based on a novel entropic stability of Schr\"odinger bridges and closed form expressions of a class of discrete time algebraic Riccati equations. In the context of regularized entropic transport these techniques provide new sharp entropic map estimates. When applied to the stability of Sinkhorn semigroups, they also yield
  a series of novel contraction estimates in terms of the fixed point of Riccati equations.
  The strength of our approach is that it is applicable to a large class of models arising in machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. We illustrate the impact of our results in the context of regularized entropic transport, proximal samplers and diffusion generative models as well as diffusion flow matching models</description>

      <title>Likelihood Level Adapted Estimation of Marginal Likelihood for Bayesian Model Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In computational mechanics, multiple models are often present to describe a physical system. While Bayesian model selection is a helpful tool to compare these models using measurement data, it requires the computationally expensive estimation of a multidimensional integral -- known as the marginal likelihood or as the model evidence (\textit{i.e.}, the probability of observing the measured data given the model). This study presents efficient approaches for estimating this marginal likelihood by transforming it into a one-dimensional integral that is subsequently evaluated using a quadrature rule at multiple adaptively-chosen iso-likelihood contour levels. Three different algorithms are proposed to estimate the probability mass at each adapted likelihood level using samples from importance sampling, stratified sampling, and Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling, respectively. The proposed approach is illustrated through four numerical examples. The first example validates the algorithms against a known exact marginal likelihood. The second example uses an 11-story building subjected to an earthquake excitation with an uncertain hysteretic base isolation layer with two models to describe the isolation layer behavior. The third example considers flow past a cylinder when the inlet velocity is uncertain. Based on these examples, the method with stratified sampling is by far the most accurate and efficient method for complex model behavior in low dimension. In the fourth example, the proposed approach is applied to heat conduction in an inhomogeneous plate with uncertain thermal conductivity modeled through a 100 degree-of-freedom Karhunen-Lo\`{e}ve expansion. The results indicate that MultiNest cannot efficiently handle the high-dimensional parameter space, whereas the proposed MCMC-based method more accurately and efficiently explores the parameter space.</description>
