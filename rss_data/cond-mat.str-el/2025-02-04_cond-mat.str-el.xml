      <title>Semi-group influence matrices for non-equilibrium quantum impurity models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for describing the real-time dynamics of quantum impurity models out of equilibrium which is based on the influence matrix approach. By replacing the dynamical map of a large fermionic quantum environment with an effective semi-group influence matrix (SGIM) which acts on a reduced auxiliary space, we overcome the limitations of previous proposals, achieving high accuracy at long evolution times. This SGIM corresponds to a uniform matrix-product state representation of the influence matrix and can be obtained by an efficient algorithm presented in this paper. We benchmark this approach by computing the spectral function of the single impurity Anderson model with high resolution. Further, the spectrum of the effective dynamical map allows us to obtain relaxation rates of the impurity towards equilibrium following a quantum quench. Finally, for a quantum impurity model with on-site two-fermion loss, we compute the spectral function and confirm the emergence of Kondo physics at large loss rates.</description>

      <title>Spin dynamics in the Dirac $U(1)$ spin liquid YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: YbZn$_2$GaO$_5$ is a promising candidate for realizing a quantum spin liquid (QSL) state, particularly owing to its lack of significant site disorder. Pulsed-field magnetometry at 0.5 K shows magnetization saturating near 15 T, with a corrected saturation moment of 2.1(1) $\mu_\mathrm{B}$ after subtracting the van Vleck contribution. Our zero-field $\mu$SR measurements down to milliKelvin temperatures provide evidence for a dynamic ground state and the absence of magnetic order. To probe fluctuations in the local magnetic field at the muon site, we performed longitudinal field $\mu$SR experiments. These results provide evidence for spin dynamics with a field dependence that is consistent with a U1A01 Dirac QSL as a plausible description of the ground state.</description>

      <title>Aspects of the normal state resistivity of cuprate superconductors Bi2201 and Tl2201</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planar normal state resistivity data from two families of hole doped single layer cuprate superconductors $Bi2201$ (Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) and $Tl2201$ (Tl$_2$Ba$_2$CuO$_{6+x}$) are calculated using the extremely correlated Fermi liquid theory (ECFL). This theory was recently employed for understanding the three families of single layer cuprate superconductors LSCO, BSLCO and NCCO. Adding these two systems accounts for essentially all single layer compounds where data is available for a range of densities and temperatures. The added case of $Bi2201$ is of particular interest since it was the original system where the almost linear in temperature resistivity was reported in 1990, and has been followed up by a systematic doping analysis only recently in 2022. The $Tl2201$ system has two distinct set of band parameters that fit the same Fermi surface, providing new challenges and insights into the ECFL theory.</description>

      <title>Magnetism from multiparticle ring exchange in moir\'e Wigner crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the multiparticle ring exchange couplings of the two-dimensional triangular Wigner crystal in external commensurate triangular and honeycomb potentials, using a semiclassical approach valid in the regime where Coulomb interactions dominate over electronic kinetic energy. In this limit, increasing the strength of the potential drives a transition from a ferromagnet to a $120^\circ$ N\'eel antiferromagnet for both external potential types. In the triangular case, we find that the transition occurs already for a weak potential, whereas in the honeycomb case, it occurs when the potential is nearly two orders of magnitude larger. Our results are relevant to the magnetism of generalized Wigner crystal phases observed at certain rational fillings of the moir\'e superlattice in transition-metal dichalcogenide heterobilayers.</description>

      <title>A Simple and General Equation for Matrix Product Unitary Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matrix Product Unitaries (MPUs) have emerged as essential tools for representing locality-preserving 1D unitary operators, with direct applications to quantum cellular automata and quantum phases of matter. A key challenge in the study of MPUs is determining when a given local tensor generates an MPU, a task previously addressed through fixed-point conditions and canonical forms, which can be cumbersome to evaluate for an arbitrary tensor. In this work, we establish a simple and efficient necessary and sufficient condition for a tensor $M$ to generate an MPU of size $N$, given by $\operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_M^N) = \operatorname{Tr}(\mathbb{E}_T^N) = 1$, where $\mathbb{E}_M$ and $\mathbb{E}_T$ are the transfer matrices of $M$ and $T = MM^\dagger$. This condition provides a unified framework for characterizing all uniform MPUs and significantly simplifies their evaluation. Furthermore, we show that locality preservation naturally arises when the MPU is generated for all system sizes. Our results offer new insights into the structure of MPUs, highlighting connections between unitary evolution, transfer matrices, and locality-preserving behavior, with potential extensions to higher-dimensions.</description>

      <title>Hardening of Ni-O bond-stretching phonons in LaNiO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that dynamical electron correlation and fluctuating local magnetic moments are crucial for the phonon spectra of the infinite-layer nickelate superconductor, LaNiO$_2$, using DFT plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations. We find significant hardening of optical Ni-O bond-stretching phonons when going from non-magnetic to paramagnetic state, and increasing Coulomb interaction will make them even harder. The electron correlation is found to be sensitive to the Ni-O bond-stretching distortions, indicating strong interplay between electron correlation and lattice. We find that the strong local electron correlation will not favor charge orders that couple to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons, in support of the recent experiment that a $3a_0$ charge order is absent in the infinite-layer nickelates. Our results emphasize that the effects of local magnetic fluctuations should be fully taken into account when describing the lattice dynamics of the infinite-layer nickelates without long-range magnetic orders, and also provide evidence to ascribe the kink observed in the recent angle-resolved photoemission experiment to possible strong electron coupling to the Ni-O bond-stretching phonons.</description>

      <title>Role of Dirac cones in the anisotropic properties associated with the spin-density wave state of iron pnictides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of unusual anisotropic electronic properties in the spin-density wave state of iron pnictides has conventionally been attributed to the breaking of four-fold rotational symmetry associated with the collinear magnetic order. By using a minimal two-orbital model, we show that a significant portion of the contribution to the anisotropy may come from the Dirac cones, which are not far away from the Fermi level. We demonstrate this phenomenon by examining optical conductivity and quasiparticle interference in the Dirac-semimetallic state with spin-density wave order, and the latter can be obtained by choosing appropriate interaction parameters and orbital splitting between the $d_{xz}$ and $d_{yz}$ orbitals. We further extend this study to investigate the low-energy spin-wave excitations in the Dirac-semimetallic state with spin-density wave order.</description>

      <title>Orbital correlations in bilayer nickelates: roles of doping and interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nature of orbital correlations present in the bilayer nickelate within a minimal two-orbital tight binding model to gain insights into their possible role in stabilizing the less-known weakly-insulating state. The latter has been observed experimentally at ambient pressure. In order to achieve this objective, we examine the static orbital susceptibilities within the random-phase approximation. Our study highlights the sensitivity of orbital correlations to various factors including the interlayer coupling, carrier concentration, band-structure details such as the orbital contents, the number of bands contributing at the Fermi level etc. We relate this sensitiveness to the modification of the Fermi surfaces as well as their orbital contents dependent on aforementioned factors.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-Field Dependence of Paramagnetic Properties Investigated by 63/65Cu-NMR on the Yb Zigzag-Chain Semiconductor YbCuS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate the paramagnetic properties of YbCuS2 under magnetic fields, we have performed the 63/65Cu-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. The NMR spectra can be reproduced by the simulations of the three-dimensional powder pattern and the additional two-dimensional powder pattern, indicating the partial sample orientation due to the anisotropy of the magnetic properties. These simulations suggest that the ac plane is the easy plane in YbCuS2. The Knight shift K is proportional to the bulk magnetic susceptibility and field-independent. The broad maximum of the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 at Tmax ~ 50 K (50 K anomaly) observed at zero magnetic field is quickly suppressed by the magnetic fields. This indicates that the 50 K anomaly is field-dependent. Furthermore, an anomalous enhancement of 1/T1 at low temperatures was observed above 3 T. This field seemingly corresponds to the magnetic field at which a field-induced phase transition occurs below the antiferromagnetic transition temperature TN ~ 1 K. The changes in 1/T1 observed in the paramagnetic state suggest the presence of the complex quantum phenomena under magnetic fields in YbCuS2.</description>

      <title>Nonclassical dynamics of N\'eel vector and magnetization accompanied by THz and high-harmonic radiation from ultrafast-light-driven NiO antiferromagnet insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00849v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast-light-driven strongly correlated antiferromagnetic insulators, such as prototypical NiO with large energy gap 4 eV, have recently attracted experimental attention using either above-gap [K. Gillmeister et al., Nat. Commun. 11, 4095 (2020)] or subgap [H. Qiu et al., Nat. Phys. 17, 388 (2021)] energy photons that are of fundamental interest in far-from-equilibrium quantum matter or spintronic applications, respectively. In the latter context, emission of THz radiation is also observed from NiO/Pt bilayers, where heavy metal (HM) Pt introduces strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). However, microscopic mechanisms of such emission remain obscure because spintronic THz emitters have been amply studied using FM/HM (FM-ferromagnetic metal of conventional type) bilayers, where ultrafast demagnetization takes place and is directly related to THz emission. Conversely, in NiO total magnetization is zero prior to the fs laser pulse (fsLP) application. Here we employ the two-orbital Hubbard-Hund-Heisenberg model and study, via numerically exact nonequilibrium quantum many-body methods, the dynamics of its Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization. Additionally, we compute electromagnetic radiation by both time-dependent magnetization and local charge currents arising in either plain NiO or NiO with proximity SOC introduced by HM layer. Our analysis reveals nonclassical dynamics of Neel vector and nonequilibrium magnetization, changing only in length while not rotating, where the former is substantially reduced only in the case above-gap fsLP. In the plain NiO case, THz radiation of interest to applications is insignificant, but adding SOC enhances both current and magnetic dipole contributions to it. Above THz range, we find integer high-harmonic generation, as well as unusual noninteger harmonics for above-gap fsLP pump.</description>

      <title>Generalized Lanczos method for systematic optimization of neural-network quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, artificial intelligence for science has made significant inroads into various fields of natural science research. In the field of quantum many-body computation, researchers have developed numerous ground state solvers based on neural-network quantum states (NQSs), achieving ground state energies with accuracy comparable to or surpassing traditional methods such as variational Monte Carlo methods, density matrix renormalization group, and quantum Monte Carlo methods. Here, we combine supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and the Lanczos method to develop a systematic approach to improving the NQSs of many-body systems, which we refer to as the NQS Lanczos method. The algorithm mainly consists of two parts: the supervised learning part and the reinforcement learning part. Through supervised learning, the Lanczos states are represented by the NQSs. Through reinforcement learning, the NQSs are further optimized. We analyze the reasons for the underfitting problem and demonstrate how the NQS Lanczos method systematically improves the energy in the highly frustrated regime of the two-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1$-$J_2$ model. Compared to the existing method that combines the Lanczos method with the restricted Boltzmann machine, the primary advantage of the NQS Lanczos method is its linearly increasing computational cost.</description>

      <title>How to stay on the physical branch in self-consistent many-electron approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the mathematical condition under which the physical solution of the many-electron problem, obtained by self-consistent approaches, becomes unstable upon increasing interaction strength. The validity of our criterion is explicitly verified by performing self-consistent calculations of basic interacting models. In this context, we eventually unveiled the precise connection linking the misleading convergence of self-consistent schemes to the multivaluedness of the Luttinger-Ward functional as well as to the divergences of the irreducible vertex function. Our analysis also explains how a misleading convergence of self-consistent approximations can occur even in parameter regions without vertex divergences. Even more importantly, it allows us to define a general procedure for stabilizing the physical solution, when it is unstable in conventional self-consistent schemes.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the energy and orbital structure of local states in CuO monolayer on Coulomb parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dependence of the energies and orbital structure of local states in the CuO monolayer on intra- and interatomic Coulomb interactions on copper and oxygen orbitals is studied. The electronic system is described within the eight-band p-d model in the hole representation with the on-site energies and hopping integrals obtained using density functional theory. CuO cluster multiparticle eigenstates are calculated using exact diagonalization. The difference between the energy dependencies on the Coulomb parameters for the states with the predominant probability density on the d-orbital and the states in which hole occupies p-orbitals leads to crossover of d- and p-states. The ground single-hole and two-hole states which determine the electronic structure of the low-energy excitations have the character of d- or p-orbitals in the different regions of the Coulomb parameters space. The gap between the energies of the dispersionless quasiparticles forming the top of the valence band and conductivity band also have different values in these two regions. The magnitude of this gap and the orbital character of the local multiparticle states change sharply even with an insignificant change in the Coulomb interactions within the boundary region of parameters between the regions in which the local states are formed by the d- or p-orbitals.</description>

      <title>Origin of phonon decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phonon decoherence determines the characteristic timescales over which coherent lattice vibrations decay, making it a crucial process for understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of crystal lattices after excitation by a pump pulse. Here, we report a theoretical and computational investigation of the origin of phonon decoherence within a first-principles many-body framework. We derive quantum kinetic equations for the dynamics of coherent phonons by explicitly accounting for dissipation processes induced by electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. The decoherence rate and frequency renormalization are formulated in terms of the non-equilibrium phonon self energy, providing a framework amenable for ab initio calculations. To validate this approach, we conduct a first-principles study of phonon decoherence for the elemental semimetals antimony and bismuth. The robust agreement with available temperature- and fluence-dependent experimental data confirms the accuracy of our theoretical and computational framework. More generally, our findings reveal that either electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling can prevail in determining the decoherence time, depending on the temperature and driving conditions. Overall, this work fills a critical gap in the theoretical understanding of phonon decoherence, providing a predictive framework for determining the timescales of light-induced structural dynamics in driven solids.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01580v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the magnetic, magnetodielectric, and electric polarization properties of single crystals of the Co-based Kitaev Spin Liquid (KSL) candidate Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$ (NCTO). The sample shows magnetic transitions at 26 K, 16 K, and 5 K, consistent with the literature. The magnetic measurements along and perpendicular to the Co-honeycomb planes show a strong anisotropy in susceptibility and in Curie-Weiss (C-W) temperatures. The experimental anisotropic C-W temperatures of NCTO qualitatively match with the theoretical C-W temperatures, calculated using the HKTF model [C. Kim \textit{et al.}, J. Phys.: Condens. Matter \textbf{34}, 045802 (2021)]. We find from our temperature- and field-dependent dielectric and pyroelectric ($I_p$) current studies ($H\parallel ab$ and $E\perp ab$) that our single crystal NCTO samples do not have a finite electric polarization below 100 K. These $I_p$ studies confirm the absence of a magnetoelectric coupling and electric polarization properties in the title compound and suggest that the zig-zag AFM structure is more favorable than the triple-$Q$ structure with AFM Kitaev interactions.</description>

      <title>A neutral-atom Hubbard quantum simulator in the cryogenic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices offer pristine realizations of Hubbard models, which are fundamental to modern condensed matter physics and the study of strongly-correlated quantum materials. Despite significant advancements, the accessible temperatures in these optical lattice material analogs are still too high to address many open problems beyond the reach of current numerical techniques. Here, we demonstrate a several-fold reduction in temperature, bringing large-scale quantum simulations of the Hubbard model into an entirely new regime. This is accomplished by transforming a low entropy product state into strongly-correlated states of interest via dynamic control of the model parameters, which is extremely challenging to simulate classically and so explored using the quantum simulator itself. At half filling, the long-range antiferromagnetic order is close to saturated, leading to a temperature of $T/t=0.05_{-0.05}^{0.06}$ based on comparisons to numerically exact simulations. Doped away from half-filling no unbiased numerical simulation is available. Importantly, we are able to use quantum simulation to identify a new pathway for achieving similarly low temperatures with doping. This is confirmed by comparing short-range spin correlations to state-of-the-art, but approximate, constrained-path auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Compared to the cuprates, the reported temperatures correspond to a reduction from far above to significantly below room temperature, where physics such as the pseudogap and stripe phases may be expected. Our work opens the door to quantum simulations that solve open questions in material science, develop synergies with numerical methods and theoretical studies, and lead to discoveries of new physics.</description>

      <title>Theory of ab initio downfolding with arbitrary range electron-phonon coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ab initio downfolding describes the electronic structure of materials within a low-energy subspace, often around the Fermi level. Typically starting from mean-field calculations, this framework allows for the calculation of one- and two-electron interactions, and the parametrization of a many-body Hamiltonian representing the active space of interest. The subsequent solution of such Hamiltonians can provide insights into the physics of strongly-correlated materials. While phonons can substantially screen electron-electron interactions, electron-phonon coupling has been commonly ignored within ab initio downfolding, and when considered this is done only for short-range interactions. Here we propose a theory of ab initio downfolding that accounts for all mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling on equal footing, regardless of the range of the interactions. Our practical computational implementation is readily compatible with current downfolding approaches. We apply our approach to polar materials MgO and GeTe, and we reveal the importance of both short-range and long-range electron-phonon coupling in determining the magnitude of electron-electron interactions. Our results show that in the static limit, phonons reduce the on-site repulsion between electrons by 40% for MgO, and by 79% for GeTe. Our framework also predicts that overall attractive nearest-neighbor interactions arise between electrons in GeTe, consistent with superconductivity in this material.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study superfluid drag in the two-component, two-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with infinitely strong repulsive interactions. We demonstrate, with a combination of analytic and numeric techniques, that the motion of holes leads to strong dissipationless coupling between currents in the two components. We show that this behavior is attributable to polaronic correlations that emerge in the presence of spin currents, and which can be observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Light-induced reorientation transition in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the lack of a net magnetic moment, antiferromagnets possess a unique robustness to external magnetic fields and are thus predicted to play an important role in future magnetic technologies. However, this robustness also makes them quite difficult to control, and the development of novel methods to manipulate these systems with external stimuli is a fundamental goal of antiferromagnetic spintronics. In this work, we report evidence for a metastable reorientation of the order parameter in an antiferromagnetic semiconductor triggered by an ultrafast quench of the equilibrium order via photoexcitation above the band gap. The metastable state forms less than 10 ps after the excitation pulse, and persists for longer than 150 ps before decaying to the ground state via thermal fluctuations. Importantly, this transition cannot be induced thermodynamically, and requires the system to be driven out of equilibrium. Broadly speaking, this phenomenology is ultimately the result of large magnetoelastic coupling in combination with a relatively low symmetry of the magnetic ground state. Since neither of these properties are particularly uncommon in magnetic materials, the observations presented here imply a generic path toward novel device technology enabled by ultrafast dynamics in antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Doped resonating valence bond states: How robust are the spin ice phases in 3D Rydberg arrays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg blockade effect provides a convenient platform for simulating locally constrained many-body systems, such as quantum dimer models and quantum loop models, especially their novel phases like topological orders and gapless quantum spin ice (QSI) phases. To discuss the possible phase diagram containing different QSIs in 3D Rydberg arrays, here, we have constructed an extended Rokhsar-Kivelson (RK) Hamiltonian with equal-weight-superposition ground state in different fillings at the RK point. Therefore, both the perfect QSIs with fixed local dimer filling and their monomer-doped states can be simulated directly by Monte Carlo sampling. Using single mode approximation, the excitations of dimers and monomers have also been explored in different fillings. We find that, in the thermodynamical limit, even doping a small amount of monomers can disrupt the topological structure and lead to the existence of off-diagonal long-range order. However, in a finite size (as in cold-atom experiment), the property of QSI will be kept in a certain region like a crossover after doping. The phase diagram containing different QSIs and off-diagonal order phases is proposed.</description>

      <title>Generating logical magic states with the aid of non-Abelian topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing with the surface code, non-Clifford gates are crucial for universal computation. However, implementing these gates using methods like magic state distillation and code switching requires significant resources. In this work, we propose a new protocol that combines magic state preparation and code switching to realize logical non-Clifford operations with the potential for fault tolerance. Our approach begins with a special logical state in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ surface code. By applying a sequence of transformations, the system goes through different topological codes, including the non-Abelian $D_4$ quantum double model. This process ultimately produces a magic state in a condensed $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code, which enables the implementation of a logical $T$ gate in the standard $\mathbb{Z}_2$ surface code. In our analysis, we employ a framework where the topological codes are represented by their topological orders and all the transformations are considered as topological manipulations such as gauging symmetries and condensing anyons. This perspective is particularly useful for understanding code switching between topological codes.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of the hybrid Ruddlesden-Popper La5Ni3O11 single crystals under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 under high pressure indicates that the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates Rn+1NinO3n+1 (R = rare earth) is a new material family for high-temperature superconductivity. Exploring the superconductivity of other RP or hybrid RP phase nickelates under high pressure has become an urgent and interesting issue. Here, we report a novel hybrid RP nickelate superconductor of La5Ni3O11. The hybrid RP nickelate La5Ni3O11 is formed by alternative stacking of La3Ni2O7 with n=2 and La2NiO4 with n=1 along the c axis. The transport and magnetic torque measurements indicate a density-wave transition at approximately 170 K near ambient pressure, which is highly similar to both La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10. With increasing pressure, high-pressure transport measurements reveal that the density-wave transition temperature (TDW) continuously increases to approximately 210 K with increasing pressure up to 12 GPa before the appearance of pressure-induced superconductivity, and the density-wave transition abruptly fades out in a first-order manner at approximately 12 GPa. The optimal superconductivity with Tconset = 64 K and Tczero = 54 K is achieved at approximately 21 GPa. On the other hand, high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition from an orthorhombic structure to a tetragonal structure at approximately 4.5 GPa. In contrast to La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, the pressure-induced structural transition has no significant effect on either the density-wave transition or the superconductivity, suggesting a minor role of lattice degree of freedom in La5Ni3O11. The present discovery extends the superconducting member in the RP nickelate family and sheds new light on the superconducting mechanism.</description>

Abstract: We apply a voltage pulse to electrically excite the incompressible region of a two-dimensional electron liquid in the $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall state and investigate the collective excitations in both the edge and bulk via photoluminescence spectral energy shifts. Introducing an offset in the voltage pulse significantly enhances the excitation signal. Real-space and time-resolved measurements reveal the dynamics of the bulk excitations, with an estimated group velocity of approximately $3 \times 10^4$ m/s. These bulk excitations align well with the magneto-plasmon model. Our results highlight the topological link between edge and bulk states, providing a novel approach to exploring solid-state analogs of quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Developing universal logical state-purification strategy for quantum error correcting codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a measurement-based protocol for simultaneously purifying arbitrary logical states in multiple quantum error correcting codes with unit fidelity and finite probability, starting from arbitrary thermal states of each code. The protocol entails a time evolution caused by an engineered Hamiltonian, which results in transitions between the logical and error subspaces of the quantum error correcting code mediated by the auxiliary qubit, followed by a projective measurement in an optimum basis on the auxiliary qubit and an appropriate post-selection of the measurement outcomes. We illustrate the results with the three-qubit repetition code and the logical qubit used in quantum state transfer protocol. We further demonstrate that when the measurement base is not optimal, it is possible to achieve both classical fidelity, and fidelity as high as $90\%$ through several iterations of the purifying procedure, thereby establishing its robustness against variations in the measurement basis. By repeating the purification rounds, we show that purifying the cardinal states of the logical Bloch sphere corresponding to logical qubits in quantum state transfer is feasible utilizing paradigmatic quantum spin models as the generator of the time evolution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: String-net models describe a vast family of topological orders in two spatial dimensions, but fail to produce all the expected anyonic excitations. Following arXiv:1502.03433, we consider an extended string-net model by attaching one tail to each plaquette of the lattice, allowing all anyons to emerge as elementary plaquette excitations for arbitrary input categories. The corresponding tube algebra is the mathematical tool needed to construct the anyons from the input category and to obtain their internal multiplicities. We use them to compute the energy level degeneracies and the partition function. In the thermodynamic limit, the latter is dominated by the trivial (vacuum) anyon, so that the topological order is destroyed at any non-zero temperature. In a finite-size system, order survives up to a finite temperature, similarly to the one-dimensional classical Ising model. We confirm this by computing thermal averages of topological projectors, Wegner-Wilson loops and the topological mutual information. The results are also generalized to models with multiple tails per plaquette.</description>

      <title>Damage of bilayer structure in La3Ni2O7-d induced by high pO2 annealing</title>

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity with onset temperature of ~80 K in pressurized bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper La3Ni2O7-d has attracted much attention. Despite intense research, determination of the exact oxygen content and understanding of the relationship between superconductivity and oxygen content remain a big challenge. Here, we report a systematical study on the structure and physical properties of La3Ni2O7-d polycrystalline powders which were prepared using sol-gel method at ambient pressure and then annealed under various oxygen pressure. We found that high pO2 annealing with slow cooling results in a new phase, which can be modeled using the hybrid single-layer-trilayer La3Ni2O7 or the tetragonal bilayer La3Ni2O7. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed significant single layers and trilayers after high oxygen pressure annealing, evidencing damage of the bilayer structure. The superconducting transition under high pressure became weak for high pO2 annealed samples, which is consistent with the damage of the bilayer structure. Our results reveal that the bilayer structure is fragile and post-annealing under near atmosphere pressure of oxygen is suitable to maintain bilayer structure and increase oxygen content at the same time.</description>

      <title>Fidelity Strange Correlators for Average Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.17485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological phases in open quantum systems have become an exciting area of research, driven by the rising importance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum platforms. The concept of Average Symmetry-Protected Topological (ASPT) phases extends symmetry-protected topological phases to quantum systems affected by disorder or decoherence. To identify nontrivial ASPT states, we introduce a "fidelity strange correlator" (FSC), which operates directly on a single bulk density matrix without boundaries. For nontrivial ASPT phases in one and two dimensions, we show that the FSC reveals long-range or power-law behavior. In several two-dimensional examples, we establish a link between the FSC and certain non-local correlation functions in statistical loop models with quantum corrections, enabling us to derive exact scaling exponents for the FSC. In addition, we discuss methods to measure the FSC using classical shadow tomography. Our work lays the groundwork for identifying these intriguing topological phases of matter in open quantum systems, both numerically and experimentally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.14640v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The identification, description, and classification of topological features is an engine of discovery and innovation in several fields of physics. This research encompasses a broad variety of systems, from the integer and fractional Chern insulators in condensed matter, to protected states in complex photonic lattices in optics, and the structure of the QCD vacuum. Here, we introduce another playground for topology: the dissipative dynamics of pseudo-Hermitian many-body quantum systems. For that purpose, we study two different systems, the dissipative Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, and a quantum chaotic dephasing spin chain. For the two different many-body models, we find the same topological features for a wide range of parameters suggesting that they are universal. In the SYK model, we identify four universality classes, related to pseudo-Hermiticity, characterized by a rectangular block representation of the vectorized Liouvillian that is directly related to the existence of an anomalous trace of the unitary operator implementing fermionic exchange. As a consequence of this rectangularization, we identify a topological index $\nu$ that only depends on symmetry. Another distinct consequence of the rectangularization is the observation, for any coupling to the bath, of purely real topological modes in the Liouvillian. The level statistics of these real modes agree with that of the corresponding random matrix ensemble and therefore can be employed to characterize the four topological symmetry classes. In the limit of weak coupling to the bath, topological modes govern the approach to equilibrium, which may enable a direct path for experimental confirmation of topology in dissipative many-body quantum chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Finite-Size Scaling for Two-Dimensional 3-state Clock Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14002v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We benchmark recently proposed tensor network based finite-size scaling analysis in Phys. Rev. B {\bf 107}, 205123 (2023) against two-dimensional classical 3-state clock model. Due to the higher complexity of the model, more complicated crossover behavior is observed. We advocate that the crossover behavior can be understood from the perspective of finite bond dimension inducing relevant perturbation. This leads to a general strategy to best estimate the critical properties for a given set of control parameters. For the critical temperature $T_c$, the relative error at the order of $10^{-7}$ can be reached with bond dimension $D=70$. On the other hand, with bond dimension $D=60$, the relative errors of the critical exponents $\nu, \beta, \alpha$ are at the order of $10^{-2}$. Increasing the bond dimension to $D=90$, these relative errors can be reduced at least to the order of $10^{-3}$. In all cases our results indicate that the errors can be systematically reduced by increasing the bond dimension and the stacking number.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15095v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study gapless edge modes corresponding to $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases of two-dimensional three-state Potts paramagnets on a triangular lattice. First, we derive microscopic lattice models for the gapless edge and, using the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) approach, investigate the finite-size scaling of the low-lying excitation spectrum and the entanglement entropy. Based on the obtained results, we identify the universality class of the critical edge, namely the corresponding conformal field theory and the central charge. Finally, we discuss the inherent symmetries of the edge models and the emergent winding number symmetry. As a result, one-dimensional chains with this symmetry form a model that supports gapless excitations due to its tricritical symmetry. Numerically, we show that low-energy states in the continuous limit of the edge model can be described by conformal field theory (CFT) with central charge $c=1$, given by the coset $SU_k(3)/SU_k(2)$ CFT at level k=1.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic skyrmion and multi-$q$ spin dynamics in centrosymmetric Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17323v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions are particle-like vortices of magnetization with non-trivial topology, which are usually stabilized by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMI) in noncentrosymmetric bulk materials. Exceptions are centrosymmetric Gd- and Eu-based skyrmion-lattice (SkL) hosts with zero DMI, where both the SkL stabilization mechanisms and magnetic ground states remain controversial. We address these here by investigating both the static and dynamical spin properties of the centrosymmetric SkL host Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ using muon spectroscopy ($\mu$SR). We find that spin fluctuations in the non-coplanar SkL phase are highly anisotropic, implying that spin anisotropy plays a prominent role in stabilizing this phase. We also observe strongly-anisotropic spin dynamics in the ground-state (IC-1) incommensurate magnetic phase of the material, indicating that it hosts a meron-like multi-$q$ structure. In contrast, the higher-field, coplanar IC-2 phase is found to be single-$q$ with nearly-isotropic spin dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.19253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the condensation completion of a modular tensor category, which yields a fusion 2-category of codimension-1 and higher defects in a $2+1$D topological order. We apply the condensation completion to $2+1$D topological order with $\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2$ and $\mathbb Z_4$ fusion rules. In these cases, we explicitly enumerate the $1$d and $0$d defects present in these topological orders, along with their fusion rules. We also talk about other applications of condensation completion: alternative interpretations of condensation completion of a braided fusion category; condensation completion of the category of symmetry charges and its correspondence to gapped phases with symmetry; for a topological order $\mathcal{C}$, one can also find all gapped boundaries of the stacking of $\mathcal{C}$ with its time-reversal conjugate through computing the condensation completion of $\mathcal{C}$.</description>

      <title>Simulating chiral spin liquids with fermionic Projected Entangled Paired States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01243v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chiral Spin Liquids (CSL) based on spin-1/2 fermionic Projected Entangled Pair States (fPEPS) are considered on the square lattice. First, fPEPS approximants of Gutzwiller-projected Chern insulators (GPCI) are investigated by Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) techniques on finite size tori. We show that such fPEPS of finite bond dimension can correctly capture the topological properties of the chiral spin liquid, as the exact GPCI, with the correct topological ground state degeneracy on the torus. Further, more general fPEPS are considered and optimized (on the infinite plane) to describe the CSL phase of a chiral frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The chiral modes are computed on the edge of a semi-infinite cylinder (of finite circumference) and shown to follow the predictions from Conformal Field Theory. In contrast to their bosonic analogs the (optimized) fPEPS do not suffer from the replication of the chiral edge mode in the odd topological sector.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a family of (semi) bold-line series, assisted with $1/\text{N}_{f}$ expansions, with $\text{N}_{f}$ being the number of fermion flavours. If there is no additional $\mathrm{N}_{f}$ cut, the series reduces to the RPA series in the density-density channel, complementary to the particle-hole and particle-particle channels introduced in [Phys. Rev. B \textbf{102}, 195122]. We performed extensive benchmarks for density, energy and pressure with $\mathrm{t}-\mathrm{t}'$ $\mathrm{SU}(\mathrm{N}_{f})$ Hubbard model on square lattice and honeycomb lattices over a wide range of numerical methods. For benchmark purposes, we also implement bare-$\mathrm{U}$ symmetry-broken perturbation series for the 2D SU(2) Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice. We find difficulties simulating grand potentials with different shift parameters even at high temperatures and weak interactions, while in general find encouraging results for density simulations. We believe the search for optimal shift parameters is feasible, while we leave this problem for future studies. Nevertheless, the $1/\mathrm{N}_{f}$ series could proves efficacious for grand potential computations where symmetry broken bare-U expansion grapples with considerable challenges.</description>

      <title>$Z_2$ flux binding to higher-spin impurities in the Kitaev spin liquid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizing $Z_2$ fluxes in Kitaev spin liquids (KSLs) is crucial for both characterizing candidate materials and identifying Ising anyons. In this study, we investigate the effects of spin-$S$ magnetic impurities embedded in the spin-1/2 KSL. Utilizing exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods, we examine the impurity magnetization and ground-state flux sector with varying impurity coupling and spin size. Our findings reveal that impurity magnetization exhibits an integer/half-integer spin dependence, which aligns with analytical predictions, and a flux-sector transition from bound-flux to zero-flux occurs at low coupling strengths, independent of the impurity spin. Notably, for spin-3/2 impurities, we observe a reentrant bound-flux sector, which remains stable under magnetic fields. By considering fermionic representations of our spin Hamiltonian, we provide phenomenological explanations for the transitions. Our results suggest a novel way of binding a flux in KSLs, beyond the proposals of vacancies or Kondo impurities.</description>

      <title>Single-boson exchange formulation of the Schwinger-Dyson equation and its application to the functional renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11661v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the recently introduced single-boson exchange formulation to the computation of the self-energy from the Schwinger--Dyson equation (SDE). In particular, we derive its expression both in diagrammatic and in physical channels. The simple form of the single-boson exchange SDE, involving only the bosonic propagator and the fermion-boson vertex, but not the rest function, allows for an efficient numerical implementation. We furthermore discuss its implications in a truncated unity solver, where a restricted number of form factors introduces an information loss in the projection of the momentum dependence that in general affects the equivalence between the different channel representations. In the application to the functional renormalization group, we find that the convergence in the number of form factors depends on the channel representation of the SDE. For the two-dimensional Hubbard model at weak coupling, the pseudogap opening driven by antiferromagnetic fluctuations is captured already by a single ($s$-wave) form factor in the magnetic channel representation, differently to the density and superconducting channels.</description>

      <title>The foot, the fan, and the cuprate phase diagram: Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.16417v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Fermi liquid with a `large' Fermi surface (FL) can have a quantum phase transition to a spin density wave state (SDW) with reconstructed `small' Fermi pockets. Both FL and SDW phases obey the Luttinger constraints on the volume enclosed by the Fermi surfaces. The critical spin fluctuations lead to spin-singlet $d$-wave pairing, as observed in the cuprates. Studies of the influence of spatial disorder on the SDW-FL quantum phase transition predict an extended quantum-critical Griffiths-type phase at low temperatures on the large Fermi surface side. These computations agree with the `foot' seen in transport, and recent low temperature neutron scattering observations on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.
  However, this theory cannot explain the higher temperature pseudogap and the `fan' of strange metal of the hole-doped cuprates. Here we need to consider underlying Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking. Then the small Fermi surface phase does not obey the Luttinger constraint, and is instead a `fractionalized Fermi liquid' (FL*). A theory of FL* in single band models describes photoemission observations in the pseudogap phase. The field theory for FL*-FL quantum phase transition in the presence of spatial disorder is mapped to a form which can be analyzed using the methods of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Such an analysis successfully describes linear-in-temperature resistivity, optical conductivity and thermopower observations.
  The confinement crossover connecting these lower and higher temperature descriptions is also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a fermionic quantum system exchanging particles with an environment at a fixed temperature and study its reduced evolution by means of a Redfield-I equation with time-dependent (non-Markovian) coefficients. We find that the description can be efficiently reduced to a standard-form Redfield-II equation, however, with a time-dependent effective bath temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective temperature appears to be very high, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a time-local master equation, offering high accuracy at all times and preserving the crucial properties of the density matrix. It includes non-Markovian relaxation processes beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods and can be further applied to various types of Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad equations. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.</description>

Abstract: In a physical system with conformal symmetry, observables depend on cross-ratios, measures of distance invariant under global conformal transformations (conformal geometry for short). We identify a quantum information-theoretic mechanism by which the conformal geometry emerges at the gapless edge of a 2+1D quantum many-body system with a bulk energy gap. We introduce a novel pair of information-theoretic quantities $(\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}, \eta)$ that can be defined locally on the edge from the wavefunction of the many-body system, without prior knowledge of any distance measure. We posit that, for a topological groundstate, the quantity $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is stationary under arbitrary variations of the quantum state, and study the logical consequences. We show that stationarity, modulo an entanglement-based assumption about the bulk, implies (i) $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is a non-negative constant that can be interpreted as the total central charge of the edge theory. (ii) $\eta$ is a cross-ratio, obeying the full set of mathematical consistency rules, which further indicates the existence of a distance measure of the edge with global conformal invariance. Thus, the conformal geometry emerges from a simple assumption on groundstate entanglement.
  We show that stationarity of $\mathfrak{c}_{\mathrm{tot}}$ is equivalent to a vector fixed-point equation involving $\eta$, making our assumption locally checkable. We also derive similar results for 1+1D systems under a suitable set of assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identification of superconductivity in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases of nickelates under high pressure remains challenging. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistance, and Meissner effect in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with hydrostatic pressures up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase above 40 GPa. Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed until it disappears above 80 GPa, resulting in a right-triangle-like superconducting region. The direct-current magnetic susceptibility technique successfully detected the Meissner effect in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure; the maximum superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 62.7% at 22.0 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals under high pressure. The results reveal intimate connections among the superconductivity, oxygen content, and structure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fracton models host unconventional topological orders in three and higher dimensions and provide promising candidates for quantum memory platforms. Understanding their robustness against quantum fluctuations is an important task but also poses great challenges due to the lack of efficient numerical tools. In this work, we establish neural quantum states (NQS) as new tools to study phase transitions in these models. Exact and efficient parametrizations are derived for three prototypical fracton codes -- the checkerboard and X-cube model, as well as Haah's code -- both in terms of a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) and a correlation-enhanced RBM. We then adapt the correlation-enhanced RBM architecture to a perturbed checkerboard model and reveal its strong first-order phase transition between the fracton phase and a trivial field-polarizing phase. To this end, we simulate this highly entangled system on lattices of up to 512 qubits with high accuracy, representing a cutting-edge application of variational neural-network methods. In addition, we reproduce the phase transition of the X-cube model previously obtained with quantum Monte Carlo and high-order series expansion methods. Our work demonstrates the remarkable potential of NQS in studying complicated three-dimensional problems and highlights physics-oriented constructions of NQS architectures.</description>

      <title>Impact of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09906v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has played an important role in many topological and correlated electron materials. In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17530v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a R\'enyi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, &amp; Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite R\'enyi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.</description>

      <title>Statistics of invertible topological excitations: a framework using operators and many-body Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the concept of anyon statistics, based on string operators and many-body Hilbert space, to invertible topological excitations of any dimensions. This framework is only build on several fundamental facts in quantum mechanics, while providing a rigorous and systematic theory for statistics independent to topological order and field theory. Additionally, we propose several conjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer program for computing statistics, which has yielded results consistent with traditional physical theories.</description>

      <title>Selective enhancement of Coulomb interactions in planar Weyl fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on our study of the electron interaction effects in topological two-dimensional (2D) materials placed in a quantizing magnetic field. Taking our cue from a recent experimental report, we consider a particular case of bismuthene monolayer with a strong spin-orbit interaction which can be a Weyl semimetal when placed on a specially tuned substrate. Interestingly, we observe that in some Landau levels of this material, the interaction effects are strongly enhanced compared to those for a conventional 2D system. Such an enhancement of electron-electron interactions in these materials is largely due to an anisotropy present in the materials. Additionally, the interaction effects can be tuned by changing the coupling to the substrate and the strongest inter-electron interactions are observed when the system is a Weyl semimental. The observed enhancement of the interaction effects can therefore be an important signature of the 2D Weyl fermions.</description>
