      <title>Ideal approximation theory in Frobenius categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be a Frobenius category and $\omega$ the full subcategory consisting of projective objects. The relations between special precovering (resp., precovering) ideals in $\mathcal{A}$ and special precovering (resp., preenveloping) ideals in the stable category $\mathcal{A}/\omega$ are explored. In combination with a result due to Breaz and Modoi, we conclude that every precovering or preenveloping ideal $\mathcal{I}$ in $\mathcal{A}$ with $1_{X}\in{\mathcal{I}}$ for any $X\in{\omega}$ is special. As a consequence, it is proved that an ideal cotorsion pair $(\mathcal{I},\mathcal{J})$ in $\mathcal{A}$ is complete if and only if $\mathcal{I}$ is precovering if and only if $\mathcal{J}$ is preenveloping. This leads to an ideal version of the Bongartz-Eklof-Trlifaj Lemma in $\mathcal{A}/\omega$, which states that an ideal cotorsion pair in $\mathcal{A}/\omega$ generated by a set of morphisms is complete. As another consequence, we provide some partial answers to the question about the completeness of cotorsion pairs posed by Fu, Guil Asensio, Herzog and Torrecillas.</description>

      <title>Morita theory for quantales</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morita theory for quantales is developed. The main result of the paper is a characterization of those quantaloids (categories enriched in the symmetric monoidal closed category of sup-lattices) that are equivalent to modular categories over quantales. Based on this characterization, necessary and sufficient conditions are derived for two quantales to be Morita-equivalent, i. e. have equivalent module categories. As an application, it is shown that the category of internal sup-lattices in a Grothendieck topos is equivalent to the module category over a suitable chosen ordinary quantale.</description>

      <title>The shift-homological spectrum and parametrising kernels of rank functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any compactly generated triangulated category we introduce two topological spaces, the shift-spectrum and the shift-homological spectrum. We use them to parametrise a family of thick subcategories of the compact objects, which we call radical. These spaces can be viewed as non-monoidal analogues of the Balmer and homological spectra arising in tensor-triangular geometry: we prove that for monogenic tensor-triangulated categories the Balmer spectrum is a subspace of the shift-spectrum. To construct these analogues we utilise quotients of the module category, rather than the lattice theoretic methods which have been adopted in other approaches. We characterise radical thick subcategories and show in certain cases, such as the perfect derived categories of tame hereditary algebras or monogenic tensor-triangulated categories, that every thick subcategory is radical. We establish a close relationship between the shift-homological spectrum and the set of irreducible integral rank functions, and provide necessary and sufficient conditions for every radical thick subcategory to be given by an intersection of kernels of rank functions. In order to facilitate these results, we prove that both spaces we introduce may equivalently be described in terms of the Ziegler spectrum.</description>

      <title>Finite symmetric algebras in tensor categories and Verlinde categories of algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate objects in symmetric tensor categories that have simultaneously finite symmetric and finite exterior algebra. This forces the characteristic of the base field to be $p&gt;0$, and the maximal degree of non-vanishing symmetric and exterior powers to add up to a multiple of $p$. We give a complete classification of objects in tensor categories for which this sum equals $p$. All resulting tensor categories are Verlinde categories of reductive groups and we fill in some gaps in the literature on these categories.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Initial Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Initial semantics aims to capture inductive structures and their properties as initial objects in suitable categories. We focus on the initial semantics aiming to model the syntax and substitution structure of programming languages with variable binding as initial objects. Three distinct yet similar approaches to initial semantics have been proposed. An initial semantics result was first proved by Fiore, Plotkin, and Turi using {\Sigma}-monoids in their seminal paper published at LICS'99. Alternative frameworks were later introduced by Hirschowitz and Maggesi using modules over monads, and by Matthes and Uustalu using heterogeneous substitution systems. Since then, all approaches have been significantly developed by numerous researchers. While similar, the links between this different approaches remain unclear. This is especially the case as the literature is difficult to access, since it was mostly published in (short) conference papers without proofs, and contains many technical variations and evolutions.
  In this work, we introduce a framework based on monoidal categories that unifies these three distinct approaches to initial semantics, by suitably generalizing and combining them. Doing so we show that modules over monoids provide an abstract and easy to manipulate framework, that {\Sigma}-monoids and strengths naturally arise when stating and proving an initiality theorem, and that heterogeneous substitution systems enable us to prove the initiality theorem modularly. Moreover, to clarify the literature, we provide an extensive overview of related work using our framework as a cornerstone to explain the links between the different approaches and their variations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any globular subdivision of multipointed $d$-spaces gives rise to a dihomotopy equivalence between the associated flows. The proof involves a new Reedy category which is a tweak of the one used to prove the left properness of the q-model category of flows. As a straightforward application, the flows associated to two multipointed $d$-spaces related by a finite zigzag of globular subdivisions have isomorphic branching and merging homology theories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During what Vietnamese call the American War, Alexander Grothendieck spent three weeks teaching mathematics in and near Hanoi. Ho\`ang Xu\^an S\'inh took notes on his lectures and later did her thesis work with him by correspondence. In her thesis she developed the theory of "Gr-categories", which are monoidal categories in which all objects and morphisms have inverses. Now often called "2-groups", these structures allow the study of symmetries that themselves have symmetries. After a brief account of how Ho\`ang Xu\^an S\'inh wrote her thesis, we explain some of its main results, and its context in the history of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Generalised 6j symbols over the category of $G$-graded vector spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Any choice of a spherical fusion category defines an invariant of oriented closed 3-manifolds, which is computed by choosing a triangulation of the manifold and considering a state sum model that assigns a 6j symbol to every tetrahedron in this triangulation. This approach has been generalized to oriented closed 3-manifolds with defect data by Meusburger. In a recent paper, she constructed a family of invariants for such manifolds parametrised by the choice of certain spherical fusion categories, bimodule categories, finite bimodule functors and module natural transformations. Meusburger defined generalised 6j symbols for these objects, and introduces a state sum model that assigns a generalised 6j symbol to every tetrahedron in the triangulation of a manifold with defect data, where the type of 6j symbol used depends on what defect data occur within the tetrahedron. The present work provides non-trivial examples of suitable bimodule categories, bimodule functors and module natural transformation, all over categories of $G$-graded vector spaces. Our main result is the description of module functors in terms of matrices, which allows us to classify these functors when $G$ is a finite cyclic group. Furthermore, we calculate the generalised 6j symbols for categories of $G$-graded vector spaces, (bi-)module categories over such categories and (bi-)module functors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of categories abstracting the structural properties of relations has been extensively developed over the years, resulting in a rich and diverse body of work. This paper strives to provide a modern and comprehensive presentation of these ``categories for relations'', including their enriched version, further showing how they arise as Kleisli categories of suitable symmetric monoidal monads. The resulting taxonomy aims at bringing clarity and organisation to the numerous related concepts and frameworks occurring in the literature</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.14668v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate a series of conjectures on the stable tensor product of irreducible representations of symmetric groups, which are closely related to the reduced Kronecker coefficients. These conjectures are certain generalizations of Okounkov's conjecture on the log-concavity of the Littlewood--Richardson coefficients and the Schur log-concavity theorem of Lam--Postnikov--Pylyavskyy. We prove our conjectures in some special cases and discuss some implications of these conjectures.</description>

      <title>Moduli stacks of quiver bundles with applications to Higgs bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a general method for constructing moduli stacks whose points are diagrams of vector bundles over a fixed base, indexed by a fixed simplicial set -- that is, quiver bundles of a fixed shape. We discuss some constraints on the base for these moduli stacks to be Artin and observe that a large class of interesting schemes satisfy these constraints. Using this construction, we recover Nakajima quiver varieties and provide an alternate construction for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles along with a proof of algebraicity following readily from the algebraicity of moduli stacks of quiver bundles. One feature of our approach is that, for each of the moduli stacks we discuss, there are moduli stacks that are Artin, parametrizing morphisms of the objects being classified. We discuss some potential applications of this in categorifying non-abelian Hodge theory in a sense we will make precise. We also discuss potential applications of our methods and perspectives to the subjects of quiver varieties, abstract moduli theory, and homotopy theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by an equivalence of categories established by Kapranov and Schechtman, we introduce, for each non-negative integer d, the category of connected bialgebras modulo d+1. We show that these categories fit into an inverse system of categories whose inverse limit category is equivalent to the category of connected bialgebras. In addition, we extend the notion of approximation of connected bialgebras to those that are not necessarily generated in degree 1 and show that, for connected bialgebras in the category of Yetter-Drinfeld modules over a Hopf algebra, approximation is compatible with cocycle twisting.</description>
