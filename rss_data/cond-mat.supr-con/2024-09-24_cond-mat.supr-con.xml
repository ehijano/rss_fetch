      <title>Chiral and topological superconductivity in isospin polarized multilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A microscopic mechanism for chiral superconductivity from Coulomb repulsion is proposed for spin- and valley-polarized state of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. The superconducting state occurs at low density, has chiral $p$-wave pairing symmetry, and exhibits highest $T_c$ close to a Lifshitz transition from annular to simply-connected Fermi sea. This Lifshitz transition also marks a topological phase transition from a trivial to a topological superconducting phase hosting Majorana fermions. The chirality of the superconducting order parameter is selected by the chirality of the valley-polarized Bloch electrons. Our results are in reasonable agreement with observations in a recent experiment on tetralayer graphene [arXiv:2408.15233]</description>

      <title>Pair size and quantum geometry in a multiband Hubbard model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the size of two-body bound states and Cooper pairs within a multiband Hubbard model that features time-reversal symmetry and uniform pairing on a generic lattice. Our analysis involves (i) an exact calculation of the localization tensor to determine the size of lowest-lying two-body bound state in vacuum, and (ii) an evaluation of the average size of Cooper pairs using mean-field BCS-BEC crossover theory at zero temperature. Beyond the conventional intraband contribution that depends on Bloch bands, we show that pair size also has a geometric contribution governed by the quantum-metric tensor of the Bloch states and their band-resolved quantum-metric tensors. As a concrete example, we investigate the pyrochlore-Hubbard model numerically and demonstrate that, while the pair size diverges in the weakly interacting BCS regime, it remains finite and relatively small in the flat-band regime, even for infinitesimal interaction, perfectly matching the exact two-body result in the dilute limit.</description>

      <title>Making s-wave superconductors topological with magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that an s-wave superconductor may become topological in the presence of a magnetic field which leads to formation of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. Below the upper critical field, a new superconducting state with a nontrivial topological number emerges, which we call Abrikosov-Chern superconducting state. Deeper in the superconducting domain, the topological number changes in steps, eventually reaching zero. Our theory uncovers the nature of evolution from an integer quantum Hall state having a cyclotron gap above the upper critical field to the topologically-trivial s-wave superconductor carrying finite-energy Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon levels at low field. Topological transitions manifest as changes in the number of edge modes, detectable through tunneling microscopy and thermal transport measurements.</description>

      <title>A compact inertial nano-positioner operating at cryogenic temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14725v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nano-positioning plays a very important role in applications such as scanning probe microscopy and optics. We report the development of a compact inertial nanopositioner along with fully computer interfaced electronics operating down to 2 K, and its use in our fully automated needle-anvil type Point Contact Andreev Reflection (PCAR) apparatus. We also present the fully automated operational procedures using LabVIEW interface with our home-built electronics. The point contact spectroscopy probe has been successfully used to perform PCAR measurements on elemental superconductors at low temperatures. The small footprint of our nano-positioner makes it ideally suited for incorporation in low temperature scanning probe microscopes and makes this design versatile for various research and industrial purposes.</description>

      <title>Charge Density Waves and the Effects of Uniaxial Strain on the Electronic Structure of 2H-NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interplay of superconductivity and density wave orders has been at the forefront of research of correlated electronic phases for a long time. 2H-NbSe$_2$ is considered to be a prototype system for studying this interplay, where the balance between the two orders was proven to be sensitive to band filling and pressure. However, the origin of charge density wave in this material is still unresolved. Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we revisit the charge density wave order and study the effects of uniaxial strain on the electronic structure of 2H-NbSe$_2$. Our results indicate previously undetected signatures of charge density waves on the Fermi surface. The application of small amount of uniaxial strain induces substantial changes in the electronic structure and lowers its symmetry. This, and the altered lattice should affect both the charge density wave phase and superconductivity and should be observable in the macroscopic properties.</description>

      <title>First Principles Prediction Unveils High-T$_c$ Superconductivity in YSc$_2$H$_{24}$ Cage Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quest for room-temperature superconductivity has been a long-standing aspiration in the field of materials science, driving extensive research efforts. In this work, we present a novel hydride, YSc$_2$H$_{24}$, which is stable at high pressure, identified through crystal structure prediction methods. The discovered material is crystalline in a hexagonal unit cell with space group $P6/mmm$ and has a fastinating structure consisting of two distinct cages: Sc@H$_{24}$ and Y@H$_{30}$. By conducting an extensive numerical investigation of lattice dynamics, electron-phonon coupling, and solving the isotropic Eliashberg equation, we have revealed a significant value of $\lambda$ = 3.27 as the underlying factor responsible for the remarkably high critical temperature (T$_c$) of 302-330 K in YSc$_2$H$_{24}$ at a pressure of 310 GPa. As pressure increases, the T$_c$ remains above the ambient temperature. Our work has the potential to enhance the existing understanding of high-temperature superconductors, with implications for practical applications. The unique network of these cage-like structures holds great promise for advancing our understanding of high-temperature superconductors, potentially leading to innovative applications.</description>

      <title>Prediction of $s^\pm$-wave superconductivity enhanced by electronic doping in trilayer nickelates La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05285v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the recently reported signatures of superconductivity in trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure, we comprehensively study this system using {\it ab initio} and random-phase approximation techniques. Without electronic interactions, the Ni $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals show a bonding-antibonding and nonbonding splitting behavior via the O $p_z$ orbitals inducing a ``trimer'' lattice in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, analogous to the dimers of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$. The Fermi surface consists of three electron sheets with mixed $e_g$ orbitals, and a hole and an electron pocket made up of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbital, suggesting a Ni two-orbital minimum model. In addition, we find that superconducting pairing is induced in the $s^{\pm}$-wave channel due to partial nesting between the {\bf M}=$(\pi, \pi)$ centered pockets and portions of the Fermi surface centered at the {\bf $\Gamma$}=$(0, 0)$ point. With changing electronic density $n$, the $s^\pm$ instability remains leading and its pairing strength shows a dome-like behavior with a maximum around $n = 4.2$ ($\sim 6.7\%$ electron doping). The superconducting instability disappears at the same electronic density as that in the new 1313 stacking La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, correlated with the vanishing of the hole pocket that arises from the trilayer sublattice, suggesting that the high-$T_c$ superconductivity of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ may $not$ originate from a trilayer- and single-layer structure. Furthermore, we predict an interesting spin-density-wave state in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with an in-plane ($\pi$, $\pi$) order and antiferromagnetic coupling between the top and bottom Ni layers, while the middle layer has spin zero.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature T$^{2}$ resistivity in the underdoped pseudogap phase versus T-linear resistivity in the overdoped strange-metal phase of cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16778v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transport experiments demonstrate a dramatic switch from the low-temperature linear in temperature (T-linear) resistivity in the overdoped strange-metal phase of cuprate superconductors to the low-temperature quadratic in temperature (T-quadratic) resistivity in the underdoped pseudogap phase, however, a consensus on the origin of this unusual switch is still lacking. Here the resistivity in the underdoped pseudogap phase of cuprate superconductors is investigated using the Boltzmann transport equation. The resistivity originates from the electron umklapp scattering mediated by the spin excitation, however, the dominant contribution mainly comes from the antinodal umklapp scattering. In particular, a low temperature $T_{\rm scale}$ scales with $\Delta^{2}_{p}$ in the underdoped regime due to the opening of a momentum dependent spin pseudogap, where $\Delta_{p}$ is the minimal umklapp vector at the antinode. Moreover, this $T_{\rm scale}$ decreases with the increase of doping in the underdoped regime, and then is reduced to a very low temperature in the overdoped regime. In the underdoped regime, the resistivity is T-quadratic at the low temperatures below $T_{\rm scale}$, where the strength of the T-quadratic resistivity weakens as the doping is raised. However, in the overdoped regime, the resistivity is T-linear at the low temperatures above $T_{\rm scale}$. The results in this paper together with the recent study on the resistivity in the overdoped regime therefore show that the electron umklapp scattering from a spin excitation responsible for the low-temperature T-linear resistivity in the overdoped regime naturally produces the low-temperature T-quadratic resistivity in the underdoped regime resulting from the opening of a momentum dependent spin pseudogap.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect in one-dimensional quantum wires connected to superconductors with mixed singlet-triplet pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02794v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear, provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing. Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent, namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always accompanied by the anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that quantum wires in Josephson junctions could serve as effective platforms for probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.</description>

      <title>Unconventional gate-induced superconductivity in transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity in few-layer semiconducting transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) can be induced by field-effect doping through ionic-liquid gating. While several experimental observations have been collected over the years, a fully-consistent theoretical picture is still missing. Here we develop a realistic framework that combines the predictive power of first-principles simulations with the versatility and insight of Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer gap equations to rationalize such experiments. The multi-valley nature of semiconducting TMDs is taken into account, together with the doping- and momentum-dependent electron-phonon and Coulomb interactions. Consistently with experiments, we find that superconductivity occurs when the electron density is large enough that the Q valleys get occupied, as a result of a large enhancement of electron-phonon interactions. Despite being phonon-driven, the superconducting state is predicted to be sensitive to Coulomb interactions, which can lead to the appearance of a relative sign difference between valleys and thus to a $s_{+-}$ character. We discuss qualitatively how such scenario may account for many of the observed physical phenomena for which no microscopic explanation has been found so far, including in particular the presence of a large subgap density of states, and the sample-dependent dome-shaped dependence of $T_c$ on accumulated electron density. Our results provide a comprehensive analysis of gate-induced superconductivity in semiconducting TMDs, and introduce an approach that will likely be valuable for other multivalley electronic systems, in which superconductivity occurs at relatively low electron density.</description>

      <title>Origin of Robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Topological Phases in Stacked Hermitian Systems: Non-Hermitian Level Repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall insulators, which possess a non-trivial $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase, have attracted great attention for two decades. It is generally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall insulators are stacked, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable due to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While the counterexamples of the instability were observed in several literates, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we provide a systematic understanding that the robust $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase in a Hermitian system with chiral symmetry against stacking. We clarify that the robustness generally originates from level repulsion in the corresponding non-Hermitian system derived from Hermitization. We demonstrate this by treating a class DIII superconductor in 1D with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology and the corresponding non-Hermitian 1D system in class AII$^\dagger$ with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ point-gap topology.</description>
