      <title>ISAC-over-NTN: HAPS-UAV Framework for Post-Disaster Responsive 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In disaster scenarios, ensuring both reliable communication and situational awareness becomes a critical challenge due to the partial or complete collapse of terrestrial networks. This paper proposes an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) over non-terrestrial networks (NTN) architecture referred to as ISAC-over-NTN that integrates multiple uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) and a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) to maintain resilient and reliable network operations in post-disaster conditions. We aim to achieve two main objectives: i) provide a reliable communication infrastructure, thereby ensuring the continuity of search-and-rescue activities and connecting people to their loved ones, and ii) detect users, such as those trapped under rubble or those who are mobile, using a Doppler-based mobility detection model. We employ an innovative beamforming method that simultaneously transmits data and detects Doppler-based mobility by integrating multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) communication and monostatic sensing within the same transmission chain. The results show that the proposed framework maintains reliable connectivity and achieves high detection accuracy of users in critical locations, reaching 90% motion detection sensitivity and 88% detection accuracy.</description>

      <title>Achievable Rate Optimization for Large Flexible Intelligent Metasurface Assisted Downlink MISO under Statistical CSI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of electromagnetic metasurfaces into wireless communications enables intelligent control of the propagation environment. Recently, flexible intelligent metasurfaces (FIMs) have evolved beyond conventional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), enabling three-dimensional surface deformation for adaptive wave manipulation. However, most existing FIM-aided system designs assume perfect instantaneous channel state information (CSI), which is impractical in large-scale networks due to the high training overhead and complicated channel estimation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a robust statistical-CSI-based optimization framework for downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems with FIM-assisted transmitters. A block coordinate ascent (BCA)-based iterative algorithm is developed to jointly optimize power allocation and FIM morphing, maximizing the average achievable sum rate. Simulation results show that the proposed statistical-CSI-driven FIM design significantly outperforms conventional rigid antenna arrays (RAAs), validating its effectiveness and practicality.</description>

      <title>Applicability and Limitation Analysis of PMU Data and Phasor Concept for Low- and High- Frequency Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) convert high-speed waveform data into low-speed phasor data, which are fundamental to wide-area monitoring and control in power systems, with oscillation detection and localization among their most prominent applications. However, representing electrical waveform signals with oscillations using PMU phasors is effective only for low-frequency oscillations. This paper investigates the root causes of this limitation, focusing on errors introduced by Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based signal processing, in addition to the attenuation effects of anti-aliasing filters, and the impact of low reporting rates. To better represent and estimate waveform signals with oscillations, we propose a more general signal model and a multi-step estimation method that leverages one-cycle DFT, the Matrix Pencil Method, and the Least Squares Method. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed signal model and estimation method. Furthermore, this paper reveals that the phasor concept, let alone PMU phasors, can become invalid for waveform signals with high-frequency oscillations characterized by asymmetric sub- and super-synchronous components. These findings highlight the fundamental limitations of PMU data and phasor concept, and emphasize the need to rely on waveform data for analyzing high-frequency oscillations in modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Uplink Anti-Jamming in LEO Mega-Constellations via Game-Theoretic Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations have become vital in emerging commercial and defense Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs). However, their predictable orbital dynamics and exposed geometries make them highly susceptible to ground-based jamming. Traditional single-satellite interference mitigation techniques struggle to spatially separate desired uplink signals from nearby jammers, even with large antenna arrays. This paper explores a distributed multi-satellite anti-jamming strategy leveraging the dense connectivity and high-speed inter-satellite links of modern LEO mega-constellations. We model the uplink interference scenario as a convex-concave game between a desired terrestrial transmitter and a jammer, each optimizing their spatial covariance matrices to maximize or minimize achievable rate. We propose an efficient min-max solver combining alternating best-response updates with projected gradient descent, achieving fast convergence of the beamforming strategy to the Nash equilibrium. Using realistic Starlink orbital geometries and Sionna ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate that while close-proximity jammers can cripple single-satellite links, distributed satellite cooperation significantly enhances resilience, shifting the capacity distribution upward under strong interference.</description>

      <title>An Iterated Hybrid Fast Parallel FIR Filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the design and optimization of parallel fast finite impulse response (FIR) filters using polyphase decomposition and iterated fast FIR algorithms (FFAs). Parallel FIR filtering enhances computational efficiency and throughput in digital signal processing (DSP) applications by enabling the simultaneous processing of multiple input samples. We revisit a prior approach to design of fast parallel filter architectures by using the iterated FFA approach where the same primitive filter, such as 2-parallel, is iterated to design the fast parallel filter. In this paper, we present yet another novel iterated fast parallel FIR filter, referred to as the fast hybrid filter. The hybrid filter iterates a transposed 2-parallel fast FIR filter in all the inner layers and a direct-form 2-parallel fast FIR filter in the outermost layer, resulting in reduced hardware complexity. Such an iterated hybrid approach has not been presented before. We show that the hybrid fast parallel filters require less number of additions compared to prior approaches.</description>

      <title>Amalgamated CHIRP and OFDM for ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) requires the development of a waveform capable of efficiently supporting both communication and sensing functionalities. This paper proposes a novel waveform that combines the benefits of both the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and the chirp waveforms to improve both the communication and sensing performance within an ISAC framework. Hence, a new architecture is proposed that utilizes the conventional communication framework while leveraging the parameters sensed at the receiver (Rx) for enhancing the communication performance. We demonstrate that the affine addition of OFDM and chirp signals results in a near constant-envelope OFDM waveform, which effectively reduces the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR), a key limitation of traditional OFDM systems. Using the OFDM framework for sensing in the conventional fashion requires the allocation of some resources for sensing, which in turn reduces communication performance. As a remedy, the proposed affine amalgam facilitates sensing through the chirp waveform without consuming communication resources, thereby preserving communication efficiency. Furthermore, a novel technique of integrating the chirp signal into the OFDM framework at the slot-level is proposed to enhance the accuracy of range estimation. The results show that the OFDM signal incorporated with chirp has better autocorrelation properties, improved root mean square error (RMSE) of range and velocity, and lower PAPR. Finally, we characterize the trade-off between communications and sensing performance.</description>

      <title>Does 6G Need a New Waveform: Comparing Zak-OTFS with CP-OFDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Across the world, there is growing interest in new waveforms, Zak-OTFS in particular, and over-the-air implementations are starting to appear. The choice between OFDM and Zak-OTFS is not so much a choice between waveforms as it is an architectural choice between preventing inter-carrier interference (ICI) and embracing ICI. In OFDM, once the Input-Output (I/O) relation is known, equalization is relatively simple, at least when there is no ICI. However, in the presence of ICI the I/O relation is non-predictable and its acquisition is non-trivial. In contrast, equalization is more involved in Zak-OTFS due to inter-symbol-interference (ISI), however the I/O relation is predictable and its acquisition is simple. {Zak-OTFS exhibits superior performance in doubly-spread 6G use cases with high delay/Doppler channel spreads (i.e., high mobility and/or large cells), but architectural choice is governed by the typical use case, today and in the future. What is typical depends to some degree on geography, since large delay spread is a characteristic of large cells which are the rule rather than the exception in many important wireless markets.} This paper provides a comprehensive performance comparison of cyclic prefix OFDM (CP-OFDM) and Zak-OTFS across the full range of 6G propagation environments. The performance results provide insights into the fundamental architectural choice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.15733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents and discusses challenges and solutions for practical issues in bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G networks. Considering orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing as the adopted waveform, a discussion on system design aiming to achieve both a desired sensing key performance indicators and limit the impact of hardware impairments is presented. In addition, signal processing techniques to enable over-the-air synchronization and generation of periodograms with range, Doppler shift, and angular information are discussed. Simulation results are then presented for a cellular-based ISAC scenario considering system parameterization compliant to current 5G and, finally, a discussion on open challenges for future deployments is presented.</description>

      <title>Joint Pilot and Unknown Data-based Localization for OFDM Opportunistic Radar Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for Sixth Generation (6G) and Wi-Fi 7 networks, with the communication-centric approach being particularly attractive due to its compatibility with current standards. Typical communication signals comprise both deterministic known pilot signals and random unknown data payloads. Most existing approaches either rely solely on pilots for positioning, thereby ignoring the radar information present in the received data symbols that constitute the majority of each frame, or rely on data decisions, which bounds positioning performance to that of the communication system. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel method that extracts positioning information from data payloads without decoding them. We consider an opportunistic scenario in which communication signals from a user are captured by an opportunistic radar equipped with a Uniform Linear Arrays of antennas. We show that, in this setting, the estimation can be efficiently implemented using Fast Fourier Transforms. Finally, we demonstrate superior localization performance compared to existing methods in the literature through numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Non-Uniform Sampling of Bandlimited Signals via Algorithm-Encoder Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an adaptive non-uniform sampling framework for bandlimited signals based on an algorithm-encoder co-design perspective. By revisiting the convergence analysis of iterative reconstruction algorithms for non-uniform measurements, we derive a local, energy-based sufficient condition that governs reconstruction behavior as a function of the signal and derivative energies within each sampling interval. Unlike classical approaches that impose a global Nyquist-type bound on the inter-sample spacing, the proposed condition permits large gaps in slowly varying regions while enforcing denser sampling only where the signal exhibits rapid temporal variation. Building on this theoretical insight, we design a variable-bias, variable-threshold integrate-and-fire time encoding machine (VBT-IF-TEM) whose firing mechanism is explicitly shaped to enforce the derived local convergence condition. To ensure robustness, a shifted-signal formulation is introduced to suppress excessive firing in regions where the magnitude of the signal amplitude is close to zero or the local signal energy approaches zero. Using the proposed encoder, an analog signal is discretely represented by time encodings and signal averages, enabling perfect reconstruction via a standard iterative algorithm even when the local sampling rate falls below the Nyquist rate. Simulation results on synthetic signals and experiments on ultrasonic guided-wave and ECG signals demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves substantial reductions in sampling density compared to uniform sampling and conventional IF-TEMs, while maintaining accurate reconstruction. The results further highlight a controllable tradeoff between sampling density, reconstruction accuracy, and convergence behavior, which can be navigated through adaptive parameter selection.</description>

      <title>Dual-Mapping Sparse Vector Transmission for Short Packet URLLC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse vector coding (SVC) is a promising short-packet transmission method for ultra reliable low latency communication (URLLC) in next generation communication systems. In this paper, a dual-mapping SVC (DM-SVC) based short packet transmission scheme is proposed to further enhance the transmission performance of SVC. The core idea behind the proposed scheme lies in mapping the transmitted information bits onto sparse vectors via block and single-element sparse mappings. The block sparse mapping pattern is able to concentrate the transmit power in a small number of non-zero blocks thus improving the decoding accuracy, while the single-element sparse mapping pattern ensures that the code length does not increase dramatically with the number of transmitted information bits. At the receiver, a two-stage decoding algorithm is proposed to sequentially identify non-zero block indexes and single-element non-zero indexes. Extensive simulation results verify that proposed DM-SVC scheme outperforms the existing SVC schemes in terms of block error rate and spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>Separable Delay And Doppler Estimation In Passive Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In passive radar, a network of distributed sensors exploit signals from so-called Illuminators-of-Opportunity to detect and localize targets. We consider the case where the IO signal is available at each receiver node through a reference channel, whereas target returns corrupted by interference are collected in a separate surveillance channel. The problem formulation is similar to an active radar that uses a noise-like waveform, or an integrated sensing and communication application. The available data is first split into batches of manageable size. In the direct approach, the target's time-delay and Doppler parameters are estimated jointly by incoherently combining the batch-wise data. We propose a new method to estimate the time-delay separately, thus avoiding a costly 2-D search. Our approach is designed for slowly moving targets, and the accuracy of the time-delay estimate is similar to that of the full batch-wise 2-D method. Given the time-delay, the coherency between batches can be restored when estimating the Doppler parameter. Thereby, the separable approach is found to yield superior Doppler estimates over a wide parameter range. In addition to reducing computational complexity, the proposed separable estimation technique also significantly reduces the communication overhead in a distributed radar setting.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Digital Beamforming mmWave MIMO with Low-Resolution DACs/ADCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future wireless communications will rely on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) beamforming operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency bands to deliver high data rates. To support flexible spatial processing and meet the demands of latency critical applications, it is essential to use fully digital mmWave MIMO beamforming, which relies on accurate channel estimation. However, ensuring power efficiency in fully digital mmWave MIMO systems requires the use of low-resolution digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). The reduced resolution of these quantizers introduces distortion in both transmitted and received signals, ultimately degrading system performance. In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation performance of mmWave MIMO systems employing fully digital beamforming with low-resolution quantization, under practical system constraints. We evaluate the system performance in terms of spectral efficiency (SE) and energy efficiency (EE). Simulation results demonstrate that a moderate quantization resolutions of 4-bit per DAC/ADC offers a favorable trade-off between energy consumption and achievable data rate.</description>

      <title>Time-Varying Rician K-factor in Measured Vehicular Channels at cmWave and mmWave Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future vehicular communication systems will integrate millimeter wave (mmWave) technology to enhance data transmission rates. To investigate the propagation effects and small-scale fading differences between mmWave and conventional centimeter wave (cmWave) bands, multi-band channel measurements have to be conducted. One key parameter to characterize small-scale fading is the Rician K-factor. In this paper, we analyze the time-varying K-factor of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) channels across multiple frequency bands, measured in an urban street environment. Specifically, we investigate three frequency bands with center frequencies of 3.2 GHz, 34.3 GHz and 62.35 GHz using measurement data with 155.5 MHz bandwidth and a sounding repetition rate of 31.25 {\mu}s. Furthermore, we analyze the relationship between K-factor and root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread. We show that the Ricean K-factor is similar at different frequency bands and that is correlated with the RMS delay spread.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Patched or Partial Holograms to allow for Whole Slide Imaging with a Self-Referencing Holographic Microscope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The last decade has seen significant advances in computer-aided diagnostics for cytological screening, mainly through the improvement and integration of scanning techniques such as whole slide imaging (WSI) and the combination with deep learning. Simultaneously, new imaging techniques such as quantitative phase imaging (QPI) are being developed to capture richer cell information with less sample preparation. So far, the two worlds of WSI and QPI have not been combined. In this work, we present a reconstruction algorithm which makes whole slide imaging of cervical smears possible by using a self-referencing three-wave digital holographic microscope. Since a WSI is constructed by combining multiple patches, the algorithm is adaptive and can be used on partial holograms and patched holograms. We present the algorithm for a single shot hologram, the adaptations to make it flexible to various inputs and show that the algorithm performs well for the tested epithelial cells. This is a preprint of our paper, which has been accepted for publication in 2026 IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging (ISBI).</description>

      <title>Performance Scaling Laws for PD Array-based Receivers in IM/DD Optical Wireless Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the performance scaling laws for electrical-domain combining in photodetector (PD) array-based receivers employing intensity modulation and direct detection, taking into account the inherent square-law relationship between the optical and electrical received powers. The performance of PD array-based systems is compared, in terms of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and achievable rate, to that of a reference receiver employing a single PD. Analytical and numerical results show that PD arrays provide performance gains for sufficiently narrow beams and above an SNR threshold. Furthermore, increasing the number of PDs alone does not enhance performance, and joint optimization of beam pattern, transverse electromagnetic mode, received power, and PD positions is necessary. Our model and derived insights provide practical guidelines and highlight the trade-offs for the design of next-generation high-bandwidth PD array receivers.</description>

      <title>Graph Topology Identification Based on Covariance Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph topology identification (GTI) is a central challenge in networked systems, where the underlying structure is often hidden, yet nodal data are available. Conventional solutions to address these challenges rely on probabilistic models or complex optimization formulations, commonly suffering from non-convexity or requiring restrictive assumptions on acyclicity or positivity. In this paper, we propose a novel covariance matching (CovMatch) framework that directly aligns the empirical covariance of the observed data with the theoretical covariance implied by an underlying graph. We show that as long as the data-generating process permits an explicit covariance expression, CovMatch offers a unified route to topology inference.
  We showcase our methodology on linear structural equation models (SEMs), showing that CovMatch naturally handles both undirected and general sparse directed graphs - whether acyclic or positively weighted - without explicit knowledge of these structural constraints. Through appropriate reparameterizations, CovMatch simplifies the graph learning problem to either a conic mixed integer program for undirected graphs or an orthogonal matrix optimization for directed graphs. Numerical results confirm that, even for relatively large graphs, our approach efficiently recovers the true topology and outperforms standard baselines in accuracy. These findings highlight CovMatch as a powerful alternative to log-determinant or Bayesian methods for GTI, paving the way for broader research on learning complex network topologies with minimal assumptions.</description>

      <title>Low-Complexity Sparse Superimposed Coding for Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16012v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse superimposed coding (SSC) has emerged as a promising technique for short-packet transmission in ultra-reliable low-latency communication scenarios. However, conventional SSC schemes often suffer from high encoding and decoding complexity due to the use of dense codebook matrices. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity SSC scheme by designing a sparse codebook structure, where each codeword contains only a small number of non-zero elements. The decoding is performed using the traditional multipath matching pursuit algorithm, and the overall complexity is significantly reduced by exploiting the sparsity of the codebook. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme achieves a favorable trade-off between BLER performance and computational complexity, and exhibits strong robustness across different transmission block lengths.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Channel Estimation with Quantized Phase Feedback for Over-the-Air Computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To reduce the signaling overhead of over-the-air computation, a hybrid channel estimation scheme is proposed, where reciprocity-based and feedback-based channel estimation are combined. In particular, the impact of quantized phase-feedback is studied while the amplitude is assumed estimated exactly. The scheme enables selecting the estimation precision of amplitude and phase separately, depending on the importance of each. Two variants of the scheme are proposed: As shown through simulations and theory, the second variant with reciprocity-based estimation of the channel phase, and optimal quantization of phase feedback, can outperform the first variant estimating the phase by feedback only.</description>

      <title>Neural Nonlinear Shrinkage of Covariance Matrices for Minimum Variance Portfolio Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a neural network-based nonlinear shrinkage estimator of covariance matrices for the purpose of minimum variance portfolio optimization. It is a hybrid approach that integrates statistical estimation with machine learning. Starting from the Ledoit-Wolf (LW) shrinkage estimator, we decompose the LW covariance matrix into its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and apply a lightweight transformer-based neural network to learn a nonlinear eigenvalue shrinkage function. Trained with portfolio risk as the loss function, the resulting precision matrix (the inverse covariance matrix) estimator directly targets portfolio risk minimization. By conditioning on the sample-to-dimension ratio, the approach remains scalable across different sample sizes and asset universes. Empirical results on stock daily returns from Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index (S&amp;P500) demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves lower out-of-sample realized risk than benchmark approaches. This highlights the promise of integrating structural statistical models with data-driven learning.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multichannel Active Noise Control with Asynchronous Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distributed multichannel active noise control (DMCANC) offers effective noise reduction across large spatial areas by distributing the computational load of centralized control to multiple low-cost nodes. Conventional DMCANC methods, however, typically assume synchronous communication and require frequent data exchange, resulting in high communication overhead. To enhance efficiency and adaptability, this work proposes an asynchronous communication strategy where each node executes a weight-constrained filtered-x LMS (WCFxLMS) algorithm and independently requests communication only when its local noise reduction performance degrades. Upon request, other nodes transmit the weight difference between their local control filter and the center point in WCFxLMS, which are then integrated to update both the control filter and the center point. This design enables nodes to operate asynchronously while preserving cooperative behavior. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed asynchronous communication DMCANC (ACDMCANC) system maintains effective noise reduction with significantly reduced communication load, offering improved scalability for heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Diversity Analysis for Terahertz Communication Systems under Small-Scale Fading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09986v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) band is a key enabler for future wireless systems, promising ultra-high data rates and dense spatial reuse. However, the reliability of THz links remains a major challenge due to severe path loss and small-scale fading effects, particularly in dynamic indoor and outdoor environments. This paper presents a comprehensive diversity analysis framework for THz communication systems under small-scale fading conditions. We model fading statistically using the generalized $\alpha$-$\mu$ distribution for indoor scenarios and the mixture of gamma (MG) model for outdoor propagation. We complement previous works that analyzed diversity under the $\alpha$-$\mu$ channels [1],[2]. In particular, we present new insights on diversity for the MG channel in addition to recovering the results of [2] using a different approach. Moreover, we derive asymptotic expressions for the bit error rate as a function of the inverse signal-to-noise ratio, recovering all of the $\alpha$-$\mu$ diversity results using a simpler approximation method. The analytical results are extensively validated through Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating excellent agreement. Our findings show that diversity gains in THz systems are strongly influenced by the number of independent paths, the severity of fading, and frequency selectivity. The proposed framework provides system designers with clear guidelines for quantifying and optimizing diversity gains in emerging channel models, paving the way for more reliable high-frequency wireless links in next-generation networks.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Band Modality Synergy Based Multi-User Beam Prediction and Proactive BS Selection with Zero Pilot Overhead</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15136v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-user millimeter-wave communication relies on narrow beams and dense cell deployments to ensure reliable connectivity. However, tracking optimal beams for multiple mobile users across multiple base stations (BSs) results in significant signaling overhead. Recent works have explored the capability of out-of-band (OOB) modalities in obtaining spatial characteristics of wireless channels and reducing pilot overhead in single-BS single-user/multi-user systems. However, applying OOB modalities for multi-BS selection towards dense cell deployments leads to high coordination overhead, i.e, excessive computing overhead and high latency in data exchange. How to leverage OOB modalities to eliminate pilot overhead and achieve efficient multi-BS coordination in multi-BS systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel OOB modality synergy (OMS) based mobility management scheme to realize multi-user beam prediction and proactive BS selection by synergizing two OOB modalities, i.e., vision and location. Specifically, mobile users are initially identified via spatial alignment of visual sensing and location feedback, and then tracked according to the temporal correlation in image sequence. Subsequently, a binary encoding map based gain and beam prediction network (BEM-GBPN) is designed to predict beamforming gains and optimal beams for mobile users at each BS, such that a central unit can control the BSs to perform user handoff and beam switching. Simulation results indicate that the proposed OMS-based mobility management scheme enhances beam prediction and BS selection accuracy and enables users to achieve 91% transmission rates of the optimal with zero pilot overhead and significantly improve multi-BS coordination efficiency compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Distance-Domain Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field Region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.01227v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays operating in the near-field regime unlock additional spatial resources, which can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction. This work investigates the distance-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), defined as the DoF when a user varies only its distance to the base station and not the angle. To obtain the distance-domain DoF, we study a line-of-sight (LoS) channel with a source representing a base station and an observation region representing users, where the source is a large two-dimensional transmit (Tx) array with arbitrary shape and the observation region is an arbitrarily long linear receive (Rx) array with collinearly aligned elements located at different distances from the Tx array. We assume that both the Tx and Rx arrays have continuous apertures with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the distance-domain DoF in the case of a finite number of elements. First, we analyze an ideal case where the Tx array is a single piece and the Rx array is on the broadside of the Tx array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the distance-domain DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the distance-domain DoF is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of both the Tx and Rx arrays rather than their detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method that converts the problem to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend the analytical framework to modular arrays and show the distance-domain DoF gain over a single-piece array under a fixed total physical length.</description>

      <title>Secure Energy Efficient Wireless Transmission: A Finite v/s Infinite-Horizon RL Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a joint optimal allocation of transmit power at the source and jamming power at the destination is proposed to maximize the average secrecy energy efficiency (SEE) of a wireless network within a finite time duration. The destination transmits the jamming signal to improve secrecy by utilizing full-duplex capability. The source and destination both have energy harvesting (EH) capability with limited battery capacity. Due to the Markov nature of the system, the problem is formulated as a finite-horizon reinforcement learning (RL) problem. We propose the finite-horizon joint power allocation (FHJPA) algorithm for the finite-horizon RL problem and compare it with a low-complexity greedy algorithm (GA). An infinite-horizon joint power allocation (IHJPA) algorithm is also proposed for the corresponding infinite-horizon problem. A comparative analysis of these algorithms is carried out in terms of SEE, expected total transmitted secure bits, and computational complexity. The results show that the FHJPA algorithm outperforms the GA and IHJPA algorithms due to its appropriate modelling in finite horizon transmission. When the source node battery has sufficient energy, the GA can yield performance close to the FHJPA algorithm despite its low-complexity. When the transmission time horizon increases, the accuracy of the infinite-horizon model improves, resulting in a reduced performance gap between FHJPA and IHJPA algorithms. The computational time comparison shows that the FHJPA algorithm takes $16.6$ percent less time than the IHJPA algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Bistatic radar measurements offer unique spatial diversity and enhanced target characterization capabilities, rendering them increasingly vital for contemporary sensing application research. The reliability of such measurements is contingent upon precise system and antenna calibration. The prevailing technique is the substitution method, which involves the use of known reference objects. We propose an over-the-air calibration algorithm for spherical bistatic measurement systems. Our method is both significantly simpler and twice as fast as existing algorithms. The application of our technique to reflectivity measurements of a metal sphere from 76 to 81 GHz demonstrates a dynamic range enhancement of up to 40 dB when compared with uncalibrated data. A comparison with simulation data demonstrates a high degree of agreement between measurement and simulation.</description>

      <title>On the Performance of Dual-Antenna Repeater Assisted Bi-Static MIMO ISAC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.17980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for target detection and downlink data transmission in a repeater-assisted bi-static integrated sensing and communication system. A repeater is an active scatterer that retransmits incoming signals with a complex gain almost instantaneously, thereby enhancing sensing performance by amplifying the echoes reflected by the targets. The same mechanism can also improve downlink communication by mitigating coverage holes. However, the repeater introduces noise and increases interference at the sensing receiver, while also amplifying the interference from target detection signals at the downlink users. The proposed framework accounts for these sensing-communication trade-offs and demonstrates the potential benefits achievable through a carefully designed precoder at the transmitting base station. In particular, our finding is that a higher value of probability of detection can be attained with considerably lower target radar-cross-section variance by deploying repeaters in the target hot-spot areas.</description>

      <title>Data-driven tool wear prediction in milling, based on a process-integrated single-sensor approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19950v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including transformer-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on two machines and on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving 99.1\% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.</description>

      <title>You May Use the Same Channel Knowledge Map for Environment-Aware NLoS Sensing and Communication</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03589v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As one of the key usage scenarios for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) provides an efficient framework to achieve simultaneous wireless sensing and communication. However, traditional wireless sensing techniques mainly rely on the line-of-sight (LoS) assumptions, i.e., the sensing targets are directly visible to both the sensing transmitter and receiver. This hinders ISAC systems to be applied in complex environments such as the urban low-altitude airspace, which usually suffers from signal blockage and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) multi-path propagation. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a novel approach to enable environment-aware NLoS ISAC by leveraging the new technique called channel knowledge map (CKM), which was originally proposed for environment-aware wireless communications. One major novelty of our proposed method is that the same CKM built for wireless communication can be directly used to enable NLoS wireless sensing, thus enjoying the benefits of ``killing two birds with one stone''. To this end, the sensing targets are treated as virtual user equipment (UE), and the wireless communication channel priors are transformed into the sensing channel priors, allowing one single CKM to serve dual purposes. We illustrate our proposed framework by a specific CKM called \emph{channel angle-delay map} (CADM). Specifically, the proposed framework utilizes CADM to derive angle-delay priors of the sensing channel by exploiting the relationship between communication and sensing angle-delay distributions, enabling sensing target localization in the challenging NLoS environment. Extensive simulation results demonstrate significant performance improvements over classic geometry-based sensing methods, which is further validated by Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) analysis.</description>
