      <title>Static four-charge squashed black hole in five-dimensional $STU-W^2U$ supergravity and its thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a remarkably simple expression for the exact solution to the $D = 5$, $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supergravity coupled to three vector multiplets with the prepotential $\mathcal{V} = STU -W^2U \equiv 1$, which represents a five-dimensional static Kaluza-Klein black hole with squashed $S^3$ horizons and four independent electric charges. It is asymptotically locally flat and has a spatial infinity $R \times S^1 \hookrightarrow S^2$. We compute its conserved charges via the counterterm method and demonstrate that the thermodynamic quantities satisfy both the first law and Bekenstein-Smarr mass formula, provided the length of the compact extra dimension is treated as a thermodynamic variable.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Vortex Strings after a Thermal Quench in a Holographic Superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous phase transitions exhibits nonequilibrium universality. While the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts universal scaling of point-like defect numbers under slow driving, the statistical properties of extended defects remain largely unexplored across both slow and fast protocols. We investigate vortex string formation in a three-dimensional holographic superfluid. For slow quenches, the vortex string number follows KZM scaling, while for rapid quenches, it exhibits complementary universal scaling governed by the final temperature. Beyond the vortex string number, the loop-length distribution reveals a richer structure: individual loops follow the first-return statistics of three-dimensional random walks, $P(\ell) \sim \ell^{-5/2}$. While the total vortex length distribution remains Gaussian, its cumulants obey universal scaling laws with varying power-law exponents, and thus differ markedly from those observed in point-defect systems, indicating distinct statistical features of extended topological defects.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable 1+1d Chiral Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the modified Villain lattice Hamiltonian formulation of the 1+1d compact boson theory, we construct exactly solvable abelian chiral lattice gauge theories in two spacetime dimensions. As a concrete example, we derive an explicit quadratic lattice Hamiltonian for the "34-50" chiral gauge theory. We further show that $N$ copies of the modified Villain theory realize the $O(N,N;\mathbb{Z})$ T-duality transformations, which we then use to solve and analyze these lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Entanglement scaling and dynamics in the Sauter-Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14390v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum field theory, entanglement entropy under spatial bipartitioning serves as a powerful information-theoretic probe of quantum correlations. In this work, we present the first comprehensive numerical study of the dynamical evolution and geometric scaling of entanglement entropy in a nonperturbative, strong-field QED setting -- specifically, in the context of the Sauter-Schwinger effect. While the weak-field regime is dominated by area-law states, we show that the entanglement entropy undergoes a transition from area-law to a volume-law scaling for certain strong-field regimes in the pulse-profile parameter space -- signaling a fundamental shift in the underlying correlation structure induced by nonperturbative pair production. For intermediate regimes, the scaling is a power-law that interpolates between area- and volume-law behavior. Finally, we provide interpretations based on the behavior of the low-energy pair-creation spectrum and discuss how these insights could inform future investigations of related phenomena.</description>

      <title>Orbital Structure of 6-Point MHV Gravity Forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We search for a logarithmic 3-form representing the 6-point MHV gravity amplitude, requiring poles only on physical channels and residues matching factorization. Working in the Orlik-Solomon algebra on a De Concini-Procesi wonderful model, we restrict to the S3 x S3 invariant subspace and impose factorization boundary-by-boundary. The intersection of ten compatible 3|3 channels with two compatible 2-particle channels collapses to a unique one-dimensional candidate line. However, enforcing factorization on a crossing channel obstructs any single-valued global representative. We find that an orbit-mixed form, a linear combination over 20 permutation images indexed by bipartitions, satisfies the crossing constraint. This is consistent with a local-system picture: the global gravity form lives in a rank-20 bundle whose monodromy mixes bipartition chambers rather than flipping a single sign. All code and data are provided for reproducibility.</description>

      <title>Amplifying the Cosmological Collider with Ghost Spectators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ghost inflation is a well-known framework in which cosmological fluctuations can generate enhanced primordial non-Gaussianity, typically of the equilateral type. In its original form, however, it is in tension with current observational constraints. Here we instead consider a setup in which a standard inflaton drives the background evolution, while excitations of a ghost condensate act as spectator fields that interact with the inflaton. This proposal fits naturally within the cosmological collider program: the exchanged particle has a modified dispersion relation, $\omega \propto k^2$. We show that this ghost-inspired dynamics weakens the usual Boltzmann suppression, similarly to models with a very small effective sound speed, yielding an enhanced bispectrum signal relative to standard cosmological collider scenarios. At the same time, the horizon-crossing scale remains a free parameter of the theory. As a result, the model shares features of both the de Sitter bootstrap and boostless frameworks. Finally, we derive the differential equations governing cosmological correlators in the ghost-collider setup. Their structure reflects the quadratic momentum dependence of the dispersion relation and distinguishes this scenario from conventional relativistic cases.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of ideal spin fluids and pseudo-gauge ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conserved currents of relativistic spin fluids derived from microscopic models are known to violate local thermodynamic relations. We present a systematic analysis of pseudo-gauge improvements in ideal spin hydrodynamics and identify a family of pseudo-gauges where standard thermodynamic relations are satisfied. We quantify pseudo-gauge ambiguities in the spin equation of state and derive universal thermodynamic relations that apply to conserved currents in any pseudo-gauge. As an application, we extract the thermodynamic variables and equations of state for free Dirac fermions and scalar fields.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any quantum field theory, or more generally any probability distribution over tempered distributions in $\mathbb{R}^d$, admits a neural network description with a countable infinity of parameters. As an example, we realize the $2d$ Liouville theory as a neural network and numerically compute the three-point function of vertex operators, finding agreement with the DOZZ formula.</description>

      <title>From Quantum Amplitudes to Spacetime Geometry: a Multipolar Framework for Black Hole Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis develops a unified framework that reconstructs the full classical content of General Relativity from the classical limit of quantum scattering amplitudes. By interpreting the analytic structure of amplitudes as the field-theoretic imprint of spacetime geometry, the work establishes a direct correspondence between quantum processes and classical gravitational observables such as metrics, deflection angles, and multipole moments. Starting from the effective-field-theory description of gravity, the thesis shows that loop amplitudes encode not only quantum corrections but also the nonlinear classical self-interaction of the gravitational field, enabling the systematic derivation of the post-Minkowskian expansion of gravitational quantities by rewriting the Einstein equations in terms of graviton scattering processes. Building upon this foundation, the framework is applied to rotating and charged sources in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. A momentum-space formulation of the energy-momentum tensor is then developed, introducing gravitational form factors and source multipoles that link, for the first time, the internal matter distribution to the external multipolar field in a completely relativistic framework. Furthermore, the thesis completes the transition from the microscopic amplitude picture to the macroscopic description of gravitational sources by engineering a multipole-based framework for black hole mimickers, then applied to build horizon-less compact objects mimicking the multipolar structure of Kerr black holes. Finally, exploiting the Kerr-Schild gauge, the Fourier transforms of rotating black hole metrics are computed in closed form, bridging perturbative and non-perturbative descriptions of gravity, and allowing to probe the multipolar structure of higher-dimensional solutions employing scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factors of the proton in the improved holographic QCD model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the gluonic contribution to the gravitational form factors of the proton using the improved holographic QCD model, in which the proton is described in terms of bulk Dirac fermions. Model parameters are constrained using lattice and phenomenological input, allowing us to obtain estimates for the gravitational form factors and to compare them with results from other approaches. The resulting $\mathcal{D}(t)$ form factor is found to exhibit an infrared pole in our framework. Using the extracted form factors, we analyze mechanical properties of the proton, including pressure and shear distributions. We obtain estimates of $\rho_\text{mech} = 0.95$ fm and $\rho_\text{mass} = 0.61$ fm for the mechanical and the mass radii of the proton, respectively, which are similar to values in other nonperturbative studies.</description>

      <title>Carroll hydrodynamics with spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate Carroll hydrodynamics with the inclusion of a spin current. Our strategy relies on the fact that the $c\to 0$ limit of relativistic hydrodynamics yields the equations of Carroll hydrodynamics. Starting with the pre-ultralocal parametrization of the background geometry and the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom for a relativistic fluid endowed with a spin current, the $c\to 0$ limit produces Carroll hydrodynamics with spin. It is known that boost-invariant hydrodynamic models for ultrarelativistic fluids relevant for the physics of quark-gluon plasma, such as Bjorken and Gubser flow, are manifestations of Carroll hydrodynamics under appropriate geometric choices for the underlying Carrollian structure. In this work, we further this mapping between such boost-invariant models and Carroll hydrodynamics, now with the inclusion of a spin current.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we have developed general algorithm for finding all orbifolds of Berglund-Hubsch-type Calabi-Yau manifolds and their mirrors. An explicit construction is formulated for finding all admissible deformations and groups defining mirror pairs of orbifolds. Then using our algorithm for one of the Calabi-Yau manifolds, defined by a Fermat-type polynomial, we found all mirror pairs of orbifolds. For this model, for each pair of orbifolds, the number of generations and the number of singlets i.e. particles participating only in gravitational interactions (dark matter particles) were found.</description>

      <title>Critical and multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points in the local potential approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multicritical generalizations of the Lee-Yang universality class arise as renormalization-group fixed points of scalar field theories with complex $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ interaction, $n\in\mathbb{N}$, just below their upper critical dimension. It has been recently conjectured that their continuation to two dimensions corresponds to the non-unitary conformal minimal models $\mathcal{M}(2,2n+3)$. Motivated by that, we revisit the functional renormalization group approach to complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric scalar field theories in the Local Potential Approximation, without or with wavefunction renormalization (LPA and LPA' respectively), aiming to explore the fate of the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ theories from their upper critical dimension to two dimensions. The $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points are identified using a perturbative expansion of the functional fixed-point equation near their upper critical dimensions, and they are followed to lower dimensions by numerical integration of the full equation. A peculiar feature of the complex $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric potentials is that the fixed points are characterized by real but negative anomalous dimensions $\eta$, and in low dimension $d$, this can lead to a change of sign of the scaling dimensions $\Delta=(d-2+\eta)/2$, thus requiring a novel analysis of the analytical properties of the functional fixed-point equations. We are able to follow the Lee-Yang universality class ($n=1$) down to two dimensions, and numerically determine the scaling dimension of the fundamental field as a function of $d$. On the other hand, within the LPA', multicritical Lee-Yang fixed points with $n&gt;1$ cannot be continued to $d=2$ due to the existence of unexpected non-perturbative fixed points that annihilate with the $i\varphi^{2n+1}$ fixed points.</description>

      <title>Five-point partial waves, splitting constraints and hidden zeros</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the partial-wave expansion of residues of five-point tree-amplitude involving identical scalar particles in the external legs. We check the construction using massive spinor-helicity building blocks and by matching to the tree-level five-point Veneziano amplitude at fixed mass levels. As an application, we express five-point splitting constraints - the reduction of the five-point amplitude to products of four-point amplitudes on special kinematic loci - as linear relations among the five-point partial-wave coefficients. At low mass levels these constraints, together with spin truncation, fix the full five-point partial-wave data in terms of the four-point coefficients and imply simple compatibility conditions; remarkably, imposing two independent splitting loci also forces the residue to vanish on their intersection, making the associated hidden zero manifest in partial-wave space. We also show that once both channels allow spin-2 exchange a genuine kernel can remain, indicating the need for additional higher-point input to achieve complete rigidity.</description>

      <title>On the DGKT brane dual and its decoupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is not understood whether scale-separated AdS vacua in string theory admit a holographic dual. A well-known class of such vacua is provided by the DGKT solutions of massive type IIA string theory, where scale separation arises from large fluxes. In this work, we construct a ten-dimensional brane geometry whose near-horizon limit reproduces the DGKT vacua, using a flux-backtracking approach combined with intersecting D4-brane stacks dual to the unbounded flux sector. We then use this setup to test whether the brane worldvolume theory decouples from the bulk. Modes localised near the branes, deep in the AdS throat, are found to be infinitely redshifted with respect to asymptotic observers. Moreover, an analysis of graviton fluctuations shows the presence of an infinite potential barrier near the branes, providing a direct indication of decoupling. We conclude by comparing these results with recent arguments against decoupling in scale-separated AdS vacua, which focus on the asymptotic region where modes are blueshifted.</description>

      <title>De Sitter Momentum Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a natural and nonperturbative momentum space for quantum field theory on $(d+1)$-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime in the Poincar\'e slicing, adapted to early Universe cosmology. In particular, we identify the dS frequency as the unitary-representation label of the dS isometry group $\mathrm{SO}(1, d+1)$. By diagonalizing the quadratic Casimir together with spatial translations, we provide a harmonic expansion of operators in what we call the Kontorovitch-Lebedev-Fourier (KLF) space. This momentum space shares many structural properties with its Minkowski counterpart, for instance: equations of motion reduce to algebraic equations, and the quadratic dynamics provides a simple propagator analogous to flat space. We reformulate the perturbative computation of in-in correlators in KLF momentum space, showing from first principles how time integrals turn into frequency-space integrals over meromorphic functions. We show how our construction streamlines computations, naturally accommodates the contributions from principal and complementary series in the K\"all\'en-Lehmann spectral decomposition of composite operators, and leads to an inversion formula for the spectral density.</description>

      <title>The phase of de Sitter higher spin gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The one-loop Euclidean partition function on the sphere is known to exhibit a nontrivial phase for massless fields of spin greater than one. Such a phase appears to be in tension with a state counting interpretation of the partition function and its relation to the de Sitter entropy. It has been recently argued that the phase associated with the gravitational path integral can be cancelled by including the contribution of an observer. In this note, we compute the total phase of Vasiliev higher spin gravity on the sphere by summing over the contributions of all spins. We evaluate the resulting infinite sum using two different regularization schemes, obtaining consistent results. We find that for the non-minimal Vasiliev theory, which includes massless fields of all integer spins, the total phase vanishes in all dimensions. This result suggests that the sphere partition function of these theories may be consistent with a counting interpretation, without explicitly including an observer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11738v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article develops a comprehensive theory of multiary graded polyadic algebras, extending the classical concept of group-graded algebras to higher-arity structures. We introduce the notion of grading by multiary groups and investigate various compatibility conditions between the arity of algebra operations and grading group operations. Key results include quantization rules connecting arities, classification of graded homomorphisms, and concrete examples including ternary superalgebras and polynomial algebras over $n$-ary matrices. The theory reveals fundamentally new phenomena not present in the binary case, such as the existence of higher power gradings and nontrivial constraints on arity compatibility.</description>

      <title>DeepInflation: an AI agent for research and model discovery of inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present \textbf{DeepInflation}, an AI agent designed for research and model discovery in inflationary cosmology. Built upon a multi-agent architecture, \textbf{DeepInflation} integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a symbolic regression (SR) engine and a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) knowledge base. This framework enables the agent to automatically explore and verify the vast landscape of inflationary potentials while grounding its outputs in established theoretical literature. We demonstrate that \textbf{DeepInflation} can successfully discover simple and viable single-field slow-roll inflationary potentials consistent with the latest observations (here ACT DR6 results as example) or any given $n_s$ and $r$, and provide accurate theoretical context for obscure inflationary scenarios. \textbf{DeepInflation} serves as a prototype for a new generation of autonomous scientific discovery engines in cosmology, which enables researchers and non-experts alike to explore the inflationary landscape using natural language. This agent is available at https://github.com/pengzy-cosmo/DeepInflation.</description>

      <title>From MOND entropy to extended uncertainty principles: A unified framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the relation between generalised entropies and the extended uncertainty principle (EUP) models. Starting from the higher-order extended uncertainty principle (HOEUP), we obtain the modified entropy-area relation. Then, we derive the modified Friedmann equations through three different approaches: the first law of thermodynamics at the apparent horizon, the entropic gravity case, and the emergence of cosmic space. Furthermore, we check the validity of the generalised second law (GSL). Notably, HOEUP modified Friedmann equations are the limiting cases of those obtained from a recently proposed novel entropy, which is derived from Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) [{\it Phys. Dark Universe} {\bf 49} (2025) 101967]. Motivated by this connection, we derive a novel EUP, referred to as MOND EUP, from a reverse procedure. This novel EUP reproduces to EUP relations associated with R\'enyi and dual Kaniadakis entropies in the limiting cases. Moreover, we show that HOEUP corresponds to perturbative limit of MOND entropy. The main new result of this paper is a reverse procedure beginning from a recently proposed novel MOND entropy to construct a unified EUP. This reverse procedure is not limited with the present case. In principle, the method can be applied to other generalised entropy formalisms, suggesting that our findings may establish a unified framework that bridges the generalised entropies, cutoff mechanisms, and EUP models. In particular, the corresponding modified uncertainty principles may have effective cutoff mechanisms for the entropy forms, which do not explicitly display cutoff mechanisms. Thus, these entropies may have cutoff mechanism due to their corresponding modified uncertainty principles.</description>

Abstract: Discretely self-similar solutions govern critical gravitational collapse and have been known only numerically since Choptuik's pioneering work. We construct, in closed analytic form, an infinite family of such solutions of the Einstein-massless-Klein-Gordon system using the large-D expansion. We characterize their structure and compare them with numerical critical solutions at finite D, identifying both universal features and distinctly large-D behavior.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Many-Body Approach for Orbital Magnetism in Correlated Multiband Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Orbital magnetism is a purely quantum phenomenon that reflects intrinsic electronic properties of solids, yet its microscopic description in interacting multiband systems remains incomplete. We develop a general quantum many-body framework for orbital magnetic responses based on the Luttinger-Ward functional. Starting from the Dyson equation, we reformulate the thermodynamic potential in a weak magnetic field and construct a controlled expansion in powers of $B$ applicable to correlated electron systems. A key technical advance is a modified ``Fourier'' representation using noncommutative coordinates, which allows the thermodynamic potential to be expressed in an effective momentum space where the magnetic field acts perturbatively. This formulation makes analytic progress possible within the Moyal algebra. As an application, we derive the spontaneous orbital magnetization and express it entirely in terms of the zero-field Hamiltonian renormalized by the self-energy. For frequency-dependent but Hermitian self-energies, we generalize the orbital magnetic moment and Berry curvature to momentum-frequency space and identify two gauge-invariant contributions built from these quantities. For frequency-independent self-energies the result reduces to the familiar geometric formula for noninteracting systems. This framework provides a unified foundation for computing orbital magnetic responses in correlated multiband materials.</description>

      <title>Deconfined quantum criticality with internal supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) describes direct, non-fine-tuned quantum phase transition between two ordered phases that break distinct and seemingly unrelated symmetries, providing a route to continuous phase transition beyond the conventional Ginzburg--Landau paradigm. In this work we extend the DQCP paradigm to systems with internal supersymmetry (SUSY), where the on-site Hilbert space furnishes a representation of a Lie superalgebra, and the Hamiltonian is invariant under the corresponding Lie supergroup. Focusing on the minimal supersymmetric generalization of spin $SU(2)$, namely $OSp(1|2)$, we propose a supersymmetric deconfined quantum critical point (sDQCP) between a phase that breaks internal $OSp(1|2)$ and a phase that instead breaks lattice rotation symmetry. We formulate a non-linear sigma model on the supersphere target space that captures the symmetry intertwinement characteristic of the sDQCP, and we further develop a gauge theory description to address its dynamical properties, including a heuristic argument for 3D XY critical behavior. Finally, we show that explicitly breaking $OSp(1|2)$ down to $SU(2)$ continuously connects our sDQCP to the conventional DQCP scenario.</description>

      <title>Acoustic phonons in a magnetized vacuum? First-principle lattice results on the mass spectrum of the electroweak model in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use numerical Monte Carlo simulations to determine the mass spectrum of the bosonic sector of the electroweak model in an external magnetic field of the electroweak-scale strength ($10^{20}\,{\rm T}$) at zero temperature. It is known that as the magnetic field gets stronger, the electroweak vacuum undergoes two consecutive crossover-type transitions, passing from (i) the conventional symmetry-broken homogeneous phase to (ii) an intermediate inhomogeneous vortex phase characterized by a (superconducting) condensate of electrically charged $W$ bosons and then to (iii) a homogeneous phase with a restored electroweak symmetry. We show that the spin component of the $W$ boson aligned with the direction of the magnetic field is the lightest excitation in all three phases. Its mass continuously decreases in the low-field broken phase and becomes very small in the intermediate phase. We argue that this nearly massless excitation corresponds to a Goldstone acoustic phonon mode associated with vibrations of the lattice of electroweak vortices. In the high-field symmetry-restored phase, where the vortices disappear, the lightest $W$ mass rises again. Neither Higgs nor $Z$ boson masses vanish across all studied phases and crossover transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.14580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that symmetry need not be restored in the Pati-Salam model, so that $SU(2)_L\otimes SU(2)_R\otimes SU(4)_c$ remains broken to the Standard Model group at temperatures above the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale. Including the leading finite-temperature corrections, suitable quartic couplings prevent a restoration transition, thereby avoiding the thermal production of 't Hooft-Polyakov monopoles after inflation, even if the reheating temperature is very high. This removes monopole-based constraints on the Pati-Salam symmetry breaking scale.</description>

      <title>Probing Late-Stage Hadronic Interactions at High Baryon Density via $K^{*0}$ Production in the RHIC Beam Energy Scan Program</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A precision measurement of the $K^{*0}$ meson yield is reported in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7,\; 11.5,\; 14.6,\; 19.6,$ and $27~\mathrm{GeV}$ using the high-statistics data sample collected by the STAR experiment during the Beam Energy Scan II (BES-II) program at RHIC. The transeverse momentum ($p_{T}$)-integrated yield ratios $(K^{*0} + \overline{K^{*0}})/(K^{+} + K^{-})$ in central collisions show a suppression relative to peripheral collisions at the $(1.7\text{-}3.6)\,\sigma$ level, while a thermal model without final-stage rescattering overpredicts this ratio with a deviation of $(6.9\text{-}8.2)\,\sigma$. These results indicate a loss of the measured $K^{*0}$ signal in central collisions due to re-scattering of its hadronic decay products in the hadronic phase. The $p_{T}$-integrated yield of charged kaons exhibits an approximate scaling with charged-particle multiplicity, independent of collision energy and system size. A similar trend is observed for the short-lived $K^{*0}$ resonance, although significant deviations emerge at lower energies. At BES energies, the $K^{*0}/K$ ratio shows stronger suppression than at the highest RHIC and LHC energies within a given multiplicity bin, particularly in central and mid-central collisions. This behavior is consistent with changes in the effective hadronic interaction cross section and is supported by transport model calculations, which indicate dominant meson-baryon interactions at lower energies and meson-meson interactions at higher energies.</description>

      <title>Exact general solutions for cosmological scalar field evolution in a vacuum-energy dominated expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15226v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive exact general solutions (as opposed to attractor particular solutions) for the evolution of a scalar field $\phi$ in a universe dominated by a background fluid with equation of state parameter $w_B = -1$, extending earlier work on exact solutions with $w_B &gt; -1$. Straightfoward exact solutions exist when the evolution is described by a linear differential equation, corresponding to constant, linear, and quadratic potentials. In the nonlinear case, exact solutions are derived for $V = V_0\ln \phi$, $V = V_0 \phi^{1/2}$ and $V = V_0/\phi$, and the logarithmic potential also yields an exact first integral. These complicated parametric solutions are considerably less useful than those derived previously for a universe dominated by a barotropic fluid such as matter or radiation with $w_B &gt; -1$. However, we generalize the slow-roll approximation and show that it applies to all sufficiently flat potentials in the case of a vacuum-dominated expansion, while it never applies when the universe is dominated by a background fluid with $w_B &gt; -1$.</description>

      <title>Quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity -- Part I: Classical reduction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11741v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the non-perturbative reduced phase space quantization of causal diamonds in (2+1)-dimensional gravity with a nonpositive cosmological constant. In this Part I we focus on the classical reduction process, and the description of the reduced phase space, while in Part II we discuss the quantization of the phase space and quantum aspects of the causal diamonds. The system is defined as the domain of dependence of a spacelike topological disk with fixed boundary metric. By solving the constraints in a constant-mean-curvature time gauge and removing all the spatial gauge redundancy, we find that the phase space is the cotangent bundle of Diff^+(S^1)/PSL(2,R), i.e., the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of the circle modulo the projective special linear subgroup. Classically, the states correspond to causal diamonds embedded in AdS_3 (or Mink_3 if $\Lambda = 0$), with fixed corner length, and whose Cauchy surfaces have the topology of a disc.</description>

      <title>Neural Ordinary Differential Equations for Mapping the Magnetic QCD Phase Diagram via Holography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.12772v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The QCD phase diagram is crucial for understanding strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions, with major implications for cosmology, neutron stars, and heavy-ion collisions. We present a novel holographic QCD model utilizing neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to map the QCD phase diagram under magnetic field $B$, baryon chemical potential $\mu_B$, and temperature $T$. By solving the inverse problem of constructing a gravitational theory from Lattice QCD data, we reveal an unprecedentedly rich phase structure at finite $B$, including multiple critical endpoints (CEPs) in strong magnetic fields. Specifically, for {$B = 1.618 \, \mathrm{GeV}^2=2.592 \times 10^{19}$ Gauss}, we identify two distinct CEPs at $(T_C = 87.3 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 115.9 \, \mathrm{MeV})$ and $(T_C = 78.9 \, \mathrm{MeV}, \, \mu_C = 244.0 \, \mathrm{MeV})$. Notably, the critical exponents vary depending on the CEP's location, and the conventional scaling relations can be violated in the presence of strong magnetic fields. These findings significantly advance our understanding of the QCD phase structure and provide concrete predictions for experimental validation at upcoming facilities such as FAIR, JPARC-HI, and NICA.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In quantum systems, purification can map mixed states into pure states and a non-unitary evolution into a unitary one by enlarging the Hilbert space. We establish a connection between the complexities of mixed quantum states and their purification, proposing new inequalities among these complexities. By examining single qubits, two-qubit Werner states, eight-dimensional Gaussian random unitary ensembles, and infinite-dimensional systems, we demonstrate how these relationships manifest across a broad class of systems. We find that the spread complexity of purification of a vacuum state evolving into a thermal state equals the average number of Rindler particles. This complexity is also shown to adhere to the Lloyd-like bound, indicating a further relation to the quantum speed limit. Finally, using mutual Krylov complexity, we observe subadditivity of the Krylov complexities, which contrasts with known results from holographic volume complexity. We put forward Krylov mutual complexity as a diagnosis of a potential gravity dual of Krylov complexities.</description>

Abstract: We provide a comprehensive picture for the formulation of the perfect fluid in the modern effective field theory formalism at both the classical and quantum level. Due to the necessity of decomposing the hydrodynamical variables $(\rho, p, u^\mu)$ into other internal degrees of freedom, the procedure is inherently not unique. We discuss and compare the different inequivalent formulations. These theories possess a peculiarity: the presence of an infinite dimensional symmetry implying a vanishing dispersion relation $\omega = 0$ for the transverse modes. This sets the stage for UV-IR mixing in the quantum theory, which we study in the different formulations focussing on the incompressible limit. We observe that the dispersion relation gets modified by quantum effects to become $\omega \propto \mathbf{k}^2$, where the fundamental excitations can be viewed as vortex-anti-vortex pairs. The spectrum exhibits infinitely many types of degenerate quanta. The unusual sensitivity to UV quantum fluctuations renders the implementation of the defining infinite symmetry somewhat subtle. However we present a lattice regularization that preserves a deformed version of such symmetry.</description>

      <title>A localising AdS$_3$ sigma model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct a CFT with $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb{R})_k$ symmetry at the `tensionless' point $k=3$, which is distinct from the usual $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})_{k=3}$ WZW model. This new CFT is much simpler than the generic WZW model: in particular its three-point functions feature momentum-conserving delta functions, and its higher-point functions localise to covering map configurations in moduli space. We establish the consistency of the theory by explicitly deriving the four-point function from the three-point data via a sum over conformal blocks. The main motivation for our construction comes from holography, and we show that various simple supersymmetric holographic dualities for $k_{\rm s}=1$ ($k=3$) can be constructed by replacing the $\mathrm{AdS}_3$ factor on the worldsheet with this alternative theory. This includes in particular the prototypical case of $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathbb{T}^4$, as well as the recently discussed example of $\mathrm{AdS}_3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{S}^3 \times \mathrm{S}^1$. However, our analysis does not require supersymmetry and also applies to bosonic ${\rm AdS}_3$ backgrounds (at $k=3$).</description>

      <title>Explicit construction of states in orbifolds of products of $N=2$ Superconformal ADE Minimal models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.21992v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the explicit construction of fields in orbifolds of products of $N=(2,2)$ minimal models, developed by A. Belavin, V. Belavin and S. Parkhomenko to include minimal models with D and E-type modular invariants. It is shown that spectral flow twisting by the elements of admissible group $G_{\text{adm}}$, which is used in the construction of the orbifold, is consistent with the nondiagonal pairing of D and E-type minimal models. We obtain the complete set of fields of the orbifold from the mutual locality and other requirements of the conformal bootstrap. The collection of mutually local primary fields is labeled by the elements of dual group $G^{*}_{\text{adm}}$. The permutation of $G_{\text{adm}}$ and $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ is given by the mirror spectral flow construction of the fields and maps the space of states of the original $G_{\text{adm}}$ orbifold onto the space of states of $G^*_{\text{adm}}$ orbifold. We show that this transformation is by construction a mirror isomorphism of spaces of states. Thus, mirror isomorphism of states is built into the construction. We illustrate our approach for the orbifolds of $\textbf{A}_{2}\textbf{E}_7^{3}$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instanton contributions in 2d string theory are known to include subtle numerical factors $\zeta_n$ closely related to a contour prescription in multi-instanton string amplitudes. Both ingredients appear to be ambiguous due to a degeneracy between $(1,n)$-ZZ instantons and $n$ (1,1)-ZZ instantons in the linear dilaton background. We resolve this ambiguity using insights from the dual matrix quantum mechanics where the multipliers $\zeta_n$ can be derived from an integral representation of the scattering phase and follow from the median resummation prescribed by resurgence theory. We evaluate multi-instanton string amplitudes in the theory compactified on a circle of finite radius for arbitrary number of instantons and show that they reproduce the matrix model predictions provided the Lorentzian contour prescription is used for their evaluation. We also show that the non-perturbative free energy matches the structure of the D-instanton induced string field theory effective action, which suggests the vanishing of contributions from worldsheet topologies of negative Euler number.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational helicity flux density represents the angular distribution of helicity flux in general relativity. In this work, we explore its relationship to the reduction of topological invariants at future null infinity. Contrary to initial expectations, the Pontryagin term, which contributes to the gravitational chiral anomaly, is not related to the gravitational helicity flux density. Instead, the Nieh-Yan term, another topological invariant within the teleparallel equivalent of general relativity (TEGR), can reproduce this flux density. We also reduce these two topological invariants to null hypersurfaces describing near-horizon geometry. In this near-horizon context, the Pontryagin term yields a non-trivial quantity that may characterize a Carrollian fluid helicity relevant to near-horizon physics.</description>

Abstract: In the paper, the family of conformal four-point ladder diagrams in arbitrary space-time dimensions is considered. We use the representation obtained via explicit calculation using the operator approach and conformal quantum mechanics to study their properties, such as symmetries, loop and dimensional shift identities. In even integer dimensions, latter allows one to reduce the problem to two-dimensional case, where the notable factorization holds. Additionally, for a specific choice of propagator powers, we show that the representation can be written in the form of linear combinations of classical polylogarithms (with coefficients that are rational functions) and explore the structure of the resulting expressions.</description>

      <title>Supersymmetric Holomorphic Masses in AdS/CFT with Flavour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In type IIB supergravity (SUGRA), in the extremal background of a number N_c of D3-branes we consider a number N_f of probe D7-branes extended along all four D3-brane directions, (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3). Using (x_2,x_3) to define complex coordinates (z,\bar{z}) and defining the D7-branes' worldvolume scalars as (y,\bar{y}), we prove that any holomorphic function y(z) or antiholomorphic function y(\bar{z}) is a BPS solution of the D7-branes' equations of motion preserving N=(4,0) or (0,4) supersymmetry (SUSY) along (x_0,x_1), respectively. In the near-horizon geometry, five-dimensional Anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime times a five-sphere, the AdS/Conformal Field Theory correspondence states that type IIB SUGRA is holographically dual to four-dimensional N=4 supersymmetric SU(N_c) Yang-Mills theory at large N_c and large 't Hooft coupling, and the N_f D7-branes are dual to N_f N=2 hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation, i.e. flavour fields. Our D7-brane solutions are dual to a position-dependent hypermultiplet mass m that is holomorphic, m(z), or antiholomorphic, m(\bar{z}). We provide field theory proofs, valid for any N_c, N_f, and 't Hooft coupling, that such m preserve N=(4,0) or (0,4) SUSY along (x_0,x_1). We also perform holographic calculations with probe D7-branes to show that the theory with such m has zero energy and zero expectation value of the mass operator, and that a zero of m is dual to a superconformal defect described by chiral fermions along (x_0,x_1).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.24692v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define two new indecomposable (not fully reducible) ${\cal N}=8$, $d=1$ off-shell multiplets and consider the corresponding models of ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric mechanics with spin variables. Each multiplet is described off shell by a scalar superfield which is a nonlinear deformation of the standard scalar superfield $X$ carrying the $d=1$ multiplet ${\bf (1,8,7)}$. Deformed systems involve, as invariant subsets, two different off-shell versions of the irreducible multiplet ${\bf (8,8,0)}$. For both systems we present the manifestly ${\cal N}=8$ supersymmetric superfield constraints, as well as the component off- and on-shell invariant actions, which for one version exactly match those given in arXiv:2402.00539 [hep-th]. The two models differ off shell, but prove to be equivalent to each other on shell, with the spin variables sitting in the adjoint representation of the maximal $R$-symmetry group ${\rm SO}(8)$.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of Wilson loops are governed by an infinite set of Schwinger-Dyson equations and trace relations. In the context of the lattice positivity bootstrap, a central challenge is determining a dynamically independent basis of these operators within a truncated space. We present a systematic framework to address this problem, utilizing a geometric plaquette-cut and subloop-cut strategy to efficiently generate all (local) direct equations. Furthermore, we identify and analyze "indirect equations", which arise from the elimination of higher-length intermediate loops. We elucidate the origin of these subtle relations and propose a vertex-filtering strategy to construct them. Applying the above framework to SU(2) lattice Yang-Mills theory, we provide explicit counts of independent canonical loops and equations in 2, 3, and 4 dimensions, along with a statistical analysis of their asymptotic growth.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we scrutinize local gauge-invariant vector operators of dimension four in the adjoint $SU(2)$ Higgs model, which are candidates for interpolating fields of the fundamental excitations of the model due to the so-called FMS mechanism. We use the equations of motion and the properties of the BRST operator to derive a Ward identity that allows us to determine whether a given operator can propagate. To corroborate this analysis, we explicitly compute the two-point function of the non-propagating operator at the one-loop level.</description>

Abstract: Holographic black holes exhibit a striking relation between thermal boundary one-point functions and bulk geodesic lengths. In the large conformal-dimension limit, the one-point function of a primary operator is given by the exponential of the geodesic length from its boundary insertion point to the horizon. We test the robustness of this relation under perturbations by considering an arbitrary radial deformation of an Euclidean BTZ black hole and working to first order in the perturbation. We find that the relation remains robust: the corrected one-point function at large conformal dimension is still governed by an exponent proportional to the modified boundary-to-horizon geodesic length. The result is established using WKB and saddle-point methods, with the validity of the WKB approximation justified by exact analyses.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.11736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of solving non-linear equations would be considerably simplified by a possibility to convert known solutions into the new ones. This could seem an element of art, but in the context of ADHM-like equations describing quiver varieties there is a systematic approach. In this note we study moduli spaces and dualities of quiver gauge theories associated to effective dynamics of D-branes compactified on Calabi-Yau resolutions. We concentrate on a subfamily of quivers $\mathfrak{Q}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ covering Dynkin diagrams for simple Lie algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, where the respective BPS algebra is expected to be the Yangian algebra $Y(\mathfrak{g})$. For Yangians labeled by quivers their representations are described by solutions of ADHM-like equations. As quivers substitute Dynkin diagrams a generalization of the Weyl group $\mathcal{W}_{\mathfrak{g}}$ acts on the ADHM solutions. Here we work with the case $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{sl}_{n+1}$ and treat this group as a group of electro-magnetic Seiberg-like dualities (we call them Weyl mutations) on the respective quiver gauge theories. We lift it to the case of higher representations associated to rectangular Young diagrams. An action of Weyl mutations on the BPS Yangian algebra is also discussed.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we use the master function approach to describe the CFT limit of the six-vertex model at the free fermion point. Using the ODE/IM correspondence, we obtain an explicit form of the master function. This allows us to compute the asymptotic expansion of the function $\omega(\lambda, \mu)$ describing the expectation values of the fermionic basis operators. As a result, we describe the entire Virasoro module of the corresponding CFT, including the integrals of motion as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that an ansatz for $1+3+n$ dimensional static spacetime with spherical symmetry in three dimensions and Euclidean symmetry in $n$ dimensions, parametrized by only one function of radial coordinate, leads to a limited set of vacuum solutions of the Einstein field equations. They can also be identified as Weyl solutions. We investigate properties of these spacetimes through the Kretschmann scalar, Newtonian mass defined through the Newtonian limit, Komar mass, Einstein, Landau--Lifshitz, and ADM mass. In addition to $1+3+n$ dimensional Minkowski spacetime, there are two classes of solutions. The first class is a trivial product of the Schwarzschild spacetime and Euclidean spaces in extra dimensions, while the second class is non-trivial. In the case with no horizon, there is a naked singularity, all masses are equal, and they are negative. In the case when there is a horizon, this horizon accommodates a physical singularity, which corresponds to Kaluza--Klein bubbles featuring exotic properties. Einstein, Landau--Lifshitz, and ADM masses are positive, while Newtonian and Komar masses are negative. This differentiates these solutions from trivial higher-dimensional extensions of the Schwarzschild solution.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound peak in isospin QCD: a natural prediction of the Medium Separation Scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14343v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present predictions for the zero-temperature equation of state at finite isospin density using the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model within the medium separation scheme (MSS) -- a scheme that explicitly disentangles medium effects from the ultraviolet divergent vacuum terms. Recent lattice QCD results reveal a nonmonotonic speed of sound ($c_s^2$) as a function of isospin chemical potential ($\mu_I$), exhibiting explicit violation of the conformal bound $c_s^2 = 1/3$. These findings have attracted significant theoretical interest, as established models -- including the NJL model -- failed to anticipate this behavior prior to lattice simulations. Conventional NJL implementations yield unphysical artifacts, often attributed to regularization scale sensitivity stemming from nonrenormalizability. However, in this work, we demonstrate that the standard NJL framework combined with MSS quantitatively reproduces state-of-the-art lattice data for isospin QCD.</description>

      <title>SO(n) Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki states as conformal boundary states of integrable SU(n) spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13114v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of conformal boundary states in the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) conformal field theory (CFT) using the symmetry embedding $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_2 \subset \mathrm{SU}(n)_1$. These boundary states are beyond the standard Cardy construction and possess $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ symmetry. The $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ Uimin-Lai-Sutherland (ULS) spin chains, which realize the $\mathrm{SU}(n)_1$ WZW model on the lattice, allow us to identify these boundary states as the ground states of the $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki spin chains. Using the integrability of the $\mathrm{SU}(n)$ ULS model, we analytically compute the corresponding Affleck-Ludwig boundary entropy using exact overlap formulas. Our results unveil intriguing connections between exotic boundary states in CFT and integrable lattice models, thus providing deep insights into the interplay of symmetry, integrability, and boundary critical phenomena.</description>

      <title>More on Bianchi I spacetimes and f(T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15322v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bianchi I cosmological solutions in f(T) gravity are discussed. We start from diagonal metrics and tetrads and show that their dynamical equations are pretty much tractable analytically, with a possible arena for physical applications. Then we derive a very bad unpredictability of the teleparallel connection in these configurations. Namely, even for the simple isotropic Friedmann universes, one might apply an arbitrary time-dependent spatial rotation to the standard tetrad without changing anything in the cosmological equations.</description>

      <title>Analytic Langlands correspondence from SoV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.06991v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytic Langlands correspondence proposed by Etingof, Frenkel and Kazhdan describes the solution to the spectral problems naturally arising in the quantisation of the Hitchin integrable systems in terms of real opers, certain second order differential operators on a Riemann surface having real monodromy. We prove this correspondence in the cases associated to the group $\mathrm{PSL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and Riemann surfaces of genus zero with a number of punctures larger than three. A crucial ingredient is a unitary integral transformation mapping products of solutions to the ordinary differential equation associated to a real oper to eigenfunctions of the quantised Hitchin Hamiltonians. This allows us to construct joint eigenfunctions of Hecke operators and Hitchin Hamiltonians from real opers.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19902v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.</description>

      <title>Conundrum of regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23711v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The search for regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields has sprouted numerous candidates, each exhibiting certain virtues but often accompanied by significant drawbacks. We demonstrate that Komar mass, electric charge and magnetic charge are mutually dependent in regular black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields, defined by a Lagrangian which is a function of both electromagnetic invariants, $F_{ab} F^{ab}$ and $F_{ab}{\star F}^{ab}$, regardless of the specific weak field limit of the theory. Also, we generalize one of the key no-go theorems by showing that static, spherically symmetric, electrically charged black holes in a theory respecting the relaxed Maxwellian weak field limit do not admit a bounded Kretschmann scalar. Finally, we address one of the long-standing niche questions, whether regular black hole solutions can exist when both electric and magnetic charges are present, by constructing an exotic family of regular dyonic black holes with nonlinear electromagnetic fields in theories respecting the Maxwellian weak field limit. Mounting evidence suggests that regularizing black holes through simplistic nonlinear extensions of Maxwell's electromagnetism entails a high cost in the form of unorthodox theoretical assumptions.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-freedom and massive glueballs in a qubit-regularized SU(2) gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that a simple qubit-regularized $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ lattice gauge theory (LGT) on a plaquette chain serves as a pseudo-one-dimensional toy model for Yang-Mills (YM) theory in three spatial dimensions. We map the chain Hamiltonian to the Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) in a uniform magnetic field and demonstrate that it can be tuned to a continuum limit in which the short-distance physics is governed by the asymptotically free Ising conformal field theory (CFT) describing free Majorana fermions, while the long-distance regime contains massive excitations of the $E_8$ quantum field theory (QFT) that can be interpreted as one-dimensional analogues of glueballs. Furthermore, we find $\sqrt{\sigma}/m_1 = 0.249(1)$ where $\sigma$ is the string tension between two static quarks and $m_1$ is the mass of the lightest glueball.</description>

      <title>Renormalization of the Quantum Stress Tensor Fluctuations and the Limits of Semiclassical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the expectation value of the energy-momentum tensor and its fluctuations in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$. A generally accepeted condition for the conceptual consistency of semiclassical gravity, where $\langle T_{ab} \rangle$ represent the sources of the Einstein equations, is that the fluctuations of the energy momentum tensor remain small compared to its expectation value. We study the renormalization of both the energy-momentum tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x)\rangle_{\rm ren}$ and the fluctuation tensor $\langle T_{ab}(x) T_{cd}(x) \rangle_{\rm ren}$ for suitable Hadamard states, using the operator product expansion for a free scalar field on a fixed curved background. We show that states (usually referred to as `squeezed vacua') -- arising naturally in black hole evaporation and in inflationary cosmology -- fail to satisfy the natural semiclassicality criterion.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</description>
