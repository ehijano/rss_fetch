      <title>Wavelet analysis and forecast of pollutants in Puebla City, Mexico</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents a detailed analysis of atmospheric pollutants in Puebla City, Mexico, based on data collected between 2016 and 2024. The research focuses on the daily variation of six major pollutants: ozone (O$_3$), particles smaller than 10 microns (PM10), particles smaller than 2.5 microns (PM2.5), sulfur dioxide (SO$_2$), and nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$). The Mann-Kendall test, Innovate Trend, and Wavelet Transform Analysis were applied to identify significant trends and seasonal patterns. The results indicate an increase in the levels of O$_3$, SO$_2$, and NO$_2$, while the levels of PM10, and PM2.5 have shown a decrease. The study also employs the Prophet Forecasting Model to predict PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations for the year 2022, demonstrating that the model's accuracy increases as the analysis extends over longer periods.</description>

      <title>La dignificaci\'on de la pepena: un an\'alisis del reciclaje de residuos s\'olidos urbanos en la ciudad de Chihuahua</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05283v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pepenaactivity is part of the informal sector, characterized by precariousness and social invisibility; however, it is a key element in the recycling production chain, providing an economic income for many people. In the city of Chihuahua, this activity is carried out on a significant scale. Therefore, this study analyzes and dignifies the recycling of urban solid waste from the perspective of scavengers, also explaining their relationship with other social actors at the city's final disposal site. The study starts from the premise that waste picking is, in the current era of global environmental crisis, an effective way to conserve resources and reduce environmental impacts. Methodologically, participatory action research was used as a strategy to raise awareness among scavengers about the importance of their work and to present their community organization as an example to other urban waste picking groups in different locations. Finally, we found issues in these groups such as informality, lack of legal support,specific health risks, and, more broadly, the absence of public policies to recognize this activity as valuable in addressing the global environmental crisis</description>

      <title>A Hard-Science Approach to Kondratieff's Economic Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an effort to evidence the Kondratieff cycle more scientifically than the way economists do, physical variables are studied rather than monetary indicators. Previously published graphs are reproduced and updated here with recent data. A cyclical rather regular variation of energy consumption reveals a 56-year cycle. A dozen human endeavors/phenomena, such as bank failures, homicides, hurricanes, feminism, and sunspot activity are shown to resonate with this cycle. Possible explanations for this phenomenon may have to do with a climatic variation or with the length of time any individual actively influences the environment. There is some evidence that the cycle may be getting shorter in amplitude and duration in recent years. All quantitative confidence levels involved in these observations are poor by scientific standards and permit critics to question the very existence of this phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Dependent Infrastructure Service Disruption Mapping (DISruptionMap): A Method to Assess Cascading Service Disruptions in Disaster Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Critical infrastructures provide essential services for our modern society. Large-scale natural hazards, such as floods or storms, can disrupt multiple critical infrastructures at once. In addition, a localized failure of one service can trigger a cascade of failures of other dependent services. This makes it challenging to anticipate and prepare adequately for direct and indirect consequences of such events. Existing methods that are spatially explicit and consider service dependencies currently lack practicality, as they require large amounts of data. To address this gap, we propose a novel method called DISruptionMap which analyzes complex disruptions to critical infrastructure services. The proposed method combines i) spatial service models to assess direct service disruptions with ii) a service dependency model to assess indirect (cascading) service disruptions. A fault tree-based approach is implemented, resulting in a significant decrease in the information required to set up the service dependency model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in a case study examining the impact of an extreme flood on health, transport, and power services in Cologne, Germany.</description>

      <title>Dense Crowd Dynamics and Pedestrian Trajectories: A Multiscale Field Study at the F\^ete des Lumi\`eres in Lyon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present one of the first comprehensive field datasets capturing dense pedestrian dynamics across multiple scales, ranging from macroscopic crowd flows over distances of several hundred meters to microscopic individual trajectories, including approximately 7,000 recorded trajectories. The dataset also includes a sample of GPS traces, statistics on contact and push interactions, as well as a catalog of non-standard crowd phenomena observed in video recordings. Data were collected during the 2022 Festival of Lights in Lyon, France, within the framework of the French-German MADRAS project, covering pedestrian densities up to 4 individuals per square meter.</description>

      <title>Liberal-Conservative Hierarchies of Intercoder Reliability Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While numerous indices of inter-coder reliability exist, Krippendorff's {\alpha} and Cohen's \{kappa} have long dominated in communication studies and other fields, respectively. The near consensus, however, may be near the end. Recent theoretical and mathematical analyses reveal that these indices assume intentional and maximal random coding, leading to paradoxes and inaccuracies. A controlled experiment with one-way golden standard and Monte Carlo simulations supports these findings, showing that \{kappa} and {\alpha} are poor predictors and approximators of true intercoder reliability. As consensus on a perfect index remains elusive, more authors recommend selecting the best available index for specific situations (BAFS). To make informed choices, researchers, reviewers, and educators need to understand the liberal-conservative hierarchy of indices, i.e., which indices produce higher or lower scores. This study extends previous efforts by expanding the math-based hierarchies to include 23 indices and constructing six additional hierarchies using Monte Carlo simulations. These simulations account for factors like the number of categories and distribution skew. The resulting eight hierarchies display a consistent pattern and reveal a previously undetected paradox in the Ir index.</description>

      <title>Integrating problem structuring methods with formal design theory: collective water management policy design in Tunisia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Groundwater management, especially in regions like Tunisia, is challenging due to diverse stakeholder interests and the dry structure of climate, which is extremely challenging for the sustainability of water resources. This paper proposes an innovative approach to policy design by merging Problem Structuring Methods (PSMs) and the Policy-Knowledge, Concepts, Proposals (P-KCP) methodology. Utilizing cognitive maps and value trees, the study aims to generate new collective groundwater management practices. Bridging decision theory and design theory, the study addresses the gap in new alternative generation and highlights the P-KCP's role in innovative policy design. Integrating PSMs and C-K theory, the framework expands policy alternatives and advocates for participatory approaches. It emphasizes adaptability across contexts, provides replicable process descriptions, and encourages the creation of unconventional policy solutions. Ultimately, this comprehensive framework offers a practical guide for policy innovation and collaboration.</description>

      <title>Investigating the Trade-off between Infections and Social Interactions Using a Compact Model of Endemic Infections on Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many epidemiological and ecological contexts, there is a trade-off between infections and interaction. This arises because the links between individuals capable of spreading infections are also often associated with beneficial activities. Here, we consider how the presence of explicit network structure changes the optimal solution of a class of infection-interaction trade-offs. In order to do this, we develop and analyse a low-dimensional dynamical system approximating the network SIS epidemic. We find that network structure in the form of heterogeneous numbers of contacts can have a significant impact on the optimal number of contacts that comes out of a trade-off model.</description>

      <title>Deliberation Among Informed Citizens: The Value of Exploring Alternative Thinking Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of deliberation to create consensus among fully-informed citizens. Our approach relies on two cognitive assumptions: i. citizens need a thinking frame (or perspective) to consider an issue; and ii. citizens cannot consider all relevant perspectives simultaneously, but only sequentially. Altogether, these assumptions imply that the citizens opinions are intrinsically contextual, and exhibit features analogous to those of quantum systems. Formally, we capture contextuality in a simple quantum-like cognitive model. We consider a binary voting problem, in which citizens with incompatible thinking frames and initially opposite voting intentions deliberate under the guidance of a benevolent facilitator. We find that offering a citizen the opportunity to probe alternative thinking frames may allow them change opinion. The probability for reaching consensus depends on the correlation between perspectives, and on their sophistication (mathematically captured by their dimensionality in the quantum model). Maximally uncorrelated sophisticated perspectives give the highest chance for opinion change, and hence for reaching consensus. With more than two citizens, multiple deliberation rounds with experts allow reaching consensus with significant probability. A first central lesson of this work is that, if one admits that opinions are contextual, the diversity of perspectives is beneficial, and even necessary, to overcome initial disagreement. One also learns that well-designed procedures managed by a facilitator are needed to increase the probability for consensus. An additional finding is that the richness of a thinking frame helps convergence towards consensus, and that the optimal facilitator's strategy entails focusing deliberation on a properly reduced problem.</description>

      <title>Evacuation patterns and socioeconomic stratification in the context of wildfires in Chile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is altering the frequency and intensity of wildfires, leading to increased evacuation events that disrupt human mobility and socioeconomic structures. These disruptions affect access to resources, employment, and housing, amplifying existing vulnerabilities within communities. Understanding the interplay between climate change, wildfires, evacuation patterns, and socioeconomic factors is crucial for developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. To contribute to this challenge, we use high-definition mobile phone records to analyse evacuation patterns during the wildfires in Valpara\'iso, Chile, that took place between February 2-3, 2024. This data allows us to track the movements of individuals in the disaster area, providing insight into how people respond to large-scale evacuations in the context of severe wildfires. We apply a causal inference approach that combines regression discontinuity and difference-in-differences methodologies to observe evacuation behaviours during wildfires, with a focus on socioeconomic stratification. This approach allows us to isolate the impact of the wildfires on different socioeconomic groups by comparing the evacuation patterns of affected populations before and after the event, while accounting for underlying trends and discontinuities at the threshold of the disaster. We find that many people spent nights away from home, with those in the lowest socioeconomic segment stayed away the longest. In general, people reduced their travel distance during the evacuation, and the lowest socioeconomic group moved the least. Initially, movements became more random, as people sought refuge in a rush, but eventually gravitated towards areas with similar socioeconomic status. Our results show that socioeconomic differences play a role in evacuation dynamics, providing useful insights for response planning.</description>

      <title>Exploring Growing Complex Systems with Higher-Order Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex system with many interacting individuals can be represented by a network consisting of nodes and links representing individuals and pairwise interactions, respectively. However, real-world systems grow with time and include many higher-order interactions. Such systems with higher-order interactions can be well described by a simplicial complex (SC), which is a type of hypergraph, consisting of simplexes representing sets of multiple interacting nodes. Here, capturing the properties of growing real-world systems, we propose a growing random SC (GRSC) model where a node is added and a higher dimensional simplex is established among nodes at each time step. We then rigorously derive various percolation properties in the GRSC. Finally, we confirm that the system exhibits an infinite-order phase transition as higher-order interactions accelerate the growth of the system and result in the advanced emergence of a giant cluster. This work can pave the way for interpreting growing complex systems with higher-order interactions such as social, biological, brain, and technological systems.</description>

      <title>Towards the science of living structure: Making and remaking livable cities as part of Urban Informatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This chapter investigates the concept of living structure - which is defined as a structural hierarchy that has a recurring pattern of an abundance of small substructures compared to larger ones - and the application of such structures in creating livable cities within urban informatics. By integrating practical, scientific, and artistic innovations, living structures provide a theoretical framework for designing healing environments and understanding urban complexity. We conceptualize spaces through hierarchical transformations, calculating livingness (L) as L = S * H, where S is the number of substructures and H is the inherent hierarchy of those substructures. Living structure is governed by the scaling law and Tobler's law, and guided by differentiation and adaptation principles, and it fosters vibrant and engaging spaces that enhance human well-being and a sense of place. Urban informatics, urban planning, and architecture must evolve beyond just understanding and prediction to include purposeful design. This new kind of science integrates the theory of living structure and emphasizes creation and design, thus transforming those disciplines. This chapter looks at environments that have high structural beauty, as defined by the 15 properties that Christopher Alexander proposed, and discusses the application of those properties in architecture, urban informatics, and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, with the aim of making built environments more vibrant and conducive to human well-being.

Abstract: Social norms and conventions are commonly accepted and adopted behaviors and practices within a social group that guide interactions -- e.g., how to spell a word or how to greet people -- and are central to a group's culture and identity. Understanding the key mechanisms that govern the formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions in social communities is a problem of paramount importance for a broad range of real-world applications, spanning from preparedness for future emergencies to promotion of sustainable practices. In the past decades, mathematical modeling has emerged as a powerful tool to reproduce and study the complex dynamics of norm and convention change, gaining insights into their mechanisms, and ultimately deriving tools to predict their evolution. The first goal of this chapter is to introduce some of the main mathematical approaches for modeling social norms and conventions, including population models and agent-based models relying on the theories of dynamical systems, evolutionary dynamics, and game theory. The second goal of the chapter is to illustrate how quantitative observations and empirical data can be incorporated into these mathematical models in a systematic manner, establishing a data-based approach to mathematical modeling of formation, persistence, and evolution of social norms and conventions. Finally, current challenges and future opportunities in this growing field of research are discussed.</description>

      <title>The multiscale self-similarity of the weighted human brain connectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06739</link>

Abstract: Anatomical connectivity between different regions in the brain can be mapped to a network representation, the connectome, where the intensities of the links, the weights, influence its structural resilience and the functional processes it sustains. Yet, many features associated with the weights in the human brain connectome are not fully understood, particularly their multiscale organization. In this paper, we elucidate the architecture of weights, including weak ties, in multiscale hierarchical human brain connectomes reconstructed from empirical data. Our findings reveal multiscale self-similarity in the weighted statistical properties, including the ordering of weak ties, that remain consistent across the analyzed length scales of every individual and the group representatives. This phenomenon is effectively captured by a renormalization of the weighted structure applied to hyperbolic embeddings of the connectomes, based on a unique weighted geometric model that integrates links of all weights across all length scales. This eliminates the need for separate generative weighted connectivity rules for each scale or to replicate weak and strong ties at specific scales in brain connectomes. The observed symmetry represents a distinct signature of criticality in the weighted connectivity of human brain connectomes, aligning with the fractality observed in their topology, and raises important questions for future research, like the existence of a resolution threshold where the observed symmetry breaks, or whether it is preserved in cases of neurodegenerative disease or psychiatric disorder.</description>

      <title>Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications</title>

Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay mathematical foundations for the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and mechanical effects in dense settings. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.</description>

      <title>Why business adoption of quantum and AI technology must be ethical</title>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) recently had its 'iPhone moment' and adoption has drastically accelerated. Quantum computing appears poised to follow suit over the next years. However, while there has been discourse about how to use AI responsibly, there is still little appreciation and awareness among executives, managers, and practitioners about the broader ethical questions and implications raised by the intersection of these emerging technologies. In this article, it is highlighted why quantum computing and AI ethics must be taken seriously by businesspersons and how these technologies affect strategic decisions; moreover, recommendations and action areas are formulated.</description>

      <title>European Football Player Valuation: Integrating Financial Models and Network Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new framework for player valuation in European football by fusing principles from financial mathematics and network theory. The valuation model leverages a "passing matrix" to encapsulate player interactions on the field, utilizing centrality measures to quantify individual influence. Unlike traditional approaches, this model is both metric-driven and cohort-free, providing a dynamic and individualized framework for ascertaining a player's fair market value. The methodology is empirically validated through a case study in European football, employing real-world match and financial data. The paper advances the disciplines of sports analytics and financial mathematics by offering a cross-disciplinary mechanism for player valuation, and also links together two well-known econometric methods in marginal revenue product and expected present valuation.</description>

      <title>Learning about the liveability of cities from young migrants using the combinatiorial-Hodge-theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Migration is a major decision to leave one place and move to another, involving career and life changes. Migration flows provide people's comparisons across places about which is better to live by ``vote with their feet'' (Tiebout, 1956). However, is it possible to derive a consistent measure of the liveability of cities from these flows? We propose a combinatorial-Hodge-theory approach: the empirical liveability of cities is evaluated by a potential governing unbalanced, acyclic migrations between cities. As a case study, we measure the liveability of municipalities in Japan for specific populations such as families with small children and women of reproductive age in a population-decline society. Using these potentials as dependent variables, we perform a regression analysis to identify the factors relevant to liveability. We also derive analytical expressions that allow us to interpret as potentials the standards of living or utilities, estimated in the economics literature (Douglas &amp; Wall, 1993; Douglas, 1997; Douglas &amp; Wall, 2000; Wall, 2001; Nakajima &amp; Tabuchi, 2011). The proposed method extracts a consistent metric of interval scale from the non-transitive, pairwise comparison between locations and provides substantial statistics for urban planning by policymakers.</description>

      <title>Predictability maximization and the origins of word order harmony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16570v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.</description>
