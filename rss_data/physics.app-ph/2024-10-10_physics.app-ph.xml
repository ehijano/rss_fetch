      <title>A Substructure Perturbation Method for Systematic Design of Mechanical Metamaterials with Programmed Functionalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical metamaterials utilize geometry to achieve exceptional mechanical properties, including those not typically possible for traditional materials. To achieve these properties, it is necessary to identify the proper structures and geometries, which is often a non-trivial and computationally expensive process. Here, we propose a Substructure Perturbation Method (SSPM) for systematic design and search of these materials with programmed deformation modes. We present the theoretical fundamentals and computational algorithms of the SSPM, along with four design problems to investigate the effect and performance of the SSPM. Results reveal the necessity of analyzing multiple substructures simultaneously in obtaining successful designs, and its effectiveness in speeding up numerical processes. In one design case, SSPM is shown to be effectively two orders of magnitude faster than another state-of-art approach while using less computational resources. We also show an experimental validation where the fabricated prototypes can grasp objects respectively by undergoing programmed deformations under corresponding inputs. The proposed SSPM provides new fundamentals and strategies for the design of mechanical metamaterials with advanced functionalities.</description>

      <title>Continuous-wave amplitude control via the interference phenomenon in acoustic structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a strategy to continuously tune the amplitude of acoustic waves based on the interference among two mode-conversion paths in passive acoustic structures. The interference phenomenon is attributed to two conjugate acoustic geometric phases obtained with two mode-conversion processes in hybrid-type geometric-phase meta-atom (HGPM) pair. Notably, 100% modulation depth of the wave amplitude is achievable by simply varying the local orientation angle of meta-atom. We utilize the acoustic structure made of two cylindrical resonators to construct deep-subwavelength secondary source with designated initial phase delay, and HGPM supporting desired mode-conversion functionality is accordingly fabricated with four secondary sources. Both theory and experiment consistently verify the continuous amplitude modulation function of HGPM pair, which showcases a general scheme for reconfigurable amplitude-type acoustic meta-devices, i.e., those that require grayscale amplitude modulation for acoustic field engineering.</description>

      <title>Simplified radar architecture based on information metasurface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern radar typically employs a chain architecture that consists of radio-frequency (RF) and intermediate frequency (IF) units, baseband digital signal processor, and information display. However, this architecture often results in high costs, significant hardware demands, and integration challenges. Here we propose a simplified radar architecture based on space-time-coding (STC) information metasurfaces. With their powerful capabilities to generate multiple harmonic frequencies and customize their phases, the STC metasurfaces play a key role in chirp signal generation, transmission, and echo reception. Remarkably, the receiving STC metasurface can implement dechirp processing directly on the RF level and realize the digital information outputs, which are beneficial to lower the hardware requirement at the receiving end while potentially shortening the time needed for conventional digital processing. As a proof of concept, the proposed metasurface radar is tested in a series of experiments for target detection and range/speed measurement, yielding results comparable to those obtained by conventional methods. This study provides valuable inspiration for a new radar system paradigm to combine the RF front ends and signal processors on the information metasurface platform that offers essential functionalities while significantly reducing the system complexity and cost.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Vortex Filter Based on Tunable Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an acoustic vortex filter (AVF) based on tunable metasurfaces, which can selectively filter the incident multiplexed vortices that carry different orbital angular momentum (OAM). Our metasurface-based AVF is composed of an upper acoustic metasurface (UAM) and a lower acoustic metasurface (LAM), of which the intrinsic topological charge (ITC) can be tuned by mechanically rotating the UAM along its central axis. Due to the critical order of the propagating vortex modes in waveguide, controlling the ITC of the AVF allows for the selective filtering of incoming multiplexed acoustic vortex beams based on the sound vortex diffraction in phase-gradient metasurface, which endows the vortex filter the capability that let the incident vortex of specific OAM pass through it. In the following demonstration, both in theory and experiment, we design the AVF and effectively filter the acoustic vortices with two opposite topological charges (TCs) by simply altering the orientation angle of the UAM. Based on this, we further demonstrate its application in asymmetric acoustic wave transmission. Our work offers an approach to selectively filter the incident acoustic vortex, which improves the capability to control the acoustic OAM via metasurfaces.</description>

      <title>Curved graphene nanoribbons derived from tetrahydropyrene-based polyphenylenes via one-pot K-region oxidation and Scholl cyclization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Precise synthesis of graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) is of great interest to chemists and materials scientists because of their unique opto-electronic properties and potential applications in carbon-based nanoelectronics and spintronics. In addition to the tunable edge structure and width, introducing curvature in GNRs is a powerful structural feature for their chemi-physical property modification. Here, we report an efficient solution synthesis of the first pyrene-based GNR (PyGNR) with curved geometry via one-pot K-region oxidation and Scholl cyclization of its corresponding well-soluble tetrahydropyrene-based polyphenylene precursor. The efficient A2B2-type Suzuki polymerization and subsequent Scholl reaction furnishes up to 35 nm long curved GNRs bearing cove- and armchair-edges. The construction of model compound, as a cutout of PyGNR, from a tetrahydropyrene-based oligophenylene precursor proves the concept and efficiency of the one-pot K-region oxidation and Scholl cyclization, which is clearly revealed by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis. The structure and optical properties of PyGNR are investigated by Raman, FT-IR, solid-state NMR and UV-Vis analysis with the support of DFT calculations. PyGNR shows the absorption maximum at 680 nm, exhibiting a narrow optical bandgap of 1.4 eV, qualifying as a low-bandgap GNR. Moreover, THz spectroscopy on PyGNR estimates its macroscopic charge mobility of 3.6 cm2/Vs, outperforming other curved GNRs reported via conventional Scholl reaction.</description>

      <title>Field-free spin-orbit switching of canted magnetization in Pt/Co/Ru/RuO2(101) multilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enabling field-free current-induced switching of perpendicular magnetization is essential for advancing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory technology. Our research on the Pt/Co/Ru/RuO2(101) system has successfully demonstrated field-free switching through current injection along the RuO2[010] axis. We discovered that the system exhibits a tilted easy axis, inclined from the out-of-plane towards the RuO2[-101] direction. The application of current perpendicular to this tilted axis generates a substantial out-of-plane effective field, which facilitates field-free magnetization switching. Our results also indicate that adjusting the thickness of the Ru layer to optimize the tilt angle can significantly reduce the critical switching current density. This work provides a viable strategy for controlling the tilting magnetization, essential for the development of RuO2-based magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>A Review on Hydrogen Production Technologies and Its Future Demand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen production is a vital process in the quest for decarbonization and a sustainable future. This conversation explores the various technologies used in hydrogen production, such as steam methane reforming, electrolysis, and biomass gasification. These methods have different applications and efficiencies, but all contribute to the production of hydrogen gas. The future of hydrogen production looks promising, as it offers a clean and versatile energy source that can be used in various sectors, including transportation, industry, and power generation. The increasing demand for hydrogen in these sectors, coupled with the global push for decarbonization, highlights the importance of advancing hydrogen production technologies and infrastructure. This paper focuses broadly on different methods of hydrogen production like steam methane reforming, electrolysis, and biomass gasification. Steam methane reforming is currently the most common method, accounting for about 95% of global hydrogen production. Electrolysis is another method that uses electricity to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Biomass gasification involves converting organic materials into hydrogen gas through a thermochemical process. The renewable energy sources considered are water and biomass and the methods considered are Electrolysis (grid), thermolysis, thermochemical water splitting, photoelectrochemical water splitting, and gasification. Electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen accounts for about 5% of the total hydrogen production. Statistically, global hydrogen production reached about USD 155.35 billion in 2022, with the majority of it being used in the petroleum refining and ammonia production industries. As for applications, hydrogen can be used as a fuel for fuel cell vehicles, as a feedstock for chemical processes, and as a storage medium for renewable energy.</description>

      <title>First experimental study of multiple orientation muon tomography, with image optimization in sparse data environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07264v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the high penetrating power of cosmic ray muons, they can be used to probe very thick and dense objects. As charged particles, they can be tracked by ionization detectors, determining the position and direction of the muons. With detectors on either side of an object, particle direction changes can be used to extract scattering information within an object. This can be used to produce a scattering intensity image within the object related to density and atomic number. Such imaging is typically performed with a single detector-object orientation, taking advantage of the more intense downward flux of muons, producing planar imaging with some depth-of-field information in the third dimension. Several simulation studies have been published with multi-orientation tomography, which can form a three-dimensional representation faster than a single orientation view. In this work we present the first experimental multiple orientation muon tomography study. Experimental muon-scatter based tomography was performed using a concrete filled steel drum with several different metal wedges inside, between detector planes. Data was collected from different detector-object orientations by rotating the steel drum. The data collected from each orientation were then combined using two different tomographic methods.
  Results showed that using a combination of multiple depth-of-field reconstructions, rather than a traditional inverse Radon transform approach used for CT, resulted in more useful images for sparser data. As cosmic ray muon flux imaging is rate limited, the imaging techniques were compared for sparse data. Using the combined depth-of-field reconstruction technique, fewer detector-object orientations were needed to reconstruct images that could be used to differentiate the metal wedge compositions.</description>

      <title>Engineering Interfacial Charge Transfer through Modulation Doping for 2D Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are likely to dominate next-generation electronics due to their advantages in compactness and low power consumption. However, challenges such as high contact resistance and inefficient doping hinder their applicability. Here, we investigate workfunction-mediated charge transfer (modulation doping) as a pathway for achieving high-performance p-type 2D transistors. Focusing on type-III band alignment, we explore the doping capabilities of 27 candidate materials, including transition metal oxides, oxyhalides, and {\alpha}-RuCl3, on channel materials such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and group-III nitrides. Our extensive first-principles density functional theory (DFT) reveal p-type doping capabilities of high electron affinity materials, including {\alpha}-RuCl3, MoO3, and V2O5. We predict significant reductions in contact resistance and enhanced channel mobility through efficient hole transfer without introducing detrimental defects. We analyze transistor geometries and identify promising material combinations beyond the current focus on WSe2 doping, suggesting new avenues for hBN, AlN, GaN, and MoS2. This comprehensive investigation provides a roadmap for developing high-performance p-type monolayer transistors toward the realization of 2D electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesa- and trench-patterned surfaces of 4H-SiC(0001) 4{\textdegree}off wafers were structured in macrosteps using Si melting in a SiC-Si-SiC sandwich configuration. Si spreading difficulties were observed in the case of trench-patterned samples while the attempts on mesa-patterned ones were more successful. In the latter case, parallel macrosteps were formed on both the dry-etched and unetched areas though these macrosteps rarely cross the patterns edges. The proposed mechanism involved preferential etching at Si-C bilayer step edges and fast lateral propagation along the [1120] direction.</description>

      <title>Widely Tunable Photonic Filter Based on Equivalent Chirped Four-Phase-Shifted Sampled Bragg Gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have developed an integrated dual-band photonic filter (PF) utilizing equivalent chirped four-phase-shifted sidewall-sampled Bragg gratings (4PS-SBG) on a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. Using the reconstruction equivalent-chirp technique, we designed linearly chirped 4PS Bragg gratings with two {\pi}-phase shifts ({\pi}-PS) positioned at 1/3 and 2/3 of the grating cavity, introducing two passbands in the +1st order channel. Leveraging the significant thermo-optic effect of silicon, dual-band tuning is achieved through integrated micro-heaters (MHs) on the chip surface. By varying the injection currents from 0 to 85 mA into the MHs, the device demonstrates continuous and wide-range optical frequency division (OFD) performance, with the frequency interval between the two passbands adjustable from 52.1 GHz to 439.5 GHz. Four notable frequency division setups at 100 GHz, 200 GHz, 300 GHz, and 400 GHz were demonstrated using a 100 GHz, 1535 nm semiconductor passive mode-locked laser as the light source.</description>

      <title>Probing nonlinear spin dynamics in canted easy-plane antiferromagnets using spin-rectification effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate spin-rectification phenomena in canted antiferromagnets, closely connected to the family of altermagnetic materials. Our results show that excitation efficiency is significantly enhanced by the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Antiferromagnetic dynamics can be detected through spin-Hall magnetoresistance and bolometric effects, with an efficiency reaching up to mV/W. The rectified voltage shape is influenced by both the symmetry of the exciting torques, detection mechanisms (continuous spin-pumping and spin-Hall magnetoresistance), and the antiferromagnetic crystalline axis. Under high pumping power, we observe a saturation effect related to Suhl-like spin-wave instabilities and a nonlinear redshift of the antiferromagnetic resonance. These findings open new avenues for studying nonlinear dynamics in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Field structures and singularities in subwavelength optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A brief overview of the current state of the problem of electromagnetic field singularities arising from the refraction and scattering of light by material objects is given. The discussion begins with caustics arising from ray tracing in geometric optics and consistently moves toward increasing the accuracy of consideration and decreasing the scale, ending with a description of singularities in light scattering by subwavelength particles. Common and distinctive features of various types of singularities, the role of the symmetry of the problem and the law of conservation of energy are revealed. Physical foundations and methods for overcoming the diffraction limit are discussed. The theoretical description is illustrated by experimental examples. Various practical applications of the effects under consideration are indicated.</description>

      <title>Beyond equivalent circuit representations in nonlinear systems with inherent memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.04135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Basic multimode impedance analysis grounded in the availability of nonequilibrium charge carriers and their retarded path towards equilibrium is used to access the inadequacy of equivalent circuits in nonlinear systems with inherent memory. On the basic grounds of generation and recombination (or trapping) of nonequilibrium carriers and their relaxation times, we show how seeming complexity of frequency-dependent impedance that matches a vast universe of experimental evidences can be reduced to simple combinations of basic microscopic ingredients. Counterintuitive features such as a negative capacitances or unexpected inductances become a metaphoric construction with poor physical meaning, pointing to the limitations and ambiguities of the symbolic nature of "equivalent" circuits. Our approach further provides a microscopic perspective that exposes the linkage of an apparent flux with an apparent inductance dismissing any magnetic essence.</description>

      <title>Terahertz emission from $\alpha$-W/CoFe epitaxial spintronic emitters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report efficient terahertz (THz) generation in epitaxial $\alpha$-W/Co$_{60}$Fe$_{40}$ spintronic emitters. Two types of emitters have been investigated; epitaxial $\alpha$-W$(110)$/Co$_{60}$Fe$_{40}(110)$ and $\alpha$-W$(001)$/Co$_{60}$Fe$_{40}(001)$ deposited on single crystalline Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$($11\bar{2}0$) and MgO($001$) substrates, respectively. First principle calculations of the electronic band structure at the W$(001)$ surface reveal Dirac-type surface states, similar to that reported previously for the W$(110)$ surface. The generated THz radiation is about $10\%$ larger for $\alpha$-W$(110)$/Co$_{60}$Fe$_{40}(110)$ grown on single crystalline Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$($11\bar{2}0$), which is explained by the fact that the $\alpha$-W$(110)$/Co$_{60}$Fe$_{40}(110)$ interface for this emitter is more transparent to the spin current due to the presence of \AA ngstr\" om-scale interface intermixing at the W/CoFe interface. Our results also reveal that the generation of THz radiation is larger when pumping with the laser light from the substrate side, which is explained by a larger part of the laser light due to interference effects in the film stack being absorbed in the ferromagnetic Co$_{60}$Fe$_{40}$ layer in this measurement configuration.</description>

      <title>Tantalum electrodeposition using a nanoporous anodic alumina template and a nanostructured gold/nickel-chromium glass-ceramic substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrodeposition of tantalum coating was performed from an ionic liquid, BMP[Tf2N], in the presence of dissolved anhydrous TaF5 and LiF. Superficial X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy supplemented by an argon ion etching and depth profiling has proven the presence of the tantalum metal inside a thin coating deposited via a porous anodic alumina template. Additionally, tantalum electrodeposition was attempted using a planar sputter-deposited gold coating on a glass-ceramic substrate as the working electrode. Pores emerged within the sputter-deposited gold layer after the Ta electrodeposition step. Nano- to submicrometer large pores were created due to aluminum impurity diffusion through the gold and consequent etching effect of fluorides in the ionic liquid solution. Nanostructured tantalum and nanoporous gold are attractive materials with potential applications in high-performance electronic devices, including sensors, electrocatalysis, and energy storage systems.</description>

      <title>Electrical excitation of color centers in phosphorus-doped diamond Schottky diodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A robust quantum light source operating upon electrical injection at ambient conditions is desirable for practical implementation of quantum technologies, such as quantum key distribution or metrology. Color centers in diamond are promising candidates as they are photostable emitters at room and elevated temperatures. The possibility of their electrical excitation has already been demonstrated within p-i-n diodes. However, this requires the growth of complex diamond structures. In contrast to these conventional approaches, we demonstrate the emission of color centers under electrical pumping in a novel Schottky diode configuration based on hydrogen passivated n-type diamond, which holds promise for integrated single-photon emitting devices based on color centers in diamond.</description>
