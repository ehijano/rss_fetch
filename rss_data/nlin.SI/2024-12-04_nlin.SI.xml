      <title>Higher symmetries of the lattices in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that there is a duality between the Davey--Stewartson type coupled systems and a class of integrable two--dimensional Toda type lattices. More precisely, the coupled systems are generalized symmetries for the lattices and the lattices can be interpreted as dressing chains for the systems. In our recent study we have found a novel lattice which apparently is not related to the known ones by Miura type transformation. In the article we described higher symmetries to this lattice and derived a new coupled system of the DS type.</description>

      <title>Construction of exact solutions of nonlinear PDE via dressing chain in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The duality between a class of the Davey-Stewartson type coupled systems and a class of two-dimensional Toda type lattices is discussed. A new coupled system related to the recently found lattice is presented. A method for eliminating nonlocalities in coupled systems by virtue of special finite reductions of the lattices is suggested. An original algorithm for constructing explicit solutions of the coupled systems based on the finite reduction of the corresponding lattice is proposed. Some new solutions for coupled systems related to the Volterra lattice are presented as illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Overscreened spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kondo impurity and Shiba state at the edge of a one-dimensional spin-1 superconducting wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a model describing a system where the superconductivity competes with the overscreened Kondo effect. The model consists of a single spin$-\frac{1}{2}$ quantum impurity at the edge of a quantum wire where spin$-1$ bulk fermions interact attractively, generating a (superconducting) mass gap. The competition between the Kondo screening and the superconductivity leads to a rich phase structure. We find that for strong Kondo coupling, there is a regime of phase space where the Kondo phase is stable with the impurity \textit{overscreened} by a multiparticle Kondo effect, and a Kondo scale is dynamically generated. When the bulk and boundary interaction strength are comparable, we find that a midgap state appears in the spectrum and screens the impurity, while in the ground state, the impurity is unscreened. This midgap state is akin to the Yu-Shiba-Rushinov (YSR) states that exist in the entire phase space in the BCS superconductor. Moreover, when the bulk superconducting interaction strength is stronger than the boundary Kondo interaction strength, the impurity can no longer be screened. Further, between the Kondo and YSR phases, we find a novel phase where, while the Kondo cloud overscreens the impurity, a boundary excitation exists that has vanishing energy in the thermodynamic limit. Similar phase diagrams that result from competition between different mechanisms were found for other models, too: the dissipative Kondo system, where dissipation competes with screening; the Kondo impurity coupled to spin-1/2 attractively interacting fermions where condensation competes with screening; and the XXX-Kondo model, where the lattice cutoff and the bulk spin interaction compete with screening.</description>

      <title>Harmonic, Holomorphic and Rational Maps from Self-Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the so-called rational map ansatz on the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^3$, for any compact simple Lie group $G$ such that $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ is an Hermitian symmetric space, for some subgroup ${\widehat K}$ of $G$. It generalizes the rational maps on the two-sphere $SU(2)/U(1)$, and also on $CP^N=SU(N+1)/SU(N)\otimes U(1)$, and opens up the way for applications of such ans\"atze on non-linear sigma models, Skyrme theory and magnetic monopoles in Yang-Mills-Higgs theories. Our construction is based on a well known mathematical result stating that stable harmonic maps $X$ from the two-sphere $S^2$ to compact Hermitian symmetric spaces $G/{\widehat K}\otimes U(1)$ are holomorphic or anti-holomorphic. We derive such a mathematical result using ideas involving the concept of self-duality, in a way that makes it more accessible to theoretical physicists. Using a topological (homotopic) charge that admits an integral representation, we construct first order partial differential self-duality equations such that their solutions also solve the (second order) Euler-Lagrange associated to the harmonic map energy $E=\int_{S^2} \mid dX\mid^2 d\mu$. We show that such solutions saturate a lower bound on the energy $E$, and that the self-duality equations constitute the Cauchy-Riemann equations for the maps $X$. Therefore, they constitute harmonic and (anti)holomorphic maps, and lead to the generalization of the rational map ans\"atze in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Solutions of an extended Duffing-van der Pol equation with variable coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19788v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, exact solutions of the nonlinear cubic-quintic Duffing-van der Pol oscillator with variable coefficients are obtained. Two approaches have been applied, one based on the factorization method combined with the Field Method, and a second one relying on Painlev\'e analysis. Both procedures allow us to find the same exact solutions to the problem. The Lagrangian formalism for this system is also derived. Moreover, some examples for particular choices of the time-dependent coefficients, and their corresponding general and particular exact solutions are presented.</description>

      <title>Solitary cluster waves in periodic potentials: Formation, propagation, and soliton-mediated particle transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Transport processes in crowded periodic structures are often mediated by cooperative movements of particles forming clusters. Recent theoretical and experimental studies of driven Brownian motion of hard spheres showed that cluster-mediated transport in one-dimensional periodic potentials can proceed in form of solitary waves. We here give a comprehensive description of these solitons. Fundamental for our analysis is a static presoliton state, which is formed by a periodic arrangement of basic stable clusters. Their size follows from a geometric principle of minimum free space. Adding one particle to the presoliton state gives rise to solitons. We derive the minimal number of particles needed for soliton formation, number of solitons at larger particle numbers, soliton velocities and soliton-mediated particle currents. Incomplete relaxations of the basic clusters are responsible for an effective repulsive soliton-soliton interaction seen in measurements. A dynamical phase transition is predicted to occur in current-density relations at low temperatures. Our results provide a theoretical basis for describing experiments on cluster-mediated particle transport in periodic potentials.</description>

      <title>Efficient Eigenstate Preparation in an Integrable Model with Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</description>
