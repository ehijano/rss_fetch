      <title>The Hands-On Growth Laws Theory Cookbook</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This tutorial covers the emerging field of coarse-grained cellular growth modeling, and aims to bridge the gap between theoretical foundations and practical application. By adopting an original "cookbook" approach, it is designed to offer a hands-on guide for constructing and analyzing different key aspects of cellular growth, focusing on available results for bacteria and beyond. The tutorial is structured as a series of step-by-step "recipes", and covers essential concepts, recent literature, and key challenges. It aims to empower a broad audience, from students to seasoned researchers, to replicate, extend, and innovate in this scientific area. Specifically, each section provides detailed, bare-bone models to start working in each area, from basic steady-state growth to variable environments and focusing on different key layers relevant to biosynthesis, transcription, translation, nutrient sensing and protein degradation, links between cell cycle and growth, ending with ecological insights.</description>

      <title>Inkspot: A stress-resilient, anthocyanin rich, dwarf tomato variant for off-world cultivation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16890v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As humanity prepares for sustained off-world habitation, the development of regolith-based agriculture (RBA) is essential for achieving self-sufficiency in space crop production. However, lunar regolith's alkaline pH, poor water retention, and high metal content pose severe physiological and biochemical challenges to plant growth. This study evaluates the performance of Solanum lycopersicum 'Inkspot', a stress-adaptive, anthocyanin-rich tomato variant, in comparison to its progenitor 'Tiny Tim', under control and simulated lunar regolith (LHS-2) conditions. A randomized complete block design was used to assess germination dynamics, morphology, fruit quality, antioxidant activity, and root architecture across 80 replicates over 65 days in controlled chambers. Inkspot maintained high germination rates (85% in regolith) with low variation (CV = 14%) and showed only moderate reductions in height and biomass, while Tiny Tim suffered a 45% biomass reduction and 60% fruit yield loss. Inkspot fruits increased anthocyanin content 2.5-fold in regolith, functioning as a stress-response mechanism and potential bioindicator. Physiological assessments revealed greater retention of chlorophyll, Fv/Fm efficiency, and stomatal conductance in Inkspot, correlated with higher SOD and CAT enzyme activity and lower lipid peroxidation. Root imaging showed Inkspot developed a significantly larger, more complex root system, while Tiny Tim's roots contracted under stress. These findings highlight Inkspot's abiotic stress tolerance and potential as a candidate for closed-loop life support and in-situ resource utilization strategies in RBA systems.</description>
