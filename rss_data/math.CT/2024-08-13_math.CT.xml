      <title>Homotopy $n$-types of cubical sets and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the model structure on the category of simplicial sets for homotopy $n$-types, originally due to Elvira-Donazar and Hernandez-Paricio, using a right transfer along the coskeleton functor. We observe that an analogous model structure can be constructed on the category of cubical sets, and use it to equip the category of (simple) graphs with a fibration category structure whose weak equivalences are discrete $n$-equivalences.</description>

      <title>Gapped Phases in (2+1)d with Non-Invertible Symmetries: Part I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) to study and classify gapped phases in (2+1)d for a class of categorical symmetries, referred to as being of bosonic type. The SymTFTs for these symmetries are given by twisted and untwisted (3+1)d Dijkgraaf-Witten (DW) theories for finite groups G. A finite set of boundary conditions (BCs) of these DW theories is well-known: these simply involve imposing Dirichlet and Neumann conditions on the (3+1)d gauge fields. We refer to these as minimal BCs. The key new observation here is that for each DW theory, there exists an infinite number of other BCs, that we call non-minimal BCs. These non-minimal BCs are all obtained by a 'theta construction', which involves stacking the Dirichlet BC with 3d TFTs having G 0-form symmetry, and gauging the diagonal G symmetry. On the one hand, using the non-minimal BCs as symmetry BCs gives rise to an infinite number of non-invertible symmetries having the same SymTFT, while on the other hand, using the non-minimal BCs as physical BCs in the sandwich construction gives rise to an infinite number of (2+1)d gapped phases for each such non-invertible symmetry. Our analysis is thoroughly exemplified for G = $\mathbb{Z_2}$ and more generally any finite abelian group, for which the resulting non-invertible symmetries and their gapped phases already reveal an immensely rich structure.</description>

      <title>The Homotopy Theory of $A_\infty$Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the homotopy category of the $A_\infty$categories. To do that we introduce the notion of semi-free $A_\infty$category, which plays the role of standard cofibration. Moreover, we define the non unital $A_\infty$ (resp. DG)categories with cofibrant morphisms and we prove that any non unital $A_\infty$ (resp. DG)category has a resolution of this kind.</description>

      <title>Locally noetherian quiver representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that a quiver is left noetherian if and only if the category of quiver representations in any locally noetherian abelian category is again locally noetherian. Here, locally noetherian means that any object is the directed union of its noetherian subobjects. For a quiver to be left noetherian means that the left ideals of paths starting at any fixed vertex satisfy the ascending chain condition. The proof generalises to representations of any small category that admits a Gr\"obner enrichment.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras in m-categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a connectivity bound for maps of $\infty$-operads of the form $\mathbb{A}_{k_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \mathbb{A}_{k_n} \to \mathbb{E}_n$, and as a consequence, give an inductive way to construct $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras in $m$-categories. The result follows from a version of Eckmann-Hilton argument that takes into account both connectivity and arity of $\infty$-operads. Along the way, we prove a technical Blakers-Massey type statement for algebras of coherent $\infty$-operads.</description>

      <title>Commutative exact algebras and modular tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the study of vertex operator algebra extensions, we answer the question of when the category of local modules over a commutative exact algebra in a braided finite tensor category is a (non-semisimple) modular tensor category. Along the way we provide sufficient conditions for the category of local modules to be rigid, pivotal and ribbon. We also discuss two ways to construct such commutative exact algebras. The first is the class of simple current algebras and the second is using right adjoints of central tensor functors. Furthermore, we discuss Witt equivalence and its relation with extensions of VOAs.</description>

      <title>Skolem, G\"odel, and Hilbert fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15765v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Grothendieck fibrations are fundamental in capturing the concept of dependency, notably in categorical semantics of type theory and programming languages. A relevant instance are Dialectica fibrations which generalise G\"odel's Dialectica proof interpretation and have been widely studied in recent years.
  We characterise when a given fibration is a generalised, dependent Dialectica fibration, namely an iterated completion of a fibration by dependent products and sums (along a given class of display maps). From a technical perspective, we complement the work of Hofstra on Dialectica fibrations by an internal viewpoint, categorifying the classical notion of quantifier-freeness. We also generalise both Hofstra's and Trotta et al.'s work on G\"odel fibrations to the dependent case, replacing the class of cartesian projections in the base category by arbitrary display maps. We discuss how this recovers a range of relevant examples in categorical logic and proof theory. Moreover, as another instance, we introduce Hilbert fibrations, providing a categorical understanding of Hilbert's $\epsilon$- and $\tau$-operators well-known from proof theory.</description>

      <title>Evolution systems: A framework for studying generic mathematical structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.12600v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of an abstract evolution system, which provides a convenient framework for studying generic mathematical structures and their properties. Roughly speaking, an evolution system is a category endowed with a selected class of morphisms called transitions, and with a selected object called the origin. We illustrate it by a series of examples from several areas of mathematics. We formulate sufficient conditions for the existence of the unique "most complicated" evolution. In case the evolution system "lives" in model theory and nontrivial transitions are one-point extensions, the limit of the most complicated evolution is known under the name Fraisse limit, a unique countable universal homogeneous model determined by a fixed class of finitely generated models satisfying some obvious axioms.
  Evolution systems can also be viewed as a generalization of abstract rewriting systems, where the partially ordered set is replaced by a category. In our setting, the process of rewriting plays a nontrivial role, whereas in rewriting systems only the result of a rewriting procedure is relevant. An analogue of Newman's Lemma holds in our setting, although the proof is a bit more delicate, nevertheless, still based on Huet's idea using well founded induction.</description>

      <title>Twists of graded algebras in monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18105v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zhang twists are a common tool for deforming graded algebras over a field in a way that preserves important ring-theoretic properties. We generalize Zhang twists to the setting of closed monoidal categories equipped with their self-enriched structure. Along the way, we prove several key results about algebraic structures in closed monoidal categories missing from the literature. We use these to ultimately prove Morita-type results, showcasing when graded algebras with equivalent categories of graded modules can be related by Zhang twists.</description>
