      <title>Refining Ky Fan's majorization relation with linear programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A separable version of Ky Fan's majorization relation is proven for a sum of two operators that are each a tensor product of two positive semi-definite operators. In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</description>

      <title>Skew bracoids containing a skew brace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15929v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skew bracoids have been shown to have applications in Hopf-Galois theory. We show that a certain family of skew bracoids correspond bijectively with left cancellative semibraces. A consequence of this correspondence is that skew bracoids in this family can be used to obtain and study solutions of the set-theoretic Yang--Baxter equation; we study this process and the resulting solutions. We give numerous examples of skew bracoids satisfying our hypothesis, drawing upon a variety of constructions in the literature.</description>

      <title>Length of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07583v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of composition series of triangulated categories. Their lengths yield invariants for these categories. We then focus on composition series of derived categories of certain projective varieties and finite dimensional algebras. We construct composition series of different lengths, for some smooth projective rational surfaces and for certain smooth threefolds. On the other hand, we prove that for derived categories of finite dimensional representations of Dynkin and extended Dynkin quivers, for derived categories of some singular varieties, all composition series have the same length. If this property would also hold for the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$ in $10$ general points, then Krah's phantom subcategory would have infinite length. In particular, it would have infinite chain of thick subcategories.</description>

      <title>Composing Global Optimizers to Reasoning Tasks via Algebraic Objects in Neural Nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove rich algebraic structures of the solution space for 2-layer neural networks with quadratic activation and $L_2$ loss, trained on reasoning tasks in Abelian group (e.g., modular addition). Such a rich structure enables analytical construction of global optimal solutions from partial solutions that only satisfy part of the loss, despite its high nonlinearity. We coin the framework as CoGO (Composing Global Optimizers). Specifically, we show that the weight space over different numbers of hidden nodes of the 2-layer network is equipped with a semi-ring algebraic structure, and the loss function to be optimized consists of monomial potentials, which are ring homomorphism, allowing partial solutions to be composed into global ones by ring addition and multiplication. Our experiments show that around $95\%$ of the solutions obtained by gradient descent match exactly our theoretical constructions. Although the global optimizers constructed only required a small number of hidden nodes, our analysis on gradient dynamics shows that over-parameterization asymptotically decouples training dynamics and is beneficial. We further show that training dynamics favors simpler solutions under weight decay, and thus high-order global optimizers such as perfect memorization are unfavorable.</description>
