      <title>On universal-homogeneous hyperbolic graphs and spaces and their isometry groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Urysohn space is the unique separable metric space that is universal and homogeneous for finite metric spaces, i.e., it embeds any finite metric space any isometry between finite subspaces extends to an isometry of the whole space. We here consider the existence of a universal-homogeneous hyperbolic space. We show that for $\delta&gt;0$ there is no $\delta$-hyperbolic space which is universal and homogeneous in the above sense for all finite $\delta$-hpyerbolic spaces.
  We then show that for any $\delta\geq 0$ and any countable class $\mathcal{C}$ of $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with countably many distinguished $\delta$-closed subspaces there exists a $\delta$-hyperbolic metric space $\mathbb{H}_\mathcal{C}$ such that every $X\in \mathcal{C}$ can be embedded into $\mathbb{H}_\mathcal{C}$ as a $\delta$-closed subspace and any isometry between distinguished $\delta$-closed subspaces extends to an isometry of $\mathbb{H}_\mathcal{C}$.
  If $\mathcal{C}$ consists of $\delta$-hyperbolic geodesic spaces, then $\mathbb{H}_\mathcal{C}$ contains the quasi-tree of spaces as defined by Bestvina et al..
  For $\mathcal{C}_\delta$ the class of all finite $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with rational distances or the class of finite $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs, the limit $\mathbb{H}_\delta$ is a $\delta$-hyperbolic space (or graph, respectively) universal for all finite $\delta$-hyperbolic spaces with rational distances (or finite $\delta$-hyperbolic graphs) and such that any isometry between $\delta$-closed subspaces extends to an isometry of $\mathbb{H}_\delta$.
  We show that the isometry group of $\mathbb{H}_\delta$ does not contain elements of bounded displacement and has no dense conjugacy class.</description>

      <title>The $L_p$ Minkowski problems on affine dual quermassintegrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.12117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, {we extend the affine dual curvature measures to the $L_p$ setting and solve the existence part of the corresponding Minkowski problem for non-symmetric discrete measures when $p&gt;1$ and for symmetric measures when $p\geq0$.} When $p=0$, the $L_0$ Minkowski problem is the affine dual Minkowski problem, which is introduced and solved by Cai-Leng-Wu-Xi in [6].</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Structure for Many Hierarchically Hyperbolic Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The combinatorial hierarchical hyperbolicity criterion is a very useful way of constructing new hierarchically hyperbolic spaces (HHSs). We show that, conversely, HHSs satisfying natural assumptions (satisfied, for example, by mapping class groups) admit a combinatorial HHS structure. This can be useful in constructions of new HHSs, and also our construction clarifies how to apply the combinatorial HHS criterion to suspected examples. We also uncover connections between HHS notions and lattice theory notions.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity of systolic and Helly complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that finite (weakly) systolic and Helly complexes can be reconstructed from their boundary distances (computed in their 1-skeleta). Furthermore, Helly complexes and 2-dimensional systolic complexes can be reconstructed by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with respect to the number of vertices of the complex. Both results can be viewed as a positive contribution to a general question of Haslegrave, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan (2025). The reconstruction of a finite cell complex from the boundary distances is the discrete analogue of the boundary rigidity problem, which is a classical problem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Compressibility Barriers to Neighborhood-Preserving Data Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To what extent is it possible to visualize high-dimensional data in two- or three-dimensional plots? We reframe this question in terms of embedding $n$-vertex graphs (representing the neighborhood structure of the input points) into metric spaces of low doubling dimension $d$ in such a way that keeps neighbors close and non-neighbors far. This notion of neighbor preservation can be understood as a considerably weaker embedding constraint than near-isometry, yet it is similarly as demanding in terms of how the minimum required dimension scales with the number of points. We show that for an overwhelming fraction of graphs, $d = \Theta(\log n)$ is both necessary and sufficient for neighbor preservation. Even sparse regular graphs, which represent more restricted neighborhood connectivity structures, typically require $d= \Omega(\log n / \log\log n)$. The landscape changes dramatically when embedding into normed spaces: general graphs become exponentially harder to embed, requiring $d=\Omega(n)$, while sparse regular graphs continue to admit $d = O(\log n)$. Finally, we study the implications of these results for visualizing data with intrinsic cluster structure. We show that graphs produced from a planted partition model with $k$ clusters on $n$ points typically require $d=\Omega(\log n)$, even when the cluster structure is salient. These results challenge the aspiration that constant-dimensional visualizations can faithfully preserve neighborhood structure.</description>
