      <title>On Probabilistic and Causal Reasoning with Summation Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ibeling et al. (2023). axiomatize increasingly expressive languages of causation and probability, and Mosse et al. (2024) show that reasoning (specifically the satisfiability problem) in each causal language is as difficult, from a computational complexity perspective, as reasoning in its merely probabilistic or "correlational" counterpart. Introducing a summation operator to capture common devices that appear in applications -- such as the $do$-calculus of Pearl (2009) for causal inference, which makes ample use of marginalization -- van der Zander et al. (2023) partially extend these earlier complexity results to causal and probabilistic languages with marginalization. We complete this extension, fully characterizing the complexity of probabilistic and causal reasoning with summation, demonstrating that these again remain equally difficult. Surprisingly, allowing free variables for random variable values results in a system that is undecidable, so long as the ranges of these random variables are unrestricted. We finally axiomatize these languages featuring marginalization (or more generally summation), resolving open questions posed by Ibeling et al. (2023).</description>

      <title>Weak diamond and pcf theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain bounds on the cardinality of $pcf(\mathfrak{a})$ from instances of weak diamond. Consequently, under mild assumptions there are many singular cardinals of the from $\aleph_\delta$ for which $2^{\aleph_\delta}&lt;\aleph_{(|\delta|^{+3})}$. For example, if every limit cardinal is a strong limit cardinal then this bound holds at a class of singular cardinals.</description>

      <title>On the categoricity of complete second order theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show, assuming PD, that every complete finitely axiomatized second order theory with a countable model is categorical, but that there is, assuming again PD, a complete recursively axiomatized second order theory with a countable model which is non-categorical. We show that the existence of even very large (e.g. supercompact) cardinals does not imply the categoricity of all finite complete second order theories. More exactly, we show that a non-categorical complete finitely axiomatized second order theory can always be obtained by (set) forcing. We also show that the categoricity of all finite complete second order theories with a model of a certain singular cardinality kappa of uncountable cofinality can be forced over any model of set theory. Previously, Solovay had proved, assuming V=L, that every complete finitely axiomatized second order theory (with or without a countable model) is categorical, and that in a generic extension of L there is a complete finitely axiomatized second order theory with a countable model which is non-categorical.</description>

      <title>Axiomatizing the Logic of Ordinary Discourse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most non-classical logics are subclassical, that is, every inference/theorem they validate is also valid classically. A notable exception is the three-valued propositional Logic of Ordinary Discourse (OL) proposed and extensively motivated by W. S. Cooper as a more adequate candidate for formalizing everyday reasoning (in English). OL challenges classical logic not only by rejecting some theses, but also by accepting non-classically valid principles, such as so-called Aristotle's and Boethius' theses. Formally, OL shows a number of unusual features - it is non-structural, connexive, paraconsistent and contradictory - making it all the more interesting for the mathematical logician. We present our recent findings on OL and its structural companion (that we call sOL). We introduce Hilbert-style multiple-conclusion calculi for OL and sOL that are both modular and analytic, and easily allow us to obtain single-conclusion axiomatizations. We prove that sOL is algebraizable and single out its equivalent semantics, which turns out to be a discriminator variety generated by a three-element algebra. Having observed that sOL can express the connectives of other three-valued logics, we prove that it is definitionally equivalent to an expansion of the three-valued logic J3 of D'Ottaviano and da Costa, itself an axiomatic extension of paraconsistent Nelson logic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complete MV-algebras are naturally equipped with frame structures. We call them MV-frames and investigate some of their main the properties as frames. We completely characterized algebraic MV-frames as well as regular MV-frames. In addition, we consider nuclei on MV-frames in general and on MV-frames of ideals of Lukasiewicz rings. Finally, we used the Chang-Mundici functor to explore the frame structures of complete unital lattice-ordered groups.</description>

      <title>Trivial Automorphisms of Reduced Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a general method for showing under weak forcing axioms that reduced products of countable models of a theory $T$ have as few automorphisms as possible. We show that such forcing axioms imply that reduced products of countably infinite or finite fields, linear orders, trees, or random graphs have only trivial automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Ordinals and recursively defined functions on the reals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.17210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.17210v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a function $f:\mathbb R\to\mathbb R$, call a decreasing sequence $x_1&gt;x_2&gt;x_3&gt;\cdots$ $f$-bad if $f(x_1)&gt;f(x_2)&gt;f(x_3)&gt;\cdots$, and call the function $f$ "ordinal decreasing" if there exist no infinite $f$-bad sequences. We prove the following result, which generalizes results of Erickson et al. (2022) and Bufetov et al. (2024): Given ordinal decreasing functions $f,g_1,\ldots,g_k,s$ that are everywhere larger than $0$, define the recursive algorithm "$M(x)$: if $x&lt;0$ return $f(x)$, else return $g_1(-M(x-g_2(-M(x-\cdots-g_k(-M(x-s(x)))\cdots))))$". Then $M(x)$ halts and is ordinal decreasing for all $x \in \mathbb{R}$.
  More specifically, given an ordinal decreasing function $f$, denote by $o(f)$ the ordinal height of the root of the tree of $f$-bad sequences. Then we prove that, for $k\ge 2$, the function $M(x)$ defined by the above algorithm satisfies $o(M)\le\varphi_{k-1}(\gamma+o(s)+1)$, where $\gamma$ is the smallest ordinal such that $\max{\{o(s),o(f),o(g_1), \ldots, o(g_k)\}}&lt;\varphi_{k-1}(\gamma)$.</description>

      <title>On sofic approximations of non amenable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.04713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.04713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we exhibit for every non amenable group that is initially sub-amenable (sometimes also referred to as LEA), two sofic approximations that are not conjugate by any automorphism of the universal sofic group. This addresses a question of Paunescu and generalizes the Elek-Szabo uniqueness theorem for sofic approximations.</description>

      <title>Taking Bi-Intuitionistic Logic First-Order: A Proof-Theoretic Investigation via Polytree Sequents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that extending the Hilbert axiomatic system for first-order intuitionistic logic with an exclusion operator, that is dual to implication, collapses the domains in the model into a constant domain. This makes it a very challenging problem to find a sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with non-constant domains, that is also conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. We solve this problem by presenting the first sound and complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic with increasing domains. We formalize our proof system in a labeled polytree sequent calculus (a notational variant of nested sequents), and prove that it enjoys cut-elimination and is conservative over first-order intuitionistic logic. A key feature of our calculus is an explicit eigenvariable context, which allows us to control precisely the scope of free variables in a polytree structure. Semantically this context can be seen as encoding a notion of Scott's existence predicate for intuitionistic logic. This turns out to be crucial to avoid the collapse of domains and to prove the completeness of our proof system. The explicit consideration of the variable context in a formula sheds light on a previously overlooked dependency between the residuation principle and the existence predicate in the first-order setting, that may help explain the difficulty in obtaining a complete proof system for first-order bi-intuitionistic logic.</description>
