      <title>Concurrent Multiphysics and Multiscale Topology Optimization for Lightweight Laser-Driven Porous Actuator Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15820v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this research, multi-physics topology optimization is employed to achieve the detailed design of a lightweight porous linear actuation mechanism that harnesses energy through laser activation. A multiscale topology optimization methodology is introduced for micro- and macroscale design, considering energy dissipation via heat convection and radiation. This investigation meticulously considers the impact of heat dissipation mechanisms, including thermal conduction, convection, and radiation. Through various numerical cases, we systematically explore the influence of micro-scale considerations on porous design and understand the effects on the topology optimization process by incorporating various microstructural systems. The results demonstrate that porous actuator designs exhibit superior performance compared to solid actuator designs. This study contributes to advancing the understanding of multiscale effects in topology optimization, paving the way for more efficient and lightweight designs in the field of laser-activated porous actuators.</description>

      <title>Transmission Interface Power Flow Adjustment: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach based on Multi-task Attribution Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transmission interface power flow adjustment is a critical measure to ensure the security and economy operation of power systems. However, conventional model-based adjustment schemes are limited by the increasing variations and uncertainties occur in power systems, where the adjustment problems of different transmission interfaces are often treated as several independent tasks, ignoring their coupling relationship and even leading to conflict decisions. In this paper, we introduce a novel data-driven deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach, to handle multiple power flow adjustment tasks jointly instead of learning each task from scratch. At the heart of the proposed method is a multi-task attribution map (MAM), which enables the DRL agent to explicitly attribute each transmission interface task to different power system nodes with task-adaptive attention weights. Based on this MAM, the agent can further provide effective strategies to solve the multi-task adjustment problem with a near-optimal operation cost. Simulation results on the IEEE 118-bus system, a realistic 300-bus system in China, and a very large European system with 9241 buses demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the performance compared with several baseline methods, and exhibits high interpretability with the learnable MAM.</description>

      <title>An Audio-Based Iterative Controller for Soft Landing of Electromechanical Relays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromechanical relays and contactors suffer from strong collisions at the end of the switching operations. This causes several undesirable phenomena, such as clicking, mechanical wear and contact bounce. Thus, there is great interest in mitigating these switching impacts while keeping the advantageous features of these devices. This paper proposes a complete control strategy for soft landing. The control structure includes three main components. The first one is a real-time flux-tracking feedback controller, which presents several advantages over voltage or current control. The second one is a feedforward controller, which computes the flux reference signal based on a proposed dynamical model and the desired position trajectory for the switching operations. Lastly, the third control component is a learning-type run-to-run adaptation law that iteratively adapts the model parameters based on an audio signal. It exploits the repetitive nature of these devices in order to circumvent modeling discrepancies due to unit-to-unit variability or small changes between operations. The effectiveness of the proposed control is demonstrated through various experiments.</description>

      <title>Safe Deep Model-Based Reinforcement Learning with Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model-based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) has shown many desirable properties for intelligent control tasks. However, satisfying safety and stability constraints during training and rollout remains an open question. We propose a new Model-based RL framework to enable efficient policy learning with unknown dynamics based on learning model predictive control (LMPC) framework with mathematically provable guarantees of stability. We introduce and explore a novel method for adding safety constraints for model-based RL during training and policy learning. The new stability-augmented framework consists of a neural-network-based learner that learns to construct a Lyapunov function, and a model-based RL agent to consistently complete the tasks while satisfying user-specified constraints given only sub-optimal demonstrations and sparse-cost feedback. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed framework through simulated experiments.</description>

      <title>Conformal Robust Control of Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: End-to-end engineering design pipelines, in which designs are evaluated using concurrently defined optimal controllers, are becoming increasingly common in practice. To discover designs that perform well even under the misspecification of system dynamics, such end-to-end pipelines have now begun evaluating designs with a robust control objective in place of the nominal optimal control setup. Current approaches of specifying such robust control subproblems, however, rely on hand specification of perturbations anticipated to be present upon deployment or margin methods that ignore problem structure, resulting in a lack of theoretical guarantees and overly conservative empirical performance. We, instead, propose a novel methodology for LQR systems that leverages conformal prediction to specify such uncertainty regions in a data-driven fashion. Such regions have distribution-free coverage guarantees on the true system dynamics, in turn allowing for a probabilistic characterization of the regret of the resulting robust controller. We then demonstrate that such a controller can be efficiently produced via a novel policy gradient method that has convergence guarantees. We finally demonstrate the superior empirical performance of our method over alternate robust control specifications in a collection of engineering control systems, specifically for airfoils and a load-positioning system.</description>

      <title>On the damping of power systems during inverter-based blackstart</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The massive deployment of inverter-based generation poses several challenges to system operators but also offers new opportunities. In the context of grid recovery, inverter-based generation is expected to take over new responsibilities, as conventional generation that are blackstart capable are being decommissioned. Inverter-based facilities, being very flexible and controllable, have the ability to contribute during grid restoration, although it is still unclear how to deal with the limited ratings of batteries, PV, etc. and how to address nonlinear effects such as inrush currents or harmonics. In this direction, the requirements of grid-forming inverters to comply with black start capabilities are still to be defined. During the first steps of a grid restoration process the dynamics of the grid largely vary from the grid behaviour under normal operation. In particular, the grid is nearly unloaded and therefore poorly damped. Indeed, overvoltages and resonances are a common concern during the energization of long transmission lines. In this work we analyse the spectral properties of unloaded transmission lines, and describe the impact of voltage controllers on the damping of the system. As a byproduct, this analysis can be leveraged to propose high level requirements for grid-forming devices, in order to provide adequate damping during the early stages of a grid restoration process.</description>

      <title>Prudent Price-Responsive Demands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a flexible demand with a risk-neutral cost-saving objective in response to volatile electricity prices. We introduce the concept of prudent demand, which states that future price uncertainties will affect immediate consumption patterns, despite the price expectations remaining unchanged. We develop a theoretical framework and prove that demand exhibits prudence when the third-order derivative of its utility cost function is positive, and show a prudent demand demonstrates risk-averse behaviors despite the objective being risk-neutral. . Prudent demands exhibit skewness aversion, with increased price skewness elevating the cost associated with prudence. We validate our theoretical findings through numerical simulations and conclude their implications for demand response modeling and the future design of incentive-based demand response mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Make Safe Decisions in Power System: Safe Reinforcement Learning Based Pre-decision Making for Voltage Stability Emergency Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high penetration of renewable energy and power electronic equipment bring significant challenges to the efficient construction of adaptive emergency control strategies against various presumed contingencies in today's power systems. Traditional model-based emergency control methods have difficulty in adapt well to various complicated operating conditions in practice. Fr emerging artificial intelligence-based approaches, i.e., reinforcement learning-enabled solutions, they are yet to provide solid safety assurances under strict constraints in practical power systems. To address these research gaps, this paper develops a safe reinforcement learning (SRL)-based pre-decision making framework against short-term voltage collapse. Our proposed framework employs neural networks for pre-decision formulation, security margin estimation, and corrective action implementation, without reliance on precise system parameters. Leveraging the gradient projection, we propose a security projecting correction algorithm that offers theoretical security assurances to amend risky actions. The applicability of the algorithm is further enhanced through the incorporation of active learning, which expedites the training process and improves security estimation accuracy. Extensive numerical tests on the New England 39-bus system and the realistic Guangdong Provincal Power Grid demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Periodic Scenario Trees: A Novel Framework for Robust Periodic Invariance and Stabilization of Constrained Uncertain Linear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes a new a framework for determining robust periodic invariant sets and their associated control laws for constrained uncertain linear systems. Necessary and sufficient conditions for stabilizability by periodic controllers are stated and proven using finite step Lyapunov functions for the unconstrained case. We then introduce a scenario tree interpretation of finite step Lyapunov functions for uncertain systems and show that this interpretation results in useful criteria for the design of robust stabilizing controllers. In particular, novel convex feasibility criteria for the synthesis of simple static controllers and what we call linear interpolating tree periodic controllers with memory are derived. It is proven that for a sufficiently large length of the period, a stabilizing linear interpolating tree periodic controller can always be found using the proposed criterion provided that the uncertain system is stabilizable by such controllers. In this sense, the presented synthesis method is non-conservative. The results are then extended to constrained uncertain linear systems and conditions for controllers that realize robust periodic invariant sets which are less conservative than those that result from the known methods in the literature are derived.</description>

      <title>Deep Koopman Learning using the Noisy Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven framework to learn a finite-dimensional approximation of a Koopman operator for approximating the state evolution of a dynamical system under noisy observations. To this end, our proposed solution has two main advantages. First, the proposed method only requires the measurement noise to be bounded. Second, the proposed method modifies the existing deep Koopman operator formulations by characterizing the effect of the measurement noise on the Koopman operator learning and then mitigating it by updating the tunable parameter of the observable functions of the Koopman operator, making it easy to implement. The performance of the proposed method is demonstrated on several standard benchmarks. We further compare the presented method with similar methods proposed in the latest literature on Koopman learning.</description>

      <title>Free-Space Optical Channel Turbulence Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Channel turbulence presents a formidable obstacle for free-space optical (FSO) communication. Anticipation of turbulence levels is highly important for mitigating disruptions. We study the application of machine learning (ML) to FSO data streams to rapidly predict channel turbulence levels with no additional sensing hardware. An optical bit stream was transmitted through a controlled channel in the lab under six distinct turbulence levels, and the efficacy of using ML to classify turbulence levels was examined. ML-based turbulence level classification was found to be &gt;98% accurate with multiple ML training parameters, but highly dependent upon the timescale of changes between turbulence levels.</description>

      <title>Graphon Particle Systems, Part I: Spatio-Temporal Approximation and Law of Large Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of graphon particle systems with time-varying random coefficients. In a graphon particle system, the interactions among particles are characterized by the coupled mean field terms through an underlying graphon and the randomness of the coefficients comes from the stochastic processes associated with the particle labels. By constructing two-level approximated sequences converging in 2-Wasserstein distance, we prove the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the system. Besides, by constructing two-level approximated functions converging to the graphon mean field terms, we establish the law of large numbers, which reveals that if the number of particles tends to infinity and the discretization step tends to zero, then the discrete-time interacting particle system over the large-scale network converges to the graphon particle system. As a byproduct, we discover that the graphon particle system can describe the dynamic evolution of the distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm over the large-scale network and prove that if the gradients of the local cost functions are Lipschitz continuous, then the graphon particle system can be regarded as the spatio-temporal approximation of the discrete-time distributed stochastic gradient descent algorithm as the number of network nodes tends to infinity and the algorithm step size tends to zero.</description>

      <title>Privacy and Security Trade-off in Interconnected Systems with Known or Unknown Privacy Noise Covariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the security problem for interconnected systems, where each subsystem is required to detect local attacks using locally available information and the information received from its neighboring subsystems. Moreover, we consider that there exists an additional eavesdropper being able to infer the private information by eavesdropping transmitted data between subsystems. Then, a privacy-preserving method is employed by adding privacy noise to transmitted data, and the privacy level is measured by mutual information. Nevertheless, adding privacy noise to transmitted data may affect the detection performance metrics such as detection probability and false alarm probability. Thus, we theoretically analyze the trade-off between the privacy and the detection performance. An optimization problem with maximizing both the degree of privacy preservation and the detection probability is established to obtain the covariance of the privacy noise. In addition, the attack detector of each subsystem may not obtain all information about the privacy noise. We further theoretically analyze the trade-off between the privacy and the false alarm probability when the attack detector has no knowledge of the privacy noise covariance. An optimization problem with maximizing the degree of privacy preservation with guaranteeing a bound of false alarm distortion level is established to obtain {\color{black}{the covariance of the privacy noise}}. Moreover, to analyze the effect of the privacy noise on the detection probability, we consider that each subsystem can estimate the unknown privacy noise covariance by the secondary data. Based on the estimated covariance, we construct another attack detector and analyze how the privacy noise affects its detection performance. Finally, a numerical example is provided to verify the effectiveness of theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To advance control, operation and planning tools of electrical networks with ML is not straightforward. 110 experts were surveyed showing where and how ML algorithmis could advance. This paper assesses this survey and research environment. Then it develops an innovation roadmap that helps align our research community towards a goal-oriented realisation of the opportunities that AI upholds. This paper finds that the R\&amp;D environment of system operators (and the surrounding research ecosystem) needs adaptation to enable faster developments with AI while maintaining high testing quality and safety. This roadmap may interest research centre managers in system operators, academics, and labs dedicated to advancing the next generation of tooling for electrical networks.</description>

      <title>Physically Consistent Modeling &amp; Identification of Nonlinear Friction with Dissipative Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Friction modeling has always been a challenging problem due to the complexity of real physical systems. Although a few state-of-the-art structured data-driven methods show their efficiency in nonlinear system modeling, deterministic passivity as one of the significant characteristics of friction is rarely considered in these methods. To address this issue, we propose a Gaussian Process based model that preserves the inherent structural properties such as passivity. A matrix-vector physical structure is considered in our approaches to ensure physical consistency, in particular, enabling a guarantee of positive semi-definiteness of the damping matrix. An aircraft benchmark simulation is employed to demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology. Estimation accuracy and data efficiency are increased substantially by considering and enforcing more structured physical knowledge. Also, the fulfillment of the dissipative nature of the aerodynamics is validated numerically.</description>

      <title>Revised Optimal design of power electronic transformer based on hybrid MMC under over-modulation operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bridge arm of the hybrid modular multilevel converter (MMC) is composed of half-bridge and full-bridge sub-modules cascaded together. Compared with the half-bridge MMC, it can operate in the boost-AC mode, where the modulation index can be higher than 1, and the DC voltage and the AC voltage level are no longer mutually constrained; compared with the full-bridge MMC, it has lower switching device costs and losses. When the hybrid MMC boost-AC mode is used in the power electronic transformer, the degree of freedom in system design is improved, and the cost and volume of the power electronic transformer system can be further reduced. This paper analyzes how to make full use of the newly added modulation index of freedom introduced by the boost-AC hybrid MMC to optimize the power electronic transformer system, and finally gives the optimal modulation index selection scheme of the hybrid MMC for different optimization objectives.</description>

      <title>Model-Agnostic Zeroth-Order Policy Optimization for Meta-Learning of Ergodic Linear Quadratic Regulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meta-learning has been proposed as a promising machine learning topic in recent years, with important applications to image classification, robotics, computer games, and control systems. In this paper, we study the problem of using meta-learning to deal with uncertainty and heterogeneity in ergodic linear quadratic regulators. We integrate the zeroth-order optimization technique with a typical meta-learning method, proposing an algorithm that omits the estimation of policy Hessian, which applies to tasks of learning a set of heterogeneous but similar linear dynamic systems. The induced meta-objective function inherits important properties of the original cost function when the set of linear dynamic systems are meta-learnable, allowing the algorithm to optimize over a learnable landscape without projection onto the feasible set. We provide a convergence result for the exact gradient descent process by analyzing the boundedness and smoothness of the gradient for the meta-objective, which justify the proposed algorithm with gradient estimation error being small. We also provide a numerical example to corroborate this perspective.</description>

      <title>Global Output-Feedback Extremum Seeking Control with Source Seeking Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the design of an extremum seeking controller that relies on a monitoring function for a class of SISO uncertain nonlinear systems characterized by arbitrary and uncertain relative degree. Our demonstration illustrates the feasibility of achieving an arbitrarily small proximity to the desired optimal point through output feedback. The core concept involves integrating a monitoring function with a norm state observer for the unitary relative degree case and its expansion to arbitrary relative degrees by means of the employment of a time-scaling technique. Significantly, our proposed scheme attains the extremum of an unknown nonlinear mapping across the entire domain of initial conditions, ensuring global convergence and stability for the real-time optimization algorithm. Furthermore, we provide tuning rules to ensure convergence to the global maximum in the presence of local extrema. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we present a numerical example and apply it to a source-seeking problem involving a cart-track linear positioning servomechanism. Notably, the cart lacks the ability to sense its velocity or the source's position, but can detect the source of a light signal of unknown concentration field.</description>

      <title>Application based Evaluation of an Efficient Spike-Encoder, "Spiketrum"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spike-based encoders represent information as sequences of spikes or pulses, which are transmitted between neurons. A prevailing consensus suggests that spike-based approaches demonstrate exceptional capabilities in capturing the temporal dynamics of neural activity and have the potential to provide energy-efficient solutions for low-power applications. The Spiketrum encoder efficiently compresses input data using spike trains or code sets (for non-spiking applications) and is adaptable to both hardware and software implementations, with lossless signal reconstruction capability. The paper proposes and assesses Spiketrum's hardware, evaluating its output under varying spike rates and its classification performance with popular spiking and non-spiking classifiers, and also assessing the quality of information compression and hardware resource utilization. The paper extensively benchmarks both Spiketrum hardware and its software counterpart against state-of-the-art, biologically-plausible encoders. The evaluations encompass benchmarking criteria, including classification accuracy, training speed, and sparsity when using encoder outputs in pattern recognition and classification with both spiking and non-spiking classifiers. Additionally, they consider encoded output entropy and hardware resource utilization and power consumption of the hardware version of the encoders. Results demonstrate Spiketrum's superiority in most benchmarking criteria, making it a promising choice for various applications. It efficiently utilizes hardware resources with low power consumption, achieving high classification accuracy. This work also emphasizes the potential of encoders in spike-based processing to improve the efficiency and performance of neural computing systems.</description>

      <title>A Low-Cost Teleoperable Surgical Robot with a Macro-Micro Structure and a Continuum Tip for Open-Source Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical robotic systems equipped with microscale, high-dexterity manipulators have shown promising results in minimally invasive surgery (MIS). One barrier to the widespread adoption of such systems is the prohibitive cost of research and development efforts using current state-of-the-art equipment. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a low-cost and modifiable tendon-driven continuum manipulator for MIS applications. The device is capable of being teleoperated in conjunction with a macro-scale six-axis robotic arm using a haptic stylus. Its control software incorporates and extends freely available and open-source software packages. For verification, we perform teleoperation trials on the proposed continuum manipulator using an electromagnetic tracker. We then integrate the manipulator with a UR5e robotic arm. A series of simulated tumour biopsies were conducted using the integrated robotic system and an anatomical model (phantom), validating its potential efficacy in MIS applications. The complete source code, CAD files for all additively manufactured components, a parts list for the manipulator, and a demonstration video of the proposed system are made available in this work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have demonstrated the potential to boost network capacity and expand coverage by adjusting their electromagnetic properties, existing RIS architectures have certain limitations, such as double-fading attenuation and restricted half-space coverage. In this article, we delve into the progressive development from single to multi-functional RIS (MF-RIS) that enables simultaneous signal amplification, reflection, and refraction. We begin by detailing the hardware design and signal model that distinguish MF-RIS from traditional RISs. Subsequently, we introduce the key technologies underpinning MF-RIS-aided communications, along with the fundamental issues and challenges inherent to its deployment. We then outline the promising applications of MFRIS in the realm of communication, sensing, and computation systems, highlighting its transformative impact on these domains. Lastly, we present simulation results to demonstrate the superiority of MF-RIS in enhancing network performance in terms of spectral efficiency.</description>

      <title>USD: Unsupervised Soft Contrastive Learning for Fault Detection in Multivariate Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised fault detection in multivariate time series is critical for maintaining the integrity and efficiency of complex systems, with current methodologies largely focusing on statistical and machine learning techniques. However, these approaches often rest on the assumption that data distributions conform to Gaussian models, overlooking the diversity of patterns that can manifest in both normal and abnormal states, thereby diminishing discriminative performance. Our innovation addresses this limitation by introducing a combination of data augmentation and soft contrastive learning, specifically designed to capture the multifaceted nature of state behaviors more accurately. The data augmentation process enriches the dataset with varied representations of normal states, while soft contrastive learning fine-tunes the model's sensitivity to the subtle differences between normal and abnormal patterns, enabling it to recognize a broader spectrum of anomalies. This dual strategy significantly boosts the model's ability to distinguish between normal and abnormal states, leading to a marked improvement in fault detection performance across multiple datasets and settings, thereby setting a new benchmark for unsupervised fault detection in complex systems. The code of our method is available at \url{https://github.com/zangzelin/code_USD.git}.</description>

      <title>Deep Reinforcement Learning with Enhanced PPO for Safe Mobile Robot Navigation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collision-free motion is essential for mobile robots. Most approaches to collision-free and efficient navigation with wheeled robots require parameter tuning by experts to obtain good navigation behavior. This study investigates the application of deep reinforcement learning to train a mobile robot for autonomous navigation in a complex environment. The robot utilizes LiDAR sensor data and a deep neural network to generate control signals guiding it toward a specified target while avoiding obstacles. We employ two reinforcement learning algorithms in the Gazebo simulation environment: Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient and proximal policy optimization. The study introduces an enhanced neural network structure in the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm to boost performance, accompanied by a well-designed reward function to improve algorithm efficacy. Experimental results conducted in both obstacle and obstacle-free environments underscore the effectiveness of the proposed approach. This research significantly contributes to the advancement of autonomous robotics in complex environments through the application of deep reinforcement learning.</description>

      <title>Formalising the intentional stance: attributing goals and beliefs to stochastic processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We are concerned with the behaviour of stochastic systems with inputs and outputs, and how this might relate to the pursuit of a goal. We model this using what we term transducers, which are a mathematical object that captures only the external behaviour of such a system and not its internal state. We present a framework for reasoning about the optimality of such a process, when it is coupled to a 'teleo-environment' consisting of another transducer that also embodies a success criterion. We find that (globally) optimal transducers have a property closely related to Bellman's theorem: a transducer that is optimal in one time step will again be optimal in the next time step, but with respect to a different environment (obtained from the original one by a modified version of Bayesian filtering). We also consider bounded rationality and its relationship to constrained optimality, which in our framework means optimal within some subset of all transducers. We describe a condition that is sufficient for such a subset to have this Bellman property. Additionally, we show that a policy is deterministic if and only if there exists a teleo-envionment for which it is uniquely optimal among the set of all transducers; this is at least conceptually related to classical representation theorems from decision theory. This need not hold for constrained subsets; we give an example of this related to the so-called absent-minded driver problem. All of the formalism is defined using coinduction, following the style proposed by Czajka [9].</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a complete inverse optimality study for a linearized tank-liquid system where the liquid is described by the viscous Saint-Venant model with surface tension and possible wall friction. We define an appropriate weak solution notion for which we establish existence/uniqueness results with inputs that do not necessarily satisfy any compatibility condition as well as stabilization results with feedback laws that are constructed with the help of a Control Lyapunov Functional. We show that the proposed family of stabilizing feedback laws is optimal for a certain meaningful quadratic cost functional. Finally, we show that the optimal feedback law guarantees additional stronger stability estimates which are similar to those obtained in the case of classical solutions.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Incentive Design with Learning Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How can the system operator learn an incentive mechanism that achieves social optimality based on limited information about the agents' behavior, who are dynamically updating their strategies? To answer this question, we propose an \emph{adaptive} incentive mechanism. This mechanism updates the incentives of agents based on the feedback of each agent's externality, evaluated as the difference between the player's marginal cost and society's marginal cost at each time step. The proposed mechanism updates the incentives on a slower timescale compared to the agents' learning dynamics, resulting in a two-timescale coupled dynamical system. Notably, this mechanism is agnostic to the specific learning dynamics used by agents to update their strategies. We show that any fixed point of this adaptive incentive mechanism corresponds to the optimal incentive mechanism, ensuring that the Nash equilibrium coincides with the socially optimal strategy. Additionally, we provide sufficient conditions that guarantee the convergence of the adaptive incentive mechanism to a fixed point. Our results apply to both atomic and non-atomic games. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanism, we verify the convergence conditions in two practically relevant games: atomic networked quadratic aggregative games and non-atomic network routing games.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) in large or infinite state spaces is notoriously challenging, both theoretically (where worst-case sample and computational complexities must scale with state space cardinality) and experimentally (where function approximation and policy gradient techniques often scale poorly and suffer from instability and high variance). One line of research attempting to address these difficulties makes the natural assumption that we are given a collection of heuristic base or $\textit{constituent}$ policies upon which we would like to improve in a scalable manner. In this work we aim to compete with the $\textit{max-following policy}$, which at each state follows the action of whichever constituent policy has the highest value. The max-following policy is always at least as good as the best constituent policy, and may be considerably better. Our main result is an efficient algorithm that learns to compete with the max-following policy, given only access to the constituent policies (but not their value functions). In contrast to prior work in similar settings, our theoretical results require only the minimal assumption of an ERM oracle for value function approximation for the constituent policies (and not the global optimal policy or the max-following policy itself) on samplable distributions. We illustrate our algorithm's experimental effectiveness and behavior on several robotic simulation testbeds.</description>

      <title>Injecting Hamiltonian Architectural Bias into Deep Graph Networks for Long-Range Propagation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of information diffusion within graphs is a critical open issue that heavily influences graph representation learning, especially when considering long-range propagation. This calls for principled approaches that control and regulate the degree of propagation and dissipation of information throughout the neural flow. Motivated by this, we introduce (port-)Hamiltonian Deep Graph Networks, a novel framework that models neural information flow in graphs by building on the laws of conservation of Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We reconcile under a single theoretical and practical framework both non-dissipative long-range propagation and non-conservative behaviors, introducing tools from mechanical systems to gauge the equilibrium between the two components. Our approach can be applied to general message-passing architectures, and it provides theoretical guarantees on information conservation in time. Empirical results prove the effectiveness of our port-Hamiltonian scheme in pushing simple graph convolutional architectures to state-of-the-art performance in long-range benchmarks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent years, various intelligent autonomous robots have begun to appear in daily life and production. Desktop-level robots are characterized by their flexible deployment, rapid response, and suitability for light workload environments. In order to meet the current societal demand for service robot technology, this study proposes using a miniaturized desktop-level robot (by ROS) as a carrier, locally deploying a natural language model (NLP-BERT), and integrating visual recognition (CV-YOLO) and speech recognition technology (ASR-Whisper) as inputs to achieve autonomous decision-making and rational action by the desktop robot. Three comprehensive experiments were designed to validate the robotic arm, and the results demonstrate excellent performance using this approach across all three experiments. In Task 1, the execution rates for speech recognition and action performance were 92.6% and 84.3%, respectively. In Task 2, the highest execution rates under the given conditions reached 92.1% and 84.6%, while in Task 3, the highest execution rates were 95.2% and 80.8%, respectively. Therefore, it can be concluded that the proposed solution integrating ASR, NLP, and other technologies on edge devices is feasible and provides a technical and engineering foundation for realizing multimodal desktop-level robots.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present for the first time a supermartingale certificate for $\omega$-regular specifications. We leverage the Robbins &amp; Siegmund convergence theorem to characterize supermartingale certificates for the almost-sure acceptance of Streett conditions on general stochastic processes, which we call Streett supermartingales. This enables effective verification and control of discrete-time stochastic dynamical models with infinite state space under $\omega$-regular and linear temporal logic specifications. Our result generalises reachability, safety, reach-avoid, persistence and recurrence specifications; our contribution applies to discrete-time stochastic dynamical models and probabilistic programs with discrete and continuous state spaces and distributions, and carries over to deterministic models and programs. We provide a synthesis algorithm for control policies and Streett supermartingales as proof certificates for $\omega$-regular objectives, which is sound and complete for supermartingales and control policies with polynomial templates and any stochastic dynamical model whose post-expectation is expressible as a polynomial. We additionally provide an optimisation of our algorithm that reduces the problem to satisfiability modulo theories, under the assumption that templates and post-expectation are in piecewise linear form. We have built a prototype and have demonstrated the efficacy of our approach on several exemplar $\omega$-regular verification and control synthesis problems.</description>

      <title>Measuring Exploration: Review and Systematic Evaluation of Modelling to Generate Alternatives Methods in Macro-Energy Systems Planning Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As decarbonization agendas mature, macro-energy systems modelling studies have increasingly focused on enhanced decision support methods that move beyond least-cost modelling to improve consideration of additional objectives and tradeoffs. One candidate is Modeling to Generate Alternatives (MGA), which systematically explores new objectives without explicit stakeholder elicitation. Previous literature lacks both a comprehensive review of MGA vector selection methods in large-scale energy system models and comparative testing of their relative efficacies in this setting. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive review of the MGA literature, identifying at least seven MGA vector selection methodologies and carrying out a systematic evaluation of four: Hop-Skip-Jump, Random Vector, Variable Min/Max, and Modelling All Alternatives. We examine each method's runtime, parallelizability, new solution discovery efficiency, and spatial exploration in lower dimensional (N &lt;= 100) spaces, as well as spatial exploration in a three-zone, 8760-hour capacity expansion model case. Through these tests, we find Random Vector provides the broadest exploration of the near-optimal feasible region and Variable Min/Max provides the most extreme results, while the two tie on computational speed. We thus propose a new Hybrid vector selection approach combining the two methods to take advantage of the strengths of each. Additional analysis is provided on MGA variable selection, in which we demonstrate MGA problems formulated over generation variables fail to retain cost-optimal dispatch and are thus not reflective of real operations of equivalent hypothetical capacity choices. As such, we recommend future studies utilize a parallelized combined vector approach over the set of capacity variables for best results in computational speed and spatial exploration while retaining optimal dispatch.</description>

Abstract: We propose a continuous feedback control strategy that steers a point-mass vehicle safely to a destination, in a quasi-optimal manner, in sphere worlds. The main idea consists in avoiding each obstacle via the shortest path on the cone's surface enclosing the obstacle and moving straight toward the target when the vehicle has a clear line of sight to the target location. In particular, almost global asymptotic stability of the target location is achieved in two-dimensional (2D) environments under a particular assumption on the obstacles configuration. We also propose a reactive (sensor-based) approach, suitable for real-time implementations in a priori unknown 2D environments with sufficiently curved convex obstacles, guaranteeing almost global asymptotic stability of the target location. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Sequencing-enabled Hierarchical Cooperative CAV On-ramp Merging Control with Enhanced Stability and Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a sequencing-enabled hierarchical connected automated vehicle (CAV) cooperative on-ramp merging control framework. The proposed framework consists of a two-layer design: the upper level control sequences the vehicles to harmonize the traffic density across mainline and on-ramp segments while enhancing lower-level control efficiency through a mixed-integer linear programming formulation. Subsequently, the lower-level control employs a longitudinal distributed model predictive control (MPC) supplemented by a virtual car-following (CF) concept to ensure asymptotic local stability, l_2 norm string stability, and safety. Proofs of asymptotic local stability and l_2 norm string stability are mathematically derived. Compared to other prevalent asymptotic local-stable MPC controllers, the proposed distributed MPC controller greatly expands the initial feasible set. Additionally, an auxiliary lateral control is developed to maintain lane-keeping and merging smoothness while accommodating ramp geometric curvature. To validate the proposed framework, multiple numerical experiments are conducted. Results indicate a notable outperformance of our upper-level controller against a distance-based sequencing method. Furthermore, the lower-level control effectively ensures smooth acceleration, safe merging with adequate spacing, adherence to proven longitudinal local and string stability, and rapid regulation of lateral deviations.</description>

      <title>Beyond 1D and oversimplified kinematics: A generic analytical framework for surrogate safety measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07019v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a generic analytical framework tailored for surrogate safety measures (SSMs) that is versatile across various highway geometries, capable of encompassing vehicle dynamics of differing dimensionality and fidelity, and suitable for dynamic, real-world environments. The framework incorporates a generic vehicle movement model, accommodating a spectrum of scenarios with varying degrees of complexity and dimensionality, facilitating the prediction of future vehicle trajectories. It establishes a generic mathematical criterion to denote potential collisions, characterized by the spatial overlap between a vehicle and any other entity. A collision risk is present if the collision criterion is met at any non-negative time point, with the minimum threshold representing the remaining time to collision. The framework's proficiency spans from conventional one-dimensional (1D) SSMs to extended multi-dimensional, high-fidelity SSMs. Its validity is corroborated through simulation experiments that assess the precision of the framework when linearization is performed on the vehicle movement model. The outcomes showcase remarkable accuracy in predicting vehicle trajectories and the time remaining before potential collisions occur. The necessity of higher-dimensional and higher-fidelity SSMs is highlighted through a comparison of conventional 1D SSMs and extended three-dimensional (3D) SSMs. The results showed that using 1D SSMs over 3D SSMs could be off by 300% for non-critical Time-to-Collision (TTC) values and about 20% for critical TTC values (below 1.5 seconds). Furthermore, the framework's practical application is demonstrated through a case study that actively evaluates all potential conflicts, underscoring its effectiveness in dynamic, real-world traffic situations.</description>

      <title>Full-Envelope Flight Control for Compound Vertical Takeoff and Landing Aircraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a flight control design for compound Vertical Takeoff and Landing (VTOL) vehicles. With their multitude of degrees of controllability as well as the significant variations in their flight characteristics, VTOL vehicles present challenges when it comes to designing their flight control system, especially for the transition phase where the vehicle transitions between near-hovering and high-speed wing-borne flights. This work extends previous research on the design of unified and generic control laws that can be applied to a broad class of vehicles such as hovering vehicles and fixed-wing aircraft. This paper exploits this unifying property and presents an extension for the case of compound VTOL vehicles. The proposed control approach consists of nonlinear geometric control laws that are continuously applicable  over the entire flight envelope, excluding the use of switching policies between different control algorithms. A transition strategy consisting of a sequence of high-level setpoints is associated with the flight control laws, it is defined with respect to flight envelope limitations and is applied in this work to a commercially available compound unmanned aerial vehicle. The control algorithms are implemented on a Pixhawk controller, they are evaluated via Hardware-In-the-Loop simulations and finally validated in a flight experiment.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for the Application of Distributed Control Techniques to the Electricity Network of the European Economic Area</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Economic Area Electricity Network Benchmark (EEA-ENB) is a multi-area power system representing the European network of transmission systems for electricity to facilitate the application of distributed control techniques. In the EEA-ENB we consider the Load Frequency Control (LFC) problem in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs), and energy storage systems (ESSs). RESs are known to cause instability in power networks due to their inertia-less and intermittent characteristics, while ESSs are introduced as a resource to mitigate the problem. In the EEA-ENB, particular attention is dedicated to Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC), whose application is often limited to small and homogeneous test cases due to the lack of standardized large-scale scenarios for testing, and due to the large computation time required to obtain a centralized MPC action for performance comparison with DMPC strategies under consideration. The second problem is exacerbated when the scale of the system grows. To address these challenges and to provide a real-world-based and control-independent benchmark, the EEA-ENB has been developed. The benchmark includes a centralized MPC strategy providing performance and computation time metrics to compare distributed control within a repeatable and realistic simulation environment.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance Safety Filter for an Autonomous E-Scooter using Ultrasonic Sensors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance safety filter for autonomous electric scooters to enable safe operation of such vehicles in pedestrian areas. In particular, we employ multiple low-cost ultrasonic sensors to detect a wide range of possible obstacles in front of the e-scooter. Based on possibly faulty distance measurements, we design a filter to mitigate measurement noise and missing values as well as a gain-scheduled controller to limit the velocity commanded to the e-scooter when required due to imminent collisions. The proposed controller structure is able to prevent collisions with unknown obstacles by deploying a reduced safe velocity ensuring a sufficiently large safety distance. The collision avoidance approach is designed such that it may be easily deployed in similar applications of general micromobility vehicles. The effectiveness of our proposed safety filter is demonstrated in real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Intention-Aware Control Based on Belief-Space Specifications and Stochastic Expansion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09037v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper develops a correct-by-design controller for an autonomous vehicle interacting with opponent vehicles with unknown intentions. We define an intention-aware control problem incorporating epistemic uncertainties of the opponent vehicles and model their intentions as discrete-valued random variables. Then, we focus on a control objective specified as belief-space temporal logic specifications. From this stochastic control problem, we derive a sound deterministic control problem using stochastic expansion and solve it using shrinking-horizon model predictive control. The solved intention-aware controller allows a vehicle to adjust its behaviors according to its opponents' intentions. It ensures provable safety by restricting the probabilistic risk under a desired level. We show with experimental studies that the proposed method ensures strict limitation of risk probabilities, validating its efficacy in autonomous driving cases. This work provides a novel solution for the risk-aware control of interactive vehicles with formal safety guarantees.</description>

      <title>Spatial Mode Multiplexing for Fiber-Coupled IM/DD Optical Wireless Links with Misalignment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optical wireless communication (OWC) emerges as a pivotal solution for achieving terabit-level aggregate throughput in next-generation wireless networks. With the mature high-speed transceivers and advanced (de)multiplexing techniques designed for fiber optics, fiber-coupled OWC can be seamlessly integrated into existing ultra-high-speed networks such as data centres. In particular, OWC leveraging spatial mode multiplexing (SMM) and few-mode fiber (FMF) coupling can significantly increase capacity, though misalignment may reduce performance. This paper presents a thorough investigation into the SMM-enabled FMF coupling OWC systems affected by link misalignment, specifically focusing on systems with intensity modulation with direct detection (IM/DD) receivers. A theoretical analysis is conducted to assess the fiber coupling efficiency of the considered system in the presence of both pointing error and angle of arrival (AOA) fluctuations caused by random device vibrations. Our model elucidates the dependence of coupling efficiency to the order of the incident modes, highlighting the critical role of beam properties in system performance. To mitigate the intermodal crosstalk arising from link misalignment, we employ zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) to enhance the overall aggregated data rate. Through extensive numerical results, we identify optimal system configurations encompassing aperture design and mode selection, leading to a capacity boost exceeding 200%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Control barrier certificates have proven effective in formally guaranteeing the safety of the control systems. However, designing a control barrier certificate is a time-consuming and computationally expensive endeavor that requires expert input in the form of domain knowledge and mathematical maturity. Additionally, when a system undergoes slight changes, the new controller and its correctness certificate need to be recomputed, incurring similar computational challenges as those faced during the design of the original controller. Prior approaches have utilized transfer learning to transfer safety guarantees in the form of a barrier certificate while maintaining the control invariant. Unfortunately, in practical settings, the source and the target environments often deviate substantially in their control inputs, rendering the aforementioned approach impractical. To address this challenge, we propose integrating \emph{inverse dynamics} -- a neural network that suggests required action given a desired successor state -- of the target system with the barrier certificate of the source system to provide formal proof of safety. In addition, we propose a validity condition that, when met, guarantees correctness of the controller. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three case studies.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we deal with a network of agents that want to cooperatively minimize the sum of local cost functions depending on a common decision variable. We consider the challenging scenario in which objective functions are unknown and agents have only access to local measurements of their local functions. We propose a novel distributed algorithm that combines a recent gradient tracking policy with an extremum-seeking technique to estimate the global descent direction. The joint use of these two techniques results in a distributed optimization scheme that provides arbitrarily accurate solution estimates through the combination of Lyapunov and averaging analysis approaches with consensus theory. We perform numerical simulations in a personalized optimization framework to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A Non-Interior-Point Continuation Method for the Optimal Control Problem with Equilibrium Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.10336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we focus on the numerical solution method for the optimal control problem with equilibrium constraints (OCPEC).It is extremely challenging to solve OCPEC owing to the absence of constraint regularity and strictly feasible interior points. To solve OCPEC efficiently, we first relax the discretized OCPEC to recover the constraint regularity and then map its Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) conditions into a perturbed system of equations. Subsequently, we propose a novel two-stage solution method, called the non-interior-point continuation method, to solve the perturbed system. In the first stage, a non-interior-point method, which solves the perturbed system using the Newton method and globalizes convergence using a dedicated merit function, is employed. In the second stage, a predictor-corrector continuation method is utilized to track the solution trajectory as a function of the perturbed parameter, starting at the solution obtained in the first stage. The proposed method regularizes the KKT matrix and does not enforce iterates to remain in the feasible interior, which mitigates the numerical difficulties of solving OCPEC. Convergence properties are analyzed under certain assumptions. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can accurately track the solution trajectory while demanding significantly less computation time compared to the interior-point method.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal Receding Horizon Control with Proactive Interaction Towards Autonomous Driving in Dense Traffic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05929v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense traffic scenarios, ensuring safety while keeping high task performance for autonomous driving is a critical challenge. To address this problem, this paper proposes a computationally-efficient spatiotemporal receding horizon control (ST-RHC) scheme to generate a safe, dynamically feasible, energy-efficient trajectory in control space, where different driving tasks in dense traffic can be achieved with high accuracy and safety in real time. In particular, an embodied spatiotemporal safety barrier module considering proactive interactions is devised to mitigate the effects of inaccuracies resulting from the trajectory prediction of other vehicles. Subsequently, the motion planning and control problem is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem, which favorably facilitates the effective use of off-the-shelf optimization solvers in conjunction with multiple shooting. The effectiveness of the proposed ST-RHC scheme is demonstrated through comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms on synthetic and real-world traffic datasets under dense traffic, and the attendant outcome of superior performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency and safety is achieved.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the use of harmonic analysis to decompose the state space of symmetric robotic systems into orthogonal isotypic subspaces. These are lower-dimensional spaces that capture distinct, symmetric, and synergistic motions. For linear dynamics, we characterize how this decomposition leads to a subdivision of the dynamics into independent linear systems on each subspace, a property we term dynamics harmonic analysis (DHA). To exploit this property, we use Koopman operator theory to propose an equivariant deep-learning architecture that leverages the properties of DHA to learn a global linear model of the system dynamics. Our architecture, validated on synthetic systems and the dynamics of locomotion of a quadrupedal robot, exhibits enhanced generalization, sample efficiency, and interpretability, with fewer trainable parameters and computational costs.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Fatigue-Induced Compensatory Movements in Bicep Curls: Gaining Insights for the Deployment of Wearable Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A common challenge in Bicep Curls rehabilitation is muscle compensation, where patients adopt alternative movement patterns when the primary muscle group cannot act due to injury or fatigue, significantly decreasing the effectiveness of rehabilitation efforts. The problem is exacerbated by the growing trend toward transitioning from in-clinic to home-based rehabilitation, where constant monitoring and correction by physiotherapists are limited. Developing wearable sensors capable of detecting muscle compensation becomes crucial to address this challenge. This study aims to gain insights into the optimal deployment of wearable sensors through a comprehensive study of muscle compensation in Bicep Curls. We collect upper limb joint kinematics and surface electromyography signals (sEMG) from eight muscles in 12 healthy subjects during standard and fatigue stages. Two muscle synergies are derived from sEMG signals and are analyzed comprehensively along with joint kinematics. Our findings reveal a shift in the relative contribution of forearm muscles to shoulder muscles, accompanied by a significant increase in activation amplitude for both synergies. Additionally, more pronounced movement was observed at the shoulder joint during fatigue. These results suggest focusing on the shoulder muscle activities and joint motions when deploying wearable sensors to effectively detect compensatory movements.</description>

      <title>Convergence Conditions of Online Regularized Statistical Learning in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space With Non-Stationary Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of recursive regularized learning algorithms in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with dependent and non-stationary online data streams. Firstly, we study the mean square asymptotic stability of a class of random difference equations in RKHS, whose non-homogeneous terms are martingale difference sequences dependent on the homogeneous ones. Secondly, we introduce the concept of random Tikhonov regularization path, and show that if the regularization path is slowly time-varying in some sense, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the regularization path in mean square. Furthermore, if the data streams also satisfy the RKHS persistence of excitation condition, i.e. there exists a fixed length of time period, such that each eigenvalue of the conditional expectation of the operators induced by the input data accumulated over every time period has a uniformly positive lower bound with respect to time, then the output of the algorithm is consistent with the unknown function in mean square. Finally, for the case with independent and non-identically distributed data streams, the algorithm achieves the mean square consistency provided the marginal probability measures induced by the input data are slowly time-varying and the average measure over each fixed-length time period has a uniformly strictly positive lower bound.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of Energy-Efficient Wireless Tire Sensing System with Delay Analysis for Intelligent Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The growing prevalence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has led to a rise in the popularity of intelligent vehicles that incorporate a range of sensors to monitor various aspects, such as driving speed, fuel usage, distance proximity and tire anomalies. Nowadays, real-time tire sensing systems play important roles for intelligent vehicles in increasing mileage, reducing fuel consumption, improving driving safety, and reducing the potential for traffic accidents. However, the current tire sensing system drains a significant vehicle' energy and lacks effective collection of sensing data, which may not guarantee the immediacy of driving safety. Thus, this paper designs an energy-efficient wireless tire sensing system (WTSS), which leverages energy-saving techniques to significantly reduce power consumption while ensuring data retrieval delays during real-time monitoring. Additionally, we mathematically analyze the worst-case transmission delay of the system to ensure the immediacy based on the collision probabilities of sensor transmissions. This system has been implemented and verified by the simulation and field trial experiments. These results show that the proposed scheme provides enhanced performance in energy efficiency and accurately identifies the worst transmission delay.</description>
