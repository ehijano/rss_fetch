      <title>The Economic Impact of Low- and High-Frequency Temperature Changes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature data have low- and high-frequency variations that may have distinct impacts on economic outcomes. Analyzing data from a panel of 48 states in the U.S., and a panel of 50 countries, we find slowly evolving, low-frequency components with periodicity greater than 32 years. These components have a common factor that trended up around the same time that economic growth slowed. Panel regressions using U.S. data fail to find a statistically significant impact of low-frequency temperature changes on growth, though the impact of high-frequency temperature changes is marginally significant. However, using the international panel (which includes several European countries), we find that a 1{\deg}C increase in the low-frequency component is estimated to reduce economic growth by about one percent in the long run. Though the first-order effect of high frequency changes is not statistically significant in this data, a smaller non-linear effect is detected. Our estimation and inference procedures control for common, business cycle variations in output growth that are not adequately controlled for by an additive fixed effect specification. These findings are corroborated by time series estimation using data at the unit and national levels.</description>

      <title>Ornithologist: Towards Trustworthy "Reasoning" about Central Bank Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I develop Ornithologist, a weakly-supervised textual classification system and measure the hawkishness and dovishness of central bank text. Ornithologist uses ``taxonomy-guided reasoning'', guiding a large language model with human-authored decision trees. This increases the transparency and explainability of the system and makes it accessible to non-experts. It also reduces hallucination risk. Since it requires less supervision than traditional classification systems, it can more easily be applied to other problems or sources of text (e.g. news) without much modification. Ornithologist measurements of hawkishness and dovishness of RBA communication carry information about the future of the cash rate path and of market expectations.</description>

      <title>The Triad of Modern Democracies: Money, Identity, and Information in Shaping Power and Legitimacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the interplay of money, identity, and information as a pivotal triad reshaping electoral politics and legitimacy in modern democracies, with insights from the United States, India, Germany, China, and Russia. Financial resources, through campaign finance and state funds, enable strategies exploiting identity cleavages like race, caste, and nationalism, amplified by digital networks such as social media and targeted messaging. In democracies, this dynamic fosters polarization and erodes trust, while in non democracies, it bolsters regime narratives. Drawing on political economy, social identity theory, and media studies, the study reveals a feedback loop: money shapes identity appeals, information disseminates them, and power consolidates, challenging issue based governance assumptions. Comparative analysis highlights the triad universal yet context specific impact, underscoring the need for reforms to address its effects on democratic theory and practice, as it entrenches elite influence and tribal divisions across diverse political systems.</description>

      <title>The Nexus of Money and Political Legitimacy: A Comparative Analysis of Democracies and Non-Democracies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article examines the complex relationship between money and political legitimacy in democracies (United States, Germany, India) and nondemocracies (China, Russia), using published empirical evidence to explore how financial resources influence governance. In democracies, US campaign finance, German party funding, and Indias electoral bonds amplify elite influence, openly eroding public trust by skewing policy toward wealthy interests. In nondemocracies, Chinas state enterprise patronage and Russias oligarch suppression strengthen legitimacy, yet hide vulnerabilities revealed by anticorruption campaigns and power struggles. The analysis argues that moneys corrosive impact is widespread but varies: democracies face evident legitimacy crises, while nondemocracies conceal underlying fragility. These findings highlight the need for reforms: increased transparency in democracies and wider power bases in nondemocracies, to mitigate moneys distorting effect on political authority.</description>

      <title>Augmenting the availability of historical GDP per capita estimates through machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Can we use data on the biographies of historical figures to estimate the GDP per capita of countries and regions? Here we introduce a machine learning method to estimate the GDP per capita of dozens of countries and hundreds of regions in Europe and North America for the past 700 years starting from data on the places of birth, death, and occupations of hundreds of thousands of historical figures. We build an elastic net regression model to perform feature selection and generate out-of-sample estimates that explain 90% of the variance in known historical income levels. We use this model to generate GDP per capita estimates for countries, regions, and time periods for which this data is not available and externally validate our estimates by comparing them with four proxies of economic output: urbanization rates in the past 500 years, body height in the 18th century, wellbeing in 1850, and church building activity in the 14th and 15th century. Additionally, we show our estimates reproduce the well-known reversal of fortune between southwestern and northwestern Europe between 1300 and 1800 and find this is largely driven by countries and regions engaged in Atlantic trade. These findings validate the use of fine-grained biographical data as a method to produce historical GDP per capita estimates. We publish our estimates with confidence intervals together with all collected source data in a comprehensive dataset.</description>

      <title>Visibility and Influence in Digital Social Relations: Towards a New Symbolic Capital?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the dynamics of visibility and influence in digital social relations, examining their implications for the emergence of a new symbolic capital. Using a mixedmethods design, the research combined semi-structured interviews with 20 digitally active individuals and quantitative social media data analysis to identify key predictors of digital symbolic capital. Findings reveal that visibility is influenced by content quality, network size, and engagement strategies, while influence depends on credibility, authority, and trust. The study identifies a new form of symbolic capital based on online visibility, influence, and reputation, distinct from traditional forms. The research discusses the ethical implications of these dynamics and suggests future research directions, emphasizing the need to update social theories to account for digital transformations.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Impact of Upstream Mergers with Downstream Complements and Substitutes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12575v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine how upstream mergers affect negotiated prices when suppliers bargain with a monopoly intermediary selling products to final consumers. Conventional wisdom holds that such transactions lower negotiated prices when the products are complements for consumers and raise them when they are substitutes. The idea is that consumer demand relationships carry over to upstream negotiations, where mergers between complements weaken the suppliers' bargaining leverage, while mergers between substitutes strengthen it. I challenge this view, showing that it breaks down when the intermediary sells products beyond those of the merging suppliers. In such cases, the merging suppliers' products may act as substitutes for the intermediary even if they are complements for consumers, or as complements for the intermediary even if they are substitutes for consumers. These findings show that upstream conglomerate mergers can raise prices without foreclosure or monopolisation and help explain buyer-specific price effects resulting from such mergers.</description>

      <title>Shifting Work Patterns with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present evidence on how generative AI changes the work patterns of knowledge workers using data from a 6-month-long, cross-industry, randomized field experiment. Half of the 7,137 workers in the study received access to a generative AI tool integrated into the applications they already used for emails, document creation, and meetings. We find that access to the AI tool during the first year of its release primarily impacted behaviors that workers could change independently and not behaviors that require coordination to change: workers who used the tool in more than half of the sample weeks spent 3.6 fewer hours, or 31% less time on email each week (intent to treat estimate is 1.3 hours) and completed documents moderately faster, but did not significantly change time spent in meetings.</description>
