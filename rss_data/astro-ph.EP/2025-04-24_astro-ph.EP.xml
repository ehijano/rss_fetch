      <title>Exploring the Neptunian Desert: Insights from a Homogeneous Planetary Sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a homogeneous analysis of close-in Neptune planets. To do this, we compile a sample of TESS-observed planets using a ranking criterion which takes into account the planet's period, radius, and the visual magnitude of its host star. We use archival and new HARPS data to ensure every target in this sample has precise radial velocities. This yields a total of 64 targets, 46 of which are confirmed planets and 18 of which show no significant radial velocity signal. We explore the mass-radius distribution, planetary density, stellar host metallicity, and stellar and planetary companions of our targets. We find 26$\%$ of our sample are in multi-planet systems, which are typically seen for planets located near the lower edge of the Neptunian desert. We define a 'gold' subset of our sample consisting of 33 confirmed planets with planetary radii between 2$R_{\oplus}$ and 10$R_{\oplus}$. With these targets, we calculate envelope mass fractions (EMF) using the GAS gianT modeL for Interiors (GASTLI). We find a clear split in EMF between planets with equilibrium temperatures below and above 1300~K, equivalent to an orbital period of $\sim$3.5~days. Below this period, EMFs are consistent with zero, while above they typically range from 20$\%$ to 40$\%$, scaling linearly with the planetary mass. The orbital period separating these two populations coincides with the transition between the Neptunian desert and the recently identified Neptunian ridge, further suggesting that different formation and/or evolution mechanisms are at play for Neptune planets across different close-in orbital regions.</description>

      <title>Colors and Dynamics of a Near-Sun Orbital Asteroid Family: 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observed the dynamically similar near-Sun asteroids 2021 PH27 and 2025 GN1 for their optical colors. These objects have the lowest known semi-major axes of any asteroids. 2021 PH27 has the largest general relativistic effects of any known solar system object. The small semi-major axis and very close passage to the Sun suggests the extreme thermal and gravitational environment should highly modify these asteroids' surfaces. From g', r', i' and z'-band imaging, we find the colors of 2021 PH27 to be between the two major asteroid types the S and C classes (g'-r'= 0.58 +- 0.02, r'-i'=0.12 +- 0.02 and i'-z'=-0.08 +- 0.05 mags). With a spectral slope of 6.8 +-0.03 percent per 100nm, 2021 PH27 is a X-type asteroid and requires albedo or spectral features to further identify its composition. We find the dynamically similar 2025 GN1 also has very similar colors (g'-r'=0.55 +-0.06 and r'-i'=0.14 +-0.04) as 2021 PH27, suggesting these objects are fragments from a once larger parent asteroid or 2021 PH27 is shedding material. The colors are not blue like some other near-Sun asteroids such as 3200 Phaethon that have been interpreted to be from the loss of reddening substances from the extreme temperatures. There is no evidence of activity or a large amplitude period for 2021 PH27, whereas 2025 GN1 might have a more significant rotational light curve. 2025 GN1 may have a very close encounter or hit Venus in about 2155 years and likely separated from 2021 PH27 in about the last 10 kyrs.</description>

      <title>Uncertainties in the Inference of Internal Structure: The Case of TRAPPIST-1 f</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the TRAPPIST-1 system as a model observation of Earth-like planets. The densities of these planets being 1-10% less than the Earth suggest that the outer planets may host significant hydrospheres. We explore the uncertainty in water mass fraction from observed mass and radius. We investigate the interior structure of TRAPPIST-1 f using the open-source solver MAGRATHEA and varying assumptions in the interior model. We find that TRAPPIST-1 f likely has a water mass fraction of 16.2% $\pm$ 9.9% when considering all possible core mass fractions and requires 6.9% $\pm$ 2.0% water at an Earth-like mantle to core ratio. We quantify uncertainties from observational precision, model assumptions, and experimental and theoretical data on the bulk modulus of planet building materials. We show that observational uncertainties are smaller than model assumptions of mantle mineralogy and core composition but larger than hydrosphere, temperature, and equation of state assumptions/uncertainties. Our findings show that while precise mass and radius measurements are crucial, uncertainties in planetary models can often outweigh those from observations, emphasizing the importance of refining both theoretical models and experimental data to better understand exoplanet interiors.</description>

      <title>A model of the heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A heliocentric dust ring on Venus orbit was discovered following observations by the Helios spacecraft, and then confirmed thanks to observations by STEREO and the Parker Solar Probe. The impact risk it poses needs to be evaluated for any spacecraft crossing the ring. This study aims to provide a first model of the dust ring, in terms of distribution of particles (including size distribution), velocity, density of the ring, and deduce a first estimation of the impact risk to spacecrafts crossing the ring. We seek to describe the orbits of dust particles in the ring. We explore a first simple model, that leads us to propose a second, more elaborate, model. This model is then populated by particles that we integrate for 2000 years. We demonstrate that the dust ring will persist over the next 2000 years, only slightly extending radially and perpendicularly to the Venus orbital plane. We show that particles tend to accumulate at Venus orbit, but that along it the differences in density is negligible. We compute the number of particles we can expect to find in the ring. Finally, as an example, we apply this model to Bepi-Colombo to obtain a first estimate of the impact flux in function of radius and mass, for radii between 2 $\mu$m and 2 cm (i.e. for masses between 10^-2 kg and 10^-14 kg). We also present the impact velocity and direction of impacts with respect to Bepi-Colombo. We are able to conclude that the ring seems to present a low risk for spacecrafts using Venus as a gravity assist.</description>

      <title>MHD Simulations Preliminarily Predict The Habitability and Radio Emission of TRAPPIST-1e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the closest Earth-like exoplanet within the habitable zone of the M-dwarf star TRAPPIST-1, TRAPPIST-1e exhibits a magnetic field topology that is dependent on space weather conditions. Variations in these conditions influence its habitability and contribute to its radio emissions. Our objective is to analyze the response of different terrestrial magnetosphere structures of TRAPPIST-1e to various space weather conditions, including events analogous to coronal mass ejections (CMEs). We assess its habitability by computing the magnetopause standoff distance and predict the resulting radio emissions using scaling laws. This study provides some priors for future radio observations. We perform three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the TRAPPIST-1e system using the PLUTO code in spherical coordinates. Our analysis indicates that the predicted habitability and radio emission of TRAPPIST-1e strongly depend on the planet's magnetic field intensity and magnetic axis inclination. Within sub-Alfvenic, super-Alfvenic, and transitional stellar wind regimes, the radio emission intensity positively correlates with both planetary magnetic field strength and axial tilt, while planetary habitability, quantified by the magnetopause standoff distance, shows a positive correlation with magnetic field strength and a negative correlation with magnetic axis tilt...</description>

      <title>Thermal Evolution and Mass Loss on Short-Period, Low-Mass Planets During FU Orionis Outbursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-short-period (USP) planets represent a unique class of exoplanets characterized by their tight orbits and relatively low masses, with some also exhibiting unusually high iron fractions. Previous work (Becker et al, 2021) proposed a dynamical pathway wherein planets can migrate inward due to drag from sub-Keplerian gas during episodic FU Orionis (FU Ori) outbursts, an abrupt accretion phenomenon exhibited by young stellar objects, thereby potentially populating USP orbits. However, the implications of this migration process on the structural and compositional evolution of these planets remain unexplored. In this work, we model the response of a planet's surface material to the high disk temperatures characteristic of an FU Ori event and compute the fraction of an Earth-like planet's mass that will be lost due to vaporization and subsequent turbulent diffusion of gaseous molecules during the FU Ori event. We find that low-mass planets may lose a substantial fraction of their mantle mass during FU Ori events, potentially contributing to the observed prevalence of low-mass, iron-rich USP planets.</description>

      <title>Constructing Four-Body Ballistic Lunar Transfers via Analytical Energy Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper derives and summarizes the analytical conditions for lunar ballistic capture and constructs ballistic lunar transfers based on these conditions. We adopt the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular restricted four-body problem as the dynamical model to construct lunar transfers. First, the analytical conditions for ballistic capture are derived based on the relationship between the Keplerian energy with respect to the Moon and the angular momentum with respect to the Moon, summarized in form of exact ranges of the Jacobi energy at the lunar insertion point. Both sufficient and necessary condition and necessary condition are developed. Then, an optimization method combined with the analytical energy conditions is proposed to construct ballistic lunar transfers. Simulations shows that a high ballistic capture ratio is achieved by our proposed method (100$\%$ for direct insertion and $99.15\%$ for retrograde insertion). Examining the obtained ballistic lunar transfers, the effectiveness of the analytical energy conditions is verified. Samples of our obtained lunar transfers achieves a lower impulse and shorter time of flight compared to two conventional methods, further strengthening the advantage of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08 has nothing to do with Planet 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been suggested that a gravitational slingshot from the hypothetical Planet 9 (P9) could explain the unusually large velocity of meteor CNEOS 2014-01-08. I show that this explanation does not work because P9 can at most provide an insignificant 0.25 km/s of the object's 42 km/s asymptotic heliocentric velocity and at most a 7.6 degree deflection due to P9's low orbital speed and non-zero radius. Furthermore, the hypothesis requires an encounter with two planets that is trillions of times more unlikely than CNEOS 2014-01-08 simply being fast from the beginning.</description>

      <title>Year six photometric measurements of known Trans-Neptunian Objects and Centaurs by the Dark Energy Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identified known Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs) and Centaurs in the complete Dark Energy Survey (DES) year six catalog (DES Y6) through the Sky Body Tracker (SkyBoT) tool. We classified our dataset of 144 objects into a widely used 4-class taxonomic system of TNOs. No such previous classification was available in the literature for most of these objects. From absolute magnitudes and average albedos, an estimation of the diameters of all these objects is obtained. Correlations involving colours, orbital parameters, dynamical classes and sizes are also discussed. In particular, our largest reddest object has a diameter of $390^{+68}_{-53}$ km and our largest cold classical, $255^{+19}_{-17}$ km. Also, a weak correlation between colour and inclination is found within the population of resonant TNOs in addition to weak correlations between colour and phase slope in different bands.</description>

      <title>Gas-phase formation routes of dimethyl sulfide in the interstellar medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Dimethyl sulfide (DMS; CH$_3$SCH$_3$) is an organosulfur compound that has been suggested as a potential biosignature in exoplanetary atmospheres. In addition to its tentative detections toward the sub-Neptune planet K2-18b, DMS has been detected in the coma of the 67/P comet and toward the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. However, its formation routes have not been characterized yet.
  Aims: In this work, we have investigated three gas-phase reactions (CH$_3$SH + CH$_3$OH$_2^+$, CH$_3$OH + CH$_3$SH$_2^+$, and the CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association), aiming at characterizing DMS formation routes in shocked molecular clouds and star-forming regions.
  Methods: We have performed dedicated quantum and kinetics calculations to evaluate the reaction rate coefficients as a function of temperature to be included in astrochemical models.
  Results: Among the investigated processes, the reaction between methanethiol (CH$_3$SH) and protonated methanol (CH$_3$OH$_2^+$)(possibly followed by a gentle proton transfer to ammonia) is a compelling candidate to explain the formation of DMS in the galactic center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The CH$_3$ + CH$_3$S radiative association does not seem to be a very efficient process, with the exclusion of cold clouds, provided that the thiomethoxy radical (CH$_3$S) is available.
  This work does not deal directly with the possible formation of DMS in the atmosphere of exoplanets. However, it clearly indicates that there are efficient abiotic formation routes of this interesting species.</description>

      <title>The Spin Zone: Synchronously and Asynchronously Rotating Exoplanets Have Spectral Differences in Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10752v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New observational facilities are beginning to enable insights into the three-dimensional (3D) nature of exoplanets. Transmission spectroscopy is the most widely used method for characterizing transiting temperate exoplanet's atmospheres, but because it only provides a glimpse of the planet's limb and nightside for a typical orbit, its ability to probe 3D characteristics is still an active area of research. Here, we use the ROCKE-3D general circulation model to test the impact of synchronization state, a ``low-order'' 3D characteristic previously shown to drive differences in planetary phase curves, on the transmission spectrum of a representative super-Earth land planet across temperate-to-warm instellations (S$_p$=0.8, 1, 1.25, 1.66, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 4.56~S$_\oplus$). We find that different synchronization states do display differences in their transmission spectra, primarily driven by clouds and humidity, and that the differences shrink or disappear in hotter regimes where water clouds are unable to condense (though our simulations do not consider haze formation). The small size of the feature differences and potential for degeneracy with other properties, like differing water content or atmospheric structure, mean that we do not specifically claim to have identified a single transmission diagnostic for synchronization state, but our results can be used for holistic spectrum interpretation and sample creation, and suggest the need for more modelling in this area.</description>
