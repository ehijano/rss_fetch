      <title>On an upper bound for central binomial coefficients and Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Agievich proposed an interesting upper bound on binomial coefficients in the de Moivre-Laplace form. In this article, we show that the latter bound, in the specific case of a central binomial coefficient, is larger than the one proposed by Sasvari and obtained using the Binet formula for the Gamma function. In addition, we provide the expression of the next-order bound and apply it to Catalan numbers $C_n$. The bounds are very close to the exact value, the difference decreasing with $n$ and with the order of the upper bound.</description>

      <title>Smooth Points on Positroid Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Grassmannian $Gr_{\mathbb{C}}(k,n)$ we have positroid varieties $\Pi_f$, each indexed by a bounded affine permutation $f$ and containing torus-fixed points $\lambda \in \Pi_f$. In this paper we consider the partially ordered set consisting of quadruples $(k,n,\Pi_f,\lambda)$ (or \textit{(positroid) pairs} $(\Pi_f,\lambda)$ for short). The partial order is the ordering given by the covering relation $\lessdot$ where $(\Pi_f',\lambda') \lessdot (\Pi_f,\lambda)$ if $\Pi_f'$ is obtained by $\Pi_f$ by \textit{deletion} or \textit{contraction.} Using the results of Snider [2010], we know that positroid varieties can be studied in a neighborhood of each of these points by \textit{affine pipe dreams.} Our main theorem provides a quick test of when a positroid variety is smooth at one of these given points. It is sufficient to test smoothness of a positroid variety by using the main result to test smoothness at each of these points. These results can also be applied to the question of whether Schubert varieties in flag manifolds are smooth at points given by 321-avoiding permutations, as studied in Graham/Kreimer [2020]. We have a secondary result, which describes the minimal singular positroid pairs in our ordering - these are the positroid pairs where any deletion or contraction causes it to become smooth.</description>

      <title>On the Uncrossed Number of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizing a graph $G$ in the plane nicely, for example, without crossings, is unfortunately not always possible. To address this problem, Masa\v{r}\'ik and Hlin\v{e}n\'y [GD 2023] recently asked for each edge of $G$ to be drawn without crossings while allowing multiple different drawings of $G$. More formally, a collection $\mathcal{D}$ of drawings of $G$ is uncrossed if, for each edge $e$ of $G$, there is a drawing in $\mathcal{D}$ such that $e$ is uncrossed. The uncrossed number $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ of $G$ is then the minimum number of drawings in some uncrossed collection of $G$.
  No exact values of the uncrossed numbers have been determined yet, not even for simple graph classes. In this paper, we provide the exact values for uncrossed numbers of complete and complete bipartite graphs, partly confirming and partly refuting a conjecture posed by Hlin\v{e}n\'y and Masa\v{r}\'ik. We also present a strong general lower bound on $\mathrm{unc}(G)$ in terms of the number of vertices and edges of $G$. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness of the related problem of determining the edge crossing number of a graph $G$, which is the smallest number of edges of $G$ taken over all drawings of $G$ that participate in a crossing. This problem was posed as open by Schaefer in his book [Crossing Numbers of Graphs 2018].</description>

      <title>Polyhedral geometry of refined $q,t$-Catalan numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a refinement of the $q,t$-Catalan numbers introduced by Xin and Zhang (2022, 2023) using tools from polyhedral geometry. These refined $q,t$-Catalan numbers depend on a vector of parameters $\vec{k}$ and the classical $q,t$-Catalan numbers are recovered when $\vec{k} = (1,\ldots,1)$. We interpret Xin and Zhang's generating functions by developing polyhedral cones arising from constraints on $\vec{k}$-Dyck paths and their associated area and bounce statistics. Through this polyhedral approach, we recover Xin and Zhang's theorem on $q,t$-symmetry of the refined $q,t$-Catalan numbers in the cases where $\vec{k} = (k_1,k_2,k_3)$ and $(k,k,k,k)$, give some extensions, including the case $\vec{k} = (k,k+m,k+m,k+m)$, and discuss relationships to other generalizations of the $q,t$-Catalan numbers.</description>

      <title>The Wide Band Cayley Continuants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cayley continuants are referred to the determinants of tridiagonal matrices in connection with the Sylvester continuants. Munarini-Torri found a striking combinatorial interpretation of the Cayley continuants in terms of the joint distribution of the number of odd cycles and the number of even cycles of permutations of $[n]=\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$. In view of a general setting, $r$-regular cycles (with length not divisible by $r$) and $r$-singular cycles (with length divisible by $r$) have been extensively studied largely related to roots of permutations. We introduce the wide band Cayley continuants as an extension of the original Cayley continuants, and we show that they can be interpreted in terms of the joint distribution of the number of $r$-regular cycles and the number of $r$-singular cycles over permutations of $[n]$.</description>

      <title>Clustered Colouring of Graph Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A colouring of a graph $G$ has clustering $k$ if the maximum number of vertices in a monochromatic component equals $k$. Motivated by recent results showing that many natural graph classes are subgraphs of the strong product of a graph with bounded treewidth and a path, this paper studies clustered colouring of strong products of two bounded treewidth graphs, where none, one, or both graphs have bounded degree. For example, in the case of two colours, if $n$ is the number of vertices in the product, then we show that clustering $\Theta(n^{2/3})$ is best possible, even if one of the graphs is a path. However, if both graphs have bounded degree, then clustering $\Theta(n^{1/2})$ is best possible. With three colours, if one of the graphs has bounded degree, then we show that clustering $\Theta(n^{3/7})$ is best possible. However, if neither graph has bounded degree, then clustering $\Omega(n^{1/2})$ is necessary. More general bounds for any given number of colours are also presented.</description>

      <title>Introduction to double coalitions in graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G(V, E)$ be a finite, simple, isolate-free graph. A set $D$ of vertices of a graph $G$ with the vertex set $V$ is a double dominating set of $G$, if every vertex $v\in D$ has at least one neighbor in $D$ and every vertex $v \in V \setminus D$ has at least two neighbors in $D$. A double coalition consists of two disjoint sets of vertices $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, neither of which is a double dominating set but their union $V_{1}\cup V_{2}$ is a double dominating set. A double coalition partition of a graph $G$ is a partition $\Pi = \{V_1, V_2,..., V_k \}$ of $V$ such that no subset of $\Pi$ is a double dominating set of $G$, but for every set $V_i \in \Pi$, there exists a set $V_j \in \Pi$ such that $V_i$ and $V_j$ form a double coalition. In this paper, we study properties of double coalitions in graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the pure $\kappa-$sparse gapsets and our focus on getting information about the sequence observed in Table 3 at [1], this sequence is listed in OEIS as A374773. We verify that the cardinality of the set of gapsets with genus $3n+1$ such that the maximum distance between two consecutive elements is $2n$ is equal to the cardinality of the set of gapsets with genus $3n+2$ such that the maximum distance between two consecutive elements is $2n+1$, for all $n\in \mathbb{N}$. In particular, we compute the cardinality of the symmetric and pseudo-symmetric gapsets in these cases.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Topological graph drawing (part I)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern methods of graph theory describe a graph up to isomorphism, which makes it difficult to create mathematical models for visualizing graph drawings on a plane. The topological drawing of the planar part of a graph allows representing the planarization process by algebraic methods, without making any geometric constructions on the plane. Constructing a rotation of graph vertices solves two most important problems of graph theory simultaneously: the problem of testing a graph for planarity and the problem of constructing a topological drawing of a planar graph. It is shown that the problem of constructing a drawing of a non-planar graph can be reduced to the problem of constructing a drawing of a planar graph, taking into account the introduction of additional vertices characterizing the intersection of edges. Naturally, the development of such a mathematical structure will make it possible to solve the following important problems of graph theory: testing the planarity of a graph, identifying the largest planar subgraph of a graph, determining the thickness of a graph, obtaining a graph with a minimum number of intersections, etc.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic methods of finite discrete structures. Topological graph drawing (part II)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A visualized graph is a powerful tool for data analysis and synthesis tasks. In this case, the task of visualization constitutes not only in displaying vertices and edges according to the graph representation, but also in ensuring that the result is visually simple and comprehensible for a human. Thus, the visualization process involves solving several problems, one of which is the problem of constructing a topological drawing of a planar part of a non-planar graph with a minimum number of removed edges. In this manuscript, we consider a mathematical model for representing the topological drawing of a graph, which is based on methods of the theory of vertex rotation with the induction of simple cycles that satisfy the Mac Lane planarity criterion. It is shown that the topological drawing of a non-planar graph can be constructed on the basis of a selected planar part of the graph. The topological model of a graph drawing allows us to reduce the brute-force enumeration problem of identifying a plane graph to a discrete optimization problem - searching for a subset of the set of isometric cycles of the graph that satisfy the zero value of the Mac Lane's functional. To isolate the planar part of the graph, a new computational method has been developed based on linear algebra and the algebra of structural numbers. The proposed method has polynomial computational complexity.</description>

Abstract: We prove that $K_n+I$, the complete graph of an even order with a $1$-factor duplicated, admits a decomposition into $2$-factors, each a disjoint union of cycles of length $m \geq 5$ if and only if $m \mid n$, except possibly when $m$ is odd and $n=4m$. In addition, we show that $K_n+I$ admits a decomposition into $2$-factors, each a disjoint union of cycles of lengths $m_1, \ldots, m_t$, whenever $m_1, \ldots, m_t$ are all even.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A permutation is called mod-k-alternating if its entries are restricted to having the same remainder as the index, modulo some integer $k \geq 1.$ In this paper, we find the sign-balance for mod-k-alternating permutations with respect to the statistic excedance. Moreover, we study the sign-balance for excedances over mod-k-alternating derangements. The results are obtained by constructing suitable matrices and connecting their determinants with the signed excedance enumeration of mod-k-alternating permutations. As an application of the signed excedance enumeration, we prove that when $n \equiv k \pmod {2k}$, the excedance enumerating polynomials over the even and odd mod-k-alternating permutations, starting with a fixed remainder, are gamma-positive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17836v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a general setup for studying incidence-preserving motions of projective geometric configurations of points and lines via a "projective rigidity matrix". The spaces of infinitesimal motions of a point-line configuration and dependencies amongst the point-line incidences can be interpreted as the kernel and co-kernel of this projective rigidity matrix, respectively. We also introduce a symmetry-adapted projective rigidity matrix for analysing symmetric configurations and their symmetry-preserving motions. The symmetry may be a point group or a more general symmetry, such as an autopolarity.</description>

Abstract: We enhance the pointed quandle counting invariant of linkoids through the use of quivers analogously to quandle coloring quivers. This allows us to generalize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids. Additionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree quiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers of linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.</description>

      <title>Grothendieck Shenanigans: Permutons from pipe dreams via integrable probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study random permutations arising from reduced pipe dreams. Our main model is motivated by Grothendieck polynomials with parameter $\beta=1$ arising in K-theory of the flag variety. The probability weight of a permutation is proportional to the principal specialization (setting all variables to 1) of the corresponding Grothendieck polynomial. By mapping this random permutation to a version of TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), we describe the limiting permuton and fluctuations around it as the order $n$ of the permutation grows to infinity. The fluctuations are of order $n^{\frac13}$ and have the Tracy-Widom GUE distribution, which places this algebraic (K-theoretic) model into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.
  We also investigate non-reduced pipe dreams and make progress on a recent open problem on the asymptotic number of inversions of the resulting permutation. Inspired by Stanley's question for the maximal value of principal specializations of Schubert polynomials, we resolve the analogous question for $\beta=1$ Grothendieck polynomials, and provide bounds for general $\beta$.</description>

      <title>Mizuno's rank three Nahm sums II: identities of index $(1,2,2)$ and modular forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mizuno provided 15 examples of generalized rank three Nahm sums with symmetrizer $\mathrm{diag}(1,2,2)$ which are conjecturally modular. Using the theory of Bailey pairs and some $q$-series techniques, we establish a number of triple sum Rogers--Ramanujan type identities. These identities confirm the modularity of all of Mizuno's examples except for two non-modular cases. We show that the two exceptional cases of Nahm sums are sums of modular forms of weights $0$ and $1$. We also prove Mizuno's conjectural modular transformation formulas for two vector-valued functions consisting of Nahm sums with symmetrizers $\mathrm{diag}(1,1,2)$ and $\mathrm{diag}(1,2,2)$.</description>

      <title>Firefighting with a Distance-Based Restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.01908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the classic version of the game of firefighter, on the first turn a fire breaks out on a vertex in a graph $G$ and then $k$ firefighters protect $k$ vertices. On each subsequent turn, the fire spreads to the collective unburnt neighbourhood of all the burning vertices and the firefighters again protect $k$ vertices. Once a vertex has been burnt or protected it remains that way for the rest of the game. A common objective with respect to some infinite graph $G$ is to determine how many firefighters are necessary to stop the fire from spreading after a finite number of turns, commonly referred to as containing the fire. We introduce the concept of distance-restricted firefighting where the firefighters' movement is restricted so they can only move up to some fixed distance $d$ per turn rather than being able to move without restriction. We establish some general properties of this new game in contrast to properties of the original game, and we investigate specific cases of the distance-restricted game on the infinite square, strong, and hexagonal grids. We conjecture that two firefighters are insufficient on the square grid when $d = 2$, and we pose some questions about how many firefighters are required in general when $d = 1$.</description>

      <title>Flips in colorful triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The associahedron is the graph $\mathcal{G}_N$ that has as nodes all triangulations of a convex $N$-gon, and an edge between any two triangulations that differ in a flip operation. A flip removes an edge shared by two triangles and replaces it by the other diagonal of the resulting 4-gon. In this paper, we consider a large collection of induced subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}_N$ obtained by Ramsey-type colorability properties. Specifically, coloring the points of the $N$-gon red and blue alternatingly, we consider only colorful triangulations, namely triangulations in which every triangle has points in both colors, i.e., monochromatic triangles are forbidden. The resulting induced subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations is denoted by $\mathcal{F}_N$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}_N$ has a Hamilton cycle for all $N\geq 8$, resolving a problem raised by Sagan, i.e., all colorful triangulations on $N$ points can be listed so that any two cyclically consecutive triangulations differ in a flip. In fact, we prove that for an arbitrary fixed coloring pattern of the $N$ points with at least 10 changes of color, the resulting subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations (for that coloring pattern) admits a Hamilton cycle. We also provide an efficient algorithm for computing a Hamilton path in $\mathcal{F}_N$ that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on average per generated node. This algorithm is based on a new and algorithmic construction of a tree rotation Gray code for listing all $n$-vertex $k$-ary trees that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(k)$ on average per generated tree.</description>

      <title>Computing the degreewidth of a digraph is hard</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a digraph, an ordering of its vertices defines a backedge graph, namely the undirected graph whose edges correspond to the arcs pointing backwards with respect to the order. The degreewidth of a digraph is the minimum over all ordering of the maximum degree of the backedge graph. We answer an open question by Keeney and Lokshtanov [WG 2024], proving that it is \NP-hard to determine whether an oriented graph has degreewidth at most $1$, which settles the last open case for oriented graphs. We complement this result with a general discussion on parameters defined using backedge graphs and their relations to classical parameters.</description>

      <title>The representation ring of $\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ and stable modular plethysms of its natural module in characteristic $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.08943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.08943v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $k$ be a field of characteristic $p$. We provide a practical algebraic description of the representation ring of $k\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$ modulo projectives. We then investigate a family of modular plethysms of the natural $k\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$-module $E$ of the form $\nabla^{\nu}\mathrm{Sym}^l E$ for a partition $\nu$ of size less than $p$ and $0\leq l\leq p-2$. Within this family we classify both the modular plethysms of $E$ which are projective and the modular plethysms of $E$ which have only one non-projective indecomposable summand which is moreover irreducible. We generalise these results to similar classifications where modular plethysms of $E$ are replaced by $k\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$-modules of the form $\nabla^{\nu} V$, where $V$ is a non-projective indecomposable $k\mathrm{SL}_2(\mathbb{F}_p)$-module and $|\nu|&lt;p$.</description>

      <title>Dyck Words, Pattern Avoidance, and Automatic Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.06145v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study various aspects of Dyck words appearing in binary sequences, where $0$ is treated as a left parenthesis and $1$ as a right parenthesis. We show that binary words that are $7/3$-power-free have bounded nesting level, but this no longer holds for larger repetition exponents. We give an explicit characterization of the factors of the Thue-Morse word that are Dyck, and show how to count them. We also prove tight upper and lower bounds on $f(n)$, the number of Dyck factors of Thue-Morse of length $2n$.</description>

      <title>The Subspace Flatness Conjecture and Faster Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.14605v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a seminal paper, Kannan and Lov\'asz (1988) considered a quantity $\mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ which denotes the best volume-based lower bound on the covering radius $\mu(\Lambda,K)$ of a convex body $K$ with respect to a lattice $\Lambda$. Kannan and Lov\'asz proved that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq n \cdot \mu_{KL}(\Lambda,K)$ and the Subspace Flatness Conjecture by Dadush (2012) claims a $O(\log(2n))$ factor suffices, which would match the lower bound from the work of Kannan and Lov\'asz.
  We settle this conjecture up to a constant in the exponent by proving that $\mu(\Lambda,K) \leq O(\log^{3}(2n)) \cdot \mu_{KL} (\Lambda,K)$. Our proof is based on the Reverse Minkowski Theorem due to Regev and Stephens-Davidowitz (2017). Following the work of Dadush (2012, 2019), we obtain a $(\log(2n))^{O(n)}$-time randomized algorithm to solve integer programs in $n$ variables. Another implication of our main result is a near-optimal flatness constant of $O(n \log^{3}(2n))$.</description>

      <title>An Algebraic Approach to the Longest Path Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11469v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Longest Path Problem is a question of finding the maximum length between pairs of vertices of a graph. In the general case, the problem is NP-complete. However, there is a small collection of graph classes for which there exists an efficient solution. Current approaches involve either approximation or computational enumeration. For Tree-like classes of graphs, there are approximation and enumeration algorithms which solves the problem efficiently. Despite this, we propose a new method of approaching the longest path problem with exact algebraic solutions that give rise to polynomial-time algorithms. Our method provides algorithms that are proven correct by their underlying algebraic operations unlike existing purely algorithmic solutions to this problem. We introduce a `booleanize' mapping on the adjacency matrix of a graph which we prove identifies the solution for trees, uniform block graphs, block graphs, and directed acyclic graphs with exact conditions and associated polynomial-time algorithms. In addition, we display additional algorithms that can generate every possible longest path of acyclic graphs in efficient time, as well as for block graphs.</description>

      <title>Fixers and derangements of finite permutation groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G\leqslant\mathrm{Sym}(\Omega)$ be a finite transitive permutation group with point stabiliser $H$. We say that a subgroup $K$ of $G$ is a fixer if every element of $K$ has fixed points, and we say that $K$ is large if $|K| \geqslant |H|$. There is a special interest in studying large fixers due to connections with Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado type problems. In this paper, we classify up to conjugacy the large fixers of the almost simple primitive groups with socle $\mathrm{PSL}_2(q)$, and we use this result to verify a special case of a conjecture of Spiga on permutation characters. We also present some results on large fixers of almost simple primitive groups with socle an alternating or sporadic group.</description>
