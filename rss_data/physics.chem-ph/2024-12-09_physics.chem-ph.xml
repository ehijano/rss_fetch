      <title>Polariton-induced Purcell effects via a reduced semiclassical electrodynamics approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have demonstrated that polariton formation provides a novel strategy for modifying local molecular processes when a large ensemble of molecules is confined within an optical cavity. Herein, a numerical strategy based on coupled Maxwell--Schr\"odinger equations is examined for simulating local molecular processes in a realistic cavity structure under collective strong coupling. In this approach, only a few molecules, referred to as quantum impurities, are treated quantum mechanically, while the remaining macroscopic molecular layer and the cavity structure are modeled using dielectric functions. When a single electronic two-level system embedded in a Lorentz medium is confined in a two-dimensional Bragg resonator, our numerical simulations reveal a polariton-induced Purcell effect: the radiative decay rate of the quantum impurity is significantly enhanced by the cavity when the impurity frequency matches the polariton frequency, while the rate can sometimes be greatly suppressed when the impurity is near resonance with the bulk molecules forming strong coupling. Additionally, this approach demonstrates that the cavity absorption of light exhibits Rabi-splitting-dependent suppression due to the inclusion of a realistic cavity structure. Our simulations also identify a fundamental limitation of this approach -- an inaccurate description of polariton dephasing rates into dark modes. This arises because the dark-mode degrees of freedom are not explicitly included when most molecules are modeled using dielectric functions. As the polariton-induced Purcell effect alters molecular radiative decay differently from the Purcell effect under weak coupling, this polariton-induced effect may facilitate understanding the origin of polariton-modified photochemistry under electronic strong coupling.</description>

      <title>A coupled-trajectory approach for decoherence, frustrated hops and internal consistency in surface hopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach to coupling trajectories in surface hopping is presented. The coupled trajectory surface hopping algorithm based on the exact factorization of the molecular wavefunction is modified to allow energy sharing between the trajectories to avoid frustrated hops coupled with a deterministic hopping algorithm that gives more importance to the quantum populations. Promising results on a high dimensional model system suggest that this robust algorithm overcomes the common problems of overcoherence, frustrated hops and internal consistency in surface hopping.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Activity Coefficients by Similarity-Based Imputation using Quantum-Chemical Descriptors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a novel approach for predicting thermodynamic properties of binary mixtures, which we call the similarity-based method (SBM). The method is based on quantifying the pairwise similarity of components, which we achieve by comparing quantum-chemical descriptors of the components, namely $\sigma$-profiles. The basic idea behind the approach is that mixtures with similar pairs of components will have similar thermodynamic properties. The SBM is trained on a matrix that contains some data for a given property for different binary mixtures; the missing entries are then predicted by the SBM. As an example, we consider the prediction of isothermal activity coefficients at infinite dilution ($\gamma^\infty_{ij}$) and show that the SBM outperforms the well-established physical methods modified UNIFAC (Dortmund) and COSMO-SAC-dsp. In this case, the matrix is only sparsely occupied, and it is shown that the SBM works also if only a limited number of data for similar mixtures is available. The SBM idea can be transferred to any mixture property and is a powerful tool for generating essential data for many applications.</description>

      <title>Approximations of the Iterative Stockholder Analysis scheme using exponential basis functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce several approximations of the Iterative Stockholder Analysis (ISA) method based on exponential basis functions. These approximations are categorized into linear and non-linear models, referred to as LISA and NLIS, respectively. By particular choices of hyperparameters in the NLIS model, both LISA and the Minimal-Basis Iterative Stockholder (MBIS) method can be reproduced. Four LISA variants are constructed using systematically generated exponential basis functions derived from the NLIS model applied to atomic systems. The performance of these LISA variants and NLIS models is benchmarked on 15 small molecules, including neutral, anionic, and cationic species. To facilitate comparison, we propose several metrics designed to highlight differences between the methods. Our results demonstrate that LISA, employing Gaussian basis functions derived from the NLIS model on isolated atomic systems, achieves an optimal balance of computational accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, particularly in minimizing the objective function.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning Electron Dynamics with Moment Propagation Theory: Application to Optical Absorption Spectrum Computation using Real-Time TDDFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an application of our new theoretical formulation of quantum dynamics, moment propagation theory (MPT) (Boyer et al., J. Chem. Phys. 160, 064113 (2024)), for employing machine-learning techniques to simulate the quantum dynamics of electrons. In particular, we use real-time time-dependent density functional theory (RT-TDDFT) simulation in the gauge of the maximally localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) for training the MPT equation of motion. Spatially-localized time-dependent MLWFs provide a concise representation that is particularly convenient for the MPT expressed in terms of increasing orders of moments. The equation of motion for these moments can be integrated in time while the analytical expressions are quite involved. In this work, machine-learning techniques were used to train the the second-order time derivatives of the moments using first-principles data from the RT-TDDFT simulation, and this MPT enabled us to perform electron dynamics efficiently. The application to computing optical absorption spectrum for various systems was demonstrated as a proof-of-principles example of this approach. In addition to isolated molecules (water, benzene, and ethene), condensed matter systems (liquid water and crystalline silicon) were studied, and we also explored how the principle of the nearsightedness of electrons can be employed in this context.</description>

      <title>Cost optimized ab initio tensor network state methods: industrial perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce efficient solutions to optimize the cost of tree-like tensor network state method calculations when an expensive GPU-accelerated hardware is utilized. By supporting a main powerful compute node with additional auxiliary, but much cheaper nodes to store intermediate, precontracted tensor network scratch data, the IO time can be hidden behind the computation almost entirely without increasing memory peak. Our solution is based on the different bandwidths of the different communication channels, like NVLink, PCIe, InfiniBand and available storage media, which are utilized on different layers of the algorithm. This simple heterogeneous multiNode solution via asynchronous IO operation has the potential to minimize IO overhead, resulting in maximum performance rate for the main compute unit. In addition, we introduce an in-house developed massively parallel protocol to serialize and deserialize block sparse matrices and tensors, reducing data communication time tremendously. Performance profiles are presented for the spin adapted ab initio density matrix renormalization group method for corresponding U(1) bond dimension values up to 15400 on the active compounds of the FeMoco with complete active space (CAS) sizes of up to 113 electrons in 76 orbitals [CAS(113, 76)].</description>

      <title>Photothermal Expansion of Nanostructures in Photo-induced Force Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Powerful mid-infrared illumination combined with mechanical detection via force microscopy provides access to nanoscale spectroscopic imaging in Materials and Life Sciences. Photo-induced force microscopy (PiFM) employs pulsed illumination and noncontact force microscopy resulting in unprecedented spatial and high spectral resolution. The near-field-enhanced light absorption in the materials leads to thermal expansion affecting the distance-dependent weak van der Waals (VdW) force acting between the tip and the sample. We model the non-linear impact of material characteristics and surface shape on the tip-sample interaction, the heat generation from the presence of a photo-induced electric field, the associated thermal expansion under different illumination conditions including light polarization and the feedback to the dynamic tip motion due to the expansion. Comparison of the results with our experimental investigation of a polymer nanosphere shows good agreement, contributing new insights into the understanding required for a quantitative analysis of nanostructured materials imaged using PiFM.</description>

      <title>Structural results for the Tree Builder Random Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Tree Builder Random Walk: a randomly growing tree, built by a walker as she is walking around the tree. Namely, at each time $n$, she adds a leaf to her current vertex with probability $p_n \asymp n^{-\gamma}$, $\gamma\in (2/3,1]$, then moves to a uniform random neighbor on the possibly modified tree. We show that the tree process at its growth times, after a random finite number of steps, can be coupled to be identical to the Barab\'asi-Albert preferential attachment tree model.
  Thus, our TBRW-model is a local dynamics giving rise to the BA-model. The coupling also implies that many properties known for the BA-model, such as diameter and degree distribution, can be directly transferred to our TBRW-model, extending previous results.</description>
