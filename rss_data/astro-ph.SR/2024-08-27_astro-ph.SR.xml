      <title>An Audit of the Light Curves of RV Tau Variable Stars in the ASAS-SN Database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: RV Tauri variable stars are pulsating evolved stars that are identified by a characterizing feature in their light curves: alternating deep and shallow minima. Many RV Tauri variable stars were originally classified decades ago using visual observations and photographic plates. However, recent studies suggest that there are imposters, or misclassified variables, amongst the sample of RV Tau stars. In this study, we examine 84 known and suspected RV Tau stars that appear in the variable star catalog of the All Sky Automated Survey for Supernova (ASAS-SN). For each ASAS-SN light curve, we performed a period analysis and compared our results with those of the General Catalog of Variables Stars (GCVS) and the automatic classification algorithm used by ASAS-SN. We found that the pattern of alternating minima present in RV Tau variable stars often confuses automatic classification. Our results include updated periods and classifications for our sample. Our study provides an important step towards obtaining a robust sample of RV Tau variable stars to better understand the pulsation mechanism and the evolutionary pathway of these variable stars.</description>

      <title>Earths within Reach: Evaluation of Strategies for Mitigating Solar Variability using 3.5 years of NEID Sun-as-a-Star Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of Sun-as-a-star observations by the NEID Solar Telescope at WIYN Observatory, spanning January 1, 2021 through June 30, 2024. We identify 117,060 observations which are unlikely to be significantly affected by weather, hardware or major calibration issues. We describe several high-level data products being made available to the community to aid in the interpretation and inter comparisons of NEID solar observations. Solar observations demonstrate excellent performance of NEID, including radial velocity (RV) accuracy and long-term stability of better than $\simeq 0.37$ m s$^{-1}$ over $\simeq 3.5$ years, even though NEID was not originally designed or optimized for daytime observations of the Sun. Currently, intrinsic stellar variability is the primary barrier to detecting Earth-analog planets for most nearby, Sun-like stars. We present a comparison of the effectiveness of several methods proposed to mitigate the effects of solar variability on the Sun's estimated RV. We find that the Scalpels algorithm performs particularly well and substantially reduces the RMS RV of solar spectra from over 2 m s$^{-1}$ to 0.277 m s$^{-1}$. Even when training on a subset of days with NEID solar observations and testing on a held-out sample, the RMS of cleaned RV is 0.34-0.42 m s$^{-1}$. This is significantly better than previous attempts at removing solar variability and suggests that the current generation of EPRV instruments are technically capable of detecting Earth-mass planets orbiting a solar twin if provided with sufficient observing time allocations ($\sim 10^3$ nights of observations).</description>

      <title>New Insights into Type-I Solar Noise Storms from High Angular Resolution Spectroscopic Imaging with the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type-I solar noise storms are perhaps the most commonly observed active radio emissions from the Sun at meter-wavelengths. Noise storms have a long-lived and wideband continuum background with superposed islands of much brighter narrowband and short-lived emissions, known as type-I bursts. There is a serious paucity of studies focusing on the morphology of these two types of emissions, primarily because of the belief that coronal scattering will always wash out any features at small angular scales. However, it is important to { investigate} their spatial structures in detail to make a spatio-temporal connection with observations at extreme-ultraviolet/ X-ray bands to understand the detailed nature of these emissions. In this work, we use high angular resolution observations from the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope to demonstrate that it is possible to detect structures with angular scales as small as $\sim 9\arcsec$, about three times smaller than the smallest structure reported to date from noise storms. Our observations also suggest while the individual type-I bursts are narrowband in nature, the bursts are probably caused by traveling disturbance(s) inducing magnetic reconnections at different coronal heights, and thus leading to correlated change in the morphology of the type-I bursts observed at a wide range of frequencies.</description>

      <title>MASTER OT J030227.28+191754.5: an unprecedentedly energetic dwarf nova outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a detailed study of the MASTER OT J030227.28+191754.5 outburst in 2021-2022, reaching an amplitude of 10.2 mag and a duration of 60 d. The detections of (1) the double-peaked optical emission lines, and (2) the early and ordinary superhumps, established that MASTER OT J030227.28+191754.5 is an extremely energetic WZ Sge-type dwarf nova (DN). Based on the superhump observations, we obtained its orbital period and mass ratio as 0.05986(1) d and 0.063(1), respectively. These are within a typical range of low-mass-ratio DNe. According to the binary parameters derived based on the thermal-tidal instability model, our analyses showed that (1) the standard disk model requires an accretion rate $\simeq$ 10$^{20}$ g s$^{-1}$ to explain its peak optical luminosity and (2) large mass was stored in the disk at the outburst onset. These cannot be explained solely by the impact of its massive ($\gtrsim$ 1.15 M$_\odot$) primary white dwarf implied by Kimura et al. (2023). Instead, we propose that the probable origin of this enormously energetic DN outburst is the even lower quiescence viscosity than other WZ Sge-type DNe. This discussion is qualitatively valid for most possible binary parameter spaces unless the inclination is low ($\lesssim 40^\circ$) enough for the disk to be bright explaining the outburst amplitude. Such low inclinations, however, would not allow detectable amplitude of early superhumps in the current thermal-tidal instability model. The optical spectra at outburst maximum showed the strong emission lines of Balmer, He I, and He II series whose core is narrower than $\sim 800$ km s$^{-1}$. Considering its binary parameters, a Keplerian disk cannot explain this narrow component, but the presumable origin is disk winds.</description>

      <title>High-Energy Insights from an Escaping Coronal Mass Ejection with Solar Orbiter/STIX Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar eruptive events, including solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs), are typically characterised by energetically significant X-ray emissions from flare-accelerated electrons and hot thermal plasmas. Occulted events, where the main flare is blocked by the solar limb, provide an opportunity to observe and analyse the X-ray emissions specifically associated with CMEs. This study investigates the X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions associated with a large filament eruption and CME that occurred on February 15, 2022. This event was highly occulted from the three vantage points of Solar Orbiter, STEREO-A, and Earth. We utilised X-ray observations from the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) and EUV observations from the Full Sun Imager (FSI) of the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on-board Solar Orbiter, supplemented by multi-viewpoint observations from STEREO-A/EUVI. This enabled a comprehensive analysis of the X-ray emissions in relation to the filament structure observed in EUV. We used STIX's imaging and spectroscopy capabilities to characterise the X-ray source associated with the eruption. Our analysis reveals that the X-ray emissions associated with the occulted eruption originated from an altitude exceeding 0.3Rsun above the main flare site. The X-ray time-profile showed a sharp increase and exponential decay, and consisted of both a hot thermal component at 17 MK and non-thermal emissions (&gt;11.4 keV) characterised by an electron spectral index of 3.9. Imaging analysis showed an extended X-ray source that coincided with the EUV emission as observed from EUI, and was imaged until the source grew to a size larger than the imaging limit of STIX (180 arcsec). The findings demonstrate that STIX combined with EUI provides a unique and powerful tool for examining the energetic properties of the CME component of solar energetic eruptions.</description>

      <title>Validation of the RR Lyrae period determination in the Pan-STARRS PS1 3$\pi$ survey with K2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pan-STARRS 3$\pi$ survey has detected hundreds of thousands of variable stars thanks to its coverage and 4-year time span, even though the sampling of the light curves is relatively sparse. These light curves contain only 10-15 detections in each of the five filters (g,r,i,z,y). During the K2 mission, the Kepler space telescope observed with a high sampling frequency, although only for about 80 days in each of its campaigns. Crossmatching and investigating the RR Lyrae stars observed by both K2 and Pan-STARRS can serve as a valuable tool to validate the classification and period determination of the survey. We used the Sesar catalogue of RR Lyrae stars detected by Pan-STARRS. After determining the overlap, we also considered the Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae catalogue data for these stars wherever it was available. The frequencies of the light variations were calculated by applying the Lomb-Scargle periodogram method on the K2 light curves that were prepared with autoEAP photometry. The calculated frequencies of the stars then were compared with those given in the Sesar catalogue and the Gaia DR3 RR Lyrae catalogue. We found that for the majority of the stars, the classification (95.6%) and the frequency determination (90.1%) of the PanSTARRS RR Lyrae stars were consistent within 0.03 d-1 with those that we derived from the K2 autoEAP light curves. For a significant subset of the sample, 7.4%, however, an offset of 1 or 2 d-1 was found in the frequencies. These are the result of the sampling of the detections, because Pan-STARRS observations are affected by diurnal cycles, whereas Kepler carried out measurements quasicontinuously. We found that RRc subtypes are significantly more affected (25.3%) than RRab subtypes (3.7%), which is most likely caused by RRc stars having less sharp light curve features. Validation via space-based data will be important for future ground-based surveys, as well.</description>

      <title>ALMA Memo 628 -- High-cadence observations of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) offers new diagnostic capabilities for studying the Sun, providing complementary insights through high spatial and temporal resolution at millimeter wavelengths. ALMA acts as a linear thermometer for atmospheric gas, aiding in understanding the solar atmosphere's structure, dynamics, and energy balance. Given the Sun's complex emission patterns and rapid evolution, high-cadence imaging is essential for solar observations. Snapshot imaging is required, though it limits available visibility data, making full exploitation of ALMA's capabilities non-trivial. Challenges in processing solar ALMA data highlight the need for revising and enhancing the solar observing mode. The ALMA development study High-Cadence Imaging of the Sun demonstrated the potential benefits of high cadence observations through a forward modelling approach. The resulting report provides initial recommendations for improved post-processing solar ALMA data and explores increasing the observing cadence to sub-second intervals to improve image reliability.</description>

      <title>Radiance Cascades: A Novel High-Resolution Formal Solution for Multidimensional Non-LTE Radiative Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-LTE radiative transfer is a key tool for modern astrophysics: it is the means by which many key synthetic observables are produced, thus connecting simulations and observations. Radiative transfer models also inform our understanding of the primary formation layers and parameters of different spectral lines, and serve as the basis of inversion tools used to infer the structure of the solar atmosphere from observations. The default approach for computing the radiation field in multidimensional solar radiative transfer models has long remained the same: a short characteristics, discrete ordinates method, formal solver. In situations with complex atmospheric structure and multiple transitions between optically-thick and -thin regimes these solvers require prohibitively high angular resolution to correctly resolve the radiation field. Here, we present the theory of radiance cascades, a technique designed to exploit structure inherent to the radiation field, allowing for efficient reuse of calculated samples, thus providing a very high-resolution result at a fraction of the computational cost of existing methods. We additionally describe our implementation of this method in the DexRT code, and present initial results of the synthesis of a snapshot of a magnetohydrodynamic model of a solar prominence formed via levitation-condensation. The approach presented here provides a credible route for routinely performing multidimensional radiative transfer calculations free from so-called ray effects, and scaling high-quality non-LTE models to next-generation high-performance computing systems with GPU accelerators.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 118 New Ultracool Dwarf Candidates Using Machine Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 118 new ultracool dwarf candidates, discovered using a new machine learning tool, named \texttt{SMDET}, applied to time series images from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. We gathered photometric and astrometric data to estimate each candidate's spectral type, distance, and tangential velocity. This sample has a photometrically estimated spectral class distribution of 28 M dwarfs, 64 L dwarfs, and 18 T dwarfs. We also identify a T subdwarf candidate, two extreme T subdwarf candidates, and two candidate young ultracool dwarfs. Five objects did not have enough photometric data for any estimations to be made. To validate our estimated spectral types, spectra were collected for 2 objects, yielding confirmed spectral types of T5 (estimated T5) and T3 (estimated T4). Demonstrating the effectiveness of machine learning tools as a new large-scale discovery technique.</description>

      <title>High-Resolution Laboratory Measurements of M-shell Fe EUV Line Emission using EBIT-I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar physicists routinely utilize observations of Ar-like Fe IX and Cl-like Fe X emission to study a variety of solar structures. However, unidentified lines exist in the Fe IX and Fe X spectra, greatly impeding the spectroscopic diagnostic potential of these ions. Here, we present measurements using the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory EBIT-I electron beam ion trap in the wavelength range 238-258 A. These studies enable us to unambiguously identify the charge state associated with each of the observed lines. This wavelength range is of particular interest because it contains the Fe IX density diagnostic line ratio 241.74 A/244.91 A, which is predicted to be one of the best density diagnostics of the solar corona, as well as the Fe X 257.26 A magnetic-field-induced transition. We compare our measurements to the Fe IX and Fe X lines tabulated in CHIANTI v10.0.1, which is used for modeling the solar spectrum. In addition, we have measured previously unidentified Fe X lines that will need to be added to CHIANTI and other spectroscopic databases.</description>

      <title>Eclipse mapping study of the eclipsing binary KIC~3858884 with hybrid $\delta$~Sct/$\gamma$~Dor component</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsating stars in eclipsing binary systems offer a unique possibility to empirically identify pulsation modes using the geometric effect of the eclipses on the pulsation signals. Here we explore the $\delta$ Scuti type pulsations in the eclipsing binary system KIC~3858884 with the aim of identifying the dominant modes using various photometric methods. We used the \textit{Kepler} short cadence photometry data. Refined binary model and pulsation parameters were determined using an iterative separation of the eclipsing binary and pulsation signals. We used various methods to identify the host stars of the dominant pulsations. \'Echelle diagram diagnostics were employed to locate the frequencies with most influence from the eclipses. Direct Fitting methods assuming spherical harmonic surface patterns were explored to determine an orientation for the symmetry axis and to infer surface mode numbers $\ell$ and $m$. General surface patterns were reconstructed using dynamic eclipse mapping, and provided ancillary mode number estimates. We established the secondary star as the main source of the pulsations. Seven peaks, including the two strongest modes, were found to show modulations during the secondary eclipses. For the first time ever, we could detect two hidden modes with amplitude intensification during the eclipses. Only one frequency appears to originate from the primary. We successfully reconstructed surface patterns and determined mode numbers for most of the selected frequencies with both of our methods. One radial and three sectoral modes, among them hidden modes. The two hidden modes were identified as (3,$\pm$1) and (2,$\pm$1). One additional radial mode turned out to be a combination frequency. Partial disagreement between EM and DF results may indicate that the strongest modes deviate from strict spherical harmonics.</description>

Abstract: The origin of Hot Jupiters (HJs) is disputed between a variety of in situ and ex situ formation scenarios. One of the early proposed ex situ scenarios was the Eccentric Kozai-Lidov (EKL) mechanism combined with tidal circularization, which can produce HJs with the aid of a stellar or planetary companion. However, observations have revealed a lack of stellar companions to HJs, which challenges the importance of the binary star-driven EKL plus tides scenario. In this work, we explore so far unaccounted-for stellar evolution effects on HJ formation, in particular the effect of white dwarf (WD) formation. Gaia observations have revealed that WDs often undergo a kick during formation, which can alter a binary's orbital configuration or even unbind it. Based on this WD kick, in this letter we propose and explore two novel HJ formation pathways: 1) HJs that are presently orbiting single stars, but were initially formed in a binary that was later unbound by a WD kick; 2) Binaries that survive the WD kick can trigger enhanced EKL oscillations and lead to 2nd generation HJ formation. We demonstrate that the majority of seemingly single HJs could have formed in binary star systems. As such, HJ formation in binaries via the EKL mechanism could be one of the dominant HJ formation pathways, and our results highlight that unaccounted-for stellar evolution effects, like WD formation, can obscure the actual origin of observed exoplanet populations.</description>

      <title>The long-term influence of a magnetar power in stripped-envelope supernovae. Radiative-transfer modeling of He-star explosions from 1 to 10 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Much interest surrounds the nature of the compact remnant formed in core collapse supernovae (SNe). One means to constrain its nature is to search for signatures of power injection from the remnant in the SN observables years after explosion. In this work, we conduct a large grid of 1D nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of He-star explosions under the influence of magnetar-power injection from post-explosion age of about one to ten years. Our results for SN observables vary with He-star mass, SN age, injected power, or ejecta clumping. At high mass, the ejecta coolants are primarily O and Ne, with [OI]6330A, [OII]7325A, and [OIII]5000A dominating in the optical, and with strong [NeII]12.81micron in the infrared -- this line may carry more than half the total SN luminosity. For lower He-star masses, a greater diversity of coolants appear, in particular Fe, S, Ar, or Ni from the Si- and Fe-rich regions. All models tend to rise in ionization in time, with twice-ionized species (i.e., OIII, NeIII, SIII, or FeIII) dominating at ~10yr, although this ionization is significantly reduced if clumping is introduced. Our treatment of magnetar power in the form of high-energy electrons or X-ray irradiation yields similar results -- no X-rays emerge from our ejecta even at ten years because of high-optical depth in the keV range. An uncertainty of our work concerns the power deposition profile, which is not known from first principles, although this profile could be constrained from observations. Our magnetar-powered model he8p00 with moderate clumping yields a good match to the optical and near-infrared observations of Type Ib SN2012au at both ~300d (power of 1-2x10^41erg/s) and 2269d (power of 10^40erg/s). Unless overly ionized, we find that all massive magnetar-powered ejecta should be infrared luminous at 5-10yr through strong [NeII]12.81micron line emission.</description>

      <title>Integral equation approach for a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The problem of a hydrogen atom in a strong magnetic field is a notorious example of a quantum system that has genuinely different asymptotic behaviors in different directions. In the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field the motion is quadratically confined, while in the direction along the field line the motion is a Coulomb-distorted free motion. In this work, we identify the asymptotically relevant parts of the Hamiltonian and cast the problem into a Lippmann-Schwinger form. Then, we approximate the asymptotically irrelevant parts by a discrete Hilbert space basis that allows an exact analytic evaluation of the relevant Green's operators by continued fractions. The total asymptotic Green's operator is calculated by a complex contour integral of subsystem Green's operators. We present a sample of numerical results for a wide range of magnetic field strengths.</description>

      <title>Evidence for the Hierarchical Formation of the Galactic Disk in the Solar Neighborhood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: According to the hierarchical clustering scenario, galaxies like the Milky Way form hierarchically, and many supporting evidences have been found in the Galactic halo. However, most stars in the Milky Way are disk stars. Disk stars have almost lost their spatial distribution and kinematic features at birth, retaining solely chemical signatures. Identifying such substructures using abundances of iron or light elements is difficult due to their high degeneracy. Heavy elements, especially neutron capture elements have limited sources so have lower degeneracy, but spectral line fitting of these elements is tough, requiring mid to high resolution spectra, which are currently limited in sample size. This work utilizes the overall effect of changing in abundances to introduce the information of heavy elements, especially neutron capture elements to weaken the degeneracy of [Fe/H]. The analysis suggests the presence of at least 12 clusters, proves that the Galactic Disk form hierarchically. We excluded giants to prevent the possibly impact of mixing effects and that of too large differences in surface gravity, so the conclusions were all drawn from the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray emission from the classical nova AT 2018bej</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical novae are known to demonstrate a supersoft X-ray source (SSS) state following outbursts, which is associated with residual thermonuclear burning on the white dwarf (WD) surface. During its all-sky survey (eRASS1), the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory discovered a bright new SSS, whose position is consistent with the known classical nova AT 2018bej in the Large Magellanic Cloud. There were two eROSITA spectra obtained during eRASS1 and eRASS2 monitoring epochs and one XMM-Newton grating spectrum close to the eRASS1 epoch. We aim to describe the eROSITA and XMM-Newton spectra of AT 2018bej with our local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmosphere models. We focused on the evolution of the hot WD properties between the eRASS1 and eRASS2 epochs, especially on the change of the carbon abundance. A grid of LTE model atmosphere spectra were calculated for different values of the effective temperature (from $T_{\rm eff}= 525$ to $700\,\rm kK$), surface gravity (six values) and chemical composition with five different values of carbon and nitrogen abundances. Both eRASS1 and XMM $0.3-0.6$ keV spectral analyses yield a temperature of the WD of $T_{\rm eff}{\sim}\,600\, \rm kK$ and a WD radius of $8000-8700\,\rm km$. Simultaneous fitting of the eROSITA spectra for two epochs (eRASS1 and eRASS2) with a common WD mass parameter demonstrates a decrease in $T_{\rm eff}$ accompanied by an increase in the WD radius and a decrease in the carbon abundance. However, these changes are marginal and coincide within errors. The derived WD mass is estimated to be $1.05-1.15\, M_\odot$. We traced a minor evolution of the source on a half-year timescale accompanied by a decrease in carbon abundance and concluded that LTE model atmospheres can be used to analyse the available X-ray spectra of classical novae during their SSS stage.</description>

      <title>A model of generation of a jet in stratified nonequilibrium plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the magnetohydrodynamic approximation, system of equations is proposed which analytically describes the initial stage of origination of axially symmetric directed flows in nonequilibrium stratified plasma. The mechanism of generation is based on the Schwarzschild's convective instability and uses the frozen-in flux condition for magnetic field lines. A solution to the nonlinear equation for the stream function is obtained and analyzed, and it is shown that jets with poloidal velocity fields are generated in such a plasma. The corresponding expressions for the R-dependences of the radial and vertical velocity components in the internal and external regions of the jet include Bessel functions and modified Bessel functions. For jets localized in height and radius, the proposed new nonlinear analytical model makes it possible to study their structure and nonlinear dynamics in the radial and vertical directions. The emerging instability in a stratified plasma leads to an increase in the radial and vertical velocities of flows according to the law of the hyperbolic sine. The characteristic growth time depends on the value of the imaginary part of the Brunt-Vyaisyalya frequency. The formation of jets with finite velocity components increasing with time is analyzed. The radial structure of the azimuthal components is determined by the structure of the initial perturbation and can vary with altitude. Along with studying the dynamics of the velocity field, the change in the vertical magnetic field, as well as the dynamics and structure of the emerging toroidal electric current, are investigated.</description>

      <title>Efficiently Searching for Close-in Companions around Young M Dwarfs using a Multi-year PSF Library</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Super-RDI, a unique framework for the application of reference star differential imaging (RDI) to Keck/NIRC2 high-contrast imaging observations with the vortex coronagraph. Super-RDI combines frame selection and signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) optimization techniques with a large multi-year reference point spread function (PSF) library to achieve optimal PSF subtraction at small angular separations. We compile a $\sim$7000 frame reference PSF library based on a set of 288 new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ sequences of 237 unique targets acquired between 2015 and 2019 as part of two planet-search programs, one focusing on nearby young M dwarfs and the other targeting members of the Taurus star-forming region. For our dataset, synthetic companion injection-recovery tests reveal that frame selection with the mean-squared error (MSE) metric combined with KLIP-based PSF subtraction using 1000-3000 frames and $&lt;$500 principal components yields the highest average S/N for injected synthetic companions. We uniformly reduce targets in the young M-star survey with both Super-RDI and angular differential imaging (ADI). For the typical parallactic angle rotation of our dataset ($\sim$10$^\circ$), Super-RDI performs better than a widely used implementation of ADI at separations $\lesssim$0.4" ($\approx$5 $\lambda$/$D$) gaining an average of 0.25 mag in contrast at 0.25" and 0.4 mag in contrast at 0.15". This represents a performance improvement in separation space over RDI with single-night reference star observations ($\sim$100 frame PSF libraries) applied to a similar Keck/NIRC2 dataset in previous work. We recover two known brown dwarf companions and provide detection limits for 155 targets in the young M-star survey. Our results demonstrate that increasing the PSF library size with careful selection of reference frames can improve the performance of RDI with the Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in $L'$.</description>

      <title>SO as shock tracer in protoplanetary disks: the AB Aurigae case</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: {Sulfur Monoxide is known to be a good shock tracer in molecular clouds and protostar environments, but its abundance is difficult to reproduce even using state-of-the-art astrochemical models. }
  {We investigate the properties of the observed SO emission in the protoplanetary disk of AB Auriga, a Herbig Ae star of 2.4 $\Msun$ located at 156 pc. The AB Aur system is unique because it exhibits a dust trap and at least one young putative planet orbiting at about 30 au from the central star.}
  {We reduced ALMA archival data (projects 2019.1.00579.S, 2021.1.00690.S and 2021.1.01216.S) and analyzed the three detected SO lines (SO $6_5-5_4$, $6_7-5_6$ and $5_6-4_5$).
  We also present C$^{17}$O and C$^{18}$O 2-1 data to complement the interpretation of the SO data.}
  {For the three SO lines, the maximum SO emission in the ring is not located in the dust trap. Moreover, the inner radius of the SO ring is significantly larger than the CO emission inner radius, $\sim 160$ au versus $\sim 90$ au. The SO emission traces gas located in part beyond the dust ring. This emission likely originates from shocks at the interface of the outer spirals, observed in CO and scattered light emission, and the molecular and dust ring. SO is also detected inside the cavity, at a radius $\sim 20-30$ au and with a rotation velocity compatible with the proto-planet P1. We speculate that this SO emission originates from accretion shocks onto the circumplanetary disk of the putative proto-planet P1.}
  {These observations confirm that SO is a good tracer of shocks in protoplanetary disks and could be a powerful, new tool to detect embedded (proto-)planets.} Conclusions. These observations confirm that SO is a good tracer of shocks in protoplanetary disks and could be a powerful, new tool to detect embedded (proto-)planets.</description>

      <title>Solar Active Regions Detection Via 2D Circular Kernel Time Series Transformation, Entropy and Machine Learning Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes an enhancement to the existing method for detecting Solar Active Regions (ARs). Our technique tracks ARs using images from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) of NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). It involves a 2D circular kernel time series transformation, combined with Statistical and Entropy measures, and a Machine Learning (ML) approach. The technique transforms the circular area around pixels in the SDO AIA images into one-dimensional time series (1-DTS). Statistical measures (Median Value, Xmed; 95th Percentile, X95) and Entropy measures (Distribution Entropy, DisEn; Fuzzy Entropy, FuzzyEn) are used as feature selection methods (FSM 1), alongside a method applying 1-DTS elements directly as features (FSM 2). The ML algorithm classifies these series into three categories: no Active Region (nARs type 1, class 1), non-flaring Regions outside active regions with brightness (nARs type 2, class 2), and flaring Active Regions (ARs, class 3). The ML model achieves a classification accuracy of 0.900 and 0.914 for Entropy and Statistical measures, respectively. Notably, Fuzzy Entropy shows the highest classification accuracy (AKF=0.895), surpassing DisEn (AKF=0.738), X95 (AKF=0.873), and Xmed (AKF=0.840). This indicates the high effectiveness of Entropy and Statistical measures for AR detection in SDO AIA images. FSM 2 captures a similar distribution of flaring AR activities as FSM 1. Additionally, we introduce a generalizing characteristic of AR activities (GSA), finding a direct agreement between increased AR activities and higher GSA values. The Python code implementation of the proposed method is available in supplementary material.</description>

      <title>Dust formation in common envelope binary interactions -- II: 3D simulations with self-consistent dust formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03644v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We performed numerical simulations of the common envelope (CE) interaction between thermally-pulsing asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars of 1.7~\Msun and 3.7~\Msun, respectively, and a 0.6~\Msun compact companion. We use tabulated equations of state to take into account recombination energy. For the first time, formation and growth of dust is calculated explicitly, using a carbon dust nucleation network with a C/O abundance ratio of 2.5 (by number). The first dust grains appear within $\sim$1--3~yrs after the onset of the CE, forming an optically thick shell at $\sim$10--20~au, growing in thickness and radius to values of $\sim$400--500~au over $\sim$40~yrs, with temperatures around 400~K. Most dust is formed in unbound material, having little effect on mass ejection or orbital evolution. By the end of the simulations, the total dust yield is $\sim8.4\times10^{-3}$~\Msun and $\sim2.2\times10^{-2}$~\Msun for the CE with a 1.7~\Msun and a 3.7~\Msun AGB star, respectively, corresponding to a nucleation efficiency close to 100\%, if no dust destruction mechanism is considered. Despite comparable dust yields to single AGB stars, \textit{in CE ejections the dust forms a thousand times faster, over tens of years as opposed to tens of thousands of years}. This rapid dust formation may account for the shift in the infrared of the spectral energy distribution of some optical transients known as luminous red novae. Simulated dusty CEs support the idea that extreme carbon stars and "water fountains" may be objects observed after a CE event.</description>

      <title>Comparison of the disk precession models with the photometric behavior of TT Ari in 2021-2023</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a comparative analysis of photometric observations of the cataclysmic variable TT Ari in its bright state, obtained by the TESS orbital observatory in 2021 and 2023 and by ground-based amateur telescopes in 2022. The light curves from 2021 and 2022 are dominated by modulations with a period slightly shorter than the orbital one (negative superhumps), 0.13292 and 0.13273 d respectively. In 2023, much stronger modulations appeared on a much longer time scale of a few days with an amplitude of up to 0.5 mag, compared to 0.2 mag in 2021. The negative superhump variability with the period of 0.1338 d was also found in the 2023 observations, but the significance of these negative superhumps is much lower than in the previous seasons. Less significant additional modulations with a period exceeding the orbital one (positive superhumps) were detected in 2021 and 2022. Their periods were 0.15106 and 0.1523 d, respectively. We also found a previously unnoticed periodic signal corresponding to the orbital period of 0.13755 d in the TESS observations in 2021. Theoretical models of tidal precession of an elliptical disk predict a decrease in the precession period (and an increase in the positive superhumps period) with increasing disk radius, which is consistent with the observed photometric behavior of the system. It enables us to estimate the mass ratio of the components in TT Ari to be $q$ in the range 0.24-0.29. The tilted disk precession model predicts a period of nodal precession whose value is in general agreement with observations.</description>

Abstract: Dust grains play a significant role in several astrophysical processes, including gas/dust dynamics, chemical reactions, and radiative transfer. Replenishment of small-grain populations is mainly governed by fragmentation during pair-wise collisions between grains. The wide spectrum of fragmentation outcomes, from complete disruption to erosion and/or mass transfer, can be modelled by the general non-linear fragmentation equation. Efficiently solving this equation is crucial for an accurate treatment of the dust fragmentation in numerical modelling. However, similar to dust coagulation, numerical errors in current fragmentation algorithms employed in astrophysics are dominated by the numerical over-diffusion problem -- particularly in 3D hydrodynamic simulations where the discrete resolution of the mass density distribution tends to be highly limited. With this in mind, we have derived the first conservative form of the general non-linear fragmentation with a mass flux highlighting the mass transfer phenomenon. Then, to address cases of limited mass density resolution, we applied a high-order discontinuous Galerkin scheme to efficiently solve the conservative fragmentation equation with a reduced number of dust bins. An accuracy of 0.1 -1% is reached with 20 dust bins spanning a mass range of 9 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Protostellar spin-up and fast rotator formation through binary star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: (Edited) Many fast rotator stars (rotation periods of &lt; 2 days) are found in unresolved binaries with separations of tens of au. This correlation leads to the question of whether the formation of binary stars inherently produces fast rotators. We aim to understand whether the formation of companions plays a role in spinning up stars. We use magneto-hydrodynamical simulations to study the formation of multiple star systems from turbulent and non-turbulent protostellar cores. We track the angular momentum accreted by individual star and inner disc systems by using a sink particle technique. We run a resolution study to extrapolate protostellar properties. We find in all simulations that the primary star can experience spin-up events that are correlated with the formation of companions. The primary star can spin up by up to 84% of its pre-fragmentation angular momentum and by up to 18% of its pre-fragmentation mass-specific angular momentum. The mechanism for the spin-up is gravitational disc instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star, leading to the accretion of material with high specific angular momentum. The simulations that experience the strongest disc instabilities fragment to form companions. Simulations with weaker spin-up events experience disc instabilities triggered by a companion flyby, and the disc instability in these cases does not produce further fragments. We conclude that the primary star in multiple star systems may end up with a higher spin than single stars. This is because gravitational instabilities in the circumstellar disc around the primary star can trigger a spin-up event. In the strongest spin-up events, the instability is likely to cause disc fragmentation and the formation of companions. This companion formation coupled with shorter disc lifetimes, because the companion truncates the circumstellar disc, can help produce fast rotators.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Testing the sources of the peculiar abundances in globular clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09001v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work aims to analyze some of the polluters proposed in the self-enrichment scenarios put forward to explain the multiple populations in globular clusters (GCs), extending previous studies. Three scenarios with different polluter stars were tested: asymptotic giant branch stars, high-mass interacting binaries, and fast rotating massive stars. With abundance data available from the APOGEE survey and $\Delta Y$ estimates from precise HST photometry, twenty-six clusters were studied. We also included the study of the abundances of N, C, Mg and Al, extending previous studies that focused mainly on the abundances of He, O and Na. In addition, we constructed an empirical model to test whether one could explain the chemical signatures of the 'enriched' population of GC stars with a fixed source and dilution process based on empirical data. In agreement with work by other authors, we found that the proposed polluters can generally predict the qualitative abundance patterns in GC stars and in some cases quantitatively predict some elements, but in most cases when we compare the model yields with the observations, we find that they can not explain the entire set of observed abundance patterns. The empirical model succeeds in reproducing the abundances of Al for a given $\Delta Y$ (and vice versa), showing that there is a direct relationship between Al and He, with one increasing proportionally to the other. However, the empirical model fails to reproduce the observed abundances of Na and N, in agreement with the results of previous works. The observed decoupling between the maximum abundances of CNO-cycle elements like N and Na with those of Al and He provides new information and constraints for future models and could take us a step closer to understanding the origin of the peculiar abundance variations of globular cluster stars.</description>

      <title>Weighing Milky Way and Andromeda in an expanding $\Lambda$CDM Universe: Decreasing the Local Group mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09546v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of the Local Group (LG), especially the contribution of the Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31) galaxies, is sensitive to the presence of dark energy. This work analyzes the evolution of the LG by considering it as a two-body problem in a homogeneous and isotropic expanding spacetime in a full $\Lambda$ cold dark matter $(\Lambda$CDM) background. Using the timing argument (TA), which links LG dynamics to LG mass, we find that the complete $\Lambda$CDM background predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ lower mass for the LG; while $\Lambda$ alone predicts a $\sim 10 \%$ higher mass. The TA mass is modified by (i) simulations and (ii) the effect of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) to alleviate the poorly constrained internal mass distributions of M31 and the MW, their time evolution, and the unknown distribution of dark matter between them. First, using IllustrisTNG simulations, we accounted for the effects of two extended halos and their environment (rather than point particles) and predicted their mass $\left(3.89 \pm 0.62\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_{\odot}$. Second, the LMC effectively changes the separation and velocities of M31 toward the MW and reduces the predicted mass to $\left(2.33 \pm 0.72\right) \cdot 10^{12} M_\odot$. Despite the uncertainties around dark matter between these galaxies, the overall estimated mass is compatible with the mere sum of the MW and M31 masses. The total mass of the TA is compatible with other estimates, such as the Hubble flow and the Virial Theorem with other dwarf galaxies. The combined result shows, for the first time, that a lower mass estimate can be obtained from the TA, with a consistent embedding and other systematic effects, and without an additional dark matter halo around the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Charged analog of anisotropic dark energy star in Rastall gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dark energy is one of the potential strategies for preventing compact objects from gravitationally collapsing into singularities. Because it is the cause of the accelerated expansion of our universe, it has the greatest impact on the cosmos. Thus, it is plausible that dark energy will interact with any stellar object that is compact in the universe [\textit{Phys. Rev. D} \textbf{103}, 084042 (2021)]. Our main goal in this work is to create a simplified model, in the Rastall gravitational framework, of a charged strange star coupled to anisotropic dark energy in Krori-Barua spacetime [\textit{J. Phys. A, Math. Gen.} \textbf{8}:508, 1975]. Here, we consider a specific strange star object, Her X-1, with observed values of mass $=(0.85 \pm 0.15)M_{\odot}$ and radius $= 8.1_{-0.41}^{+0.41}$ km., so that we can develop our model. In this context, we began by modeling dark energy using the equation of state (EoS), in which the dark energy density is proportional to the isotropic perfect fluid matter-energy density. The Darmois-Israel condition has been used to calculate the unknown constants that are present in the metric. We perform a detailed analysis of the model's physical properties, including the mass-radius relation, pressure, density, metric function, and dark energy parameters, by varying the Rastall coupling parameter. We also examine the stability and force equilibrium of our proposed stellar configuration. Following a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we discovered that our suggested model is both singularity-free and meets all stability requirements needed to be a stable, physically reasonable stellar model.</description>

      <title>The effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16244v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use particle-in-cell, fully electromagnetic, plasma kinetic simulation to study the effect of external magnetic field on electron scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability (ESKHI). The results are applicable to collisionless plasmas when e.g. solar wind interacts with planetary magnetospheres or magnetic field is generated in AGN jets. We find that as in the case of magnetohydrodynamic KHI, in the kinetic regime, presence of external magnetic field reduces growth rate of the instability. In MHD case there is known threshold magnetic field for KHI stabilization, while for ESKHI this is to be analytically determined. Without a kinetic analytical expression, we use several numerical simulation runs to establish an empirical dependence of ESKHI growth rate, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}$, on the strength of applied external magnetic field. We find the best fit is hyperbolic, $\Gamma(B_0)\omega_{\rm pe}=\Gamma_0\omega_{\rm pe}/(A+B\bar B_0)$, where $\Gamma_0$ is the ESKHI growth rate without external magnetic field and $\bar B_0=B_0/B_{\rm MHD}$ is the ratio of external and two-fluid MHD stability threshold magnetic field, derived here. An analytical theory to back up this growth rate dependence on external magnetic field is needed. The results suggest that in astrophysical settings where strong magnetic field pre-exists, the generation of an additional magnetic field by the ESKHI is suppressed, which implies that the Nature provides a "safety valve" -- natural protection not to "over-generate" magnetic field by ESKHI mechanism. Remarkably, we find that our two-fluid MHD threshold magnetic field is the same (up to a factor $\sqrt{\gamma_0}$) as the DC saturation magnetic field, previously predicted by fully kinetic theory.</description>

      <title>Discovery of MgS and NaS in the Interstellar Medium and tentative detection of CaO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the first detection of the metal-bearing molecules sodium sulfide (NaS) and magnesium sulfide (MgS) and the tentative detection of calcium monoxide (CaO) in the interstellar medium (ISM) towards the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027. The derived column densities are (5.0+-1.1) x 10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, (6.0+-0.6) x $^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (2.0+-0.5) x $^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with respect to H$_2$ of (3.7+-1.0) x $10^{-13}$, (4.4+-0.8) x $10^{-13}$, and (1.5+-0.4) x $10^{-13}$, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg- and Ca-bearing species towards this source but none of them have been detected and thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible chemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals under interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between sulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding that metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing oxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between other non metal- oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthen the idea that sulfur may be little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the low velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material from dust grains.</description>

      <title>Ejecta masses in Type Ia Supernovae -- Implications for the Progenitor and the Explosion Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The progenitor system(s) as well as the explosion mechanism(s) of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae are long-standing issues in astrophysics. Here we present ejecta masses and other physical parameters for 28 recent Type Ia supernovae inferred from multiband photometric and optical spectroscopic data. Our results confirm that the majority of SNe Ia show {\it observable} ejecta masses below the Chandrasekhar-limit (having a mean $M_{\rm ej} \approx 1.1 \pm 0.3$ M$_\odot$), consistent with the predictions of recent sub-M$_{\rm Ch}$ explosion models. They are compatible with models assuming either single- or double-degenerate progenitor configurations. We also recover a sub-sample of supernovae within $1.2 $ M$_\odot$ $&lt; M_{\rm {ej}} &lt; 1.5$ M$_\odot$ that are consistent with near-Chandrasekhar explosions. Taking into account the uncertainties of the inferred ejecta masses, about half of our SNe are compatible with both explosion models. We compare our results with those in previous studies, and discuss the caveats and concerns regarding the applied methodology.</description>
