      <title>Vanishing of dimensions and nonexistence of spectral triples on compact Vilenkin groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the spectral dimension, the dimension of a symmetric random walk, and the Gelfand-Kirillov dimension for compact Vilenkin groups. As a result, we show that these dimensions are zero for any compact, totally disconnected, metrizable topological group. We provide an explicit description of the $K$-groups for compact Vilenkin groups. We express the generators of the $K_0$-groups in terms of the corresponding matrix coefficients for two specific examples: the group of $p$-adic integers and the $p$-adic Heisenberg group. Finally, we prove the nonexistence of a natural class of spectral triples on the group of $p$-adic integers.</description>

      <title>Finite Free Convolution: Infinitesimal Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Additive and multiplicative finite free convolutions are operations on the set of polynomials with real roots, whose empirical distributions are known to approximate free additive and multiplicative convolutions, as the degree $d$ converges to infinity. In this paper, we study these approximations in finer detail, focusing on corrections (or fluctuations) up to order $1/d$, namely their infinitesimal distribution. By studying how the infinitesimal behavior of the moments relates to the infinitesimal behavior of the cumulants we are able to determine how the infinitesimal distributions changes under the additive and multiplicative finite free convolutions. It is worth mentioning that these operations do not correspond to the infinitesimal free additive and multiplicative convolutions that has been studied before, but in the additive case we provide an explicit connection using subordination functions. We give several examples and applications, including an explicit formula to compute the effect of repeated differentiation on the infinitesimal distribution.</description>

      <title>Generalized Double Operator Integrals for Continuous Spectrum Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous spectrum operators (CSOs), characterized by spectra comprising continuous intervals rather than discrete eigenvalues, are pivotal in quantum mechanics, wave propagation, and systems governed by partial differential equations. Traditional double operator integrals (DOIs), central to analyzing operator functions and perturbations, have been limited to operators with finite or countable spectra, relying critically on self-adjointness. This work introduces a comprehensive framework for Generalized Double Operator Integrals (GDOIs), extending DOI theory to non-self-adjoint operators through the spectral structure of CSOs. By reinterpreting DOIs as instances of the spectral mapping theorem for CSOs, we establish GDOIs as a rigorous generalization, enabling their application to operators with continuous spectra. Key contributions include the development of GDOIs' algebraic properties, perturbation formulas generalizing classical results, norm and Lipschitz-type inequalities, and continuity with respect to operator and function parameters. Applications to differentiating operator-valued functions demonstrate the framework's utility in functional calculus. Furthermore, integrating recent spectral mapping theorems allows natural extension to hybrid spectrum operators, bridging operator theory with applied fields. This work significantly expands the analytical toolbox for systems with continuous spectral phenomena, offering new methodologies for quantum mechanics, control theory, and stochastic analysis, where non-self-adjoint and continuous spectral features are fundamental. The results unify and extend existing operator-theoretic techniques, fostering interdisciplinary advances in mathematics, physics, and engineering.</description>

      <title>Geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces via Banach representations of Roe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces, which jointly generalizes Banach property (T) for groups and geometric property (T) for metric spaces. Our framework is achieved by Banach representations of Roe algebras of metric spaces. We show that geometric Banach property (T) is a coarse geometric invariant and establish several equivalent characterizations of this property, including a characterization via Kazhdan projections in Roe algebras. Further, we investigate foundational properties of geometric Banach property (T), including: the geometric Banach property (T) of sequences of finite Cayley graphs to the Banach property (T) of their limit groups (this partially extends the classical correspondence between residually finite groups and their box spaces), and the connection between the coarse fixed point property and geometric Banach property (T). Additionally, we provide a geometric characterization of V. Lafforgue's strong Banach property (T) for residually finite groups in terms of geometric Banach property (T) of its box spaces.</description>

      <title>A higher index and rapidly decaying kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an index of first-order, self-adjoint, elliptic differential operators in the $K$-theory of a Fr\'echet algebra of smooth kernels with faster than exponential off-diagonal decay. We show that this index can be represented by an idempotent involving heat operators. The rapid decay of the kernels in the algebra used is helpful in proving convergence of pairings with cyclic cocycles. Representing the index in terms of heat operators allows one to use heat kernel asymptotics to compute such pairings. We give a link to von Neumann algebras and $L^2$-index theorems as an immediate application, and work out further applications in other papers.</description>

      <title>The Multidimensional Quadratic Phase Fourier Transform: Theoretical Analysis and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02526v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quadratic phase Fourier transform (QPFT) is a generalization of several well-known integral transforms, including the linear canonical transform (LCT), fractional Fourier transform (FrFT), and Fourier transform (FT). This paper introduces the multidimensional QPFT and investigates its theoretical properties, including Parseval's identity and inversion theorems. Generalized convolutions and correlation for multiple variables, extending the conventional convolution for single-variable functions, are proposed within the QPFT setting. Additionally, a Boas-type theorem for the multidimensional QPFT is established. As applications, multiplicative filter design and the solution of integral equations using the proposed convolution operation are explored.</description>

      <title>Limits of Probability Measures with General Coefficients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.14052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of probability measures in terms of moments by applying operators to their Bessel generating functions. We consider a general setting of applying operators such as the Dunkl operator to formal power series that are symmetric or symmetric in all but one variable. Afterwards, we apply the results from this setting by considering Bessel generating functions as the formal power series to obtain a Law of Large Numbers as $N$, the number of variables, increases to infinity and $N^c\beta$ converges to a constant, where $c\in (-\infty, 1)$. In contrast with previous results, we consider when the scaled partial derivatives of the logarithms of the Bessel generating functions evaluated at the origin can have nonzero $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit when any number of variables is involved. Then, the free cumulant of order $k$ is a linear combination of the limits of the order $k$ partial derivatives.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we obtain a complete characterization of reducing, invariant, and hyperinvariant subspaces for the completely non-unitary component of a power partial isometry. In particular, precise characterization of reducing, invariant, and hyperinvariant subspaces of a truncated shift operator has been achieved.</description>

      <title>A note on the quantum Wielandt inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this note, we prove that the index of primitivity of any primitive unital Schwarz map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, where $D$ is the dimension of the underlying matrix algebra. This inequality was first proved by Rahaman for Schwarz maps which were both unital and trace preserving. As we show, the assumption of unitality is basically innocuous, but in general not all primitive unital Schwarz maps are trace preserving. Therefore, the precise purpose of this note is to showcase how to apply the method of Rahaman to unital primitive Schwarz maps that don't preserve trace. As a corollary of this theorem, we show that the index of primitivity of any primitive 2-positive map is at most $2(D-1)^2$, so in particular this bound holds for arbitrary primitive completely positive maps. We briefly discuss of how this relates to a conjecture of Perez-Garcia, Verstraete, Wolf and Cirac.</description>
