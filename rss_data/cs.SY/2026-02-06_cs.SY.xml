      <title>Multi-Sensor Scheduling for Remote State Estimation over Wireless MIMO Fading Channels with Semantic Over-the-Air Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study multi-sensor scheduling for remote state estimation over wireless multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fading channels using a novel semantic over-the-air (SemOTA) aggregation approach. We first revisit Kalman filtering with conventional over-the-air (OTA) aggregation and highlight its transmit power limitations. To balance power efficiency and estimation performance, we formulate the scheduling task as a finite-horizon dynamic programming (DP) problem. By analyzing the structure of the optimal Q-function, we show that the resulting scheduling policy exhibits a semantic structure that adapts online to the estimation error covariance and channel variations. To obtain a practical solution, we derive a tractable upper bound on the Q-function via a positive semidefinite (PSD) cone decomposition, which enables an efficient approximate scheduling policy and a low-complexity remote estimation algorithm. Numerical results confirm that the proposed scheme outperforms existing methods in both estimation accuracy and power efficiency.</description>

      <title>Learning Nonlinear Continuous-Time Systems for Formal Uncertainty Propagation and Probabilistic Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are powerful tools for modeling real-world dynamical systems. However, propagating initial state uncertainty through nonlinear dynamics, especially when the ODE is unknown and learned from data, remains a major challenge. This paper introduces a novel continuum dynamics perspective for model learning that enables formal uncertainty propagation by constructing Taylor series approximations of probabilistic events. We establish sufficient conditions for the soundness of the approach and prove its asymptotic convergence. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, particularly when predicting rare events.</description>

      <title>GPU-to-Grid: Voltage Regulation via GPU Utilization Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the rapid expansion of data centers poses challenges for power grids, it also offers new opportunities as potentially flexible loads. Existing power system research often abstracts data centers as aggregate resources, while computer system research primarily focuses on optimizing GPU energy efficiency and largely ignores the grid impacts of optimized GPU power consumption. To bridge this gap, we develop a GPU-to-Grid framework that couples device-level GPU control with power system objectives. We study distribution-level voltage regulation enabled by flexibility in LLM inference, using batch size as a control knob that trades off the voltage impacts of GPU power consumption against inference latency and token throughput. We first formulate this problem as an optimization problem and then realize it as an online feedback optimization controller that leverages measurements from both the power grid and GPU systems. Our key insight is that reducing GPU power consumption alleviates violations of lower voltage limits, while increasing GPU power mitigates violations near upper voltage limits in distribution systems; this runs counter to the common belief that minimizing GPU power consumption is always beneficial to power grids.</description>

      <title>Trojan Attacks on Neural Network Controllers for Robotic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural network controllers are increasingly deployed in robotic systems for tasks such as trajectory tracking and pose stabilization. However, their reliance on potentially untrusted training pipelines or supply chains introduces significant security vulnerabilities. This paper investigates backdoor (Trojan) attacks against neural controllers, using a differential-drive mobile robot platform as a case study. In particular, assuming that the robot's tracking controller is implemented as a neural network, we design a lightweight, parallel Trojan network that can be embedded within the controller. This malicious module remains dormant during normal operation but, upon detecting a highly specific trigger condition defined by the robot's pose and goal parameters, compromises the primary controller's wheel velocity commands, resulting in undesired and potentially unsafe robot behaviours. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of the proposed Trojan network, which is validated through simulation under two different attack scenarios. The results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed attack and demonstrate that neural network-based robotic control systems are subject to potentially critical security threats.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Predictive Cost Adaptive Control of Pseudo-Linear Input-Output Models Using Polynomial, Fourier, and Cubic Spline Observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control of nonlinear systems with high levels of uncertainty is practically relevant and theoretically challenging. This paper presents a numerical investigation of an adaptive nonlinear model predictive control (MPC) technique that relies entirely on online system identification without prior modeling, training, or data collection. In particular, the paper considers predictive cost adaptive control (PCAC), which is an extension of generalized predictive control. Nonlinear PCAC (NPCAC) uses recursive least squares (RLS) with subspace of information forgetting (SIFt) to identify a discrete-time, pseudo-linear, input-output model, which is used with iterative MPC for nonlinear receding-horizon optimization. The performance of NPCAC is illustrated using polynomial, Fourier, and cubic-spline basis functions.</description>

      <title>Policy-Driven Orchestration Framework for Multi-Operator Non-Terrestrial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) have gained significant attention for their scalability and wide coverage in next-generation communication systems. A large number of NTN nodes, such as satellites, are required to establish a global NTN, but not all operators have the capability to deploy such a system. Therefore, cooperation among multiple operators, facilitated by an orchestrator, enables the construction of virtually large-scale constellations. In this paper, we propose a weak-control-based orchestration framework that coordinates multiple NTN operators while ensuring that operations align with the policies of both the orchestrator and the individual operators. Unlike centralized orchestration frameworks, where the orchestrator determines the entire route from source to destination, the proposed framework allows each operator to select preferred routes from multiple candidates provided by the orchestrator. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed framework, we conducted numerical simulations under various scenarios and network configurations including dynamic NTN environments with time-varying topologies, showing that inter-operator cooperation improves the availability of feasible end-to-end routes. Furthermore, we analyzed the iterative negotiation process to address policy conflicts and quantitatively demonstrated the "price of autonomy," where strict individual policies degrade global feasibility and performance. The results also demonstrate that outcomes of the proposed framework depend on the operators' policies and that hop count and latency increase as the number of operators grows. These findings validate the proposed framework's ability to deliver practical benefits of orchestrated multi-operator collaboration in future NTN environments.</description>

      <title>Robust data-driven model-reference control of linear perturbed systems via sliding mode generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a data-based integral sliding mode control scheme for robustification of model-reference controllers, accommodating generic multivariable linear systems with unknown dynamics and affected by matched disturbances. Specifically, an integral sliding mode control (ISMC) law is recast into a data-based framework relying on an integral sliding variable depending only on the reference model, without the need of modeling the plant. The main strength of the proposed approach is the enforcement of the desired reference model in closed-loop under sliding mode conditions, despite the lack of knowledge of the model dynamics and the presence of the matched disturbances. Moreover, the conditions required to guarantee an integral sliding mode generation and the closed-loop stability are formally analyzed in the paper, remarking the generality of the proposed data-driven integral sliding mode control (DD-ISMC) with respect to the related model-based counterpart. Finally, the main practices for the data-based design of the proposed control scheme are deeply discussed in the paper, and the proposed method is tested in simulation on a benchmark example, and experimentally on a real laboratory setup. Simulation and experimental evidence fully corroborates the theoretical analysis, thus motivating further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Toward Operationalizing Rasmussen: Drift Observability on the Simplex for Evolving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Monitoring drift into failure is hindered by Euclidean anomaly detection that can conflate safe operational trade-offs with risk accumulation in signals expressed as shares, and by architectural churn that makes fixed schemas (and learned models) stale before rare boundary events occur. Rasmussen's dynamic safety model motivates drift under competing pressures, but operationalizing it for software is difficult because many high-value operational signals (effort, remaining margin, incident impact) are compositional and their parts evolve. We propose a vision for drift observability on the simplex: model drift and boundary proximity in Aitchison geometry to obtain coordinate-invariant direction and distance-to-safety in interpretable balance coordinates. To remain comparable under churn, a monitor would continuously refresh its part inventory and policy-defined boundaries from engineering artifacts and apply lineage-aware aggregation. We outline early-warning diagnostics and falsifiable hypotheses for future evaluation.</description>

      <title>Fairness-aware design of nudging policies under stochasticity and prejudices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an injustice-aware innovation-diffusion model extending the Generalized Linear Threshold framework by assigning agents activation thresholds drawn from a Beta distribution to capture the stochastic nature of adoption shaped by inequalities. Because incentive policies themselves can inadvertently amplify these inequalities, building on this model, we design a fair Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme that incorporates equality and equity objectives for allocating incentives. Simulations using real mobility-habit data show that injustice reduces overall adoption, while equality smooths incentive distribution and equity reduces disparities in the final outcomes. Thus, incorporating fairness ensures effective diffusion without exacerbating existing social inequalities.</description>

      <title>Observer-based Control of Multi-agent Systems under STL Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a decentralized controller for large-scale heterogeneous multi-agent systems subject to bounded external disturbances, where agents must satisfy Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications requiring cooperation among non-communicating agents. To address the lack of direct communication, we employ a decentralized k-hop Prescribed Performance State Observer (k-hop PPSO) to provide each agent with state estimates of those agents it cannot communicate with. By leveraging the performance bounds on the state estimation errors guaranteed by the k-hop PPSO, we first modify the space robustness of the STL tasks to account for these errors, and then exploit the modified robustness to design a decentralized continuous-time feedback controller that ensures satisfaction of the STL tasks even under worst-case estimation errors. A simulation result is provided to validate the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>UAV Trajectory Optimization via Improved Noisy Deep Q-Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an Improved Noisy Deep Q-Network (Noisy DQN) to enhance the exploration and stability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) when applying deep reinforcement learning in simulated environments. This method enhances the exploration ability by combining the residual NoisyLinear layer with an adaptive noise scheduling mechanism, while improving training stability through smooth loss and soft target network updates. Experiments show that the proposed model achieves faster convergence and up to $+40$ higher rewards compared to standard DQN and quickly reach to the minimum number of steps required for the task 28 in the 15 * 15 grid navigation environment set up. The results show that our comprehensive improvements to the network structure of NoisyNet, exploration control, and training stability contribute to enhancing the efficiency and reliability of deep Q-learning.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Dynamic Average Consensus by Masking Reference Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In multi-agent systems, dynamic average consensus (DAC) is a decentralized estimation strategy in which a set of agents tracks the average of time-varying reference signals. Because DAC requires exchanging state information with neighbors, attackers may gain access to these states and infer private information. In this paper, we develop a privacy-preserving method that protects each agent's reference signal from external eavesdroppers and honest-but-curious agents while achieving the same convergence accuracy and convergence rate as conventional DAC. Our approach masks the reference signals by having each agent draw a random real number for each neighbor, exchanges that number over an encrypted channel at the initialization, and computes a masking value to form a masked reference. Then the agents run the conventional DAC algorithm using the masked references. Convergence and privacy analyses show that the proposed algorithm matches the convergence properties of conventional DAC while preserving the privacy of the reference signals. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed privacy-preserving DAC algorithm.</description>

      <title>GUARDIAN: Safety Filtering for Systems with Perception Models Subject to Adversarial Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety filtering is an effective method for enforcing constraints in safety-critical systems, but existing methods typically assume perfect state information. This limitation is especially problematic for systems that rely on neural network (NN)-based state estimators, which can be highly sensitive to noise and adversarial input perturbations. We address these problems by introducing GUARDIAN: Guaranteed Uncertainty-Aware Reachability Defense against Adversarial INterference, a safety filtering framework that provides formal safety guarantees for systems with NN-based state estimators. At runtime, GUARDIAN uses neural network verification tools to provide guaranteed bounds on the system's state estimate given possible perturbations to its observation. It then uses a modified Hamilton-Jacobi reachability formulation to construct a safety filter that adjusts the nominal control input based on the verified state bounds and safety constraints. The result is an uncertainty-aware filter that ensures safety despite the system's reliance on an NN estimator with noisy, possibly adversarial, input observations. Theoretical analysis and numerical experiments demonstrate that GUARDIAN effectively defends systems against adversarial attacks that would otherwise lead to a violation of safety constraints.</description>

      <title>Banach Control Barrier Functions for Large-Scale Swarm Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the safe control of very large multi-agent systems via a generalized framework that employs so-called Banach Control Barrier Functions (B-CBFs). Modeling a large swarm as probability distribution over a spatial domain, we show how B-CBFs can be used to appropriately capture a variety of macroscopic constraints that can integrate with large-scale swarm objectives. Leveraging this framework, we define stable and filtered gradient flows for large swarms, paying special attention to optimal transport algorithms. Further, we show how to derive agent-level, microscopical algorithms that are consistent with macroscopic counterparts in the large-scale limit. We then identify conditions for which a group of agents can compute a distributed solution that only requires local information from other agents within a communication range. Finally, we showcase the theoretical results over swarm systems in the simulations section.</description>

      <title>PLATO Hand: Shaping Contact Behavior with Fingernails for Precise Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the PLATO Hand, a dexterous robotic hand with a hybrid fingertip that embeds a rigid fingernail within a compliant pulp. This design shapes contact behavior to enable diverse interaction modes across a range of object geometries. We develop a strain-energy-based bending-indentation model to guide the fingertip design and to explain how guided contact preserves local indentation while suppressing global bending. Experimental results show that the proposed robotic hand design demonstrates improved pinching stability, enhanced force observability, and successful execution of edge-sensitive manipulation tasks, including paper singulation, card picking, and orange peeling. Together, these results show that coupling structured contact geometry with a force-motion transparent mechanism provides a principled, physically embodied approach to precise manipulation.</description>

      <title>The Necessity of a Holistic Safety Evaluation Framework for AI-Based Automation Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05157</link>

Abstract: The intersection of Safety of Intended Functionality (SOTIF) and Functional Safety (FuSa) analysis of driving automation features has traditionally excluded Quality Management (QM) components from rigorous safety impact evaluations. While QM components are not typically classified as safety-relevant, recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) integration reveal that such components can contribute to SOTIF-related hazardous risks. Compliance with emerging AI safety standards, such as ISO/PAS 8800, necessitates re-evaluating safety considerations for these components. This paper examines the necessity of conducting holistic safety analysis and risk assessment on AI components, emphasizing their potential to introduce hazards with the capacity to violate risk acceptance criteria when deployed in safety-critical driving systems, particularly in perception algorithms. Using case studies, we demonstrate how deficiencies in AI-driven perception systems can emerge even in QM-classified components, leading to unintended functional behaviors with critical safety implications. By bridging theoretical analysis with practical examples, this paper argues for the adoption of comprehensive FuSa, SOTIF, and AI standards-driven methodologies to identify and mitigate risks in AI components. The findings demonstrate the importance of revising existing safety frameworks to address the evolving challenges posed by AI, ensuring comprehensive safety assurance across all component classifications spanning multiple safety standards.</description>

      <title>A Short and Unified Convergence Analysis of the SAG, SAGA, and IAG Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stochastic variance-reduced algorithms such as Stochastic Average Gradient (SAG) and SAGA, and their deterministic counterparts like the Incremental Aggregated Gradient (IAG) method, have been extensively studied in large-scale machine learning. Despite their popularity, existing analyses for these algorithms are disparate, relying on different proof techniques tailored to each method. Furthermore, the original proof of SAG is known to be notoriously involved, requiring computer-aided analysis. Focusing on finite-sum optimization with smooth and strongly convex objective functions, our main contribution is to develop a single unified convergence analysis that applies to all three algorithms: SAG, SAGA, and IAG. Our analysis features two key steps: (i) establishing a bound on delays due to stochastic sub-sampling using simple concentration tools, and (ii) carefully designing a novel Lyapunov function that accounts for such delays. The resulting proof is short and modular, providing the first high-probability bounds for SAG and SAGA that can be seamlessly extended to non-convex objectives and Markov sampling. As an immediate byproduct of our new analysis technique, we obtain the best known rates for the IAG algorithm, significantly improving upon prior bounds.</description>

      <title>Formal Synthesis of Certifiably Robust Neural Lyapunov-Barrier Certificates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Lyapunov and barrier certificates have recently been used as powerful tools for verifying the safety and stability properties of deep reinforcement learning (RL) controllers. However, existing methods offer guarantees only under fixed ideal unperturbed dynamics, limiting their reliability in real-world applications where dynamics may deviate due to uncertainties. In this work, we study the problem of synthesizing \emph{robust neural Lyapunov barrier certificates} that maintain their guarantees under perturbations in system dynamics. We formally define a robust Lyapunov barrier function and specify sufficient conditions based on Lipschitz continuity that ensure robustness against bounded perturbations. We propose practical training objectives that enforce these conditions via adversarial training, Lipschitz neighborhood bound, and global Lipschitz regularization. We validate our approach in two practically relevant environments, Inverted Pendulum and 2D Docking. The former is a widely studied benchmark, while the latter is a safety-critical task in autonomous systems. We show that our methods significantly improve both certified robustness bounds (up to $4.6$ times) and empirical success rates under strong perturbations (up to $2.4$ times) compared to the baseline. Our results demonstrate effectiveness of training robust neural certificates for safe RL under perturbations in dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Data Driven Structural Decomposition of Dynamic Games via Best Response Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamic games are powerful tools to model multi-agent decision-making, yet computing Nash (generalized Nash) equilibria remains a central challenge in such settings. Complexity arises from tightly coupled optimality conditions, nested optimization structures, and poor numerical conditioning. Existing game-theoretic solvers address these challenges by directly solving the joint game, typically requiring explicit modeling of all agents' objective functions and constraints, while learning-based approaches often decouple interaction through prediction or policy approximation, sacrificing equilibrium consistency. This paper introduces a conceptually novel formulation for dynamic games by restructuring the equilibrium computation. Rather than solving a fully coupled game or decoupling agents through prediction or policy approximation, a data-driven structural reduction of the game is proposed that removes nested optimization layers and derivative coupling by embedding an offline-compiled best-response map as a feasibility constraint. Under standard regularity conditions, when the best-response operator is exact, any converged solution of the reduced problem corresponds to a local open-loop Nash (GNE) equilibrium of the original game; with a learned surrogate, the solution is approximately equilibrium-consistent up to the best-response approximation error. The proposed formulation is supported by mathematical proofs, accompanying a large-scale Monte Carlo study in a two-player open-loop dynamic game motivated by the autonomous racing problem. Comparisons are made against state-of-the-art joint game solvers, and results are reported on solution quality, computational cost, and constraint satisfaction.</description>

      <title>Distributed Model Predictive Control for Energy and Comfort Optimization in Large Buildings Using Piecewise Affine Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The control of large buildings encounters challenges in computational efficiency due to their size and nonlinear components. To address these issues, this paper proposes a Piecewise Affine (PWA)-based distributed scheme for Model Predictive Control (MPC) that optimizes energy and comfort through PWA-based quadratic programming. We utilize the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) for effective decomposition and apply the PWA technique to handle the nonlinear components. To solve the resulting large-scale nonconvex problems, the paper introduces a convex ADMM algorithm that transforms the nonconvex problem into a series of smaller convex problems, significantly enhancing computational efficiency. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the convex ADMM algorithm converges to a local optimum of the original problem. A case study involving 36 zones validates the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our proposed method reduces execution time by 86\% compared to the centralized version.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses robotic system engineering for safety- and mission-critical applications by bridging the gap between high-level objectives and formal, executable specifications. The proposed method, Robotic System Task to Model Transformation Methodology (RSTM2) is an ontology-driven, hierarchical approach using stochastic timed Petri nets with resources, enabling Monte Carlo simulations at mission, system, and subsystem levels. A hypothetical case study demonstrates how the RSTM2 method supports architectural trades, resource allocation, and performance analysis under uncertainty. Ontological concepts further enable explainable AI-based assistants, facilitating fully autonomous specification synthesis. The methodology offers particular benefits to complex multi-robot systems, such as the NASA CADRE mission, representing decentralized, resource-aware, and adaptive autonomous systems of the future.</description>

      <title>Emergence-as-Code for Self-Governing Reliable Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SLO-as-code has made per-service} reliability declarative, but user experience is defined by journeys whose reliability is an emergent property of microservice topology, routing, redundancy, timeouts/fallbacks, shared failure domains, and tail amplification. As a result, journey objectives (e.g., "checkout p99 &lt; 400 ms") are often maintained outside code and drift as the system evolves, forcing teams to either miss user expectations or over-provision and gate releases with ad-hoc heuristics. We propose Emergence-as-Code (EmaC), a vision for making journey reliability computable and governable via intent plus evidence. An EmaC spec declares journey intent (objective, control-flow operators, allowed actions) and binds it to atomic SLOs and telemetry. A runtime inference component consumes operational artifacts (e.g., tracing and traffic configuration) to synthesize a candidate journey model with provenance and confidence. From the last accepted model, the EmaC compiler/controller derives bounded journey SLOs and budgets under explicit correlation assumptions (optimistic independence vs. pessimistic shared fate), and emits control-plane artifacts (burn-rate alerts, rollout gates, action guards) that are reviewable in a Git workflow. An anonymized artifact repository provides a runnable example specification and generated outputs.</description>

      <title>On Path-based Marginal Cost of Heterogeneous Traffic Flow for General Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05565v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Path marginal cost (PMC) is a crucial component in solving path-based system-optimal dynamic traffic assignment (SO-DTA), dynamic origin-destination demand estimation (DODE), and network resilience analysis. However, accurately evaluating PMC in heterogeneous traffic conditions poses significant challenges. Previous studies often focus on homogeneous traffic flow of single vehicle class and do not well address the interactive effect of heterogeneous traffic flows and the resultant computational issues. This study proposes a novel but simple method for approximately evaluating PMC in complex heterogeneous traffic condition. The method decomposes PMC into intra-class and inter-class terms and uses conversion factor derived from heterogeneous link dynamics to explicitly model the intricate relationships between vehicle classes. Additionally, the method considers the non-differentiable issue that arises when mixed traffic flow approaches system optimum conditions. The proposed method is tested on a small corridor network with synthetic demand and a large-scale network with calibrated demand from real-world data. Results demonstrated that our method exhibits superior performance in solving bi-class SO-DTA problems, yielding lower total travel cost and capturing the multi-class flow competition at the system optimum state.</description>

      <title>From Vision to Decision: Neuromorphic Control for Autonomous Navigation and Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic navigation has historically struggled to reconcile reactive, sensor-based control with the decisive capabilities of model-based planners. This duality becomes critical when the absence of a predominant option among goals leads to indecision, challenging reactive systems to break symmetries without computationally-intense planners. We propose a parsimonious neuromorphic control framework that bridges this gap for vision-guided navigation and tracking. Image pixels from an onboard camera are encoded as inputs to dynamic neuronal populations that directly transform visual target excitation into egocentric motion commands. A dynamic bifurcation mechanism resolves indecision by delaying commitment until a critical point induced by the environmental geometry. Inspired by recently proposed mechanistic models of animal cognition and opinion dynamics, the neuromorphic controller provides real-time autonomy with a minimal computational burden, a small number of interpretable parameters, and can be seamlessly integrated with application-specific image processing pipelines. We validate our approach in simulation environments as well as on an experimental quadrotor platform.</description>

      <title>A Hybrid Data-Driven Algorithm for Real-Time Friction Force Estimation in Hydraulic Cylinders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05967v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.</description>

      <title>Normalization of ReLU Dual for Cut Generation in Stochastic Mixed-Integer Programs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.05974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) dual, an existing dual formulation for stochastic programs that reformulates non-anticipativity constraints using ReLU functions to generate tight, non-convex, and mixed-integer representable cuts. While this dual reformulation guarantees convergence with mixed-integer state variables, it admits multiple optimal solutions that can yield weak cuts. To address this issue, we propose normalizing the dual in the extended space to identify solutions that yield stronger cuts. We prove that the resulting normalized cuts are tight and Pareto-optimal in the original state space. We further compare normalization with existing regularization-based approaches for handling dual degeneracy and explain why normalization offers key advantages. In particular, we show that normalization can recover any cut obtained via regularization, whereas the converse does not hold. Computational experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing methods by consistently yielding stronger cuts and reducing solution times on harder instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates stochastic generalized dynamic games with coupling chance constraints, where agents have incomplete information about uncertainties satisfying a concentration of measure property. This problem, in general, is non-convex and NP-hard. To address this, we propose a convex under-approximation by replacing chance constraints with tightened expected-value constraints, yielding a tractable game. We prove the existence of a stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) in this new game and show that its variational SGNE is an $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$-SGNE for the original game, with $\boldsymbol{\varepsilon}$ expressed via the approximation errors and Lagrange multipliers. A semi-decentralized, sampling-based algorithm with time-varying step sizes is developed, requiring no prior knowledge of the uncertainty distribution or expectation evaluations. Unlike existing methods, it avoids step-size tuning based on Lipschitz constants or adaptive rules. Under standard assumptions on the pseudo-gradient, the algorithm converges almost surely to an SGNE.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates maximum likelihood estimation for direct system identification in networks of dynamical systems. We establish that the proposed approach is both consistent and efficient. In addition, it is more generally applicable than existing methods, since it can be employed even when measurements are unavailable for all network nodes, provided that network identifiability is satisfied. Finally, we demonstrate that the maximum likelihood problem can be formulated without relying on a predictor, which is key to achieving computationally efficient numerical solutions.</description>

      <title>A Sliced Learning Framework for Online Disturbance Identification in Quadrotor SO(3) Attitude Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a dimension-decomposed geometric learning framework called Sliced Learning for disturbance identification in quadrotor geometric attitude control. Instead of conventional learning-from-states, this framework adopts a learning-from-error strategy by using the Lie-algebraic error representation as the input feature, enabling axis-wise space decomposition (``slicing") while preserving the SO(3) structure. This is highly consistent with the geometric mechanism of cognitive control observed in neuroscience, where neural systems organize adaptive representations within structured subspaces to enable cognitive flexibility and efficiency. Based on this framework, we develop a lightweight and structurally interpretable Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM) module. The high-dimensional mapping for online identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings (``slices"), implemented by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation within their respective shared subspaces. To enhance interpretability, we prove exponential convergence despite time-varying disturbances and inertia uncertainties. To our knowledge, Sliced Learning is among the first frameworks to demonstrate lightweight online neural adaptation at 400 Hz on resource-constrained microcontroller units (MCUs), such as STM32, with real-world experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Privacy-Preserving Distributed Control for a Networked Battery Energy Storage System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.19345v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing deployment of distributed Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) in modern power grids necessitates effective coordination strategies to ensure state-of-charge (SoC) balancing and accurate power delivery. While distributed control frameworks offer scalability and resilience, they also raise significant privacy concerns due to the need for inter-agent information exchange. This paper presents a novel privacy-preserving distributed control algorithm for SoC balancing in a networked BESS. The proposed framework includes distributed power allocation law that is designed based on two privacy-preserving distributed estimators, one for the average unit state and the other for the average desired power. The average unit state estimator is designed via the state decomposition method without disclosing sensitive internal states. The proposed power allocation law based on these estimators ensures asymptotic SoC balancing and global power delivery while safeguarding agent privacy from external eavesdroppers. The effectiveness and privacy-preserving properties of the proposed control strategy are demonstrated through simulation results.</description>

      <title>Novel Stability Criteria for Discrete and Hybrid Systems via Ramanujan Inner Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a Ramanujan inner product and its corresponding norm, establishing a novel framework for the stability analysis of hybrid and discrete-time systems as an alternative to traditional Euclidean metrics. We establish new $\epsilon$-$\delta$ stability conditions that utilize the unique properties of Ramanujan summations and their relationship with number-theoretic concepts. The proposed approach provides enhanced robustness guarantees and reveals fundamental connections between system stability and arithmetic properties of the system dynamics. Theoretical results are rigorously proven, and simulation results on numerical examples are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Approximating Analytically-Intractable Likelihood Densities with Deterministic Arithmetic for Optimal Particle Filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01023v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Particle filtering algorithms have enabled practical solutions to problems in autonomous robotics (self-driving cars, UAVs, warehouse robots), target tracking, and econometrics, with further applications in speech processing and medicine (patient monitoring). Yet, their inherent weakness at representing the likelihood of the observation (which often leads to particle degeneracy) remains unaddressed for real-time resource-constrained systems. Improvements such as the optimal proposal and auxiliary particle filter mitigate this issue under specific circumstances and with increased computational cost. This work presents a new particle filtering method and its implementation, which enables tunably-approximative representation of arbitrary likelihood densities as program transformations of parametric distributions.Our method leverages a recent computing platform thatcan perform deterministic computation on probability distributionrepresentations (UxHw) without relying on stochastic methods.For non-Gaussian non-linear systems and with an optimal-auxiliary particle filter, we benchmark the likelihood evaluation error and speed for a total of 294840 evaluation points. For such models, the results show that the UxHw method leads to as much as 37.7x speedup compared to the Monte Carlo alternative. For narrow uniform measurement uncertainty, the particle filter falsely assigns zero likelihood as much as 81.89% of the time whereas UxHw achieves 1.52% false-zero rate. The UxHw approach achieves filter RMSE improvement of as much as 18.9% (average 3.3%) over the Monte Carlo alternative.</description>

      <title>Bandit-Based Rate Adaptation for a Single-Server Queue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of obtaining bounded time-average expected queue sizes in a single-queue system with a partial-feedback structure. Time is slotted; in slot $t$ the transmitter chooses a rate $V(t)$ from a continuous interval. Transmission succeeds if and only if $V(t)\le C(t)$, where channel capacities $\{C(t)\}$ and arrivals are i.i.d. draws from fixed but unknown distributions. The transmitter observes only binary acknowledgments (ACK/NACK) indicating success or failure. Let $\varepsilon&gt;0$ denote a sufficiently small lower bound on the slack between the arrival rate and the capacity region. We propose a phased algorithm that progressively refines a discretization of the uncountable infinite rate space and, without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, achieves a $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log^{3.5}(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{3}\big)$ time-average expected queue size uniformly over the horizon. We also prove a converse result showing that for any rate-selection algorithm, regardless of whether $\varepsilon$ is known, there exists an environment in which the worst-case time-average expected queue size is $\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{2})$. Thus, while a gap remains in the setting without knowledge of $\varepsilon$, we show that if $\varepsilon$ is known, a simple single-stage UCB type policy with a fixed discretization of the rate space achieves $\mathcal{O}\!\big(\log(1/\varepsilon)/\varepsilon^{2}\big)$, matching the converse up to logarithmic factors.</description>

      <title>Physical Human-Robot Interaction: A Critical Review of Safety Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper aims to provide a clear and rigorous understanding of commonly recognized safety constraints in physical human-robot interaction, particularly regarding ISO/TS 15066. We investigate the derivation of these constraints, critically examine the underlying assumptions, and evaluate their practical implications for system-level safety and performance in industrially relevant scenarios. Key design parameters within safety-critical control architectures are identified, and numerical examples are provided to quantify performance degradation arising from typical approximations and design decisions in manufacturing environments. Within this analysis, the fundamental role of energy in safety assessment is emphasized, providing focused insights into energy-based safety methodologies for collaborative industrial robot systems.</description>

      <title>Learning to Dial-a-Ride: A Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning Approach to the Electric Dial-a-Ride Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.22052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban mobility systems are transitioning toward electric, on-demand services, creating operational challenges for fleet management under energy and service-quality constraints. The Electric Dial-a-Ride Problem (E-DARP) extends the classical dial-a-ride problem by incorporating limited battery capacity and nonlinear charging dynamics, increasing computational complexity and limiting the scalability of exact methods for real-time use. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning approach based on an edge-centric graph neural network encoder and an attention-driven route construction policy. By operating directly on edge attributes such as travel time and energy consumption, the method captures non-Euclidean, asymmetric, and energy-dependent routing costs in real road networks. The learned policy jointly optimizes routing, charging, and service quality without relying on Euclidean assumptions or handcrafted heuristics. The approach is evaluated on two case studies using ride-sharing data from San Francisco. On benchmark instances, the method achieves solutions within 0.4% of best-known results while reducing computation times by orders of magnitude. A second case study considers large-scale instances with up to 250 request pairs, realistic energy models, and nonlinear charging. On these instances, the learned policy outperforms Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) by 9.5% in solution quality while achieving 100% service completion, with inference times under 10 seconds compared to hours for the metaheuristic. Finally, sensitivity analyses quantify the impact of battery capacity, fleet size, ride-sharing capacity, and reward weights, while robustness experiments show that deterministically trained policies generalize effectively under stochastic conditions.</description>

      <title>ProOPF: Benchmarking and Improving LLMs for Professional-Grade Power Systems Optimization Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03070v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Growing renewable penetration introduces substantial uncertainty into power system operations, necessitating frequent adaptation of dispatch objectives and constraints and challenging expertise-intensive, near-real-time modeling workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for automating this process by translating natural-language (NL) operational requirements into executable optimization models via semantic reasoning and code synthesis. Yet existing LLM datasets and benchmarks for optimization modeling primarily target coarse-grained cross-domain generalization, offering limited, rigorous evaluation in power-system settings, particularly for Optimal Power Flow (OPF). We therefore introduce \textbf{ProOPF-D} and \textbf{ProOPF-B}, a dataset and benchmark for professional-grade OPF modeling: ProOPF-D contains 12K instances pairing NL requests with parameter adjustments and structural extensions to a canonical OPF, together with executable implementations; ProOPF-B provides 121 expert-annotated test cases with ground-truth code, enabling end-to-end evaluation under both concrete and abstract OPF modeling regimes.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Resource Allocation with Karma: An Experimental Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A system of non-tradable credits that flow between individuals like karma, hence proposed under that name, is a mechanism for repeated resource allocation that comes with attractive efficiency and fairness properties, in theory. In this study, we test karma in an online experiment in which human subjects repeatedly compete for a resource with time-varying and stochastic individual preferences or urgency to acquire the resource. We confirm that karma has significant and sustained welfare benefits even in a population with no prior training. We identify mechanism usage in contexts with sporadic high urgency, more so than with frequent moderate urgency, and implemented as a simple (binary) karma bidding scheme as particularly effective for welfare improvements: relatively larger aggregate efficiency gains are realized that are (almost) Pareto superior. These findings provide guidance for further testing and for future implementation plans of such mechanisms in the real world.</description>
