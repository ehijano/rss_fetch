      <title>The NICER view of Scorpius X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Neutron Star X-ray binary Sco X-1 is one of the brightest Z-type sources in our Galaxy, showing frequent periods of flaring activity and different types of relativistic outflows. Observations with RXTE have shown that the strongest X-ray variability appears in the transition from/to the flaring state. During this transition, it has been proposed that two particular types of quasi-periodic oscillations might be connected with the ejection of the so-called ultra-relativistic flows. In this paper, we present an analysis of the first NICER observations of Sco X-1 obtained during a multi-wavelenght campaign conducted in February 2019, in order to characterise the properties of QPOs as the system evolves through its various accretion states. We compute a light-curve and a Hardness-Intensity diagram to track the evolution of the source spectral properties, while we investigate the X-ray time variability with a Dynamical Power Density Spectrum. To trace the temporal evolution of QPOs, we segment the dataset into shorter, continuous intervals, and compute and fit the averaged PDS for each interval. Our analysis shows that the overall behaviour of the source is consistent with the literature; strong QPOs around 6 Hz are detected on the normal branch, while transitions to/from the flaring branch -- occurring over timescales of a few hundreds of seconds -- are characterised by rapid, weaker quasi-periodic variability reaching frequencies up to 15 Hz. Despite limited statistical significance, we also identify faint, transient timing features above 20 Hz, occasionally coexisting with the prominent 6 Hz QPOs. Although tentative, the existence of these features in the NICER data is crucial for interpreting the simultaneous radio observations from the same multi-wavelength campaign, potentially reinforcing the connection between the ejection of relativistic outflows and the accretion states in Sco X-1.</description>

      <title>The impact of kilonova seed photons on GRB VHE emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last few years, an increasing number of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) have been detected with very high energy (VHE) emission in excess of 100 GeV, with a few cases above 1 TeV. In several instances, synchrotron seed photons do not fully explain the emission observed, suggesting the presence of other seed photon sources to up-scatter. In this work, we consider the kilonova as a source of seed photons for up-scattering in the afterglow. We model the kilonova as a thermal source injecting into the back of a GRB fireball, evolved using a shell model, and with the electron and photon populations updated via a kinetic solver. We find that VHE emission from weaker afterglows, such as those found in short GRBs, can be affected by such seed photons, with the kilonova seed photons mitigating the loss of synchrotron photons on the VHE emission when afterglow parameters are varied. We also find that VHE emission in structured jets, due to weaker synchrotron emission at their wings, can also benefit from this supply of seed photons, especially when viewed off-axis. We apply this model to GRB 170817A, and show that its VHE emission is higher than expected in previous models for the first 100 days, though still below the detection threshold.</description>

      <title>Jet Collimation Profile of Low-Luminosity AGN M84: Insight into the Jet Formation in the Low Accretion Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in high-resolution Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) have significantly improved our understanding of jet collimation near supermassive black holes in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), particularly in high-power systems. However, the collimation properties of jets in low-luminosity AGNs (LLAGNs) remain poorly explored. In this study, we investigate the jet structure of M84, a nearby radio galaxy and a representative LLAGN, to probe jet collimation properties in a low-accretion regime. Utilizing astrometric phase-referencing observations from the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), supplemented by archival Very Large Array (VLA) data, we trace the jet geometry of M84 over a broad range of scales, from approximately 10^2 to 10^7 Schwarzschild radii (rs). Our analysis reveals a well-defined transition from a semi-parabolic profile, W(r) proportional to r^0.71, to a conical shape, W(r) proportional to r^1.16, occurring at approximately 1.67 x 10^4 rs. This indicates that the M84 jet is notably less collimated than those in other known LLAGN sources. Our findings provide new insights into the relationship between jet collimation and accretion rate, offering crucial constraints for jet formation models in LLAGNs.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of ultra-high-energy cosmic ray backtracking through sparse local measurements of the Galactic magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planned and ongoing campaigns for the acquisition of high-quality local measurements of the Galactic magnetic field (GMF) at interstellar cloud locations have generated intense interest in the use of such measurements to accurately backtrack Ultra High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECR) through the Milky Way, a crucial aspect of charged-particle astronomy. However, the inherent sparsity of these measurements raises concerns regarding the feasibility of this approach. We assessed the achievable accuracy of UHECR backtracking using mock sparse local GMF data derived from the Jansson &amp; Farrar 2012 (JF12) GMF model and mock UHECR events. We created mock UHECR datasets that trace back within a 3 degree angular range from the galaxy M82 (a hypothesized UHECR source), and we investigated the impact on such backtracking attempts of varying GMF measurement sparsity and of varying GMF strength, which we emulated by rescaling the strength of the ordered components of the JF12 model. We found that: (a) for an average GMF strength of $1\mu G$, satisfactory backtracking results for magnetic rigidities of $10^{20}$ eV can be obtained even with very sparse measurements ($ \sim 1600$ pc); (b) when the average GMF strength is significantly increased ($\sim$ factor of 10) the accuracy of backtracking breaks down at measurement spacings of 400 pc. These findings emphasize on one hand that sparsity is not an automatic deal-breaker for the utility of local GMF measurements in UHECR backtracking. On the other hand, we also confirm that important challenges remain on the path from sparse local GMF measurements to precise charge-particle astronomy, especially in directions of high-strength ordered magnetic fields. This underscores the importance of using all available complementary magnetic field measurements and sophisticated reconstruction techniques to enable accurate backtracking of UHECR.</description>

      <title>SN2022jli modeled with a $^{56}$Ni double-layer and a magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the bolometric evolution of the exceptional Type Ic Supernova (SN) 2022jli, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms responsible for its distinctive double-peaked light curve morphology, extended timescales, and the rapid, steep decline in luminosity observed at around 270 days after the SN discovery. We present a quantitative assessment of two leading models through hydrodynamic radiative simulations: two shells enriched with nickel and a combination of nickel and magnetar power. We explore the parameter space of a model in which the SN is powered by radioactive decay assuming a bimodal nickel distribution. While this setup can reproduce the early light curve properties, it faces problems to explain the prominent second peak. We therefore consider a hybrid scenario with a rapidly rotating magnetar as additional energy source. We find that the observed light curve morphology can be well reproduced by a model combining a magnetar engine and a double-layer $^{56}$Ni distribution. The best-fitting case consist of a magnetar with a spin period of $P\simeq 22$ ms and a bipolar magnetic field strength of $B\simeq 5\times 10^{14}$ G and a radioactive content with total nickel mass of 0.15 M$_\odot$, distributed across two distinct shells within a pre-SN structure of 11 M$_\odot$. To reproduce the abrupt drop in luminosity at $\sim 270$ d, the energy deposition from the magnetar must be rapidly and effectively switched off.</description>

      <title>Rotational Dynamics in Pulsational Pair-Instability Supernovae: Implications for Mass-Loss and Transient Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsational pair-instability supernovae (PPISNe) are transient events occurring in progenitor stars with helium cores of approximately 32-65 solar masses, where rapid electron-positron pair production induces pressure loss, collapse, and pulsations driving episodic mass loss. The number, strength, and duration of these pulses can lead to shell collisions that produce shock-powered transients, potentially explaining some of the most luminous events, such as superluminous supernovae, and other rare transients. Rapid progenitor rotation lowers the PPISN mass threshold and influences the dynamics, energetics, and chemical composition of PPISN-driven pulses. In this study, we computed 1D evolutionary models of massive, rotating PPISN progenitor stars with zero-age main-sequence masses of 85-140 solar masses and solar metallicity and 10% solar metallicity. Our analysis reveals strong correlations between PPISN ejected mass and total energy as well as between ejected mass and peak ejected shell velocity. Additionally, moderate correlations indicate that higher initial PPISN progenitor mass leads to greater mass ejection and energy release, while negative correlations show that rapid rotation appears to reduce mass ejection and kinetic energy of the shells. Subsequent pulses lead to hydrogen-poor, carbon- and oxygen-enriched ejected shells, indicating the effect of rotationally-induced chemical mixing in PPISN-driven episodic mass loss with implications for their transients. We model the light curve and synthetic spectra that arise from the collision of two H-poor shells for one of our models using the radiation transport code SuperLite. We find that shock-heated H-poor PPISN shell collisions from rapidly rotating progenitors can lead to moderately luminous H-poor transients that share some similarities with observed SLSN-I events.</description>

      <title>Image of a time-dependent rotating regular black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a modeling framework based on spatio-temporal generalized random fields to simulate the time-evolving accretion flows and their associated imaging signatures around rotating regular black holes. We extend the Mat\'ern field formalism to the spatio-temporal domain and introduce a locally anisotropic tensor structure \(\Lambda(\mathbf{x})\), which encodes direction-dependent correlation scales motivated by Keplerian velocity fields, thereby generating physically informed perturbation structures. Coupled with a computationally efficient light ray-tracing scheme, this framework produces a sequence of time-resolved images of regular black hole shadow and accretion structures. By incorporating light-travel time effects, we identify significant temporal smearing of features within strongly lensed regions and rapidly varying sources, thus enhancing the physical realism of the modeling. Comparison with existing general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations demonstrates that our stochastic generative model maintains statistical consistency while offering substantial computational efficiency. Moreover, the simulated results reproduce the dynamic positional shift of the bright ring structure observed in M87$^{*}$, providing theoretical support for interpreting its time-variable images.</description>

      <title>From Equipartition to Curvature: The Spectral Evolution of 4FGL Blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21647v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of spectral energy distribution (SED) and underlying electron energy distribution (EED) by modeling the nearly simultaneous broadband spectra of selected bright 4FGL blazars, in the context of a combined cooling and stochastic acceleration scenario. We find that one-zone leptonic model with log-parabolic (LP) EED can successfully fit the GeV-TeV emission of blazars. The synchrotron frequency $\nu_s$ of blazars mainly evolves due to variation of electron peak energy $\gamma_{3p}$. The BL Lac objects (BL Lacs) show a negative trend in the $\nu_s- \nu_s L_s$ SED plane, known as blazar sequence, that does not seem to be an artifact of Doppler boosting, but driven by the equipartition constraints. A positive correlation is found between the derived magnetic field $B$ and electron density $n_e$, whereas $n_e$ and $\gamma_{3p}$ negatively relate, as expected in an equipartition scenario. The flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs) deviate significantly from such a scenario, indicating their jet parameters should be varying independently. The synchrotron peak frequency $\nu_s$ and its spectral curvature $b_s$ negatively correlate for all blazars, confirming the stochastic particle acceleration in blazar jets. However, blazars do not show the signature of hard-sphere acceleration, indicating that magnetic turbulence in the jets might be soft and physical conditions might be near to steady state, consistent with equipartition. Furthermore, for BL Lacs, the SED curvature $b_s$ and the EED curvature $r$ and nearly meet the theoretical relationship $r=5b_s$, whereas the FSRQs show large deviation due to poor constrain on $b_s$ due to presence of thermal component.</description>

      <title>On the orbital variability of gamma-ray emission in $\gamma^2$ Velorum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Colliding wind binaries (CWBs) are promising sources of high-energy gamma-ray emission driven by shock acceleration of particles at wind interaction zones. The nearby CWB system $\gamma^2$ Velorum (WR 11), composed of a Wolf-Rayet (WR) and an O-star, has been recently associated with GeV gamma-ray emission observed by Fermi-LAT, including evidence of orbital variability. This offers a valuable opportunity to test models of phase-dependent hadronic emission and absorption in CWBs. We aim to explain both the spectral energy distribution (SED) and orbital variability of gamma-ray emission from $\gamma^2$ Velorum using a physically motivated phase-dependent hadronic model. We consider the injection of accelerated relativistic protons based on the WR wind's kinetic energy intercepted at the wind collision region (WCR), and calculate the resulting phase-dependent hadronic gamma-ray emission assuming a proton conversion efficiency $\eta_p$ and accounting for energy-dependent diffusion, advection, conical shock interception and the evolution of the effective acceleration volume, assumed to scale with the WCR, with the orbital phase. Gamma-ray emission from hadronic interactions is attenuated by $\gamma$ - $\gamma$ absorption, calculated via full angular integration over both stellar photon fields. Our model successfully reproduces the observed SED and is consistent with the apastron-to-periastron flux ratio, resulting in a dip in emission at periastron passage and an increase during apastron. Our findings support the conclusion that the observed orbital modulation is primarily driven by geometric variations of the WCR. This underscores the significant influence of evolving orbital geometry on the high-energy gamma-ray light curves of $\gamma^2$ Velorum.</description>

      <title>The constraining power of X-ray polarimetry: detailed structure of the intrabinary bow shock in Cygnus X-3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cygnus X-3 is the only known Galactic high-mass X-ray binary with a Wolf-Rayet companion. Recent X-ray polarimetry results with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer have revealed it as a concealed ultraluminous X-ray source. It is also the first source where pronounced orbital variability of X-ray polarization has been detected -- notably with only one polarization maximum per orbit. Polarization caused by scattering of the source X-rays can only be orbitally variable if the scattering angles change throughout the orbit. Since this requires an asymmetrically distributed medium around the compact object, the observed variability traces the intrabinary structures. The single-peaked profile further imposes constraints on the possible geometry of the surrounding medium. Therefore, the X-ray polarization of Cygnus X-3 is the first opportunity to study the wind structures of high-mass X-ray binaries in detail. We aim to uncover the underlying geometry through analytical modeling of the polarized variability. Knowledge of these structures could be extended to other sources with similar wind-binary interactions. We study the variability caused by single scattering in the intrabinary bow shock, exploring both the optically thin and optically thick limits. We consider two geometries of the reflecting medium, the axisymmetric parabolic bow shock and the parabolic cylinder shock, and determine the geometry that best matches the X-ray polarimetric data. We find that the peculiar properties of the data can only be replicated with a cylindrical bow shock with asymmetry across the shock centerline and significant optical depth. This geometry is comparable to shocks formed by the jet-wind or outflow-wind interactions. The position angle of the orbital axis is slightly misaligned from the orientation of the radio jet in all our model fits.</description>

      <title>Magnetic flux transport via reconnection diffusion in different sonic regimes of interstellar MHD turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence and magnetic fields are components of the interstellar medium and are interconnected through plasma processes. In particular, the magnetic flux transport in the presence of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is an essential factor for understanding star formation. The theory of Reconnection Diffusion (RD), based on statistics of Alfv\'enic turbulence, predicts a dependence of the diffusion coefficient of the magnetic field on the Alfv\'enic Mach number $M_A$. However, this theory does not consider the effects of compressibility which are important in the regime of supersonic MHD turbulence. In this work, we measure the diffusion coefficient of magnetic fields in sub-Alfv\'enic MHD turbulence, with different sonic Mach numbers $M_S$. We perform numerical simulations of forced turbulence in periodic domains from the incompressible limit to the supersonic regime. We introduce two methods to extract the diffusion coefficient, based on the analysis of tracer particles. Our results confirm the RD assumption regarding the correspondence between the diffusion of magnetic field and that of fluid Lagrangian particles. The measured diffusion rate provided by incompressible turbulence agrees with the suppression predicted by the RD theory in the presence of strong magnetic fields: $D \propto M_A^3$. Our simulations also indicate an increase in RD efficiency when the turbulence is compressible. The dependency on $M_A$ and $M_S$ from the simulations can be described by the relation $D \propto M_A^\alpha$, where $\alpha(M_S) \approx 3/(1 + M_S)$. This quantitative characterization of $D$ is critical for modeling star formation in turbulent molecular clouds and evaluating the efficiency of this transport compared to other mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Gamma rays as leptonic portals to energetic neutrinos: a new Monte Carlo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High center-of-mass electromagnetic~(EM) interactions could produce decaying heavy leptons and hadrons, leading to neutrino generation. These processes might occur in the most extreme astrophysical scenarios, potentially altering the expected gamma-ray and neutrino fluxes in both the hadronic and the leptonic pictures. For instance, neutrinos could arise from high-redshift EM cascades, triggered by gamma rays beyond $10^{18} \; \text{eV}$ scattering background photons, from radio to ultraviolet energy bands. Such energetic gamma rays are predicted in cosmogenic models and in scenarios involving non-standard physics. On astrophysical scales, leptonic production of neutrinos could take place in active galactic nuclei cores, where several-TeV gamma rays interact with the X-ray photons from the hot corona. We explore these scenarios within the CRPropa Monte Carlo code framework, developing dedicated tools to account for leptonic production and decay of heavy leptons and hadrons. In particular, the latter are performed by interfacing with the PYTHIA event generator. With these novel tools, we characterise the spectrum and flavour composition of neutrinos emerging from cosmological EM cascades and from leptonic processes in the core of active galactic nuclei. Finally, we investigate the leptonic production of neutrinos in the context of the IceCube detection of NGC~1068.</description>

      <title>Reprocessing of the Parkes 70-cm Survey and Discovery of a New Radio Pulsar in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have reprocessed the data archived from the Parkes 70-cm pulsar (PKS70) survey with an expanded DM search range and an acceleration search. Our goal was to detect pulsars that might have been missed in the original survey processing. Of the original 43842 pointings, 34869 pointings were archived, along with 440 additional pointings for confirmation or timing. We processed all of these archived data and detected 359 known pulsars: 265 of these were detected in the original survey, while an additional 94 currently known pulsars were detected in our reprocessing. A few among those 94 pulsars are highly accelerated binary pulsars. Furthermore, we detected 5 more pulsars with DMs higher than the original survey thresholds, as well as 6 more pulsars below the nominal survey sensitivity threshold (from the original survey beams with longer integrations). We missed detection of 33 (of the 298) pulsars detected in the original survey, in part because portions of the survey data were missing in the archive and our early stage candidate sifting method. We discovered one new pulsar in the re-analysis, PSR J0540$-$69 which has a spin period of 0.909 s and resides in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). This new pulsar appeared in three PKS70 beams and one additional L-band observation that targeted the LMC pulsar PSR B0540$-$69. The numerous pulsar detections found in our re-analysis and the discovery of a new pulsar in the LMC highlight the value of conducting multiple searches through pulsar datasets.</description>

      <title>Does magnetic field promote or suppress fragmentation in AGN disks? Results from local shearing box simulations with simple cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion disks in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are predicted to become gravitationally unstable substantially interior to the black hole's sphere of influence, at radii where the disk is simultaneously unstable to the magnetorotational instability (MRI). Using local shearing box simulations with net vertical flux and a simple cooling prescription, we investigate the effect of magnetic fields on fragmentation in the limit of ideal magnetohydrodyamics. Different levels of in-disk magnetic field from the magnetorotational instability are generated by varying the initial vertical-field plasma beta $\beta_0$. We find that the disk becomes magnetically dominated when $\beta_0 &lt; 10^3$, and that this transition is accompanied by a drastic drop in fragmentation (as measured by the bound mass fraction) and gravitational stress. The destabilizing influence of radial magnetic fields, which are present locally and which may promote fragmentation via magnetic tension effects, is overwhelmed by magnetic elevation, which significantly reduces the mid-plane density. The magnetic suppression of fragmentation in magnetically elevated disks has implications for the radial extent of the accretion flow in AGN disks, and for the efficiency of in situ formation of disk-embedded stars that are progenitors for single and binary compact objects.</description>

      <title>Probing ALP-Photon Mixing with High-Resolution X-ray Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALPs) provide a compelling avenue for exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. In astrophysical magnetized plasmas an ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ induces energy-dependent oscillations in the photon survival probability that imprint modulations on emission spectra. X-ray observations of bright spectrally-smooth sources can provide particularly sensitive probes of ultralight ALPs with masses $m_a \lesssim 10^{-11}$ eV due to long propagation distances, strong magnetic fields and high photon statistics. We present a comprehensive forecast of ALP-photon conversion in three representative systems: (i) background active galactic nuclei (AGNs) observed through foreground intracluster magnetic fields, (ii) central AGNs within their host cluster halos and (iii) Galactic X-ray binaries viewed through the Milky Way field. Using detailed simulations we assess the prospective sensitivity of high-resolution X-ray missions including XRISM, Athena, and Arcus. For typical magnetic field configurations a 5 Ms XRISM observation of the Perseus Cluster AGN NGC 1275 can reach down to $g_{a\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ at $m_a \lesssim 10^{-12}$ eV, while Athena's superior energy resolution improves this reach by a factor of $\sim 3$. We quantify the impact of magnetic field modeling, photon statistics, and spectral binning strategies. Our results demonstrate the scientific potential of high-resolution X-ray observations to probe photon-ALP coupling in previously inaccessible parameter space, offering a powerful window into physics beyond the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>On the formation of strange quark stars from supernova in compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strange quark stars (SQSs), namely compact stars entirely composed of deconfined quark matter, are characterized by similar masses and compactness to neutron stars (NSs) and have been theoretically proposed to exist in the Universe since the 1970s. However, multiwavelength observations of compact stars in the last 50 years have not yet led to an unambiguous SQS identification. This article explores whether SQSs could form in the supernova (SN) explosion of an evolved star (e.g., carbon-oxygen, or Wolf-Rayet) occurring in a binary with the companion being a neutron star (NS). The collapse of the iron core of the evolved star generates a newborn NS and the SN explosion. Part of the ejected matter accretes onto the NS companion as well as onto the newborn NS via matter fallback. The accretion occurs at hypercritical (highly super-Eddington) rates, transferring mass and angular momentum to the stars. We present numerical simulations of this scenario and demonstrate that the density increase in the NS interiors during the accretion process may induce quark matter deconfinement, suggesting the possibility of SQS formation. We discuss the astrophysical conditions under which such a transformation may occur and possible consequences.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking of Geant4 simulations for the COSI Anticoincidence System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Compton Spectrometer and Imager (COSI) is an upcoming NASA Small Explorer satellite mission, designed for all-sky observations in the soft gamma-ray domain with the use of germanium detectors (GeDs). An active Anticoincidence System (ACS) of BGO scintillators surrounds the GeDs to reduce the background and contribute to the detection of transient events. Accurately modeling the ACS performance requires simulating the intricate scintillation processes within the shields, which significantly increases the computational cost. We have encoded these effects into a correction matrix derived from dedicated Geant4 simulations with the inclusion of the optical physics. For this purpose, we use laboratory measurements for the energy and spatial response of the ACS lateral wall to benchmark the simulation and define instrument parameters, including the BGO absorption length and the electronic noise. We demonstrate that the simulations replicate the experimental energy resolution and light collection uniformity along the BGO crystal, with maximum discrepancies of 20% and 10%, respectively. The validated simulations are then used to develop the correction matrix for the lateral wall, accounting for the light collection efficiency and energy resolution based on the position within the crystal. The gamma-ray quantum detection efficiency is also position-dependent via the inclusion of the optical physics. It is enhanced by $\sim$8% close to the SiPMs and suppressed by $\sim$2% in the adjacent corners with respect to the average value. Finally, we explore the energy threshold and resolution of the bottom ACS, considering the impact of its smaller crystals compared with the lateral walls.</description>

      <title>Interpreting the KM3-230213A PeV Neutrino Event via Vector Dark Matter Decay and Its Multi-Messenger Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21534v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The KM3NeT Collaboration recently reported the detection of an ultra-high-energy neutrino event KM3-230213A with a reconstructed energy of $220^{+570}_{-110}$ PeV, the most energetic astrophysical neutrino ever detected. The absence of convincing electromagnetic counterparts motivates exploration of exotic origins beyond standard astrophysical processes. We present a vector dark matter model based on a new $U(1)_X$ gauge symmetry to interpret this event through superheavy dark matter decay. Our analysis demonstrates that dark matter lifetimes in the range $7.3 \times 10^{28}$ to $2.9 \times 10^{30}$ s can successfully account for the KM3-230213A event while satisfying stringent constraints from gamma-ray observations. Moreover, the spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_X$ in our model naturally predicts cosmic string formation, generating a stochastic gravitational wave background with string tension $4.5 \times 10^{-11} \lesssim G\mu \lesssim 1.2 \times 10^{-10}$, consistent with recent pulsar timing array observations. This multi-messenger consistency across neutrinos, gamma-rays, and gravitational waves validates our vector dark matter interpretation of the KM3-230213A event while providing testable predictions for upcoming multi-wavelength experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing missing physics from inspiralling compact binaries via time-frequency tracks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The orbital evolution of binary black hole (BBH) systems is determined by the component masses and spins of the black holes and the governing gravity theory. Gravitational wave (GW) signals from the evolution of BBH orbits offer an unparalleled opportunity for examining the predictions of General Relativity (GR) and for searching for missing physics in the current waveform models. We present a method of stacking up the time-frequency pixel energies through the orbital frequency evolution with the flexibility of gradually shifting the orbital frequency curve along the frequency axis. We observe a distinct energy peak corresponding to the GW signal's quadrupole mode. If an alternative theory of gravity is considered and the analysis of the BBH orbital evolution is executed following GR, the energy distribution on the time-frequency plane will be significantly different. We propose a new consistency test to check whether our theoretical waveform explains the BBH orbital evolution. Through the numerical simulation of beyond-GR theory of gravity and utilizing the framework of second-generation interferometers, we demonstrate the efficiency of this new method in detecting any possible departure from GR. Finally, when applied to an eccentric BBH system and GW190814, which shows the signatures of higher-order multipoles, our method provides an exquisite probe of missing physics in the GR waveform models.</description>

      <title>Bondi accretion disk luminosity around neutral and charged Simpson-Visser spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate relativistic Bondi accretion in the Simpson-Visser spacetime, which, via a single parameter $\ell$, interpolates between the Schwarzschild, regular black hole, extremal and wormhole regimes. First, we analyze the neutral Simpson-Visser geometry, recovering Schwarzschild at $\ell=0$, and then its charged extension of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric. In both these cases, we derive the conservation equations and analyze two representative fluid models: a barotropic perfect fluid and a constituent with an exponential density profile. By varying the parameters across regimes, we locate critical (sonic) points and integrate velocity, density and pressure profiles. While near-horizon inflow velocities are similar across the different solutions, we find that the critical radius and the resulting accretion rates and luminosities severely change, depending on the value of the parameter and type of fluid. Remarkably, the barotropic and exponential cases exhibit different trends in the outer regions. Moreover, by extending the analysis to the charged SV spacetime, we find that the presence of a central charge $Q$ produces additional, albeit modest, shifts in the sonic radius which, in combination with those induced by the regularization parameter $\ell$, could provide a double observational marker. In particular, while $\ell$ acts predominantly on the position of the critical point, in the barotropic fluid case, the electromagnetic contribution of $Q$ slightly dampens the inflow velocity near the horizon.</description>

      <title>Continuum Reverberation Mapping of Accretion Disks Surrounding Supermassive Black Hole Binaries: Observational Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has remained challenging to reliably identify sub-parsec supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs), despite them being expected to be ubiquitous. We propose a new method using multi-band continuum reverberation mapping to identify low-mass-ratio SMBHBs in active galactic nuclei. The basic principle is that, due to the presence of a low-density cavity between the mini-disks and the circumbinary disk, the continuum emissions show a deficit at certain wavelengths, leading to a distinguishing feature in the relation between the inter-band time lag and wavelengths $\tau(\lambda)$. Specifically, the relation appears flat at short wavelengths because of the truncated sizes of the mini-disks and transits to a power law $\lambda^{4/3}$ at long wavelength stemming from the circumbinary disk. This transition feature is distinct from the uniform relation $\lambda^{4/3}$ of the standard accretion disk around a single black hole. Using the lamp-post scenario and assuming that only the secondary black hole is active in a low-mass-ratio SMBHB, we design a simple continuum reverberation model to calculate the transfer function of the accretion disks and the resulting $\tau(\lambda)$ relations for various SMBHB orbital parameters. The transition wavelength typically can lie at UV/optical bands, mainly depending on the total mass and orbital separation of the SMBHB. We apply our SMBHB model to the intensive multiwavelength monitoring data of the SMBHB candidate PG1302-102 and find that the SMBHB model can reproduce the inter-band time lags. Remarkably, the inferred total mass and orbital period from the SMBHB fitting are consistent with values derived from other independent methods.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational wave observations have recently revealed with high significance, and high precision, the existence of $\mathcal{O}(100) \, M_\odot$ rapidly rotating black holes, allowing gravitational wave events to be used for the first time to probe unexplored axion parameter space using the phenomenon known as black hole superradiance. Here, we present new limits on axions using the binary black hole merger event GW231123, whose constituent black holes are among the fastest spinning observed with gravitational waves to date. We demonstrate that the most viable binary formation channels lead to conservative constraints on axion masses $\mu \sim [0.6-5] \times \, 10^{-13}$ eV and decay constants $f_\Phi \gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, extending existing superradiance constraints derived using x-ray observations to yet lower axion masses.</description>

      <title>Tidal heating in detached double white dwarf binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short--period ($P&lt;$1 hr orbits) detached double white dwarf binary (DWDB) components identified with transient surveys (e.g. SDSS, ZTF) have hot surface temperatures ($&gt;$10,000 K) and observed radii a factor two larger than completely degenerate white dwarfs. We formulate tidal heating in helium composition extremely low mass white dwarf (ELM WD) components of detached DWDBs which reach mass transfer within a Hubble time. We combine a mass radius relation which varies with surface temperature and the tidal friction model of Hut 1981, where the additional orbital energy loss from tidal friction is accounted for by increases in the primary surface temperature, and hence increasing radius. Applying this heating model to the current sample of binaries with ZTF, we predict temperature increases from the present day of up to $\sim$40\% before the onset of mass transfer. We find that helium white dwarfs are generically hot and large at the onset of mass transfer, even for the oldest DWDBs whose components can cool to be degenerate by the present day. In the population of Galactic DWDBs, we find that the onset of mass transfer should occur at orbital periods as long as 1000s (17 minutes), or binary gravitational wave frequency of 2 mHz. This is over three times longer than periods expected for degenerate WD (5 minutes). Since mass transferring DWDBs are progenitors for a variety of transients and stellar populations e.g. RCrB stars, AM CVn binaries, type .Ia supernova, the finite temperature of donor white dwarfs should be taken into account.</description>

      <title>Chromo: A High-Performance Python Interface to Hadronic Event Generators for Collider and Cosmic-Ray Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations of hadronic and nuclear interactions are essential in both collider and astroparticle physics. The Chromo package provides a unified Python interface to multiple widely used hadronic event generators, including EPOS, DPMJet, Sibyll, QGSJet, and Pythia. Built on top of their original Fortran and C++ implementations, Chromo offers a zero-overhead abstraction layer suitable for use in Python scripts, Jupyter notebooks, or from the command line, while preserving the performance of direct calls to the generators. It is easy to install via precompiled binary wheels distributed through PyPI, and it integrates well with the Scientific Python ecosystem. Chromo supports event export in HepMC, ROOT, and SVG formats and provides a consistent interface for inspecting, filtering, and modifying particle collision events. This paper describes the architecture, typical use cases, and performance characteristics of Chromo and its role in contemporary astroparticle simulations, such as in the MCEq cascade solver.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots as self-gravitating discs accreting on supermassive stars: Spectral appearance and formation pathway of the progenitors to direct collapse black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an alternative physical interpretation and formation pathway for the recently discovered "little red dots" (LRDs). We model LRDs as super-massive stars (SMSs) surrounded by massive self-gravitating accretion discs (SMDs) that form as a consequence of gas-rich major galaxy mergers. The model provides an excellent match for numerous spectral features of LRDs, where the V-shape arises from the superposition of two black bodies, and Balmer line broadening is sourced by the intrinsic rotation of the SMD. No additional AGN, stellar wind, dust obscuration or galactic component is required. This results in a model with uniquely few, physically motivated free parameters that are robust to variations in observed LRD properties. We perform MCMC fits for two representative LRD spectra, for which the full parameter posterior distributions are determined. Allowing for a compressed SMS mass-radius relation, the recovered parameters are compatible with sub-Eddington accretion in self-gravitating discs, and the recovered SMS masses of few $ 10^6$ M$_{\odot}$ imply the subsequent formation of massive black holes (BH) that squarely follow the expected BH mass--galaxy mass relation. In addition, the model implies a redshift distribution for LRDs that accurately matches with observations.</description>

      <title>Accretion dynamics in black holes with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22031</link>

Abstract: We investigate the spherical accretion of various types of fluids onto a Schwarzschild-like black hole solution modified by a Kalb-Ramond field implementing spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation (LV). The system is analyzed for isothermal fluids characterized by the equation of state $p=\omega\rho$, including ultra-stiff, ultra-relativistic, and radiation fluids. We investigate the effect of the LV parameter $l$ on the fluid density $\rho(r)$, radial velocity $u(r)$, and accretion rate $\dot{M}$. Using a Hamiltonian dynamical systems approach, we examine the behavior near critical points and identify the sonic transitions in each scenario. Our results show that the LV parameter influences the location of critical points, the flow structure, and the accretion rate, with $l&gt;0$ ($l&lt;0$) enhancing (suppressing) the latter. For ultra-stiff fluids, no critical points are found, and the flow remains entirely subsonic. For ultra-relativistic and radiation fluids, transonic solutions exist, with the position of the sonic point depending on the sign of $l$. We also analyze polytropic fluids $p=\mathcal{K} \rho^{\Gamma}$ with $\Gamma=5/3$ and $\Gamma=4/3$, observing similar qualitative behavior, where the sonic transition is affected by both the equation of state and the LV parameter. These findings suggest that Lorentz symmetry breaking can significantly alter accretion dynamics in black hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Radio Pulsar Emission-Beam Geometry at Low Frequency: LOFAR High Band Survey Sources Studied using Arecibo at 1.4 GHz and 327 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15209v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper continues our study of radio pulsar emission-beam configurations with the primary intent of extending study to the lowest possible frequencies. Here we focus on a group of 133 more recently discovered pulsars, most of which were included in the (100-200 MHz) LOFAR High Band Survey, observed with Arecibo at 1.4 GHz and 327 MHz, and some observed at decameter wavelengths. Our analysis framework is the core/double-cone beam model, and we took opportunity to apply it as widely as possible, both conceptually and quantitatively, while highlighting situations where modeling is difficult, or where its premises may be violated. In the great majority of pulsars, beam forms consistent with the core/double-cone model were identified. Moreover, we found that each pulsar's beam structure remained largely constant over the frequency range available; where profile variations were observed, they were attributable to different component spectra and in some instances to varying conal beam sizes. As an Arecibo population, many or most of the objects tend to fall in the Galactic anticenter region and/or at high Galactic latitudes, so overall it includes a number of nearer, older pulsars. We found a number of interesting or unusual characteristics in some of the pulsars that would benefit from additional study. The scattering levels encountered for this group are low to moderate, apart from a few pulsars lying in directions more toward the inner Galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Sea of Black Holes: Characterizing the LISA Signature for Stellar-Origin Black Hole Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21161v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Observations by the LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA (LVK) detectors have provided new insights in the demographics of stellar-origin black hole binaries (sBHB). A few years before gravitational-wave signals from sBHB mergers are recorded in the LVK detectors, their early coalescence will leave a unique signature in the ESA/NASA mission Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Multiband observations of sBHB sources between LISA and LVK detectors opens an unprecedented opportunity to investigate the astrophysical environment and multi-messenger early-alerts. In this study, we report the sBHB sources that will be present in the LISA data derived directly from the hydrodynamic cosmological simulation Illustris. By surveying snapshots across cosmological volume, metallicity and look-back time, we find that about tens to thousand sBHB candidates will be present in the LISA data for various combinations of mission lifetime. For estimates consistent with the LVK rates, we find that only 20 sBHBs across Illustris snapshots will be detected with significant confidence for a 10-year LISA mission, while a 4-year LISA mission would detect only 2 sBHBs. Our work paves the way for creating LISA mock data and bench marking LISA detection pipelines directly using cosmological simulations.</description>

      <title>Observation of Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy in the Southern Hemisphere with 12 yr of Data Collected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05046v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyzed the 7.92$\times 10^{11}$ cosmic-ray-induced muon events collected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory from May 13, 2011, when the fully constructed experiment started to take data, to May 12, 2023. This dataset provides an up-to-date cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution in the Southern Hemisphere with unprecedented statistical accuracy covering more than a full period length of a solar cycle. Improvements in Monte Carlo event simulation and better handling of year-to-year differences in data processing significantly reduce systematic uncertainties below the level of statistical fluctuations compared to the previously published results. We confirm the observation of a change in the angular structure of the cosmic-ray anisotropy between 10 TeV and 1 PeV, more specifically in the 100-300 TeV energy range.</description>

      <title>Spectro-polarimetry of GRB 180427A: evidence for distinct emission sites with varying polarisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dynamics of the origin of gamma-ray emissions in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) remains an enigma. Through a joint analysis of GRB 180427A, observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope and AstroSat's Cadmium Zinc Telluride Imager, we identify emissions from two distinct regions with varying polarisation properties. Time-resolved polarisation analysis reveals a synchronous evolution of the polarisation angle (PA) and fraction (PF) with two emission pulses, peaking with a delay of $ 5.09 \pm 0.29\, \mathrm{s}$. Spectral analysis indicates that the first pulse is characterised by a stronger blackbody component, while the second pulse exhibits a more prominent non-thermal spectrum (power law with an exponential cutoff). Using a bottom-to-top approach through simulations, we decouple the polarisation properties of the individual spectral components, revealing polarisation fractions of 25\% - 40\% for the blackbody spectrum and 30\% - 60\% for the non-thermal spectrum. At a redshift of $z \sim 0.22$, the blackbody emission originates from the jet photosphere at $\sim$ a few $10^{11}\, \mathrm{cm}$, whereas the non-thermal emission arises from an optically thin region at a few $10^{13}\, \mathrm{cm}$. The changing dominance of these emissions explains the observed PA shift of $60^\circ \pm 22^\circ$. The spectral cutoff at 1 MeV suggests pair opacity due to the jet's relatively lower bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma \sim$ a few tens). The high polarisation fraction and hard low energy spectral slopes ($\alpha &gt; -0.5$) imply a top-hat jet structure observed off-axis, near the jet's edge. This off-axis viewing introduces anisotropy in the observed radiation within the viewing cone ($1/\Gamma$), accounting for the observed polarisation.</description>

      <title>Exploring the evolution of gravitational-wave emitters with efficient emulation: Constraining the origins of binary black holes using normalising flows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03819v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary population synthesis simulations allow detailed modelling of gravitational-wave sources from a variety of formation channels. These population models can be compared to the observed catalogue of merging binaries to infer the uncertain astrophysical input parameters describing binary formation and evolution, as well as relative rates between various formation pathways. However, it is computationally infeasible to run population synthesis simulations for all variations of uncertain input physics. We demonstrate the use of normalising flows to emulate population synthesis results and interpolate between astrophysical input parameters. Using current gravitational-wave observations of binary black holes, we use our trained normalising flows to infer branching ratios between multiple formation channels, and simultaneously infer common-envelope efficiency and natal spins across a continuous parameter range. Given our set of formation channel models, we infer the natal spin to be $0.04^{+0.04}_{-0.01}$, and the common-envelope efficiency to be $&gt;3.7$ at 90% credibility, with the majority of underlying mergers coming from the common-envelope channel. Our framework allows us to measure population synthesis inputs where we do not have simulations, and better constrain the astrophysics underlying current gravitational-wave populations.</description>

      <title>Observing radio transients with Phased ALMA: Pulses from the Galactic Centre magnetar</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06234v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio transients, such as pulsars and Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), are primarily detected at centimetre radio wavelengths, where higher luminosities are found. However, observations of sources in dense environments are heavily affected by propagation effects which may hinder a detection. Millimetre wave observations bypass this complication but require the largest radio telescopes to compensate for the lower flux densities. When used in phased mode, the ALMA radio telescope provides an equivalent dish size of 84m, being the most sensitive instrument at mm/sub mm. With its high time resolution it offers a unique opportunity to study radio transients in an unexplored window. We study the Galactic Centre (GC) magnetar, PSR J1745$-$2900, as a laboratory for magnetars in complex magneto-turbulent environments and to link with FRBs. We showcase the potential of ALMA in phased mode to observe radio transients and to achieve, for some sources, the first ever detections outside the cm wave range. We studied the GC magnetar using ALMA archival data of Sgr A* at Band 3 from the 2017 GMVA campaign. We searched in intensity and classified the pulses based on their circular and linear polarisation properties and arrival phase. We detected eight pulses with energies in the range of 10$^{29}$ erg. We constructed its cumulative energy distribution and we fit a power law, where the event rate scales with energy as $R \propto E^{\gamma}$. The result is an exponent of $\gamma = -2.4 \pm 0.1$. With the $\gamma -$value and the system properties of phased ALMA, we estimate that over 160 known pulsars could be detected by ALMA. For repeating FRBs, observing during their peak activity window could lead to several detections. We expect that ALMA's lower frequency bands with polarisation capabilities, will serve as a pioneer on mm wave searches for pulsars and to study complex environments involving radio transients.</description>

      <title>Energy-dependent gamma-ray morphology estimation tool in Gammapy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An understanding of the energy dependence of gamma-ray sources can yield important information on the underlying emission mechanisms. However, despite the detection of energy-dependent morphologies in many TeV sources, we lack a proper quantification of such measurements. We introduce an estimation tool within the Gammapy landscape, an open-source Python package for the analysis of gamma-ray data, for quantifying the energy-dependent morphology of a gamma-ray source. The proposed method fits the spatial morphology in a global fit across all energy slices (null hypothesis) and compares this to separate fits for each energy slice (alternative hypothesis). These are modelled using forward-folding methods, and the significance of the variability is quantified by comparing the test statistics of the two hypotheses. We present a general tool for probing changes in the spatial morphology with energy, employing a full forward-folding approach with a 3D likelihood. We present its usage on a real dataset from H.E.S.S. and on a simulated dataset to quantify the significance of the energy dependence for sources of different sizes. In the first example, which utilises a subset of data from HESSJ1825-137, we observe extended emission at lower energies that becomes more compact at higher energies. The tool indicates a very significant variability (9.8{\sigma}) in the case of the largely extended emission. In the second example, a source with a smaller extent (~0.1{\deg}), simulated using the CTAO response, shows the tool can still provide a statistically significant variation (9.7{\sigma}) on small scales.</description>

Abstract: New limits on the axion-nucleon coupling over the axion mass region $10^{-24} \leq m_a \leq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ eV are derived by reanalyzing data from laboratory measurements on Lorentz and $CPT$ violation. These results establish the first laboratory constraints on the axion-nucleon coupling for axion masses below $10^{-22}$ eV. For $10^{-22} \leq m_a \leq 5 \times 10^{-21}$ eV, the results improve upon previous laboratory limits by more than 3 orders of magnitude, exceeding for the first time the astrophysical limits from supernova SN1987A cooling. For the axion mass range of interest corresponding to ultralow frequencies, the crucial local phase of the axion field is considered. Furthermore, the obtained limits are nearly equivalent to those projected for a recently proposed experiment employing high-intensity neutron beams at the European Spallation Source. For an alternative type of axion-nucleon interaction, the quadratic wind coupling, the constraints exceed the current best results by approximately 2 orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Mapping Parameter Correlations in Spinning Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>

Abstract: The spins of binary black holes measured with gravitational waves provide insights about the formation, evolution, and dynamics of these systems. However, interpreting these measurements-especially for heavy black holes-remains an open problem.While the imprint of spin during the inspiral phase, where the black holes are well-separated, is understood through analytic descriptions of the dynamics, no such expressions exist for the merger. Though numerical relativity simulations provide an exact solution (to within numerical error), the imprint of the full six spin degrees of freedom on the signal is not transparent. In the absence of analytic expressions for the merger and to advance our ability to interpret massive binary black hole spin measurements, here we propose a waveform-based approach. Leveraging a neural network to efficiently calculate mismatches between waveforms, we identify regions in the parameter space of spins and mass ratio that result in low mismatches and thus similar waveforms. We map these regions with a Gaussian fit, thus identifying correlations and quantifying their strength. For low-mass, inspiral-dominated systems, we recover the known physical imprint: larger aligned spins are correlated with more equal masses as they have opposite effects on the inspiral length. For high-mass, merger-dominated signals, a qualitatively similar correlation is present, though its shape is altered and strength decreases with larger total mass. Correlations between in-plane spins and mass ratio follow a similar trend, with their shape and strength altered as the mass increases. Our new methodology of waveform-based correlation mapping provides a first step toward systematically modeling spin effects in merger-dominated signals across the full intrinsic parameter-space and motivates future effective spin parameters beyond the reach of analytic methods.</description>

      <title>Optimal Follow-Up of Gravitational-Wave Events with the UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17560v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The UltraViolet EXplorer (UVEX) is a wide-field ultraviolet space telescope selected as a NASA Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) mission for launch in 2030. UVEX will undertake deep, cadenced surveys of the entire sky to probe low mass galaxies and explore the ultraviolet (UV) time-domain sky, and it will carry the first rapidly deployable UV spectroscopic capability for a broad range of science applications. One of UVEX's prime objectives is to follow up gravitational wave (GW) binary neutron star mergers as targets of opportunity (ToOs), rapidly scanning across their localization regions to search for their kilonova (KN) counterparts. Early-time multiband ultraviolet light curves of KNe are key to explaining the interplay between jet and ejecta in binary neutron star mergers. Owing to high Galactic extinction in the ultraviolet and the variation of GW distance estimates over the sky, the sensitivity to kilonovae can vary significantly across the GW localization and even across the footprint of a single image given UVEX's large field of view. Good ToO observing strategies to trade off between area and depth are neither simple nor obvious. We present an optimal strategy for GW follow-up with UVEX in which exposure time is adjusted dynamically for each field individually to maximize the overall probability of detection. We model the scheduling problem using the expressive and powerful mathematical framework of mixed integer linear programming (MILP), and employ a state-of-the-art MILP solver to automatically generate observing plan timelines that achieve high probabilities of kilonova detection. We have implemented this strategy in an open-source astronomical scheduling software package called the Multi-Mission Multi-Messenger Observation Planning Toolkit, on GitHub at https://github.com/m4opt/m4opt.</description>

      <title>Detecting Supernova Axions with IAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of IAXO and its intermediate version, BabyIAXO, to detect axions produced in core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Our study demonstrates that these experiments have realistic chances of identifying SN axions, offering crucial insights into both axion physics and SN dynamics. IAXO's sensitivity to SN axions allows for the exploration of regions of the axion parameter space inaccessible through solar observations. In addition, in the event of a nearby SN, $d \sim O(100)$ pc, and sufficiently large axion couplings, $g_{a \gamma} \gtrsim 10^{-11} GeV^{-1}$, IAXO could have a chance to significantly advance our understanding of axion production in nuclear matter and provide valuable information about the physics of SNe, such as pion abundance, the equation of state, and other nuclear processes occurring in extreme environments.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Gas Density, Velocity, and Magnetic Fields in Cool-Core Galaxy Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding turbulence within the Intracluster Medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters is pivotal for comprehending their evolution and dynamics. Employing 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of galaxy cluster mergers, we examine the statistical properties of gas density, magnetic fields, and velocity, particularly emphasizing the central regions spanning 400 kpc. The simulations are designed to resemble massive cool-core clusters such as Perseus, while varying the initial plasma $\beta$ values (100, 200, and 500). Our findings indicate that while the statistical histogram distributions of gas density and velocity appear similar across different $\beta$ scenarios, their spatial distributions and morphological patterns exhibit noticeable differences. Through the application of the second-order structure function, we identified a scaling relation in velocity fluctuations, characterized by a slope of 1/2 and predominantly dominated by solenoidal components. Furthermore, our analysis reveals a pronounced anisotropy in both velocity and magnetic field fluctuations, with more significant fluctuations along the direction perpendicular to the magnetic fields. This anisotropy is scale-dependent, becoming more pronounced at smaller scales, and exhibits a decreasing trend in scenarios where the magnetic field is relatively weak, particularly at $\beta=500$. This suggests that the anisotropic nature of these fluctuations is predominantly regulated by the magnetic fields. Additionally, we test the efficacy of the Synchrotron Intensity Gradient (SIG) method for tracing magnetic fields in these environments. The SIG shows a global agreement with the magnetic field across all three $\beta$ scenarios, confirming the SIG's insensitivity to the medium's magnetization level.</description>

      <title>Chandra Rules Out Super-Eddington Accretion Models For Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09669v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the most puzzling discoveries by JWST is the population of high-redshift, red, and compact galaxies dubbed little red dots (LRDs). Based on broad-line diagnostics, these galaxies have been argued to host accreting $10^7-10^8$ M$_\odot$ supermassive black holes (SMBHs), a claim with crucial consequences for our understanding of how the first black holes form and grow over cosmic time. A key feature of LRDs is their extreme X-ray weakness: analyses of individual and stacked sources have yielded non-detections or only tentative, inconclusive X-ray signals, except for a handful of individual cases. Although high obscuration is the most straightforward way to explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, JWST rest-frame optical/UV spectra initially argued against the presence of Compton-thick gas clouds. Instead, several authors have proposed that LRDs are intrinsically X-ray weak due to super-Eddington accretion rates. In this work, we observationally test these tailored models by stacking X-ray data for 55 LRDs in the Chandra Deep Field South, accumulating a total exposure time of nearly 400 Ms. Despite reaching unprecedented X-ray depths, our stack still yields a non-detection. The corresponding upper limits are deep enough to rule out current super-Eddington accretion models, and are compatible only with extremely high levels of obscuration ($N_{\rm H}\gtrsim10^{25}$ cm$^{-2}$). To explain the X-ray weakness of LRDs, we therefore speculate that the SMBHs in these systems are neither as massive nor as luminous as currently believed.</description>

      <title>dot-PE: Sampler-free gravitational wave inference using matrix multiplication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parameter estimation (PE) for compact binary coalescence (CBC) events observed by gravitational wave (GW) laser interferometers is a core task in GW astrophysics. We present a method to compute the posterior distribution efficiently without relying on stochastic samplers. First, we show how to select sets of intrinsic and extrinsic parameters that efficiently cover the relevant phase space. We then show how to compute the likelihood for all combinations of these parameters using dot products. We describe how to assess and tune the integration accuracy, making the outcome predictable and adaptable to different applications. The low computational cost allows full PE in minutes on a single CPU, with the potential for further acceleration using multiple CPUs or GPUs. We implement this method in the $\texttt{dot-PE}$ package, enabling sensitive searches using the full evidence integral for precessing CBCs and supporting large waveform banks ($\sim10^6$ waveforms), regardless of waveform generation cost.</description>
