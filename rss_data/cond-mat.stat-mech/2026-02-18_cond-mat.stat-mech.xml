      <title>Hidden Twisted Sectors and Exponential Degeneracy in Root-of-Unity XXZ Heisenberg Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, product states have been identified as simple-structured eigenstates of XXZ Heisenberg spin models in arbitrary dimensions, occurring at anisotropy values corresponding to certain roots of unity. Yet, the product states typically only span parts of a larger degenerate eigenspace. Here, we classify this eigenspace in the one-dimensional periodic XXZ chain at all roots of unity $q$, where $q^2$ is an $\ell$-th primitive root of unity. For commensurate chain lengths $N$ with $q^N=1$, we prove that the minimal degeneracy is $2^{N/\ell}\ell$ using the representation theory of the affine Temperley-Lieb (aTL) algebra. For the incommensurate case, we derive analogous exponential lower bounds of $2^{2\lfloor\frac{N}{2\ell}\rfloor+1}$ if $N$ is even and $2^{2\lfloor \frac{N}{2\ell}+\frac{1}{2}\rfloor}$ if $N$ is odd and $q^\ell=1$. Our proof employs the morphisms between aTL modules discovered by Pinet and Saint-Aubin and emphasizes the importance of exact sequences and hidden twisted boundary condition sectors that mediate the degeneracy. In the case of commensurate chain lengths, we connect to the Fabricius-McCoy string construction of all Bethe roots of the degenerate subspace, which previously uncovered parts of our results. We corroborate our results numerically and demonstrate that the lower bound is saturated for chain lengths $N\leq20$. Our work demonstrates for a concrete system how the interplay of the Bethe ansatz, aTL representation theory, and twisted boundary conditions explains degeneracy connected to long-lived product states, stimulating research towards generalization to higher dimensions. Exponential degeneracy could boost applications of spin chains as quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous quenches and GHD in the $\nu = 1$ QSSEP model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the $\nu=1$ Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process starting from spatially inhomogeneous initial states. This one-dimensional system of free fermions has time-dependent stochastic hopping amplitudes that are uniform in space. We focus on two paradigmatic setups: domain-wall melting and the expansion of a trapped gas. Both are investigated by extending the framework of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to account for the underlying stochastic dynamics. We derive the evolution of the local quasiparticle occupation function, which characterizes the system at large space-time scales, and analyze the resulting entanglement spreading. By incorporating quantum fluctuations of the occupation function and employing conformal field theory techniques, we obtain the exact contribution to the entanglement entropy for each individual noise realization. Averaging over these realizations then yields the full entanglement statistics in the hydrodynamic regime. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by exact numerical calculations. The results presented here constitute the first application of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to stochastic quantum systems, demonstrating that this framework can be successfully extended beyond purely unitary dynamics to include stochastic effects.</description>

      <title>Bond percolation in distorted simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of structural distortion on bond percolation in simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Distortion is introduced through controlled random displacements of lattice sites, thereby modifying nearest-neighbor distances. Bond occupation is permitted only when the bond length is smaller than a prescribed connection threshold, directly coupling geometric disorder to connectivity. Finite-size scaling analysis is employed to determine percolation thresholds for finite systems and in the thermodynamic limit. We find that when the connection threshold exceeds the nearest-neighbor distance of the undistorted lattice, the percolation threshold increases monotonically with distortion strength, indicating a systematic suppression of spanning. In contrast, this monotonic behavior breaks down when the connection threshold is below the nearest-neighbor distance of the undistorted lattice, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between geometric distortion and connectivity. We further identify critical values of the connection threshold and the distortion amplitude required for global spanning when all the allowed bonds are occupied. All qualitative behaviors remain robust across both lattice geometries. These results clarify how geometric disorder reshapes percolation in three-dimensional crystalline networks.</description>

      <title>Finding the Edge of Chaos in a Ferromagnet: Quantifying the "Complexity" of 2D Ising Phase Transitions with Image Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The data-driven characterization of the ``complexity'' present in dynamical systems remains an open problem with broad applications across the physical sciences. We investigate the ``structural complexity'' of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, a paradigmatic system exhibiting a second-order phase transition at a certain critical temperature which is often cited as a canonical example of complex morphology. We define a quantitative metric for this structural complexity, $\mathcal C_s$, through the lens of algorithmic information theory by approximating the Kolmogorov complexity of lattice configurations via standard lossless image compression algorithms. We regularize our proposed metric, $\mathcal C_s$, by comparing the compressibility of a configuration to that of its pixel-wise sorted and randomly shuffled counterparts. We arrive at a definition of $\mathcal C_s$ as a product of two components representing the systems departure from perfect order and disorder respectively which we then plot as a function of temperature. Our numerical simulations reveal a distinct peak in $\mathcal C_s$ at the known critical temperature $T_c$. This result demonstrates that such information-theoretic measures can act as sensitive, model-agnostic indicators of criticality, directly quantifying the emergence of complex structure at the boundary between order and chaos, opening the door to data-driven applications in domains where analytic solutions are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Entropy Has No Direction: A Mirror-State Paradox Against Universal Monotonic Entropy Increase and a First-Principles Proof that Constraints Reshape the Entropy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a purely theoretical, self-contained argument that the Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be a universal fundamental law in the form ``entropy does not decrease'' (whether asserted trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical principle) when the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant. The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \emph{only} way $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that the relative entropy of a non-equilibrium ensemble to the corresponding equilibrium ensemble is the excess free energy. We show that the reverse relative entropy also has a thermodynamic interpretation: it is the excess free energy of a dual ensemble in which the roles of energy and entropy are interchanged.</description>

      <title>Generalized Geometric Brownian motion and the Infinite Ergodicity concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate stochastic processes that generalize geometric Brownian motion, focusing on cases where the standard invariant measure, i.e. the solution of the stationary Fokker-Planck equation does not necessarily exist. We demonstrate that the existence of such a measure depends sensitively on the structure of the drift and diffusion terms, as well as on the chosen discretization scheme of the underlying stochastic dynamics. To ground our discussion, we draw motivation from phenomenological models in statistical theories of turbulence, where geometric Brownian motion serves as a classical example. To address situations where the standard invariant measure fails to exist, we heuristically explore the concept of infinite ergodicity, a notion recently introduced in the context of statistical physics for drift-diffusion stochastic processes.</description>

      <title>Ising Model with Power Law Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the nearest-neighbour Ising model subjected to stochastic resetting, where the system is intermittently returned to an initial configuration with magnetisation $m_0$, with the inter-reset times drawn from the power law distribution $\alpha \tau_0^\alpha / \tau^{\alpha+1}$. The heavy-tailed resets generate magnetisation distributions that differ significantly from both equilibrium dynamics and the previously studied Ising model with exponentially distributed reset times. In two dimensions, for $T &gt; T_C$, we find a quasi-ferro state for all $\alpha$, marked by a double-peaked distribution that diverges at $m=0$ and $m=m_0$; no steady state exists for $\alpha &lt; 1$, while a stationary state emerges for $\alpha &gt; 1$. For $T &lt; T_C$, power law resetting produces two distinct regimes separated by a crossover exponent $\alpha^* = 1-c$: a single-peak ferromagnetic phase localised at $m_{eq}$ for $\alpha &lt; \alpha^*$, and a dual-peak ferromagnetic phase with divergences at $m_{eq}$ and $m_0$ for $\alpha &gt; \alpha^*$. Analytic results in one and two dimensions, supported by simulations, yield a rich phase diagram in the $(T,\alpha)$ plane and reveal how heavy-tailed resetting generates nonequilibrium phases very different from those seen in the case of exponential resetting.</description>

      <title>Anomalous transport in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model: a review and open problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review provides an up-to-date account of energy transport in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) chains, a key testbed for nonequilibrium statistical physics. We discuss the transition from the historical puzzle of thermalization to the discovery of anomalous heat transport, where the effective thermal conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with system size $L$ as $\kappa \propto L^\delta$. The article clarifies the distinction between two universality classes: the FPUT-$\alpha \beta$ model, characterized by $\delta = 1/3$ and linked to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics, and the symmetric FPUT-$\beta$ model, where numerical and theoretical evidence support $\delta = 2/5$. We investigate how finite-size effects - unavoidably induced by the thermostatting protocols - can disguise the asymptotic scaling. Additionally, we analyze the role of conservative noise in preserving hydrodynamic properties and examine how proximity to integrable limits leads to long-lived quasi-particles and, thereby, to diffusive regimes over intermediate spatial scales.</description>

      <title>Fastest first-passage time for multiple searchers with finite speed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the mean fastest first-passage time (fFPT) to an immobile target for an ensemble of $N$ independent finite-speed random searchers driven by dichotomous noise and described by the telegrapher's equation. In stark contrast to the well-studied case of Brownian particles -- for which the mean fFPT vanishes logarithmically with $N$ -- we uncover that the mean fFPT is bounded from below by the minimal ballistic travel time, with an exponentially fast convergence to this bound as $N \to \infty$. This behavior reveals a dramatic efficiency advantage of physically realistic, finite-speed searchers over Brownian ones and illustrates how diffusive macroscopic models may be conceptually misleading in predicting the short-time behavior of a physical system. We extend our analysis to anomalous diffusion generated by Riemann-Liouville-type dichotomous noises and find that target detection is more efficient in the superdiffusive regime, followed by normal and then subdiffusive regimes, in agreement with physical intuition and contrary to earlier predictions.</description>

      <title>Self-phoretic oscillatory motion in a one-dimensional channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a simple model for a particle that is active due to self-phoresis and that has been proposed to model symmetric camphor grains. The particle generates a concentration field through the continuous emission of a chemical substance, and its motion is driven by gradients of this field as it diffuses within a confined channel whose ends perfectly reflect the chemical. The reflection of the chemical field leads to an effective confinement of the particle, which itself is reflected before encountering the channel ends. The system displays a transition from a passive state, where the particle rests at the channel midpoint, to an active state characterized by highly regular, non-chaotic oscillations. We analytically construct the phase diagram and derive the oscillation frequency and amplitude in the vicinity of the transition. A perturbative analysis perfectly describes the dynamics of the particle even for oscillations as large as half the channel size. Furthermore, we develop an analysis which explains the mechanism of particle reflection close to the channel edges in the regime of large activity.</description>

      <title>Entropy production reveals hidden dynamical constraints rather than stochastic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropy production is often interpreted as a proxy for microscopic disorder or environmental roughness in stochastic systems. We test this interpretation using controlled simulations of overdamped stochastic dynamics on curved surfaces in which local noise, geometry, and forces are held fixed while global constraints are varied. Trajectories are generated for particles evolving toward a central attractor, and entropy production is quantified using both a continuum probability-current estimator and coarse-grained Markov transition statistics across multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Across systematic sweeps of timestep size, domain extent, and boundary topology, entropy production is governed primarily by constraint-induced probability flow rather than local stochastic variability. Periodic domains that permit sustained circulation yield substantially higher entropy production than reflecting domains despite identical local stochastic structure, with the magnitude of the separation depending on domain extent. In contrast, coarse-grained estimates decrease as temporal resolution increases and rise with finer spatial binning, demonstrating that discrete estimates depend strongly on observation scale and may fail to resolve topology-induced irreversible structure. Ergo, entropy production is not a direct measure of environmental roughness or randomness. Instead, it quantifies how strongly system dynamics are driven away from reversibility by global constraints, geometry, and the space of allowed trajectories. Interpreted in this way, entropy production maps function as diagnostics of organized probability flow and provide a principled method for detecting hidden dynamical constraints from trajectory data alone.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions to Matrix Models and String Theories: The Local Construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.15101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exact nonperturbative solutions to hermitian one-matrix models, their topological string duals, as well as their double-scaling limits to multicritical and minimal string theories, may be obtained via the use of resurgent transseries. These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches. In order to study these solutions globally across their phase diagrams, however, complete non-linear Stokes data is still needed -- which will be addressed in a complementary follow-up paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Micro-calorimetry offers significant potential as a quantitative method for studying the structure and function of biological systems, for instance, by probing the excess heat released by cellular or sub-cellular structures, isothermal or not, when external parameters change. We present the conceptual framework of nonequilibrium calorimetry, and as illustrations, we compute the heat capacity of biophysical models with few degrees of freedom related to ciliar motion (rowing model) and molecular motor motion (flashing ratchets). Our quantitative predictions reveal intriguing dependencies of the (nonequilibrium) heat capacity as a function of relevant biophysical parameters, which can even take negative values as a result of biological activity.</description>

      <title>Effects of quenched disorder in three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge Higgs models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of uncorrelated quenched disorder to the phase diagram and continuous transitions of three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge Higgs models. For this purpose, we consider two types of quenched disorder, associated with the sites and plaquettes of the cubic lattice. In both cases, for sufficiently weak disorder, the phase diagram remains similar to that of the pure system, showing two different phases (one of them being a topologically ordered phase), separated by two different continuous transition lines. However, the quenched disorder changes the universality classes of the critical behaviors along some of the transition lines. The random-plaquette disorder turns out to be relevant along the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge transition line, so the critical behaviors belong to the different random-plaquette $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge (RP${\mathbb Z}_2$G) universality class with length-scale exponent $\nu=\nu_{\rm rp}\approx 0.82$; on the other hand, it turns out to be irrelevant along the other Ising$^\times$ transition line (a variant of the Ising transitions with a gauge-dependent order parameter), leaving unchanged its asymptotic critical behaviors with $\nu=\nu_{\cal I}\approx 0.63$. The random-site disorder leads to a substantially different scenario: it destabilizes the Ising$^\times$ critical behaviors of the pure model, changing them into those of the randomly-dilute Ising$^{\times}$ (RDI$^{\times}$) universality class with $\nu=\nu_{\rm rdi}\approx 0.68$, while the critical behaviors along the other ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge topological transition line remains stable, with $\nu=\nu_{\cal I}\approx 0.63$.</description>

      <title>Observing quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved spacetime using programmable quantum processors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We digitally simulate quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved backgrounds using 80 superconducting qubits on IBM Heron processors. By engineering spatially varying couplings in the spin-$\frac12$ XXZ chain, consistent with the low energy description of the model in terms of an inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, we realize excitations that follow geodesics of an effective metric inherited from the underlying spatial deformation. Following quenches from N\'eel and few-spin-flip states, we observe curved light-cone propagation, horizon-induced freezing in the local magnetization, and position-dependent oscillation frequencies set by the engineered spatial deformation. Despite strong spatial inhomogeneity, unequal-time correlators reveal ballistic quasiparticle propagation in the spin chain. These results establish large-scale digital quantum processors as a flexible platform for detailed and controlled exploration of many-body dynamics in tunable and synthetic curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Temperley-Lieb modules and local operators for critical ADE models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.15742v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate critical restricted solid-on-solid models associated to Dynkin diagrams of type $A$, $D$ and $E$, with fixed, periodic and twisted periodic boundary conditions. These models are endowed with an action of the diagrams of the Temperley-Lieb category. For each model, we obtain the decomposition of the state space as a direct sum of irreducible modules over the Temperley-Lieb algebra $\mathsf{TL}_N(\beta)$ or its periodic incarnation $\mathsf{\mathcal EPTL}_N(\beta)$. This allows us to recover the known conformal partition functions for these models in the continuum scaling limit.
  For each irreducible factor arising in the decompositions, we define an associated local operator on the lattice, which behaves like a connectivity operator. Using knowledge from the Temperley-Lieb representation theory at roots of unity, we show that these operators satisfy certain linear difference relations, which are lattice counterparts of the singular-vector relations in conformal field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the optimal performance of an information engine consisting of an overdamped Brownian bead confined in a controllable, $d$-dimensional harmonic trap and additionally subjected to gravity. The trap's center is updated dynamically via a feedback protocol designed such that no external work is done by the trap on the bead, while maximizing the extraction of gravitational potential energy and achieving directed motion. We show that performance strikingly improves when thermal fluctuations in directions perpendicular to gravity are harnessed. This improvement arises from feedback cooling of these transverse degrees of freedom, along which all heat is extracted; comparable performance can be achieved even without vertical measurements. This engine design modularizes the functions of harnessing fluctuations and storing free energy, drawing a close analogy to the Szilard engine.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of thermodynamically consistent stochastic phase oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09718v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a toy model of two kinetically coupled stochastic oscillators whose dynamics is described as a Markov jump process among $N$ discrete phase states. For large $N$, it maps onto the deterministic two-oscillator Kuramoto model of synchronization. Despite its simplicity, we postulate its relevance for understanding more complex and realistic oscillator systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the model exhibits a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition between the unsynchronized and synchronized states. We show that this transition is not governed by any extremum dissipation principle -- depending on system parameters, synchronization may either reduce or enhance the dissipation. Close to the phase transition, we observe a divergent behavior of fluctuations and responses with $N$ and characterize their universal scaling behavior. In particular, the covariances of the oscillator phases and the local entropy productions are shown to diverge towards $-\infty$, a phenomenon that has not been reported before. Finally, we study the behavior of information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that mutual information and information flow between oscillators display different scaling with $N$ in synchronized and unsynchronized states, and thus can act as order parameters of synchronization.</description>

      <title>Statistical Mechanics of the Sub-Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04308v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistical mechanics is a powerful framework for analyzing optimization yielding analytical results for matching, optimal transport, and other combinatorial problems. However, these methods typically target the zero-temperature limit, where systems collapse onto optimal configurations, a.k.a. the ground states. Real-world systems often occupy intermediate regimes where entropy and cost minimization genuinely compete, producing configurations that are structured yet sub-optimal. The Sub-Optimal Transport (SOT) model captures this competition through an ensemble of weighted bipartite graphs: a coupling parameter interpolates between entropy-dominated dense configurations and cost-dominated sparse structures. This crossover has been observed numerically but lacked analytical understanding. Here we develop a mean-field theory that characterizes this transition. We show that local fluctuations in Lagrange multipliers become sub-extensive in the thermodynamic limit, reducing the full model with strength constraints to an effective single-constraint problem admitting an exact solution in some intermediate regime. The resulting free energy is analytic in the coupling parameter, confirming a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic observables and weight distributions, validated against numerical simulations. These results establish the first analytical description of the SOT model, extending statistical mechanics methods beyond the zero-temperature regime.</description>

      <title>On the principal eigenvectors of random Markov matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the invariant distributions of continuous-time and discrete-time random walks on randomly weighted complete digraphs. These distributions correspond to the principal left eigenvectors of the associated random Markov generators and kernels, viewed as random matrices. While much is known about the spectra of these matrices, relatively little is known about the principal left eigenvectors, which are delicate random objects for which no explicit form is known. We consider a broad class of such matrices obtained by associating random weights to the vertices and edges of the complete digraph. Our main result concerns the total variation distance between the invariant distribution of the continuous-time random walk and the distribution that is inversely proportional to the vertex weights. It states that, if the edge weights are i.i.d. with a finite $p$-th moment for some $p&gt;4$, then this distance a.s. converges to zero as the number of vertices grows large, even when the vertex weights are heavy-tailed. We further answer a question of Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafa\"i by showing that, despite the dependence of the entries in the corresponding Markov kernel, its invariant distribution is asymptotically uniform a.s., so long as the edge weights have a finite second moment.</description>

Abstract: We introduce and benchmark an improved algorithm for complex Langevin simulations of bosonic coherent state path integrals. Our approach utilizes a Strang splitting of the imaginary-time propagator rather than the conventional linear-order Taylor expansion, allowing us to construct an action that incorporates higher-order terms at negligible computational cost. The resulting algorithm enjoys guaranteed linear stability independent of the imaginary-time discretization, enabling more resource-efficient simulations. We demonstrate this improved performance for single-species bosons and for two-component bosons with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <title>Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17886v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.</description>

      <title>Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09715v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.</description>

      <title>Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13124v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.</description>

      <title>Causally constrained reduced-order neural models of complex turbulent dynamical systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.13847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a flexible framework based on response theory and score matching to suppress spurious, noncausal dependencies in reduced-order neural emulators of turbulent systems, focusing on climate dynamics as a proof-of-concept. We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.</description>
