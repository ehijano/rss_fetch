      <title>Characterizing nonlinear dynamics by contrastive cartography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The qualitative study of dynamical systems using bifurcation theory is key to understanding systems from biological clocks and neurons to physical phase transitions. Data generated from such systems can feature complex transients, an unknown number of attractors, and stochasticity. Making an analogy to bifurcation analysis, which specifies that useful dynamical features are often invariant to coordinate transforms, we leverage contrastive learning to devise a generic tool to discover dynamical classes from stochastic trajectory data. By providing a model-free trajectory analysis tool, this method automatically recovers the dynamical phase diagram of known models and provides a "map" of dynamical behaviors for a large ensemble of dynamical systems. The method thus provides a way to characterize and compare dynamical trajectories without governing equations or prior knowledge of target behavior. This approach can be used as a standalone analysis tool, or as part of a broader data-driven analysis framework.</description>

      <title>Space-time proper orthogonal decomposition of actuation transients: plasma-controlled jet flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09746v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the forcing-induced transient between statistically stationary and cyclostationary states. The transient dynamics of a turbulent supersonic twin-rectangular jet flow, forced symmetrically at a Strouhal number of 0.9, are studied using synchronized large-eddy simulations (LES) and space-time proper orthogonal decomposition (space-time POD). Under plasma-actuated control, the statistically stationary jet evolves towards a cyclostationary state over a transient phase. Forcing-induced perturbations of the natural jet are extracted using synchronized simulations of the natural and forced jets. A database is collected that captures an ensemble of realizations of the perturbations within the initial transient. The spatiotemporal dynamics and statistics of the transient are analyzed using space-time POD for each symmetry component. The eigenvalue spectra unveil low-rank dynamics in the symmetric component. The spatial and temporal structures of the leading modes indicate that the initial pulse of the actuators produces large, impulsive perturbations to the flow field. The symmetric mode reveals the contraction of the shock cells due to the forcing, and shows the evolution of the mean flow deformation transient.</description>

      <title>Universal Sharpness Dynamics in Neural Network Training: Fixed Point Analysis, Edge of Stability, and Route to Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In gradient descent dynamics of neural networks, the top eigenvalue of the loss Hessian (sharpness) displays a variety of robust phenomena throughout training. This includes early time regimes where the sharpness may decrease during early periods of training (sharpness reduction), and later time behavior such as progressive sharpening and edge of stability. We demonstrate that a simple $2$-layer linear network (UV model) trained on a single training example exhibits all of the essential sharpness phenomenology observed in real-world scenarios. By analyzing the structure of dynamical fixed points in function space and the vector field of function updates, we uncover the underlying mechanisms behind these sharpness trends. Our analysis reveals (i) the mechanism behind early sharpness reduction and progressive sharpening, (ii) the required conditions for edge of stability, (iii) the crucial role of initialization and parameterization, and (iv) a period-doubling route to chaos on the edge of stability manifold as learning rate is increased. Finally, we demonstrate that various predictions from this simplified model generalize to real-world scenarios and discuss its limitations.</description>

      <title>Quantum Chaos in Random Ising Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a systematic investigation of universal quantum chaotic signatures in the transverse field Ising model on an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi network. This is achieved by studying local spectral measures such as the level spacing and the level velocity statistics. A spectral form factor analysis is also performed as a global measure, probing energy level correlations at arbitrary spectral distances. Our findings show that these measures capture the breakdown of chaotic behavior upon varying the connectivity and strength of the transverse field in various regimes. We demonstrate that the level spacing statistics and the spectral form factor signal this breakdown for sparsely and densely connected networks. The velocity statistics capture the surviving chaotic signatures in the sparse limit. However, these integrable-like regimes extend over a vanishingly small segment in the full range of connectivity.</description>

      <title>A fluctuation-dissipation theorem perspective on radiative responses to temperature perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12585v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative forcing drives warming in the Earth system, leading to changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and associated radiative feedbacks. The link between changes in the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) net radiative flux and SST patterns, known as the "pattern effect", is typically diagnosed by studying the response of atmosphere-only models to SST perturbations. In this work, we diagnose the pattern effect through response theory, by performing idealized warming perturbation experiments from unperturbed data alone. First, by studying the response at short time scales, where the response is dominated by atmospheric variability, we recover results that agree with the literature. Second, by extending the framework to longer time scales, we capture coupled interactions between the slow ocean component and the atmosphere, yielding a novel "sensitivity map" quantifying the response of the net radiative flux to SST perturbations in the coupled system. Here, feedbacks are captured by a spatiotemporal response operator, rather than time-independent maps as in traditional studies. Both formulations skillfully reconstruct changes in externally forced simulations and provide practical strategies for climate studies. The key distinction lies in their perspectives on climate feedbacks. The first formulation, closely aligned with prediction tasks, follows the traditional view in which slow variables, such as SSTs, exert a one-way influence on fast variables. The second formulation broadens this perspective by incorporating spatiotemporal interactions across state variables. This alternative approach explores how localized SST perturbations can alter the coupled dynamics, leading to temperature changes in remote areas and further impacting the radiative fluxes at later times.</description>

      <title>The simplest 2D quantum walk detects chaoticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum walks have been actively studied from many perspectives, mainly from the statistical physics and quantum information points of view. We here determine the influence of basic chaotic features on the walker behavior. We consider an extremely simple model consisting of alternate one-dimensional walks along the two spatial coordinates of bidimensional closed domains (hard wall billiards). The chaotic or regular behavior that the shape of the boundary induces in the deterministic classical equations of motion and that translates into chaotic signatures for the quantized problem also results in sharp differences for the spectral statistics and morphology of the eigenfunctions of the quantum walker. This includes the presence of scarring on unstable periodic orbits of the Hamiltonian system. Unexpectedly, two different quantum mechanical problems share the same kind of features related to the corresponding classical dynamics of one of them.</description>
