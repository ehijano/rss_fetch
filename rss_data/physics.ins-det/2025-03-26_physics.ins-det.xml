      <title>Seven-dimensional Trajectory Reconstruction for VAMOS++</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VAMOS++ magnetic spectrometer is characterized by a large angular and momentum acceptance and highly non-linear ion optics properties requiring the use of software ion trajectory reconstruction methods to measure the ion magnetic rigidity and the trajectory length between the beam interaction point and the focal plane of the spectrometer. Standard measurements, involving the use of a thin target and a narrow beam spot, allow the assumption of a point-like beam interaction volume for ion trajectory reconstruction. However, this represents a limitation for the case of large beam spot size or extended gaseous target volume. To overcome this restriction, a seven-dimensional reconstruction method incorporating the reaction position coordinates was developed, making use of artificial deep neural networks. The neural networks were trained on a theoretical dataset generated by standard magnetic ray-tracing code. Future application to a voluminous gas target, necessitating the explicit inclusion of the three-dimensional position of the beam interaction point within the target in the trajectory reconstruction method, is discussed. The performances of the new method are presented along with a comparison of mass resolution obtained with previously reported model for the case of thin-target experimental data.</description>

      <title>Prototyping and Test of the "Canis" HTS Planar Coil Array for Stellarator Field Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thea Energy, Inc. is currently developing the "Eos" planar coil stellarator, the Company's first integrated fusion system capable of forming optimized stellarator magnetic fields without complex and costly modular coils. To demonstrate the field shaping capability required to enable Eos, Thea Energy designed, constructed, and tested the "Canis" 3x3 array of high-temperature superconductor (HTS) planar shaping coils after successfully demonstrating a single shaping coil prototype. Through the Canis 3x3 magnet array program, Thea Energy manufactured nine HTS shaping coils and developed the cryogenic test and measurement infrastructure necessary to validate the array's performance. Thea Energy operated the array at 20 K, generating several stellarator-relevant magnetic field shapes and demonstrating closed loop field control of the superconducting magnets to within 1% of predicted field, a margin of error acceptable for operation of an integrated stellarator. The Canis magnet array test campaign provides a proof of concept for HTS planar shaping coils as a viable approach to confining stellarator plasmas.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the $^{40}$Ar(e,e$^{\prime}$) elastic scattering cross section with a novel gas-jet target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on a measurement of elastic electron scattering on argon performed with a novel cryogenic gas-jet target at the Mainz Microtron accelerator MAMI. The luminosity is estimated with the thermodynamical parameters of the target and by comparison to a calculation in distorted-wave Born approximation. The cross section, measured at new momentum transfers of 1.24 fm$^{-1}$ and 1.55 fm$^{-1}$ is in agreement with previous experiments performed with a traditional high-pressure gas target, as well as with modern ab-initio calculations employing state-of-the-art nuclear forces from chiral effective field theory. The nearly background-free measurement highlights the optimal properties of the gas-jet target for elements heavier than hydrogen, enabling new applications in hadron and nuclear physics.</description>

      <title>CONFLUX: A Standardized Framework to Calculate Reactor Antineutrino Flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear fission reactors are abundant sources of antineutrinos. The flux and spectrum of antineutrinos emitted by a reactor can indicate its activity and composition, suggesting potential applications of neutrino measurements beyond fundamental scientific studies that may be valuable to society. The utility of reactor antineutrinos for applications and fundamental science is dependent on the availability of precise predictions of these emissions. For example, in the last decade, disagreements between reactor antineutrino measurements and models have inspired revision of reactor antineutrino calculations and standard nuclear databases as well as searches for new fundamental particles not predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Past predictions and descriptions of the methods used to generate them are documented to varying degrees in the literature, with different modeling teams incorporating a range of methods, input data, and assumptions. The resulting difficulty in accessing or reproducing past models and reconciling results from differing approaches complicates the future study and application of reactor antineutrinos. The CONFLUX (Calculation Of Neutrino FLUX) software framework is a neutrino prediction tool built with the goal of simplifying, standardizing, and democratizing the process of reactor antineutrino flux calculations. CONFLUX include three primary methods for calculating the antineutrino emissions of nuclear reactors or individual beta decays that incorporate common nuclear data and beta decay theory. The software is prepackaged with the current nuclear database. It includes the capability to predict time-dependent neutrino model, adjust decay information entries, and propagate uncertainties. This paper describes the software structure, details the methods used for flux and spectrum calculations, and talks about potential use cases.</description>

      <title>Measurement of cosmic muon-induced neutron background with ISMRAN detector in a non-reactor environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Indian Scintillator Matrix for Reactor Anti-Neutrinos (ISMRAN) is an above-ground, very short baseline reactor anti-neutrino (${\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{e}$) experiment, located inside the Dhruva research reactor facility, Mumbai, India. The primary goal of the ISMRAN experiment is the indirect detection of reactor ${\overline{\ensuremath{\nu}}}_{e}$ through an inverse beta decay (IBD) process, using a cluster of 90 optically segmented plastic scintillator detectors, weighing $\sim$1 ton. In this work, we present the neutron capture time response and energy deposition of neutron capture signals generated by cosmic muons in the ISMRAN geometry, and we compare these experimental results with Geant4-based Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The obtained mean capture time of fast neutrons is 74.46 $\pm$ 5.98 $\mathrm{\mu}$s and is comparable with the MC simulation results. The efficiency-corrected rate of muon-induced neutron background inside the ISMRAN geometry, due to the presence of a passive shielding structure of 10 cm lead followed by 10 cm borated polyethylene with a surface area of 600 $\mathrm{cm^{2}}$, deployed on top of the ISMRAN setup, is reported to be 1334 $\pm$ 64 (stat.) $\pm$ 70 (sys.) per day. This result shows good agreement with the expected background rate from MC simulations using Geant4. We also estimate the muon-induced fast-neutron rate in the ISMRAN geometry for the actual shielding configuration of 9000 $\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ surface area to be 3335 $\pm$ 160 (stat.) $\pm$ 175 (sys.) neutrons $\mathrm{day^{-1}}$ through an extrapolation, after incorporating the model dependent acceptance correction factor from the Geant4 MC simulation. Finally, using these results, we evaluate the neutron production yield due to the composite shielding in the ISMRAN geometry, which is 2.81$\times$$\mathrm{10^{-5}}$ neutrons per $\mu$ per (g/$\mathrm{cm^{2}}$) at sea level.</description>

      <title>Irradiation Study Using QA Test Pieces of ATLAS18 ITk Strip Sensors with 80MeV Protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS experiment is planning a complete replacement of its inner detector(ID) with a new all-silicon inner tracker (ITk) for the ATLAS Inner Tracker Phase-2 upgrade. The ATLAS18 silicon strip sensors are designed to operate up to the integrated luminosity of 4000 fb$^{-1}$, which corresponds to the maximum fluence of $1.6 \times 10^{15} \, \text n_{\text{eq}} / \text{cm}^2$ (including safety factor). To enhance the quality assurance (QA) program to monitor the key properties of the sensors, the strip sensor community is considering to include China Spallation Neutron Source (CSNS) as a proton irradiation site and Institute of High Energy Physics (IHEP) as a QA test site. A total of 18 ATLAS18 ITk QA test pieces were irradiated with $6.0 \times 10^{14}$, $1.6 \times 10^{15}$, and $2.6 \times 10^{15} \, \text n_{\text{eq}} / \text{cm}^2$ protons at CSNS, and measured at IHEP, including IV (leakage current-voltage), CV (capacitance-voltage) and CCE (charge collection efficiency) measurements. The upgraded irradiation setup at CSNS and measurement setup at IHEP are shown in this paper. Irradiated samples were exchanged between IHEP, Ljubljana and Birmingham to cross-check CCE measurements.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Bandwidth Testing Framework for the LHCb Upgrade Trigger System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHCb experiment at CERN has undergone a comprehensive upgrade, including a complete re-design of the trigger system into a hybrid-architecture, software-only system that delivers ten times more interesting signals per unit time than its predecessor. This increased efficiency - as well as the growing diversity of signals physicists want to analyse - makes conforming to crucial operational targets on bandwidth and storage capacity ever more challenging. To address this, a comprehensive, automated testing framework has been developed that emulates the entire LHCb trigger and offline-processing software stack on simulated and real collision data. Scheduled both nightly and on-demand by software testers during development, these tests measure the online- and offline-processing's key operational performance metrics (such as rate and bandwidth), for each of the system's 4000 distinct physics selection algorithms, and their cumulative totals. The results are automatically delivered via concise summaries - to GitLab merge requests and instant messaging channels - that further link to an extensive dashboard of per-algorithm information. The dashboard and pages therein facilitate test-driven trigger development by 100s of physicists, whilst the concise summaries enable efficient, data-driven decision-making by management and software maintainers. This novel bandwidth-testing framework has been helping LHCb build an operationally-viable trigger and data-processing system whilst maintaining the efficiency to satisfy its physics goals.</description>

      <title>Removal of high-voltage-induced surface charges by ultraviolet light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A plethora of studies ranging from precision physics to quantum information employ ions, highly excited neutral atoms or polar molecules as tools. Motivated by the need for miniaturization, scalability and controllability, the particles are often trapped close to electrodes imprinted on dielectric surfaces. However, such geometry makes the particles susceptible to undesired surface charges. To understand how high voltage applied to the electrodes mediates the buildup of charges, we use a scanning Kelvin probe in an ultrahigh vacuum to investigate the electric potential landscape of an electrostatic molecule trap with a microstructured electrode array. We find that the surface becomes positively charged after applying voltages to the electrodes, leading to offset and patch electric potentials across the surface. Removal of these charges is demonstrated using ultraviolet light. The dynamics of this process, including the dependence on light intensity, wavelength and sample type, are investigated in detail. We find the charge removal to be faster for shorter ultraviolet wavelengths, with an additional polymer coating providing further enhancement. Our findings may be useful in a wide spectrum of experiments with electric-field-sensitive particles.</description>

      <title>A cryogenic test-mass suspension with flexures operating in compression for third-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the conceptual design of a novel silicon suspension for the cryogenic test-mass mirrors of the low-frequency detector of the Einstein Telescope gravitational-wave observatory. In traditional suspensions, tensional stress is a severe limitation for achieving low thermal noise, safer mechanical margins and high thermal conductance simultaneously. In order to keep the tensional stress sufficiently low, we propose the use of rigid beams with large cross sections, combined with short flexures under compressional load. This configuration takes advantage of the many times higher strength of silicon in compression to respect to its strength in tension. The flexures are mechanically robust and at the same time soft in the working direction, thus producing low suspension thermal noise and, by being short, provide high thermal conductance for cryogenic cooling. The rigid beams, located between the test mass and an intermediate mass, allow the elimination of the recoil mass used conventionally for applying control forces for interferometer lock, and the use of optical anti-springs to reduce the pendulum resonant frequency to further improve the vibration isolation of the test mass. The configuration has the capability to reach a lower mirror operational temperature, which is expected to produce a substantial reduction of the thermal noise in the mirrors of the interferometer.</description>

      <title>A Managed Tokens Service for Securely Keeping and Distributing Grid Tokens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermilab is transitioning authentication and authorization for grid operations to using bearer tokens based on the WLCG Common JWT (JSON Web Token) Profile. One of the functionalities that Fermilab experimenters rely on is the ability to automate batch job submission, which in turn depends on the ability to securely refresh and distribute the necessary credentials to experiment job submit points. Thus, with the transition to using tokens for grid operations, we needed to create a service that would obtain, refresh, and distribute tokens for experimenters' use. This service would avoid the need for experimenters to be experts in obtaining their own tokens and would better protect the most sensitive long-lived credentials. Further, the service needed to be widely scalable, as Fermilab hosts many experiments, each of which would need their own credentials. To address these issues, we created and deployed a Managed Tokens Service. The service is written in Go, taking advantage of that language's native concurrency primitives to easily be able to scale operations as we onboard experiments. The service uses as its first credentials a set of kerberos keytabs, stored on the same secure machine that the Managed Tokens service runs on. These kerberos credentials allow the service to use htgettoken via condor_vault_storer to store vault tokens in the HTCondor credential managers (credds) that run on the batch system scheduler machines (HTCondor schedds); as well as downloading a local, shorter-lived copy of the vault token. The kerberos credentials are then also used to distribute copies of the locally-stored vault tokens to experiment submit points.</description>

      <title>Prospects and Opportunities with an upgraded FASER Neutrino Detector during the HL-LHC era: Input to the EPPSU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The FASER experiment at CERN has opened a new window in collider neutrino physics by detecting TeV-energy neutrinos produced in the forward direction at the LHC. Building on this success, this document outlines the scientific case and design considerations for an upgraded FASER neutrino detector to operate during LHC Run 4 and beyond. The proposed detector will significantly enhance the neutrino physics program by increasing event statistics, improving flavor identification, and enabling precision measurements of neutrino interactions at the highest man-made energies. Key objectives include measuring neutrino cross sections, probing proton structure and forward QCD dynamics, testing lepton flavor universality, and searching for beyond-the-Standard Model physics. Several detector configurations are under study, including high-granularity scintillator-based tracking calorimeters, high-precision silicon tracking layers, and advanced emulsion-based detectors for exclusive event reconstruction. These upgrades will maximize the physics potential of the HL-LHC, contribute to astroparticle physics and QCD studies, and serve as a stepping stone toward future neutrino programs at the Forward Physics Facility.</description>

Abstract: This document, written by early career researchers (ECRs) in particle physics, aims to represent the perspectives of the European ECR community and serves as input for the 2025--2026 update of the European Strategy for Particle Physics. With input from a community-wide survey, it highlights key challenges faced by ECRs -- career stability, funding access and long-term research opportunities -- while proposing policy recommendations and targeted initiatives. It underscores the importance of practices fostering diverse, equitable, inclusive and healthy workplaces, as well as of stronger ECR communities, and highlights how effective communication and interdisciplinary collaborations reinforce the societal relevance of particle physics and promote continued support for large-scale and long-term projects. Finally, the future of both collider and beyond-collider experiments is addressed, emphasising the critical role of ECRs in shaping future projects. The ECR contribution is formed of two parts: the ten-page executive summary submitted as input to the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update and, as backup document, this extended white paper providing additional context.</description>

      <title>Athermal phonon collection efficiency in diamond crystals for low mass dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explored the efficacy of lab-grown diamonds as potential target materials for the direct detection of sub-GeV dark matter~(DM) using metallic magnetic calorimeters~(MMCs). Diamond, with its excellent phononic properties and the low atomic mass of the constituent carbon, can play a crucial role in detecting low-mass dark matter particles. The relatively long electron-hole pair lifetime inside the crystal may provide discrimination power between the DM-induced nuclear recoil events and the background-induced electron recoil events. Utilizing the the fast response times of the MMCs and their unique geometric versatility, we deployed a novel methodology for quantifying phonon dynamics inside diamond crystals. We demonstrated that lab-grown diamond crystals fabricated via the chemical vapor deposition~(CVD) technique can satisfy the stringent quality requirements for sub-GeV dark matter searches. The high-quality polycrystalline CVD diamond showed a superior athermal phonon collection efficiency compared to that of the reference sapphire crystal, and achieved energy resolution 62.7~eV at the 8.05~keV copper fluorescence line. With this energy resolution, we explored the low-energy range below 100~eV and confirmed the existence of so-called low-energy excess~(LEE) reported by multiple cryogenic experiments.</description>

      <title>Bulk-Surface Event Discrimination in Point Contact Germanium Detectors at Near-Threshold Energies with Shape-Matching Pulse-Shape Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00089v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The p-type point-contact germanium (pPCGe) detectors have been widely adopted in searches for low energy physics events such as neutrinos and dark matter. This is due to their enhanced capabilities of background rejection, sensitivity at energies as low as the sub-keV range and particularly fine energy resolution. Nonetheless, the pPCGe is subject to irregular behaviour caused by surface effects for events near the passivated surface. These surface events can, in general, be distinguished from events that occur in the germanium crystal bulk by its slower pulse rise time. Unfortunately, the rise-time spectra of bulk and surface events starts to convolve with each other at sub-keV energies. In this work, we propose a novel method based on cross-correlation shape-matching combined with a low-pass filter to constrain the initial parameter estimates of the signal pulse. This improvement at the lowest level leads to a 50% reduction in computation time and refinements in the rise-time resolution, which will, in the end, enhance the overall analysis. To evaluate the performance of the method, we simulate artificial pulses that resembles bulk and surface pulses by using a programmable pulse generator module (pulser). The pulser-generated pulses are then used to examine the pulse behaviours at near-threshold energies, suggesting a roughly 70% background-leakage reduction in the bulk spectrum. Finally, the method is tested on data collected from the TEXONO experiment, where the results are consistent with our observations in pulser and demonstrated the possibility of lowering the analysis threshold by at least 10eV.</description>

      <title>Properties of carbon-infused silicon LGAD devices after non-uniform irradiation with 24 GeV/c protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Forward proton spectrometers at high-energy proton colliders rely on precision timing to discriminate signal from background. Silicon low gain avalanche diodes (LGADs) are a candidate for future timing detectors in these systems. A major challenge for the use of LGADs is that these detectors must be placed within a few mm of the beams, resulting in a very large and highly non-uniform radiation environment. We present a first measurement of the current and capacitance vs. voltage behavior of LGAD sensors, after a highly non-uniform irradiation with beams of 24 GeV/c protons at fluences up to $1\times10^{16} p/cm^{2}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to addressing challenges in neutrino event reconstruction within large Time Projection Chambers (TPCs). By integrating fiber-coupled digital silicon photomultipliers, we propose a design that enhances light detection, improves energy resolution, and enhance event reconstruction. Advancements in power and signal over fiber technologies are leveraged to deploy digital sensors within the TPC bulk volume, enabling precise timing and robust particle identification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16658v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterization of strip and pixel AC-LGAD devices with both laser TCT and probe station (IV/CV) will be shown on AC-LGADs irradiated with 1 MeV reactor neutrons at JSI/Ljubljana and with 400~MeV protons at FNAL ITA to fluences from 1e13~$n_{eq}/cm^2$ to a few times 1e15~$n_{eq}/cm^2$. This study was conducted within the scope of the ePIC detector time of flight (TOF) layer R\&amp;D program at the EIC, which will feature AC-LGADs with strip and pixel geometry. Sensors in the TOF layer will receive up to 1e13~$n_{eq}/cm^2$ fluence over the lifetime of the experiment.</description>

      <title>An experiment to observe GNSS signals with the Australian VGOS array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07020v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new instrument enabling a novel combination of Earth measuring techniques: direct observations with the radio astronomical instruments to satellites of the global navigation satellite systems. Inter-technique biases are a major error source in the terrestrial reference frame. Combining two major space-geodetic techniques, GNSS and VLBI, through observations to identical sensors has been considered infeasible due to their seemingly incompatible operating frequencies. The newly accessible L-band capability of the Australian VGOS telescopes is shown here, invalidating this prevailing opinion. A series of test observations demonstrates geodetic VLBI observations to GPS satellites for a continental-wide IVS telescope array, with the potential for observations at a critical scale. We anticipate immediate impact for the geodetic community, through first-ever inter-technique ties between VLBI and GNSS in the Australian region and via the opportunity for critical test observations towards the Genesis mission, geodesy's flagship project in the area of space ties set for launch in 2028.</description>

      <title>COCOA: a compact Compton camera for astrophysical observation of MeV-scale gamma rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20916v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: COCOA (COmpact COmpton cAmera) is a next-generation, cost-effective gamma-ray telescope designed for astrophysical observations in the MeV energy range. The detector comprises a scatterer volume employing the LiquidO detection technology and an array of scintillating crystals acting as absorber. Surrounding plastic scintillator panels serve as a veto system for charged particles. The detector's compact, scalable design enables flexible deployment on microsatellites or high-altitude balloons. Gamma rays at MeV energies have not been well explored historically (the so-called "MeV gap") and COCOA has the potential to improve the sensitivity in this energy band by more than one order of magnitude.</description>
