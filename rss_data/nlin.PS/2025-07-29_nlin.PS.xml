      <title>Solitons of the Symmetric $\phi^4$-$\phi^2 |\phi|$-$\phi^2$ Triple Well Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A symmetric $\phi^4$-$\phi^2 |\phi|$-$\phi^2$ model has recently attracted a lot of attention due to its usefulness in studying tunable phase transitions. We analyze the behavior of this model for the entire range of parameters and obtain its kink and pulse solutions. For completeness, we also present several periodic solutions of this model. Furthermore, we present a generalized symmetric $\phi^{4n}$-$\phi^{2n}|\phi|$-$\phi^2$ model where $n = 1, 2, 3, ...$ and obtain its kink and pulse solutions for arbitrary $n$.</description>

      <title>Controlled Fission and Superposition of Vector Solitons in an Integrable Model of Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of vector solitons in a two-component Bose-Einstein condensates governed by the system of Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Using a gauge-transformation approach, we construct a four-soliton solution and analyze their interactions, including superposition states, fission, and shape-preserving collisions. We explore the ability of time-dependent parameters, such as the intra- and intercomponent interaction coefficients and trapping potential, to control the soliton properties. In particular, we demonstrate controlled four-soliton fission, highlighting its potential applications to quantum data processing and coherent matter-wave transport. The results suggest experimental realization in BEC systems and provide insights into nonlinear wave interactions in multicomponent quantum fluids.</description>

      <title>Soliton-like Rogue Wave Dynamics in Dissipative Higher-Order NLS Models: A Floquet Spectral Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate rogue wave formation and spectral downshifting in the higher-order nonlinear Schr\"odinger (HONLS) equation and its dissipative extensions: the nonlinear mean-flow damping model (NLD-HONLS) and the viscous damping model (V-HONLS). By applying Floquet spectral analysis, we characterize i) the structural organization of the dynamical background and ii) the nature of the rogue waves that appear, distinguishing sharply localized, soliton-like structures from more diffuse, spatially extended waveforms with mixed mode characteristics. In the conservative HONLS, soliton-like rogue waves (SRWs) arise only for steep initial data, with the dynamics intermittently switching between periods of SRW formation and periods dominated by a disordered multi-mode background. For moderately steep initial data, only broader, less coherent rogue waves form.
  Nonlinear damping in the NLD-HONLS model suppresses disorder and supports a stable, well-organized Floquet spectra that reflects a sustained soliton-like state from which SRWs emerge, along with strong phase coherence. In contrast, viscous damping in the V-HONLS model leads to a disordered Floquet spectral evolution with broader, less localized rogue waves and increased phase variability. Furthermore, the NLD-HONLS model shows a close link between rogue wave events and the time of permanent downshift, whereas these phenomena appear decoupled in the V-HONLS model. These results clarify how dissipation type and wave steepness interact to shape extreme events in near-integrable wave systems and highlight the value of spectral diagnostics for studying nonlinear wave dynamics.</description>

      <title>Inverse scattering transform via affine map: applications to high-speed nonlinear optical communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work present an affine map approximation for solving the inverse scattering problem related to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger model of signal propagation in high-speed coherent optical communication. Numerical simulations indicate that accurate recovery of the transmitted bit sequence can be achieved using only the continuous part of the Lax spectrum at the fiber output, thereby allowing the discrete (soliton) spectrum to be disregarded. We observed that the numerically evaluated rank of the resulting affine map matrix equals the number of bits per transmitted sequence, and we utilize this to derive a reduced order affine map.</description>

      <title>Dark photon dark matter from flattened axion potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark photons can be resonantly produced in the early universe via their coupling to an oscillating axion field. However, this mechanism typically requires large axion-dark photon couplings or some degree of fine-tuning. In this work, we present a new scenario in which efficient dark photon production arises from axion potentials that are shallower than quadratic at large field values. For moderately large initial misalignment angles, the oscillation of the axion field can trigger either efficient dark photon production or strong axion self-resonance via parametric resonance. When self-resonance dominates and disrupts the field's homogeneity, we show that oscillons -- localized, oscillating axion field configurations -- naturally form and can sustain continued dark photon production, provided the coupling is $\gtrsim \mathcal O(1)$. For dark photon mass up to three orders of magnitude below the axion mass, the produced dark photons can account for a significant fraction of the present-day dark matter. We support this scenario with numerical lattice simulations of a benchmark model. Our results further motivate experimental searches for ultralight dark photon dark matter. The simulation code is publicly available at https://github.com/hongyi18/AxionDarkPhotonSimulator.</description>

      <title>Convergent Weight and Activation Dynamics in Memristor Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence of dynamic feedback neural networks (NNs), as the Cohen-Grossberg, Hopfield and cellular NNs, has been for a long time a workhorse of NN theory. Indeed, convergence in the presence of multiple stable equilibrium points (EPs) is crucial to implement content addressable memories and solve several other signal processing tasks in real time. There are two typical ways to use a convergent NN, i.e.: a) let the activations evolve while maintaining fixed weights and inputs (activation dynamics) or b) adapt the weights while maintaining fixed activations (weight dynamics). As remarked in a seminal paper by Hirsch, there is another interesting possibility, i.e., let the neuron interconnection weights evolve while simultaneously running the activation dynamics (weight-activation dynamics). The weight-activation dynamics is of importance also because it is more plausible than the other two types for modeling neural systems. The paper breaks new ground by analyzing for the first time in a systematic way the convergence properties of the weight-activation dynamics for a class of memristor feedback dynamic NNs. The main result is that, under suitable assumptions on the structure of the memristor interconnections, the solutions (weights and activations) converge to an EP, except at most for a set of initial conditions with zero measure. The result includes the most important case where the NN has multiple stable EPs.</description>

      <title>Coherent Structures in Flame Fronts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study traveling waves in a coordinate-free model of flame fronts. The flame front is the interface between the burnt and unburnt phases of a gas undergoing combustion. The front therefore moves in a preferred direction, as the unburnt gas is consumed. In the horizontally periodic, vertically unbounded setting, we prove the existence of waves of permanent form which are traveling in the vertical direction. We also compute these waves. The analysis and computation use the framework of traveling waves in the arclength parameterization as previously developed by two of the authors and Wright.</description>

      <title>Quantum synchronization blockade induced by nonreciprocal coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, the synchronization of coupled quantum oscillators has attracted a great deal of interest. Synchronization requires driven constituents, and in such systems, the coupling can be designed to be nonreciprocal. Nonreciprocally coupled oscillators exhibit a rich variety of behavior including active traveling-wave-type states. In this work, we study the interplay of three competing synchronization mechanisms in a setup of two nonreciprocally coupled quantum van der Pol oscillators. One of the oscillators is driven externally which induces phase locking. A dissipative interaction leads to antiphase locking, whereas a coherent interaction nurtures bistable phase locking and active states. We approximate the phase diagram of the quantum case by evaluating the synchronization measure of a perturbation expansion of the steady state. Effective unidirectional interactions lead to synchronization blockades between the undriven oscillator and the external drive as well as between both oscillators. Furthermore, we study the phase diagrams of two and three oscillators in the mean-field limit and find highly nontrivial active states.</description>

      <title>Experimental Observation of Single- and Multi-Site Matter-Wave Solitons in 1D Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. The experimental results qualitatively agree with a Gaussian variational model and match quantitatively with numerical simulations of the three-dimensional Gross-Pitaevskii equation, extended with a quintic term to account for the loss of atoms. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.</description>
