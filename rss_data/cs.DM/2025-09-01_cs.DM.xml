      <title>Constructive l2-Discrepancy Minimization with Additive Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{signed series} problem in the $\ell_2$ norm asks, given set of vectors $v_1,\ldots,v_n\in \mathbf{R}^d$ having at most unit $\ell_2$ norm, does there always exist a series $(\varepsilon_i)_{i\in [n]}$ of $\pm 1$ signs such that for all $i\in [n]$, $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d})$. A result of Banaszczyk [2012, \emph{Rand. Struct. Alg.}] states that there exist signs $\varepsilon_i\in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that $\max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i \varepsilon_i v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d+\log n})$. The best constructive bound known so far is of $O(\sqrt{d\log n})$, by Bansal and Garg [2017, \emph{STOC.}, 2019, \emph{SIAM J. Comput.}]. We give a polynomial-time randomized algorithm to find signs $x(i) \in \{-1,1\},\; i\in [n]$ such that \[ \max_{i\in [n]} \|\sum_{j=1}^i x(i)v_i\|_2 = O(\sqrt{d + \log^2 n}) = O(\sqrt{d}+\log n).\] By the constructive reduction of Harvey and Samadi [\emph{COLT}, 2014], this also yields a constructive bound of $O(\sqrt{d}+\log n)$ for the Steinitz problem in the $\ell_2$-norm. Thus, our result settles both conjectures when $d \geq \log^2n$. Our algorithm is based on the framework on Bansal and Garg, together with a new analysis involving $(i)$ additional linear and spectral orthogonality constraints during the construction of the covariance matrix of the random walk steps, which allow us to control the quadratic variation in the linear as well as the quadratic components of the discrepancy increment vector, alongwith $(ii)$ a ``Freedman-like" version of the Hanson-Wright concentration inequality, for filtration-dependent sums of subgaussian chaoses.</description>

      <title>Signed counting of partition matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the signed counting (with respect to the parity of the ``$\operatorname{inv}$'' statistic) of partition matrices equals the cardinality of a subclass of inversion sequences. In the course of establishing this result, we introduce an interesting class of partition matrices called improper partition matrices. We further show that a subset of improper partition matrices is equinumerous with the set of Motzkin paths. Such an equidistribution is established both analytically and bijectively.</description>

      <title>When Many Trees Go to War</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is known that any two trees on the same $n$ leaves can be displayed by a network with $n-2$ reticulations, and there are two trees that cannot be displayed by a network with fewer reticulations. But how many reticulations are needed to display multiple trees? For any set of $t$ trees on $n$ leaves, there is a trivial network with $(t - 1)n$ reticulations that displays them. To do better, we have to exploit common structure of the trees to embed non-trivial subtrees of different trees into the same part of the network. In this paper, we show that for $t \in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there is a set of $t$ trees with virtually no common structure that could be exploited. More precisely, we show for any $t\in o(\sqrt{\lg n})$, there are $t$ trees such that any network displaying them has $(t-1)n - o(n)$ reticulations. For $t \in o(\lg n)$, we obtain a slightly weaker bound. We also prove that already for $t = c\lg n$, for any constant $c &gt; 0$, there is a set of $t$ trees that cannot be displayed by a network with $o(n \lg n)$ reticulations, matching up to constant factors the known upper bound of $O(n \lg n)$ reticulations sufficient to display \emph{all} trees with $n$ leaves. These results are based on simple counting arguments and extend to unrooted networks and trees.</description>

      <title>Epsilon-saturation for stable graphs and Littlestone classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Any Littlestone class, or stable graph, has finite sets which function as ``virtual elements'': these can be seen from the learning side as representing hypotheses which are expressible as weighted majority opinions of hypotheses in the class, and from the model-theoretic side as an approximate finitary version of realizing types. We introduce and study the epsilon-saturation of a Littlestone class, or stable graph, which is essentially the closure of the class under inductively adding all such virtual elements. We characterize this closure and prove that under reasonable choices of parameters, it remains Littlestone (or stable), though not always of the same Littlestone dimension. This highlights some surprising phenomena having to do with regimes of epsilon and the relation between Littlestone/stability and VC dimension.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Soft Happiness via Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $0\leq \rho\leq 1$, a $\rho$-happy vertex $v$ in a coloured graph shares colour with at least $\rho\mathrm{deg}(v)$ of its neighbours. Soft happy colouring of a graph $G$ with $k$ colours extends a partial $k$-colouring to a complete vertex $k$-colouring such that the number of $\rho$-happy vertices is maximum among all such colouring extensions. The problem is known to be NP-hard, and an optimal solution has a direct relation with the community structure of the graph. In addition, some heuristics and local search algorithms, such as {\sf Local Maximal Colouring} ({\sf LMC}) and {\sf Local Search} ({\sf LS}), have already been introduced in the literature. In this paper, we design Genetic and Memetic Algorithms for soft happy colouring and test them for a large set of randomly generated partially coloured graphs. Memetic Algorithms yield a higher number of $\rho$-happy vertices, but Genetic Algorithms can perform well only when their initial populations are locally improved by {\sf LMC} or {\sf LS}. Statistically significant results indicate that both Genetic and Memetic Algorithms achieve high average accuracy in community detection when their initial populations are enhanced using {\sf LMC}. Moreover, among the competing methods, the evolutionary algorithms identified the greatest number of complete solutions.</description>
