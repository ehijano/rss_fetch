      <title>HQNN-FSP: A Hybrid Classical-Quantum Neural Network for Regression-Based Financial Stock Market Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Financial time-series forecasting remains a challenging task due to complex temporal dependencies and market fluctuations. This study explores the potential of hybrid quantum-classical approaches to assist in financial trend prediction by leveraging quantum resources for improved feature representation and learning. A custom Quantum Neural Network (QNN) regressor is introduced, designed with a novel ansatz tailored for financial applications. Two hybrid optimization strategies are proposed: (1) a sequential approach where classical recurrent models (RNN/LSTM) extract temporal dependencies before quantum processing, and (2) a joint learning framework that optimizes classical and quantum parameters simultaneously. Systematic evaluation using TimeSeriesSplit, k-fold cross-validation, and predictive error analysis highlights the ability of these hybrid models to integrate quantum computing into financial forecasting workflows. The findings demonstrate how quantum-assisted learning can contribute to financial modeling, offering insights into the practical role of quantum resources in time-series analysis.</description>

      <title>Large language models in finance : what is financial sentiment?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03612v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Financial sentiment has become a crucial yet complex concept in finance, increasingly used in market forecasting and investment strategies. Despite its growing importance, there remains a need to define and understand what financial sentiment truly represents and how it can be effectively measured. We explore the nature of financial sentiment and investigate how large language models (LLMs) contribute to its estimation. We trace the evolution of sentiment measurement in finance, from market-based and lexicon-based methods to advanced natural language processing techniques. The emergence of LLMs has significantly enhanced sentiment analysis, providing deeper contextual understanding and greater accuracy in extracting sentiment from financial text. We examine how BERT-based models, such as RoBERTa and FinBERT, are optimized for structured sentiment classification, while GPT-based models, including GPT-4, OPT, and LLaMA, excel in financial text generation and real-time sentiment interpretation. A comparative analysis of bidirectional and autoregressive transformer architectures highlights their respective roles in investor sentiment analysis, algorithmic trading, and financial decision-making. By exploring what financial sentiment is and how it is estimated within LLMs, we provide insights into the growing role of AI-driven sentiment analysis in finance.</description>
