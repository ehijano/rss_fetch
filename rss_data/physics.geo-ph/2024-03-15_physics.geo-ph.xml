      <title>Joule-Thomson cooling of CO2 injected into aquifer under heat exchange with adjacent formations by Newtons law- 1D exact solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper discusses axi-symmetric flow during CO2 injection into a non-adiabatic reservoir accounting for Joule-Thomson cooling and steady-state heat exchange between the reservoir and the adjacent layers by Newtons law. An exact solution for this 1D problem is derived and a new method for model validation by comparison with quasi 2D analytical heat-conductivity solution is developed. The temperature profile obtained by the analytical solution shows a temperature decrease to a minimum value, followed by a sharp increase to initial reservoir temperature. The analytical model exhibits stabilization of the temperature profile and cooled zone. When accounting for heat gain from adjacent layers, the minimum temperature is higher compared to the case with no heat exchange. The analytical model can be used to evaluate the risks of hydrate formation and/or rock integrity during CO2 storage in depleted reservoirs.</description>

      <title>A secular solar system resonance that disrupts the dominant cycle in Earth's orbital eccentricity (g2-g5): Implications for astrochronology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The planets' gravitational interaction causes rhythmic changes in Earth's orbital parameters (also called Milankovi\'c cycles), which have powerful applications in geology and astrochronology. For instance, the primary astronomical eccentricity cycle due to the secular frequency term (g2-g5) (~405 kyr in the recent past) utilized in deep-time analyses is dominated by Venus' and Jupiter's orbits, aka long eccentricity cycle. The widely accepted and long-held view is that (g2-g5) was practically stable in the past and may hence be used as a "metronome" to reconstruct accurate ages and chronologies. However, using state-of-the-art integrations of the solar system, we show here that (g2-g5) can become unstable over long time scales, without major changes in, or destabilization of, planetary orbits. The (g2-g5) disruption is due to the secular resonance $\sigma_{12}$ = (g1 - g2) + (s1 - s2), a major contributor to solar system chaos. We demonstrate that entering/exiting the $\sigma_{12}$ resonance is a common phenomenon on long time scales, occurring in ~40% of our solutions. During $\sigma_{12}$-resonance episodes, (g2-g5) is very weak or absent and Earth's orbital eccentricity and climate-forcing spectrum are unrecognizable compared to the recent past. Our results have fundamental implications for geology and astrochronology, as well as climate forcing because the paradigm that the longest Milankovi\'c cycle dominates Earth's astronomical forcing, is stable, and has a period of ~405 kyr requires revision.</description>
