      <title>Curvature homogeneous hypersurfaces in space forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We classify curvature homogeneous hypersurfaces in S^4 and H^4. In higher dimesnsion one only has the FKM examples and an isolate one by Tsukada of a hypersurface in H^5.
  Besides some simple examples, we show that there exists an isolated hypersurface with a circle of symmetries and and a one parameter family admitting no continuous symmetries. Outside the set of minimal points, which only exists in the case of S^4, every example is locally and up to covers of this form.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new construction method for $r$-harmonic submanifolds in spheres, i.e. proper isometric $r$-harmonic immersions into spheres. Furthermore, we give new examples of $r$-harmonic spheres in spheres, possibly of high codimension. We determine index and nullity of these isometric $r$-harmonic immersions when $r=2$. Finally, we provide the normal index of these maps when $r=3$.</description>

      <title>Oberwolfach Report: Scalar Curvature Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although scalar curvature is the simplest curvature invariant, our understanding of scalar curvature has not matured to the same level as Ricci or sectional curvature. Despite this fact, many rigidity phenomenon have been established which give some of the strongest insights into scalar curvature. Important examples include Geroch's conjecture, the positive mass theorem, and Llarull's theorem. In order to further understand scalar curvature we ask corresponding geometric stability questions, where the hypotheses of the rigidity phenomenon are relaxed, and one would like to show that Riemannian manifolds which satisfy the relaxed conditions are close to the rigid objects in some topology. In this note we will survey what is known for scalar curvature stability, discuss what the questions are in this area, and introduce important tools which have been useful so far.</description>

      <title>Auxiliary Monge-Amp\`ere Equations in Orbifold Setting -- a Mean-Value Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we generalize a mean-value inequality of Guo-Phong-Sturm to the setting of a compact K\"ahler orbifold. This shows that their reasoning is insensitive to quotient singularities. As we aim for a self-contained exposition, we generalize some fundamental results, namely the $\alpha$-invariant estimate by H\"ormander and Tian, an approximation result for the psh-envelope of a $(1,1)$-form in a K\"ahler class by Berman and an $L^\infty$ estimate for this envelope by Guo-Phong-Tong-Wang.</description>

      <title>An $\infty$-Laplacian for differential forms, and calibrated laminations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Thurston and Daskalopoulos--Uhlenbeck's approach to Teichm\"uller theory, we study the behavior of $q$-harmonic functions and their $p$-harmonic conjugates in the limit as $q \to 1$, where $1/p + 1/q = 1$. The $1$-Laplacian is already known to give rise to laminations by minimal hypersurfaces; we show that the limiting $p$-harmonic conjugates converge to calibrations $F$ of the laminations. Moreover, we show that the laminations which are calibrated by $F$ are exactly those which arise from the $1$-Laplacian. We also explore the limiting dual problem as a model problem for the optimal Lipschitz extension problem, which exhibits behavior rather unlike the scalar $\infty$-Laplacian. In a companion work, we will apply the main result of this paper to associate to each class in $H^{d - 1}$ a lamination in a canonical way, and study the duality of the stable norm on $H_{d - 1}$.</description>

      <title>Solving the $KP$ problem with the Global Cartan Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometric methods have useful application for solving problems in a range of quantum information disciplines, including the synthesis of time-optimal unitaries in quantum control. In particular, the use of Cartan decompositions to solve problems in optimal control, especially lambda systems, has given rise to a range of techniques for solving the so-called $KP$-problem, where target unitaries belong to a semi-simple Lie group manifold $G$ whose Lie algebra admits a $\mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k} \oplus \mathfrak{p}$ decomposition and time-optimal solutions are represented by subRiemannian geodesics synthesised via a distribution of generators in $\mathfrak{p}$. In this paper, we propose a new method utilising global Cartan decompositions $G=KAK$ of symmetric spaces $G/K$ for generating time-optimal unitaries for targets $-iX \in [\frak{p},\frak{p}] \subset \frak{k}$ with controls $-iH(t) \in \frak{p}$. Target unitaries are parametrised as $U=kac$ where $k,c \in K$ and $a = e^{i\Theta}$ with $\Theta \in \frak{a}$. We show that the assumption of $d\Theta=0$ equates to the corresponding time-optimal unitary control problem being able to be solved analytically using variational techniques. We identify how such control problems correspond to the holonomies of a compact globally Riemannian symmetric space, where local translations are generated by $\mathfrak{p}$ and local rotations are generated by $[\mathfrak{p},\mathfrak{p}]$.</description>

      <title>A Dual Geometric Test for Forward-Flatness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Forward-flatness is a generalization of static feedback linearizability and a special case of a more general flatness concept for discrete-time systems. Recently, it has been shown that this practically quite relevant property can be checked by computing a unique sequence of involutive distributions which generalizes the well-known static feedback linearization test. In this paper, a dual test for forward-flatness based on a unique sequence of integrable codistributions is derived. Since the main mathematical operations for determining this sequence are the intersection of codistributions and the calculation of Lie derivatives of 1-forms, it is computationally quite efficient. Furthermore, the formulation with codistributions also facilitates a comparison with the existing discrete-time literature regarding the closely related topic of dynamic feedback linearization, which is mostly formulated in terms of 1-forms rather than vector fields. The presented results are illustrated by two examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.16655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop new techniques to compute the weighted $L^2$-cohomology of quasi-fibered boundary metrics (QFB-metrics). Combined with the decay of $L^2$-harmonic forms obtained in a companion paper, this allows us to compute the reduced $L^2$-cohomology for various classes of QFB-metrics. Our results applies in particular to the Nakajima metric on the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points on $\mathbb{C}^2$, for which we can show that the Vafa-Witten conjecture holds. Using the compactification of the monopole moduli space announced by Fritzsch, the first author and Singer, we can also give a proof of the Sen conjecture for the monopole moduli space of magnetic charge 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.15610v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: No Hopf-Rinow Theorem is possible in Lorentzian Geometry. Nonetheless, we prove that a spacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if it is metrically complete with respect to the null distance of a time function. Our approach is based on the observation that null distances behave particularly well for weak temporal functions in terms of regularity and causality. Specifically, we also show that the null distances of Cauchy temporal functions and regular cosmological time functions encode causality globally.</description>

Abstract: We investigate geometric evolution equations for Legendrian curves in the 3-sphere which are invariant under the action of the unitary group ${\rm U}(2)$. We define a natural symplectic structure on the space of Legendrian loops and show that the modified Korteweg-de Vries equation, along with its associated hierarchy, are realized as curvature evolutions induced by a sequence of Hamiltonian flows. For the flow among these that induces the mKdV equation, we investigate the geometry of solutions which evolve by rigid motions in ${\rm U}(2)$. Generalizations of our results to higher-order evolutions and curves in similar geometries are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.10100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we find that the integrated form $d_F$ of a complex Finsler metric $F$ is inner. The distance $d_F$ is complete if and only if every closed bounded subset of a complex manifold $M$ is compact. We prove a version of theorem for normal families of holomorphic mappings between two complex Finsler manifolds, i.e, the theorem of Montel in complex Finsler manifolds. Our results extend the basic theorem of strongly negatively curved families for a Hermitian manifold [Wu, Acta Math. 119(1967), 193-233] or [Grauert, Reckziegel, Math. Z. 89(1965), 108-125]. As applications, we obtain a complex Finsler version of theorems $A$-$F$ in [Wu, Acta Math. 119(1967), 193-233], including the Cartan-Carath\'eodory-Kaup-Wu theorem, the theorem of the automorphism group on a complex Finsler manifold and some rigid results.</description>

Abstract: A $p$-K\"ahler structure on a complex manifold of complex dimension $n$ is given by a $d$-closed transverse real $(p,p)$-form. In the paper we study the existence of $p$-K\"ahler structures on compact quotients of simply connected Lie groups by discrete subgroups endowed with an invariant complex structure. In particular, we discuss the existence of $p$-K\"ahler structures on nilmanifolds, with a focus on the case $p =2$ and complex dimension $n = 4$. Moreover, we prove that a $(n-2)$-K\"ahler almost abelian solvmanifold of complex dimension $n\geq3$ has to be K\"ahler.</description>

      <title>Examples of Ricci limit spaces with infinite holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.00619v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n\geq 3$, $\lambda \in \mathbb{R} $, and $(X,h)$ be an $n$-dimensional smooth complete Riemannian manifold with ${\rm Ric}_h &gt; \lambda $.
  In this paper, we construct, for each given $\epsilon &gt;0$, a sequence of $(n+2)$-dimensional manifolds $(M_{i} ,g_i ) \stackrel{GH}{\longrightarrow} (X_\epsilon ,d_\epsilon ) $ with ${\rm Ric}_{g_i} &gt; \lambda $, such that $d_{GH} (X,X_\epsilon ) \leq \epsilon $, and $X_\epsilon $ is homeomorphic to the space obtained by removing an infinite number of balls from $X$. Hence $X_\epsilon $ has dense boundary with an infinite number of connected components. Moreover, $X_\epsilon $ has no open subset which is topologically a manifold. This generalizes Hupp-Naber-Wang's result (arxiv: 2308.03909) from $4$-dimensional case to the general case of dimension $n\geq 3$.
  Our construction differs from that of Hupp-Naber-Wang. In their approach, Hupp-Naber-Wang considered doing an infinite number of blow-ups on the local complex surface structure of $X$, thus relying on the $4$-dimensional condition. However, our method involves removing an infinite number of balls from $X$, allowing us to construct in the general case of dimensions greater than or equal to $3$. As a corollary, we provide a solution to an open problem posed by Naber in the $3$-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>The Brioschi Formula for the Gaussian Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00835v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Brioschi formula expresses the Gaussian curvature $K$ in terms of the functions $E, F$ and $G$ in local coordinates of a surface $S$. This implies the Gauss' theorema egregium, which says that the Gaussian curvature just depends on angles, distances, and their rates of change.
  In most of the textbooks, the Gauss' theorema egregium was proved as a corollary to the derivation of the Gauss equations, a set of equations expressing $EK, FK$ and $GK$ in terms of the Christoffel symbols. The Christoffel symbols can be expressed in terms of $E$, $F$ and $G$. In principle, one can derive the Brioschi formula from the Gauss equations after some tedious calculations.
  In this note, we give a direct elementary proof of the Brioschi formula without using Christoffel symbols. The key to the proof are properties of matrices and determinants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.01681v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Landau--Ginzburg superpotential of del Pezzo surfaces can be realized as a limit of their hyperK\"ahler rotation toward the large complex structure limit point. As a corollary, we compute the limit of the complex affine structure of the special Lagrangian fibrations constructed by Collins--Jacob--Lin in $\mathbf{P}^1\times \mathbf{P}^1$ arXiv:1904.08363 and compare it with the integral affine structures used in the work of Carl--Pumperla--Siebert arXiv:2205.07753. We also construct the Floer-theoretical Landau--Ginzburg mirrors of smoothing of $A_n$-singularities and monotone del Pezzo surfaces, by using the gluing method of Cho--Hong--Lau arXiv:1810.02045 and Hong--Kim--Lau arXiv:1805.11738. They agree with the result of hyperK\"ahler rotation.</description>

      <title>Sharp spectral gap estimates for higher-order operators on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02911v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide sharp spectral gap estimates for problems involving higher-order operators (including both the clamped and buckling plate problems) on Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. The proofs are symmetrization-free -- thus no sharp isoperimetric inequality is needed -- based on two general, yet elementary functional inequalities. The spectral gap estimate for clamped plates solves a sharp asymptotic problem from Cheng and Yang [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc., 2011] concerning the behavior of higher-order eigenvalues on hyperbolic spaces, and answers a question raised in Krist\'aly [Adv. Math., 2020] on the validity of such sharp estimates in high-dimensional Cartan-Hadamard manifolds. As a byproduct of the general functional inequalities, various Rellich inequalities are established in the same geometric setting.</description>

      <title>Moduli Space of Dihedral Spherical Surfaces and Measured Foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01807v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cone spherical surfaces are orientable Riemannian surfaces with constant curvature one and a finite set of conical singularities. A subset of these surfaces, referred to as dihedral surfaces, is characterized by their monodromy groups, which notably preserve a pair of antipodal points on the unit two-sphere within three-dimensional Euclidean space. On each dihedral surface, we define a pair of transverse measured foliations that, in turn, comprehensively characterize the original dihedral surface. Furthermore, we introduce a variety of geometric decompositions and deformations specific to dihedral surfaces. As a practical application, we ascertain the dimension of the moduli space for dihedral surfaces given specified cone angles and topological types. This dimension acts as an indicator of the independent geometric parameters that determine the isometric classes of these surfaces.</description>

      <title>Functional Inequalities for Brownian Motion on Riemannian Manifolds with Sticky-Reflecting Boundary Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00206v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove geometric upper bounds for the Poincar\'e and Logarithmic Sobolev constants for Brownian motion on manifolds with sticky reflecting boundary diffusion i.e. extended Wentzell-type boundary condition under general curvature assumptions on the manifold and its boundary. The method is based on an interpolation involving energy interactions between the boundary and the interior of the manifold. As side results we obtain explicit geometric bounds on the first nontrivial Steklov eigenvalue, for the norm of the boundary trace operator on Sobolev functions, and on the boundary trace logarithmic Sobolev constant. The case of Brownian motion with pure sticky reflection is also treated.</description>

      <title>The prescribed curvature flow on the disc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13377v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For given functions $f$ and $j$ on the disc $B$ and its boundary $\partial B=S^1$, we study the existence of conformal metrics $g=e^{2u}g_0$ with prescribed Gauss curvature $K_g=f$ and boundary geodesic curvature $k_g=j$. Using the variational characterization of such metrics obtained by Cruz-Blazquez and Ruiz (2018), we show that there is a canonical negative gradient flow of such metrics, either converging to a solution of the prescribed curvature problem, or blowing up to a spherical cap. In the latter case, similar to our work Struwe (2005) on the prescribed curvature problem on the sphere, we are able to exhibit a $2$-dimensional shadow flow for the center of mass of the evolving metrics from which we obtain existence results complementing the results recently obtained by Ruiz (2021) by degree-theory.</description>
