      <title>NIC-RobustBench: A Comprehensive Open-Source Toolkit for Neural Image Compression and Robustness Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adversarial robustness of neural networks is an increasingly important area of research, combining studies on computer vision models, large language models (LLMs), and others. With the release of JPEG AI -- the first standard for end-to-end neural image compression (NIC) methods -- the question of evaluating NIC robustness has become critically significant. However, previous research has been limited to a narrow range of codecs and attacks. To address this, we present \textbf{NIC-RobustBench}, the first open-source framework to evaluate NIC robustness and adversarial defenses' efficiency, in addition to comparing Rate-Distortion (RD) performance. The framework includes the largest number of codecs among all known NIC libraries and is easily scalable. The paper demonstrates a comprehensive overview of the NIC-RobustBench framework and employs it to analyze NIC robustness. Our code is available online at https://github.com/msu-video-group/NIC-RobustBench.</description>

      <title>Xray2Xray: World Model from Chest X-rays with Volumetric Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most widely used medical imaging modality and play a pivotal role in diagnosing diseases. However, as 2D projection images, CXRs are limited by structural superposition, which constrains their effectiveness in precise disease diagnosis and risk prediction. To address the limitations of 2D CXRs, this study introduces Xray2Xray, a novel World Model that learns latent representations encoding 3D structural information from chest X-rays. Xray2Xray captures the latent representations of the chest volume by modeling the transition dynamics of X-ray projections across different angular positions with a vision model and a transition model. We employed the latent representations of Xray2Xray for downstream risk prediction and disease diagnosis tasks. Experimental results showed that Xray2Xray outperformed both supervised methods and self-supervised pretraining methods for cardiovascular disease risk estimation and achieved competitive performance in classifying five pathologies in CXRs. We also assessed the quality of Xray2Xray's latent representations through synthesis tasks and demonstrated that the latent representations can be used to reconstruct volumetric context.</description>

      <title>Staining normalization in histopathology: Method benchmarking using multicenter dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) has been the gold standard in tissue analysis for decades, however, tissue specimens stained in different laboratories vary, often significantly, in appearance. This variation poses a challenge for both pathologists' and AI-based downstream analysis. Minimizing stain variation computationally is an active area of research. To further investigate this problem, we collected a unique multi-center tissue image dataset, wherein tissue samples from colon, kidney, and skin tissue blocks were distributed to 66 different labs for routine H&amp;E staining. To isolate staining variation, other factors affecting the tissue appearance were kept constant. Further, we used this tissue image dataset to compare the performance of eight different stain normalization methods, including four traditional methods, namely, histogram matching, Macenko, Vahadane, and Reinhard normalization, and two deep learning-based methods namely CycleGAN and Pixp2pix, both with two variants each. We used both quantitative and qualitative evaluation to assess the performance of these methods. The dataset's inter-laboratory staining variation could also guide strategies to improve model generalizability through varied training data</description>

      <title>A Deep Learning Based Method for Fast Registration of Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Image registration is used in many medical image analysis applications, such as tracking the motion of tissue in cardiac images, where cardiac kinematics can be an indicator of tissue health. Registration is a challenging problem for deep learning algorithms because ground truth transformations are not feasible to create, and because there are potentially multiple transformations that can produce images that appear correlated with the goal. Unsupervised methods have been proposed to learn to predict effective transformations, but these methods take significantly longer to predict than established baseline methods. For a deep learning method to see adoption in wider research and clinical settings, it should be designed to run in a reasonable time on common, mid-level hardware. Fast methods have been proposed for the task of image registration but often use patch-based methods which can affect registration accuracy for a highly dynamic organ such as the heart.
  In this thesis, a fast, volumetric registration model is proposed for the use of quantifying cardiac strain. The proposed Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) is designed to utilize an architecture that can compute convolutions incredibly efficiently, allowing the model to achieve registration fidelity similar to other state-of-the-art models while taking a fraction of the time to perform inference. The proposed fast and lightweight registration (FLIR) model is used to predict tissue motion which is then used to quantify the non-uniform strain experienced by the tissue. For acquisitions taken from the same patient at approximately the same time, it would be expected that strain values measured between the acquisitions would have very small differences. Using this metric, strain values computed using the FLIR method are shown to be very consistent.</description>

      <title>VHU-Net: Variational Hadamard U-Net for Body MRI Bias Field Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bias field artifacts in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans introduce spatially smooth intensity inhomogeneities that degrade image quality and hinder downstream analysis. To address this challenge, we propose a novel variational Hadamard U-Net (VHU-Net) for effective body MRI bias field correction. The encoder comprises multiple convolutional Hadamard transform blocks (ConvHTBlocks), each integrating convolutional layers with a Hadamard transform (HT) layer. Specifically, the HT layer performs channel-wise frequency decomposition to isolate low-frequency components, while a subsequent scaling layer and semi-soft thresholding mechanism suppress redundant high-frequency noise. To compensate for the HT layer's inability to model inter-channel dependencies, the decoder incorporates an inverse HT-reconstructed transformer block, enabling global, frequency-aware attention for the recovery of spatially consistent bias fields. The stacked decoder ConvHTBlocks further enhance the capacity to reconstruct the underlying ground-truth bias field. Building on the principles of variational inference, we formulate a new evidence lower bound (ELBO) as the training objective, promoting sparsity in the latent space while ensuring accurate bias field estimation. Comprehensive experiments on abdominal and prostate MRI datasets demonstrate the superiority of VHU-Net over existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of intensity uniformity, signal fidelity, and tissue contrast. Moreover, the corrected images yield substantial downstream improvements in segmentation accuracy. Our framework offers computational efficiency, interpretability, and robust performance across multi-center datasets, making it suitable for clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>Deformable Medical Image Registration with Effective Anatomical Structure Representation and Divide-and-Conquer Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective representation of Regions of Interest (ROI) and independent alignment of these ROIs can significantly enhance the performance of deformable medical image registration (DMIR). However, current learning-based DMIR methods have limitations. Unsupervised techniques disregard ROI representation and proceed directly with aligning pairs of images, while weakly-supervised methods heavily depend on label constraints to facilitate registration. To address these issues, we introduce a novel ROI-based registration approach named EASR-DCN. Our method represents medical images through effective ROIs and achieves independent alignment of these ROIs without requiring labels. Specifically, we first used a Gaussian mixture model for intensity analysis to represent images using multiple effective ROIs with distinct intensities. Furthermore, we propose a novel Divide-and-Conquer Network (DCN) to process these ROIs through separate channels to learn feature alignments for each ROI. The resultant correspondences are seamlessly integrated to generate a comprehensive displacement vector field. Extensive experiments were performed on three MRI and one CT datasets to showcase the superior accuracy and deformation reduction efficacy of our EASR-DCN. Compared to VoxelMorph, our EASR-DCN achieved improvements of 10.31\% in the Dice score for brain MRI, 13.01\% for cardiac MRI, and 5.75\% for hippocampus MRI, highlighting its promising potential for clinical applications. The code for this work will be released upon acceptance of the paper.</description>

      <title>Quantitative Benchmarking of Anomaly Detection Methods in Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anomaly detection has been widely studied in the context of industrial defect inspection, with numerous methods developed to tackle a range of challenges. In digital pathology, anomaly detection holds significant potential for applications such as rare disease identification, artifact detection, and biomarker discovery. However, the unique characteristics of pathology images, such as their large size, multi-scale structures, stain variability, and repetitive patterns, introduce new challenges that current anomaly detection algorithms struggle to address. In this quantitative study, we benchmark over 20 classical and prevalent anomaly detection methods through extensive experiments. We curated five digital pathology datasets, both real and synthetic, to systematically evaluate these approaches. Our experiments investigate the influence of image scale, anomaly pattern types, and training epoch selection strategies on detection performance. The results provide a detailed comparison of each method's strengths and limitations, establishing a comprehensive benchmark to guide future research in anomaly detection for digital pathology images.</description>

      <title>Explicit Residual-Based Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years, images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods: Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over the previous work.</description>

      <title>Reconsidering Explicit Longitudinal Mammography Alignment for Enhanced Breast Cancer Risk Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular mammography screening is essential for early breast cancer detection. Deep learning-based risk prediction methods have sparked interest to adjust screening intervals for high-risk groups. While early methods focused only on current mammograms, recent approaches leverage the temporal aspect of screenings to track breast tissue changes over time, requiring spatial alignment across different time points. Two main strategies for this have emerged: explicit feature alignment through deformable registration and implicit learned alignment using techniques like transformers, with the former providing more control. However, the optimal approach for explicit alignment in mammography remains underexplored. In this study, we provide insights into where explicit alignment should occur (input space vs. representation space) and if alignment and risk prediction should be jointly optimized. We demonstrate that jointly learning explicit alignment in representation space while optimizing risk estimation performance, as done in the current state-of-the-art approach, results in a trade-off between alignment quality and predictive performance and show that image-level alignment is superior to representation-level alignment, leading to better deformation field quality and enhanced risk prediction accuracy. The code is available at https://github.com/sot176/Longitudinal_Mammogram_Alignment.git.</description>

      <title>NAADA: A Noise-Aware Attention Denoising Autoencoder for Dental Panoramic Radiographs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Convolutional denoising autoencoders (DAEs) are powerful tools for image restoration. However, they inherit a key limitation of convolutional neural networks (CNNs): they tend to recover low-frequency features, such as smooth regions, more effectively than high-frequency details. This leads to the loss of fine details, which is particularly problematic in dental radiographs where preserving subtle anatomical structures is crucial. While self-attention mechanisms can help mitigate this issue by emphasizing important features, conventional attention methods often prioritize features corresponding to cleaner regions and may overlook those obscured by noise. To address this limitation, we propose a noise-aware self-attention method, which allows the model to effectively focus on and recover key features even within noisy regions. Building on this approach, we introduce the noise-aware attention-enhanced denoising autoencoder (NAADA) network for enhancing noisy panoramic dental radiographs. Compared with the recent state of the art (and much heavier) methods like Uformer, MResDNN etc., our method improves the reconstruction of fine details, ensuring better image quality and diagnostic accuracy.</description>

      <title>Angio-Diff: Learning a Self-Supervised Adversarial Diffusion Model for Angiographic Geometry Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vascular diseases pose a significant threat to human health, with X-ray angiography established as the gold standard for diagnosis, allowing for detailed observation of blood vessels. However, angiographic X-rays expose personnel and patients to higher radiation levels than non-angiographic X-rays, which are unwanted. Thus, modality translation from non-angiographic to angiographic X-rays is desirable. Data-driven deep approaches are hindered by the lack of paired large-scale X-ray angiography datasets. While making high-quality vascular angiography synthesis crucial, it remains challenging. We find that current medical image synthesis primarily operates at pixel level and struggles to adapt to the complex geometric structure of blood vessels, resulting in unsatisfactory quality of blood vessel image synthesis, such as disconnections or unnatural curvatures. To overcome this issue, we propose a self-supervised method via diffusion models to transform non-angiographic X-rays into angiographic X-rays, mitigating data shortages for data-driven approaches. Our model comprises a diffusion model that learns the distribution of vascular data from diffusion latent, a generator for vessel synthesis, and a mask-based adversarial module. To enhance geometric accuracy, we propose a parametric vascular model to fit the shape and distribution of blood vessels. The proposed method contributes a pipeline and a synthetic dataset for X-ray angiography. We conducted extensive comparative and ablation experiments to evaluate the Angio-Diff. The results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in synthetic angiography image quality and more accurately synthesizes the geometric structure of blood vessels.

      <title>Learning from Anatomy: Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) for Improved Metastatic Bone Disease Segmentation in Whole-Body MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The segmentation of metastatic bone disease (MBD) in whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is a challenging problem. Due to varying appearances and anatomical locations of lesions, ambiguous boundaries, and severe class imbalance, obtaining reliable segmentations requires large, well-annotated datasets capturing lesion variability. Generating such datasets requires substantial time and expertise, and is prone to error. While self-supervised learning (SSL) can leverage large unlabeled datasets, learned generic representations often fail to capture the nuanced features needed for accurate lesion detection.
  In this work, we propose a Supervised Anatomical Pretraining (SAP) method that learns from a limited dataset of anatomical labels. First, an MRI-based skeletal segmentation model is developed and trained on WB-MRI scans from healthy individuals for high-quality skeletal delineation. Then, we compare its downstream efficacy in segmenting MBD on a cohort of 44 patients with metastatic prostate cancer, against both a baseline random initialization and a state-of-the-art SSL method.
  SAP significantly outperforms both the baseline and SSL-pretrained models, achieving a normalized surface Dice of 0.76 and a Dice coefficient of 0.64. The method achieved a lesion detection F2 score of 0.44, improving on 0.24 (baseline) and 0.31 (SSL). When considering only clinically relevant lesions larger than 1~ml, SAP achieves a detection sensitivity of 100% in 28 out of 32 patients.
  Learning bone morphology from anatomy yields an effective and domain-relevant inductive bias that can be leveraged for the downstream segmentation task of bone lesions. All code and models are made publicly available.</description>

      <title>Filling of incomplete sinograms from sparse PET detector configurations using a residual U-Net</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed, allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant step forward in medical imaging technology.</description>

      <title>ReCoGNet: Recurrent Context-Guided Network for 3D MRI Prostate Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prostate gland segmentation from T2-weighted MRI is a critical yet challenging task in clinical prostate cancer assessment. While deep learning-based methods have significantly advanced automated segmentation, most conventional approaches-particularly 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs)-fail to leverage inter-slice anatomical continuity, limiting their accuracy and robustness. Fully 3D models offer improved spatial coherence but require large amounts of annotated data, which is often impractical in clinical settings. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid architecture that models MRI sequences as spatiotemporal data. Our method uses a deep, pretrained DeepLabV3 backbone to extract high-level semantic features from each MRI slice and a recurrent convolutional head, built with ConvLSTM layers, to integrate information across slices while preserving spatial structure. This combination enables context-aware segmentation with improved consistency, particularly in data-limited and noisy imaging conditions. We evaluate our method on the PROMISE12 benchmark under both clean and contrast-degraded test settings. Compared to state-of-the-art 2D and 3D segmentation models, our approach demonstrates superior performance in terms of precision, recall, Intersection over Union (IoU), and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), highlighting its potential for robust clinical deployment.</description>

      <title>NeRF-based CBCT Reconstruction needs Normalization and Initialization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is widely used in medical imaging. However, the limited number and intensity of X-ray projections make reconstruction an ill-posed problem with severe artifacts. NeRF-based methods have achieved great success in this task. However, they suffer from a local-global training mismatch between their two key components: the hash encoder and the neural network. Specifically, in each training step, only a subset of the hash encoder's parameters is used (local sparse), whereas all parameters in the neural network participate (global dense). Consequently, hash features generated in each step are highly misaligned, as they come from different subsets of the hash encoder. These misalignments from different training steps are then fed into the neural network, causing repeated inconsistent global updates in training, which leads to unstable training, slower convergence, and degraded reconstruction quality. Aiming to alleviate the impact of this local-global optimization mismatch, we introduce a Normalized Hash Encoder, which enhances feature consistency and mitigates the mismatch. Additionally, we propose a Mapping Consistency Initialization(MCI) strategy that initializes the neural network before training by leveraging the global mapping property from a well-trained model. The initialized neural network exhibits improved stability during early training, enabling faster convergence and enhanced reconstruction performance. Our method is simple yet effective, requiring only a few lines of code while substantially improving training efficiency on 128 CT cases collected from 4 different datasets, covering 7 distinct anatomical regions.</description>

      <title>Systematic Review of Pituitary Gland and Pituitary Adenoma Automatic Segmentation Techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Accurate segmentation of both the pituitary gland and adenomas from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for diagnosis and treatment of pituitary adenomas. This systematic review evaluates automatic segmentation methods for improving the accuracy and efficiency of MRI-based segmentation of pituitary adenomas and the gland itself. Methods: We reviewed 34 studies that employed automatic and semi-automatic segmentation methods. We extracted and synthesized data on segmentation techniques and performance metrics (such as Dice overlap scores). Results: The majority of reviewed studies utilized deep learning approaches, with U-Net-based models being the most prevalent. Automatic methods yielded Dice scores of 0.19--89.00\% for pituitary gland and 4.60--96.41\% for adenoma segmentation. Semi-automatic methods reported 80.00--92.10\% for pituitary gland and 75.90--88.36\% for adenoma segmentation. Conclusion: Most studies did not report important metrics such as MR field strength, age and adenoma size. Automated segmentation techniques such as U-Net-based models show promise, especially for adenoma segmentation, but further improvements are needed to achieve consistently good performance in small structures like the normal pituitary gland. Continued innovation and larger, diverse datasets are likely critical to enhancing clinical applicability.</description>

      <title>Convergent and divergent connectivity patterns of the arcuate fasciculus in macaques and humans</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The organization and connectivity of the arcuate fasciculus (AF) in nonhuman primates remain contentious, especially concerning how its anatomy diverges from that of humans. Here, we combined cross-scale single-neuron tracing - using viral-based genetic labeling and fluorescence micro-optical sectioning tomography in macaques (n = 4; age 3 - 11 years) - with whole-brain tractography from 11.7T diffusion MRI. Complemented by spectral embedding analysis of 7.0T MRI in humans, we performed a comparative connectomic analysis of the AF across species. We demonstrate that the macaque AF originates in the temporal-parietal cortex, traverses the auditory cortex and parietal operculum, and projects into prefrontal regions. In contrast, the human AF exhibits greater expansion into the middle temporal gyrus and stronger prefrontal and parietal operculum connectivity - divergences quantified by Kullback-Leibler analysis that likely underpin the evolutionary specialization of human language networks. These interspecies differences - particularly the human AF's broader temporal integration and strengthened frontoparietal linkages - suggest a connectivity-based substrate for the emergence of advanced language processing unique to humans. Furthermore, our findings offer a neuroanatomical framework for understanding AF-related disorders such as aphasia and dyslexia, where aberrant connectivity disrupts language function.</description>

      <title>Experimental Assessment of Neural 3D Reconstruction for Small UAV-based Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing miniaturization of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) has expanded their deployment potential to indoor and hard-to-reach areas. However, this trend introduces distinct challenges, particularly in terms of flight dynamics and power consumption, which limit the UAVs' autonomy and mission capabilities. This paper presents a novel approach to overcoming these limitations by integrating Neural 3D Reconstruction (N3DR) with small UAV systems for fine-grained 3-Dimensional (3D) digital reconstruction of small static objects. Specifically, we design, implement, and evaluate an N3DR-based pipeline that leverages advanced models, i.e., Instant-ngp, Nerfacto, and Splatfacto, to improve the quality of 3D reconstructions using images of the object captured by a fleet of small UAVs. We assess the performance of the considered models using various imagery and pointcloud metrics, comparing them against the baseline Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that the N3DR-enhanced pipeline significantly improves reconstruction quality, making it feasible for small UAVs to support high-precision 3D mapping and anomaly detection in constrained environments. In more general terms, our results highlight the potential of N3DR in advancing the capabilities of miniaturized UAV systems.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer-Based Time-Series Image Reconstruction for Cloud-Filling Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cloud cover in multispectral imagery (MSI) poses significant challenges for early season crop mapping, as it leads to missing or corrupted spectral information. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, which is not affected by cloud interference, offers a complementary solution, but lack sufficient spectral detail for precise crop mapping. To address this, we propose a novel framework, Time-series MSI Image Reconstruction using Vision Transformer (ViT), to reconstruct MSI data in cloud-covered regions by leveraging the temporal coherence of MSI and the complementary information from SAR from the attention mechanism. Comprehensive experiments, using rigorous reconstruction evaluation metrics, demonstrate that Time-series ViT framework significantly outperforms baselines that use non-time-series MSI and SAR or time-series MSI without SAR, effectively enhancing MSI image reconstruction in cloud-covered regions.</description>

      <title>Video Compression for Spatiotemporal Earth System Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large-scale Earth system datasets, from high-resolution remote sensing imagery to spatiotemporal climate model outputs, exhibit characteristics analogous to those of standard videos. Their inherent spatial, temporal, and spectral redundancies can thus be readily exploited by established video compression techniques. Here, we present xarrayvideo, a Python library for compressing multichannel spatiotemporal datasets by encoding them as videos. Our approach achieves compression ratios of up to 250x while maintaining high fidelity by leveraging standard, well-optimized video codecs through ffmpeg. We demonstrate the library's effectiveness on four real-world multichannel spatiotemporal datasets: DynamicEarthNet (very high resolution Planet images), DeepExtremeCubes (high resolution Sentinel-2 images), ERA5 (weather reanalysis data), and the SimpleS2 dataset (high resolution multichannel Sentinel-2 images), achieving Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNRs) of 55.86, 40.60, 46.58, and 43.23 dB at 0.1 bits per pixel per band (bpppb) and 65.91, 54.28, 62.90, and 55.04 dB at 1 bpppb. We are redistributing two of these datasets, DeepExtremeCubes (2.3 Tb) and DynamicEarthNet (525 Gb), in the machine-learning-ready and cloud-ready TACO format through HuggingFace at significantly reduced sizes (270 Gb and 8.5 Gb, respectively) without compromising quality (PSNR 55.77-56.65 and 60.15). No performance loss is observed when the compressed versions of these datasets are used in their respective deep learning-based downstream tasks (next step reflectance prediction and landcover segmentation). In conclusion, xarrayvideo presents an efficient solution for handling the rapidly growing size of Earth observation datasets, making advanced compression techniques accessible and practical to the Earth science community.

      <title>Semantic Scene Graph for Ultrasound Image Explanation and Scanning Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding medical ultrasound imaging remains a long-standing challenge due to significant visual variability caused by differences in imaging and acquisition parameters. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have been used to automatically generate terminology-rich summaries orientated to clinicians with sufficient physiological knowledge. Nevertheless, the increasing demand for improved ultrasound interpretability and basic scanning guidance among non-expert users, e.g., in point-of-care settings, has not yet been explored. In this study, we first introduce the scene graph (SG) for ultrasound images to explain image content to ordinary and provide guidance for ultrasound scanning. The ultrasound SG is first computed using a transformer-based one-stage method, eliminating the need for explicit object detection. To generate a graspable image explanation for ordinary, the user query is then used to further refine the abstract SG representation through LLMs. Additionally, the predicted SG is explored for its potential in guiding ultrasound scanning toward missing anatomies within the current imaging view, assisting ordinary users in achieving more standardized and complete anatomical exploration. The effectiveness of this SG-based image explanation and scanning guidance has been validated on images from the left and right neck regions, including the carotid and thyroid, across five volunteers. The results demonstrate the potential of the method to maximally democratize ultrasound by enhancing its interpretability and usability for ordinaries.</description>

      <title>Diff-Def: Diffusion-Generated Deformation Fields for Conditional Atlases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16776v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anatomical atlases are widely used for population studies and analysis. Conditional atlases target a specific sub-population defined via certain conditions, such as demographics or pathologies, and allow for the investigation of fine-grained anatomical differences like morphological changes associated with ageing or disease. Existing approaches use either registration-based methods that are often unable to handle large anatomical variations or generative adversarial models, which are challenging to train since they can suffer from training instabilities. Instead of generating atlases directly in as intensities, we propose using latent diffusion models to generate deformation fields, which transform a general population atlas into one representing a specific sub-population. Our approach ensures structural integrity, enhances interpretability and avoids hallucinations that may arise during direct image synthesis by generating this deformation field and regularising it using a neighbourhood of images. We compare our method to several state-of-the-art atlas generation methods using brain MR images from the UK Biobank. Our method generates highly realistic atlases with smooth transformations and high anatomical fidelity, outperforming existing baselines. We demonstrate the quality of these atlases through comprehensive evaluations, including quantitative metrics for anatomical accuracy, perceptual similarity, and qualitative analyses displaying the consistency and realism of the generated atlases.</description>

      <title>IgCONDA-PET: Weakly-Supervised PET Anomaly Detection using Implicitly-Guided Attention-Conditional Counterfactual Diffusion Modeling -- a Multi-Center, Multi-Cancer, and Multi-Tracer Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimizing the need for pixel-level annotated data to train PET lesion detection and segmentation networks is highly desired and can be transformative, given time and cost constraints associated with expert annotations. Current unsupervised or weakly-supervised anomaly detection methods rely on autoencoder or generative adversarial networks (GANs) trained only on healthy data. While these approaches reduce annotation dependency, GAN-based methods are notably more challenging to train than non-GAN alternatives (such as autoencoders) due to issues such as the simultaneous optimization of two competing networks, mode collapse, and training instability. In this paper, we present the weakly-supervised $\textbf{I}$mplicitly-$\textbf{g}$uided $\textbf{CO}$u$\textbf{N}$terfactual diffusion model for $\textbf{D}$etecting $\textbf{A}$nomalies in $\textbf{PET}$ images (IgCONDA-PET). The solution is developed and validated using PET scans from six retrospective cohorts consisting of a total of 2652 cases (multi-cancer, multi-tracer) containing both local and public datasets (spanning multiple centers). The training is conditioned on image class labels (healthy vs. unhealthy) via attention modules, and we employ implicit diffusion guidance. We perform counterfactual generation which facilitates "unhealthy-to-healthy" domain translation by generating a synthetic, healthy version of an unhealthy input image, enabling the detection of anomalies through the calculated differences. The performance of our method was compared against several other deep learning based weakly-supervised or unsupervised methods as well as traditional methods like 41% SUV$_\text{max}$ thresholding. We also highlight the importance of incorporating attention modules in our network for the detection of small anomalies. The code is publicly available at: https://github.com/ahxmeds/IgCONDA-PET.git.</description>

      <title>Improved and Explainable Cervical Cancer Classification using Ensemble Pooling of Block Fused Descriptors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cervical cancer is the second most common cancer in women and causes high death rates. Earlier models for detecting cervical cancer had limited success. In this work, we propose new models that substantially outperform previous models.
  Previous studies show that pretrained ResNets extract features from cervical cancer images well. Hence, our first model involves working with three ResNets (50, 101, 152). All the existing works use only the last convolution block of their respective ResNet, which captures abstract features (e.g., shapes, objects). However, we believe that detailed features (e.g., color, edges, texture), coming from earlier convolution blocks, are equally important for cancer (specifically cervical cancer) classification. Since now the number of features become large, we use a novel feature selection technique of Global Max Pooling for detailed features and Global Average Pooling for abstract features. Hence, our second model consists of the resulting Cascaded Block Fused variants of the three ResNets. To improve the performance further, we combine and normalize the features of the three standard ResNets as well as our proposed three Cascaded Block Fused ResNets. This type of combination is also new in cancer classification domain (also in cervical cancer), and results in our third and fourth models, respectively. We use a linear SVM for classification.
  We exhaustively perform experiments on two public datasets, IARC and AnnoCerv, achieving an average performance of 97.92% and 92.97% surpassing standard ResNets performance of 90.89% and 87.97%, respectively. We outperform the competitive approach available on IARC dataset with an average gain of 13.20%, while no prior competitive work available on AnnoCerv. Additionally, we introduce a novel SHAP+LIME explainability method, accurately identifying the cancerous region in 97% of cases.</description>

      <title>MOST: MR reconstruction Optimization for multiple downStream Tasks via continual learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10394v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep learning-based Magnetic Resonance (MR) reconstruction methods have focused on generating high-quality images but often overlook the impact on downstream tasks (e.g., segmentation) that utilize the reconstructed images. Cascading separately trained reconstruction network and downstream task network has been shown to introduce performance degradation due to error propagation and domain gaps between training datasets. To mitigate this issue, downstream task-oriented reconstruction optimization has been proposed for a single downstream task. Expanding this optimization to multi-task scenarios is not straightforward. In this work, we extended this optimization to sequentially introduced multiple downstream tasks and demonstrated that a single MR reconstruction network can be optimized for multiple downstream tasks by deploying continual learning (MOST). MOST integrated techniques from replay-based continual learning and image-guided loss to overcome catastrophic forgetting. Comparative experiments demonstrated that MOST outperformed a reconstruction network without finetuning, a reconstruction network with na\"ive finetuning, and conventional continual learning methods.

      <title>VesselSAM: Leveraging SAM for Aortic Vessel Segmentation with AtrousLoRA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18185v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at https://github.com/Adnan-CAS/AtrousLora.</description>

      <title>A Contrastive Learning Foundation Model Based on Perfectly Aligned Sample Pairs for Remote Sensing Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) enables us to pre-train foundation models without costly labeled data. Among SSL methods, Contrastive Learning (CL) methods are better at obtaining accurate semantic representations in noise interference. However, due to the significant domain gap, while CL methods have achieved great success in many computer vision tasks, they still require specific adaptation for Remote Sensing (RS) images. To this end, we present a novel self-supervised method called PerA, which produces all-purpose RS features through semantically Perfectly Aligned sample pairs. Specifically, PerA obtains features from sampled views by applying spatially disjoint masks to augmented images rather than random cropping. Our framework provides high-quality features by ensuring consistency between teacher and student and predicting learnable mask tokens. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method demonstrates higher memory efficiency and can be trained with larger batches due to its sparse inputs. Additionally, the proposed method demonstrates remarkable adaptability to uncurated RS data and reduce the impact of the potential semantic inconsistency. We also collect an unlabeled pre-training dataset, which contains about 5 million RS images. We conducted experiments on multiple downstream task datasets and achieved performance comparable to previous state-of-the-art methods with a limited model scale, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. We hope this work will contribute to practical remote sensing interpretation works.</description>

      <title>crossMoDA Challenge: Evolution of Cross-Modality Domain Adaptation Techniques for Vestibular Schwannoma and Cochlea Segmentation from 2021 to 2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cross-Modality Domain Adaptation (crossMoDA) challenge series, initiated in 2021 in conjunction with the International Conference on Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI), focuses on unsupervised cross-modality segmentation, learning from contrast-enhanced T1 (ceT1) and transferring to T2 MRI. The task is an extreme example of domain shift chosen to serve as a meaningful and illustrative benchmark. From a clinical application perspective, it aims to automate Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) and cochlea segmentation on T2 scans for more cost-effective VS management. Over time, the challenge objectives have evolved to enhance its clinical relevance. The challenge evolved from using single-institutional data and basic segmentation in 2021 to incorporating multi-institutional data and Koos grading in 2022, and by 2023, it included heterogeneous routine data and sub-segmentation of intra- and extra-meatal tumour components. In this work, we report the findings of the 2022 and 2023 editions and perform a retrospective analysis of the challenge progression over the years. The observations from the successive challenge contributions indicate that the number of outliers decreases with an expanding dataset. This is notable since the diversity of scanning protocols of the datasets concurrently increased. The winning approach of the 2023 edition reduced the number of outliers on the 2021 and 2022 testing data, demonstrating how increased data heterogeneity can enhance segmentation performance even on homogeneous data. However, the cochlea Dice score declined in 2023, likely due to the added complexity from tumour sub-annotations affecting overall segmentation performance. While progress is still needed for clinically acceptable VS segmentation, the plateauing performance suggests that a more challenging cross-modal task may better serve future benchmarking.</description>

      <title>Contactless Cardiac Pulse Monitoring Using Event Cameras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09529v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm) compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.</description>
