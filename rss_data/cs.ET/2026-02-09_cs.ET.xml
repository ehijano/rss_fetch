      <title>Algebraic Reduction to Improve an Optimally Bounded Quantum State Preparation Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preparation of $n$-qubit quantum states is a cross-cutting subroutine for many quantum algorithms, and the effort to reduce its circuit complexity is a significant challenge. In the literature, the quantum state preparation algorithm by Sun et al. is known to be optimally bounded, defining the asymptotically optimal width-depth trade-off bounds with and without ancillary qubits. In this work, a simpler algebraic decomposition is proposed to separate the preparation of the real part of the desired state from the complex one, resulting in a reduction in terms of circuit depth, total gates, and CNOT count when $m$ ancillary qubits are available. The reduction in complexity is due to the use of a single operator $\Lambda$ for each uniformly controlled gate, instead of the three in the original decomposition. Using the PennyLane library, this new algorithm for state preparation has been implemented and tested in a simulated environment for both dense and sparse quantum states, including those that are random and of physical interest. Furthermore, its performance has been compared with that of M\"ott\"onen et al.'s algorithm, which is a de facto standard for preparing quantum states in cases where no ancillary qubits are used, highlighting interesting lines of development.</description>

      <title>Malicious Agent Skills in the Wild: A Large-Scale Security Empirical Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third-party agent skills extend LLM-based agents with instruction files and executable code that run on users' machines. Skills execute with user privileges and are distributed through community registries with minimal vetting, but no ground-truth dataset exists to characterize the resulting threats. We construct the first labeled dataset of malicious agent skills by behaviorally verifying 98,380 skills from two community registries, confirming 157 malicious skills with 632 vulnerabilities. These attacks are not incidental. Malicious skills average 4.03 vulnerabilities across a median of three kill chain phases, and the ecosystem has split into two archetypes: Data Thieves that exfiltrate credentials through supply chain techniques, and Agent Hijackers that subvert agent decision-making through instruction manipulation. A single actor accounts for 54.1\% of confirmed cases through templated brand impersonation. Shadow features, capabilities absent from public documentation, appear in 0\% of basic attacks but 100\% of advanced ones; several skills go further by exploiting the AI platform's own hook system and permission flags. Responsible disclosure led to 93.6\% removal within 30 days. We release the dataset and analysis pipeline to support future work on agent skill security.</description>

      <title>Temperature Scaling Attack Disrupting Model Confidence in Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive confidence serves as a foundational control signal in mission-critical systems, directly governing risk-aware logic such as escalation, abstention, and conservative fallback. While prior federated learning attacks predominantly target accuracy or implant backdoors, we identify confidence calibration as a distinct attack objective. We present the Temperature Scaling Attack (TSA), a training-time attack that degrades calibration while preserving accuracy. By injecting temperature scaling with learning rate-temperature coupling during local training, malicious updates maintain benign-like optimization behavior, evading accuracy-based monitoring and similarity-based detection. We provide a convergence analysis under non-IID settings, showing that this coupling preserves standard convergence bounds while systematically distorting confidence. Across three benchmarks, TSA substantially shifts calibration (e.g., 145% error increase on CIFAR-100) with &lt;2 accuracy change, and remains effective under robust aggregation and post-hoc calibration defenses. Case studies further show that confidence manipulation can cause up to 7.2x increases in missed critical cases (healthcare) or false alarms (autonomous driving), even when accuracy is unchanged. Overall, our results establish calibration integrity as a critical attack surface in federated learning.</description>

      <title>FaA-CAF: Modular Single-RF-Chain Near-Field mmWave Sensing via Clip-On Antenna Fabric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.06767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Near field mmWave sensing is poised to play a key role in future wireless systems, enabling environment-aware, embodied, and application adaptive operation under stringent form-factor and hardware constraints. However, achieving high spatial resolution in the near field typically requires large antenna arrays, multiple radio frequency (RF) chains, or mechanical scanning, creating a fundamental tension between spatial observability and system simplicity. This paper presents frequency as aperture clip on antenna fabric (FaACAF), a hardware efficient sensing by design architecture that synthesizes spatial aperture through the FaA paradigm using a single RF chain. FaACAF realizes a modular clip on aperture fabric, in which frequency selective clip on modules (CMs) are attached to a shared guided-wave substrate and implicitly coordinated by the instantaneous frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) excitation frequency. In this fabric, FMCW signaling simultaneously indexes the sensing aperture and orchestrates uplink/downlink signal distribution and echo multiplexing in a switch free, fully passive, and all analog manner, eliminating RF switching and multichannel front ends. An online self calibration mechanism stabilizes the frequency to aperture mapping under practical attachment variability without requiring full matrix calibration. Two case studies illustrate the robustness of the proposed approach and quantify the predictable sensing margin tradeoffs introduced by modular deployment. Overall, FaACAF demonstrates that near field spatial observability can be scaled through architectural coordination in the frequency domain rather than hardware expansion, providing a reconfigurable and hardware efficient pathway toward embodied sensing and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Towards Scalable Multi-Chip Wireless Networks with Near-Field Time Reversal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17325v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The concept of Wireless Network-on-Chip (WNoC) has emerged as a potential solution to address the escalating communication demands of modern computing systems due to its low-latency, versatility, and reconfigurability. However, for WNoC to fulfill its potential, it is essential to establish multiple high-speed wireless links across chips. Unfortunately, the compact and enclosed nature of computing packages introduces significant challenges in the form of Co-Channel Interference (CCI) and Inter-Symbol Interference (ISI), which not only hinder the deployment of multiple spatial channels, but also severely restrict the symbol rate of each individual channel. In this paper, we posit that Time Reversal (TR) could be effective in addressing both impairments in this static scenario, thanks to its spatiotemporal focusing capabilities even in the near-field. Through comprehensive full-wave simulations and bit error rate analysis in multiple chip layouts with multiple frequency bands, we provide evidence that TR can increase the symbol rate by an order of magnitude, enabling the deployment of multiple concurrent links and achieving aggregate speeds exceeding 100 Gb/s. Finally, we evaluate the impact of reducing the sampling rate of the TR filter on the achievable speeds, paving the way to practical TR-based wireless communications at the chip scale.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Framework for Protein Binding-Site Structure Prediction on Utility-Level Quantum Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of protein active-site structures remains a central challenge in structural biology, particularly for short and flexible peptide fragments where conventional and simulation-based methods often fail. Here, we present a quantum computing framework specifically developed for utility-level quantum processors to address this problem. Starting from an amino acid sequence, we formulate structure prediction as a ground-state energy minimization problem using the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE). Amino acid connectivity is encoded on a tetrahedral lattice model, and structural constraints-including steric, geometric, and chirality terms-are mapped into a problem-specific Hamiltonian represented as sparse Pauli operators. Optimization is performed with a two-stage architecture that separates energy estimation from measurement decoding, enabling noise mitigation under realistic device conditions. We evaluate the framework on 23 randomly selected protein fragments from the PDBbind dataset and 7 fragments from therapeutically relevant proteins, and execute experiments on the IBM-Cleveland Clinic quantum processor. Predictions are benchmarked against AlphaFold 3 (AF3) and classical simulation-based approaches using identical postprocessing and docking procedures. Our method outperforms both AF3 and classical baselines in RMSD (root-mean-square deviation) and docking efficacy. These results demonstrate an end-to-end, hardware-executable pipeline for biologically relevant structure prediction on real quantum processors, highlighting its engineering feasibility and practical advantages over existing classical and deep learning approaches.</description>

      <title>Wireless Sensing of Temperature, Strain and Crack Growth in 3D-Printed Metal Structures via Magneto-Responsive Inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the first realization of wireless strain, temperature and crack growth sensing within 3D-printed metallic structures using standard electromagnetic inspection hardware. This establishes a path toward need-based maintenance for parts operating in harsh environments driven by accurate, real-time damage assessments instead of relying on regularly scheduled maintenance teardowns. To this end, we encapsulate and embed magnetoelastic and thermomagnetic materials during additive manufacturing. Mechanical and thermal stimuli affect the magnetic permeability of the embedded materials, which modulates the flux through a coil placed on or near the part's surface. We demonstrate strain sensing accurate to +/-27x10-6 and temperature sensing accurate to +/-0.75 oC. We highlight these sensors' capabilities by detecting the onset of plasticity and fatigue-driven crack growth thousands of cycles before critical failure.</description>

      <title>Encoding Tactile Stimuli for Braille Recognition with Organoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study proposes a transferable encoding strategy that maps tactile sensor data to electrical stimulation patterns, enabling neural organoids to perform an open-loop artificial tactile Braille classification task. Human forebrain organoids cultured on a low-density microelectrode array (MEA) are systematically stimulated to characterize the relationship between electrical stimulation parameters (number of pulse, phase amplitude, phase duration, and trigger delay) and organoid responses, measured as spike activity and spatial displacement of the center of activity. Implemented on event-based tactile inputs recorded from the Evetac sensor, our system achieved an average Braille letter classification accuracy of 61% with a single organoid, which increased significantly to 83% when responses from a three-organoid ensemble were combined. Additionally, the multi-organoid configuration demonstrated enhanced robustness against various types of artificially introduced noise. This research demonstrates the potential of organoids as low-power, adaptive bio-hybrid computational elements and provides a foundational encoding framework for future scalable bio-hybrid computing architectures.</description>
