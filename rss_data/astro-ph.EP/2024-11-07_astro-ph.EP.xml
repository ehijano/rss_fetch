      <title>MARFA: An Effective Line-by-line Tool for Calculating Absorption Coefficients and Cross-sections in Planetary Atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present MARFA (Molecular atmospheric Absorption with Rapid and Flexible Analysis) -- a streamlined efficient tool for line-by-line calculation of atmospheric absorption signatures in the form of PT lookup tables, which may be used in radiative transfer codes. The tool is intended for computations in the IR and visible spectral regions. Core line-by-line scheme features nine-grid interpolation technique, which strikes good balance between speed and accuracy for calculations in the scenario of unknown continuum function and large lines cut-offs. The model features high flexibility, allowing fast recalculations with different line shapes, $\chi$-factors, line cut-offs conditions, and other parameters, making it valuable for planetary studies where atmospheric and spectroscopic data are sparse or uncertain. The MARFA tool is provided in two ways: through a web interface for onboarding and immediate usage, and as open-source code available in a public repository for advanced utilization, development and contributions.</description>

      <title>Exo-Daisy World: Revisiting Gaia Theory through an Informational Architecture Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03421v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Daisy World model has long served as a foundational framework for understanding the self-regulation of planetary biospheres, providing insights into the feedback mechanisms that may govern inhabited exoplanets. In this study, we extend the classic Daisy World model through the lens of Semantic Information Theory (SIT), aiming to characterize the information flow between the biosphere and planetary environment -- what we term the \emph{information architecture} of Daisy World systems. Our objective is to develop novel methodologies for analyzing the evolution of coupled planetary systems, including biospheres and geospheres, with implications for astrobiological observations and the identification of agnostic biosignatures. To operationalize SIT in this context, we introduce a version of the Daisy World model tailored to reflect potential conditions on M-dwarf exoplanets, formulating a system of stochastic differential equations that describe the co-evolution of the daisies and their planetary environment. Analysis of this Exo-Daisy World model reveals how correlations between the biosphere and environment intensify with rising stellar luminosity, and how these correlations correspond to distinct phases of information exchange between the coupled systems. This \emph{rein control} provides a quantitative description of the informational feedback between the biosphere and its host planet. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our approach for developing detailed ExoGaia models of inhabited exoplanetary systems, proposing new avenues for interpreting astrobiological data and exploring biosignature candidates.</description>

      <title>Formation of Terrestrial Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our understanding of the process of terrestrial planet formation has grown markedly over the past 20 years, yet key questions remain. This review begins by first addressing the critical, earliest stage of dust coagulation and concentration. While classic studies revealed how objects that grow to $\sim$meter sizes are rapidly removed from protoplanetary disks via orbital decay (seemingly precluding growth to larger sizes), this chapter addresses how this is resolved in contemporary, streaming instability models that favor rapid planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse of solids in over-dense regions. Once formed, planetesimals grow into Mars-Earth-sized planetary embryos by a combination of pebble- and planetesimal accretion within the lifetime of the nebular disk. After the disk dissipates, these embryos typically experience a series of late giant impacts en route to attaining their final architectures. This review also highlights three different inner Solar System formation models that can match a number of empirical constraints, and also reviews ways that one or more might be ruled out in favor of another in the near future. These include (1) the Grand Tack, (2) the Early Instability and (3) Planet Formation from Rings. Additionally, this chapter discusses formation models for the closest known analogs to our own terrestrial planets: super-Earths and terrestrial exoplanets in systems also hosting gas giants. Finally, this review lays out a chain of events that may explain why the Solar System looks different than more than 99% of exoplanet systems.</description>

      <title>The Aegis Orbit Determination and Impact Monitoring System and services of the ESA NEOCC web portal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NEO Coordination Centre (NEOCC) of the European Space Agency is an operational centre that, among other activities, computes the orbits of near-Earth objects and their probabilities of impact with the Earth. The NEOCC started providing information about near-Earth objects in 2012 on a dedicated web portal, accessible at https://neo.ssa.esa.int/. Since the beginning of the operational phase, many developments and improvements have been implemented regarding the software, the data provided, and the portal. One of the most important upgrades is that the NEOCC is now independently providing data through a newly developed Orbit Determination and Impact Monitoring system, named Aegis. All the data computed by Aegis is publicly available on the NEOCC web portal, and Aegis is also used to maintain all the major services offered. The most important services comprise an orbital catalogue of all known asteroids, a list of possible future impacts with the Earth (also called Risk List), a list of forthcoming close approaches, a set of graphical toolkits, and an on-demand ephemerides service. Many of the services are also available through dedicated APIs, which can be used to automatically retrieve data. Here we give an overview of the algorithms implemented in the Aegis software, and provide a summary of the services offered by the NEOCC that are supported by Aegis.</description>

      <title>Limits to dynamic range in GHz-THz single-dish planetary spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When bright solar-system objects are observed by GHz-THz regime telescopes, off-axis signals bounce around locally and re-enter the signal path with a time delay, causing sinusoidal ripples in output spectra. Ripples that are unstable over time are challenging to remove. A typical detection limit for planetary spectral lines is a fraction of order 0.001 of continuum signal, restricting searches for minor atmospheric trace-gases. Modern wideband spectra of Venus demonstrate a plethora of effects, at three example telescopes spanning nearly a factor of 50 in frequency. Characterisation of instrumental effects as families of pure sine-waves via Fourier-analysis is shown to improve dynamic range by factors of a few. An example upper limit on sulphuric acid vapour in the Venusian mesosphere, from fully-automated data-cleaning of a 3.5 GHz band containing 10 line components, goes as deep as the best previously-published limit. The most challenging cases are searches for single lines of width comparable to ripple periods. Traditional polynomial-fitting approaches can be deployed to test for false positives, to demonstrate robustness at a level of zero 'fake lines' in more than 1000 comparisons. Fourier-based data-cleaning avoids subjectivity and can be fully automated, and synthetic spectra can be injected before processing to test to what degree signals are lost in cleaning. An ideal robustness strategy is mitigation at the data-acquisition stage, e.g. using slow drifts in target-velocity with respect to the telescope to isolate a planetary line from a quasi-static instrumental ripple pattern.</description>

      <title>Temporal and chromatic variation of polarized scattered light in the outer disk of PDS 70</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04091v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: PDS 70 is a unique system as it hosts a protoplanetary disk with two confirmed forming planets, making it an ideal target for characterizing dust in such disks. We present new high-contrast polarimetric differential imaging of PDS 70 using the $N\_R$ filter on SPHERE/ZIMPOL, combined with archival VLT/SPHERE data across five wavelengths ($N\_R$, $VBB$, $J$, $H$, and $Ks$) spanning seven epochs over eight years. For each epoch, we corrected smearing effects from instrument resolution, analyzed azimuthal brightness profiles, and derived intrinsic disk-integrated polarized reflectivity and brightness contrasts. Our analysis reveals significant temporal variability in both integrated polarized reflectivity and azimuthal brightness profiles, suggesting variable shadowing on the outer disk from unresolved inner disk structures. Nonetheless, we observe a systematic wavelength-dependent contrast between the near and far sides of the inclined disk, highlighting the need to consider shadowing from the inner disk and surface geometry of the reflecting disk in data interpretation.</description>

      <title>Host-star and exoplanet composition: Polluted white dwarf reveals depletion of moderately refractory elements in planetary material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets form from the same cloud of molecular gas and dust as their host stars. Confirming if planetary bodies acquire the same refractory element composition as their natal disc during formation, and how efficiently volatile elements are incorporated into growing planets, is key to linking the poorly constrained interior composition of rocky exoplanets to the observationally-constrained composition of their host star. Such comparisons also afford insight into the planet formation process. This work compares planetary composition with host-star composition using observations of a white dwarf that has accreted planetary material and its F-type star wide binary companion as a reference for the composition of the natal molecular gas and dust. Spectroscopic analysis reveals abundances of Fe, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti in both stars. We use the white dwarf measurements to estimate the composition of the exoplanetary material and the F-type companion to constrain the composition of the material the planet formed from. Comparing planetary material to the composition of its natal cloud, our results reveal that the planetary material is depleted in moderate refractories (Mg, Si, Fe) relative to the refractory material (Ca, Ti). Grouping elements based on their condensation temperatures is key to linking stellar and planetary compositions. Fractionation during formation or subsequent planetary evolution leads to the depletion of moderate refractories from the planetary material accreted by the white dwarf. This signature, as seen for bulk Earth, will likely be present in the composition of many exoplanets relative to their host-stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detecting exoplanets and other faint sources of emitted and reflected light near a bright star requires deeply suppressing the starlight while efficiently transmitting the dim light from its surroundings. This suppression can be carried out by coronagraphs, nulling interferometers, and starshades. This chapter provides a brief overview of these technologies, emphasizing coronagraphs.</description>

      <title>A high resolution simulation of protoplanetary disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A high resolution fourth-order Pad\'e scheme is used to simulate locally isothermal 3D disk turbulence driven by the vertical shear instability (VSI) using 268.4 M points. In the early non-linear period of axisymmetric VSI, angular momentum transport by vertical jets creates correlated N-shaped radial profiles of perturbation vertical and azimuthal velocity. This implies dominance of positive perturbation vertical vorticity layers and a recently discovered angular momentum staircase with respect to radius ($r$). These features are present in 3D in a weaker form. The 3D flow consists of vertically and azimuthally coherent turbulent shear layers with small vortices with all three components are active. Previously observed large persistent vortices in the interior of the domain driven by the Rossby wave instability are absent. We speculate that this is due to a weaker angular momentum staircase in 3D in the present simulations than in a previous simulation. The turbulent viscosity parameter $\alpha(r)$ increases linearly with $r$. At intermediate resolution, the value of $\alpha(r)$ at mid-radius is close to that of a previous simulation. The specific kinetic energy spectrum with respect to radial wavenumber has a power law region with exponent $-1.84$, close to the value $-2$ expected for shear layers. The spectrum with respect to azimuthal wavenumber has a $-5/3$ region and lacks a $-5$ region reported in an earlier study. Finally, it is found axisymmetric VSI has artifacts at late times, including a very strong angular momentum staircase, which in 3D is present weakly in the upper layers of the disk.</description>

      <title>Redshifting the Study of Cold Brown Dwarfs and Exoplanets: the Mid-Infrared Wavelength Region as an Indicator of Surface Gravity and Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: JWST is opening many avenues for exploration. For cold brown dwarfs and exoplanets, JWST has opened the door to the mid-infrared wavelength region, where such objects emit significant energy. For the first time, astronomers have access to mid-infrared spectroscopy for objects colder than 600 K. The first spectra appear to validate the model suite known as ATMO 2020++: atmospheres which include disequilibrium chemistry and have a non-adiabatic pressure-temperature relationship. Preliminary fits to JWST spectroscopy of Y dwarfs show that the slope of the energy distribution from lambda = 4.5 um to lambda = 10 um is very sensitive to gravity. We explore this phenomenon using PH3-free ATMO 2020++ models and updated WISE W2 - W3 colors. We find that an absolute 4.5 um flux measurement constrains temperature, and the ratio of the 4.5 um flux to the 10 - 15 um flux is sensitive to gravity and less sensitive to metallicity. We identify 10 T dwarfs with red W2 - W3 colors which are likely to be very low gravity, young, few-Jupiter-mass objects; one of these is the previously known COCONUTS-2b. The unusual Y dwarf WISEPA J182831.08+265037.8 is blue in W2 - W3 and we find that the 4 to 18 um JWST spectrum is well reproduced if the system is a pair of high gravity 400 K dwarfs. Recently published JWST colors and luminosity-based effective temperatures for late-T and Y dwarfs further corroborate the ATMO 2020++ models, demonstrating the potential for significant improvement in our understanding of cold very low-mass bodies in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Half a Million Binary Stars identified from the low resolution spectra of LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binary stars are prevalent yet challenging to detect. We present a novel approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to identify binary stars from low-resolution spectra obtained by the LAMOST survey. The CNN is trained on a dataset that distinguishes binaries from single main sequence stars based on their positions on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The network achieves high accuracy with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.949 on the test set. Its performance is further validated against known eclipsing binaries (97% detection rate) and binary stars identified by radial velocity variations (92% detection rate). Applying the trained CNN to a sample of one million main sequence stars from LAMOST DR10 and Gaia DR3 yields a catalog of 468,634 binary stars. This catalog includes 115 binary stars located beyond 10 kpc from the Sun and 128 cross-matched with known exoplanet hosts from the NASA Exoplanet Archive. This new catalog provides a valuable resource for future research on the properties, formation, and evolution of binary systems, particularly for statistically characterizing large populations.</description>

      <title>Normal forms for the Laplace resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2102.07671v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a comprehensive model for systems locked in the Laplace resonance. The framework is based on the simplest possible dynamical structure provided by the Keplerian problem perturbed by the resonant coupling truncated at second order in the eccentricities. The reduced Hamiltonian, constructed by a transformation to resonant coordinates, is then submitted to a suitable ordering of the terms and to the study of its equilibria. Henceforth, resonant normal forms are computed. The main result is the identification of two different classes of equilibria. In the first class, only one kind of stable equilibrium is present: the paradigmatic case is that of the Galilean system. In the second class, three kinds of stable equilibria are possible and at least one of them is characterised by a high value of the forced eccentricity for the `first planet': here the paradigmatic case is the exo-planetary system GJ-876, in which the combination of libration centers admits triple conjunctions otherwise not possible in the Galilean case. The normal form obtained by averaging with respect to the free eccentricity oscillations, describes the libration of the Laplace argument for arbitrary amplitudes and allows us to determine the libration width of the resonance. The agreement of the analytic predictions with the numerical integration of the toy models is very good.</description>

      <title>First Comparative Exoplanetology Within a Transiting Multi-planet System: Comparing the atmospheres of V1298 Tau b and c</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The V1298 Tau system (20-30Myr), is a benchmark young multi-planet system that provides the opportunity to perform comparative exoplanetology between planets orbiting the same star right after their formation.
  We present the first atmospheric comparison between two planets in the same transiting system: V1298 Tau b and V1298 Tau c. We derive constraints on the mass of planet b and c (&lt;20M$_\oplus$ at 3$\sigma$ confidence level and $17_{-6}^{+13} M_{\oplus}$ respectively) and atmospheric metallicity (logZ/Z$_\odot$=-2.04$_{-0.59}^{0.69}$, -0.16$_{-0.94}^{1.15}$ respectively) from atmospheric retrievals. The V1298 Tau planets, are likely to be similar in terms of mass at the current age, implying that both planets are potential sub-Neptune/super-Earth progenitors. However, planet c is expected to lose a higher fraction of its mass compared to planet b given its close proximity to the host star. Alternatively, the observed spectrum of planet c can be explained by atmospheric hazes, which is in contrast to planet b where efficient haze formation can be ruled out. Higher haze formation efficiency in planet c could be due to differences in atmospheric composition, temperature and higher UV flux incident compared to planet b.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Stability of the Laplace Resonance</title>

Abstract: We analyse the stability of the de Sitter equilibria in multi-resonant planetary systems. The de Sitter equilibrium is the dynamical state of the Laplace resonance in which all resonant arguments are librating. The sequence of equilibria exists all along the possible states balancing resonance offsets and forced eccentricities. Possible additional new-de Sitter equilibria may exist when at least one of the forced eccentricities is large (the paradigmatic case is Gliese-876). In the present work, these families of equilibria are traced up to crossing exact commensurability, where approximate first-order solutions diverge. Explicit exact location of the equilibria are determined allowing us to verify the Lyapunov stability of the standard de Sitter equilibrium and of the stable branches of the additional ones.</description>

      <title>Planet Migration in Windy Discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>

      <title>Condensation and the Volatility Trend of the Earth</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes condensation of the elements and use of condensation temperatures (Tcond) to interpret the volatility trend of the Earth. Major points are: (1) a listing of updated 50% Tcond for all natural elements and Pu at 1e-2 to 1e-8 bar pressure for solar composition matter. (2) The Tcond are mainly controlled by the Gibbs energy of condensation reactions and also by the Gibbs energy of ideal mixing if elements (compounds) condense in a solution. The Gibbs energy change of non-ideal solution (activity coefficients not equal to 1) is a secondary effect. (3) The theoretically correct relationship between Tcond and fraction condensed is derived from mass balance and chemical thermodynamic considerations. (4) The maximum amount of element condensed per 1/T, is at the inflection point in the logistic (sigmoid) curve for an element, which is also at (or close to) the 50% Tcond. (5) Plots of normalized elemental abundances versus 50% Tcond (volatility trends) are qualitative indicators of elemental fractionations due to volatility. (6) Volatility trend plots for average elemental abundances in CM, CO, CV, CR, H, L, LL, EH, EL chondrites show different trends for moderately and highly volatile elements, which may be linear, curved, a step function, or plateau. Comparison of three abundance sets for CM and CV chondrites shows trends depend on which elements are plotted, which data sources are used, and which temperature range is considered. (7) Proposed mechanisms for volatile element depletion in carbonaceous chondrites and the Earth are reviewed. (8) Possible implications of volatile element abundances in the bulk silicate Earth are discussed.</description>

      <title>Activity of main-belt comet 324P/La Sagra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the activity evolution of the main-belt comet 324P/La Sagra over time and the properties of its emitted dust. We performed aperture photometry on images taken by a wide range of telescopes at optical and thermal infrared wavelengths between 2010 and 2021. We derived the combined scattering cross section of the nucleus and dust (when present) as a function of time, and we derived the thermal emission properties. Fitting an IAU H-G phase function to the data obtained when 324P was likely inactive, we derived an absolute nucleus magnitude $H_R = (18.4 \pm 0.5)$ mag using $G = 0.15 \pm 0.12$. The activity of 324P/La Sagra during the 2015 perihelion passage has significantly decreased compared to the previous perihelion passage in 2010, and it decreased even further during the 2021 perihelion passage. This decrease in activity may be attributed to mantling or to the depletion of volatile substances. The $Af\rho$ profile analysis of the coma of the main-belt comet suggests a near-perihelion transition from a lower-activity pre-perihelion to a higher-activity post-perihelion steady state. We calculate a dust geometric albedo in the range of (2 - 45)%, which prevents us from constraining the spectral type of 324P/La Sagra, but we found an indication of dust superheating at 4.5 micrometers.</description>

      <title>An exact analytical solution for the weakly magnetized flow around an axially symmetric paraboloid, with application to magnetosphere models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.07419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.07419v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rotationally symmetric bodies with longitudinal cross sections of parabolic shape are frequently used to model astrophysical objects, such as magnetospheres and other blunt objects, immersed in interplanetary or interstellar gas or plasma flows. We discuss a simple formula for the potential flow of an incompressible fluid around an elliptic paraboloid whose axis of symmetry coincides with the direction of incoming flow. Prescribing this flow, we derive an exact analytical solution to the induction equation of ideal magnetohydrodynamics for the case of an initially homogeneous magnetic field of arbitrary orientation being passively advected in this flow. Our solution procedure employs Euler potentials and Cauchy's integral formalism based on the flow's stream function and isochrones. Furthermore, we use a particular renormalization procedure that allows us to generate more general analytical expressions modeling the deformations experienced by arbitrary scalar or vector-valued fields embedded in the flow as they are advected first toward and then past the parabolic obstacle. Finally, both the velocity field and the magnetic field embedded therein are generalized from incompressible to mildly compressible flow, where the associated density distribution is found from Bernoulli's principle.</description>

      <title>Possibilities for methanogenic and acetogenic life in molecular cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to panspermia, life on Earth may have originated from life forms transported through space from elsewhere. These life forms could have passed through molecular clouds, where the process of methanogenesis could have provided enough energy to sustain living organisms. In this study, we have calculated the Gibbs free energy released from synthesizing hydrocarbons for methanogenic (acetogenic) life in a molecular cloud, with methane (acetic acid) as the final metabolic product. Our calculations demonstrate that the chemical reactions during methanogenesis can release enough free energy to support living organisms. The methanogenic life may have served as the predecessor of life on Earth, and there is some preliminary evidence from various molecular biology studies to support this idea. Furthermore, we propose a potential distinguishing signal to test our model.</description>
