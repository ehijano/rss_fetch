      <title>Sensitivity Comparison of Rydberg Atom-Based Radio-Frequency Electric Field Detection: Ionization Current Versus Optical Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a technique for detecting radio-frequency (RF) electric fields in a Cesium (Cs) vapor cell at room temperature by collecting charge from ionized Rydberg atoms and compare its performance with the established method of electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). By applying a known RF field, we measure the response from both the electrical (ionization current-based) and optical (EIT-based) readouts. The ionization current-based method yields a sensitivity of 22~$\mu$Vm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$, while the EIT-based method achieves 3.7~$\mu$Vm$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1/2}$. The sensitivity of the ionization current-based method is limited by thermal noise arising from a 2.2~k$\Omega$ resistance between the collection electrodes, attributed to a thin Cs film on the inner surfaces of the vapor cell. Controlling or eliminating the Cs layer can significantly improve the sensitivity of this ionization approach.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared high resolution overtone spectroscopy of the hydronium ion H$_3$O$^+$: the $2\nu_3^{2+}$ and $2\nu_3^{2-}$ bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents the rovibrational spectra of the two strongest first overtone bands of the asymmetric stretching mode $\nu_3$ ($2\nu_3^{2+}$ and $2\nu_3^{2-}$) of the hydronium ion, H$_3$O$^+$. The measurements were performed in a temperature-variable cryogenic 22 pole ion trap using leak-out spectroscopy (LOS), covering an energy range of $6750-6950$ cm$^{-1}$.
  The spectra were fit with a standard oblate symmetric top Hamiltonian and additional off-diagonal matrix elements accounting for $l$-doubling to obtain the spectroscopic constants and the band origins, which were determined to be $6845.610(14)$ cm$^{-1}$ for $2\nu_3^{2+}$ and $6878.393(13)$ cm$^{-1}$ for $2\nu_3^{2-}$.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Atomic Fine Structure Determination with Graph Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic data determined by analysis of observed atomic spectra are essential for plasma diagnostics. For each low-ionisation open d- and f-subshell atomic species, around $10^3$ fine structure level energies can be determined through years of analysis of $10^4$ observable spectral lines. We propose the automation of this task by casting the analysis procedure as a Markov decision process and solving it by graph reinforcement learning using reward functions learned on historical human decisions. In our evaluations on existing spectral line lists and theoretical calculations for Co II and Nd II-III, hundreds of level energies were computed within hours, agreeing with published values in 95% of cases for Co II and 54-87% for Nd II-III. As the current efficiency in atomic fine structure determination struggles to meet growing atomic data demands from astronomy and fusion science, our new artificial intelligence approach sets the stage for closing this gap.</description>

      <title>Detecting milli-Hz gravitational waves with optical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.</description>

      <title>Exploring confinement transitions in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories with dipolar atoms beyond one dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement of particles into bound states is a phenomenon spanning from high-energy to condensed matter physics, which can be studied in the framework of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). Achieving a comprehensive understanding of confinement continues to pose a major challenge, in particular at finite matter density and in the presence of strong quantum fluctuations. State-of-the-art quantum simulators constitute a promising platform to address this problem. Here we study confinement in coupled chains of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, that can be mapped to a mixed-dimensional (mixD) XXZ model. We perform large-scale numerical matrix-product state calculations to obtain the phase diagram of this model, in which we uncover striped phases formed by the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges that can be melted at finite temperature or by increasing the tunneling rate. To explore this setting experimentally, we use our quantum simulator constituted by erbium atoms with dipolar interactions in a quantum gas microscope, and observe the predicted melting of a stripe phase by increasing the particle tunneling rate. Our explorative experimental studies of thermal deconfinement of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ charges motivate our further theoretical study of the mixD $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT, in which we predict a confined meson gas at finite temperature and low magnetization where thermal fluctuations destroy stripes but enable spontaneous commensurate spin order. Overall, we demonstrate that our platform can be used to study confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs coupled to matter fields, including long-range interactions and beyond one dimension, paving the way for future research of confinement in the quantum many-body regime.</description>
