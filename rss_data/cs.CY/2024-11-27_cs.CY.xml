      <title>Factors Influencing the Usage of Mobile Banking Apps Among Malaysian Consumers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobile banking apps have transformed the banking sector by offering customers with convenient, secure and easily accessible financial services. Even so, it is crucial for banks and the mobile banking apps developers to understand the factors that influence the utilisation of these apps among Malaysian consumer. This study will examine the influence of several factors which are security concerns, service quality, technological factors and convenience, on the usage of mobile banking apps. The study aims to discover the key factors that affect the usage of mobile banking apps. A quantitative research method was utilised, which involves the collection of data from an online survey. The survey managed to collect data from 152 respondents who are above 18 years old and users of mobile banking apps in Malaysia. The data was analysed with correlation analyses to examine the relationship between the variables. A multinominal logistic regression model was used as a predictive model to predict the usage of mobile banking apps. This study contributes to existing researches by highlighting the importance of security and convenience into the development and marketing strategies of mobile banking apps. The study can help them conduct improvements on their current apps and thus increase the usage of mobile banking apps among consumers in Malaysia.</description>

      <title>Benefits and Risks of Using ChatGPT4 as a Teaching Assistant for Computer Science Students</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon release, ChatGPT3.5 shocked the software engineering community by its ability to generate answers to specialized questions about coding. Immediately, many educators wondered if it was possible to use the chatbot as a support tool that helps students answer their programming questions. This article evaluates this possibility at three levels: fundamental Computer Science knowledge (basic algorithms and data structures), core competency (design patterns), and advanced knowledge (quantum computing). In each case, we ask normalized questions several times to ChatGPT3.5, then look at the correctness of answers, and finally check if this creates issues. The main result is that the performances of ChatGPT3.5 degrades drastically as the specialization of the domain increases: for basic algorithms it returns answers that are almost always correct, for design patterns the generated code contains many code smells and is generally of low quality, but it is still sometimes able to fix it (if asked), and for quantum computing it is often blatantly wrong.</description>

      <title>The Dual Impact of Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: Balancing Advancements with Ethical and Operational Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synchronic and diachronic study of the evolution of Artificial Intelligence (AI) unveils one prominent fact that its effect can be traced in almost all fields such as healthcare industry. The growth is perceived holistically in software, hardware implementation, or application in these various fields. As the title suggests, the review will highlight the impact of AI on healthcare possibly in all dimensions including precision medicine, diagnostics, drug development, automation of the process, etc., explicating whether AI is a blessing or a curse or both. With the availability of enough data and analysis to examine the topic at hand, however, its application is still functioning in quite early stages in many fields, the present work will endeavour to provide an answer to the question. This paper takes a close look at how AI is transforming areas such as diagnostics, precision medicine, and drug discovery, while also addressing some of the key ethical challenges it brings. Issues like patient privacy, safety, and the fairness of AI decisions are explored to understand whether AI in healthcare is a positive force, a potential risk, or perhaps both.</description>

      <title>Exploring the determinants on massive open online courses continuance learning intention in business toward accounting context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive open online courses (MOOC) have become important in the learning journey of college students and have been extensively implemented in higher education. However, there are few studies that investigated the willingness to continue using Massive open online courses (MOOC) in the field of business in higher education. Therefore, this paper proposes a comprehensive theoretical research framework based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). In the field of business, a representative accounting course is taken as an example. We adopt the questionnaire survey method and use the partial least squares structural equation model to analyze the collected feedback data from college students and test the hypotheses. This paper focuses on the potential influencing factors and mechanisms of the willingness to continuously use Massive open online courses (MOOC) in accounting. The results show that interface convenience (IC) and interface design aesthetics (IDA) have positive effects on user attitude (ATT). User attitude (ATT), perceived behavioral control (PBC), and subjective norms (SN) have positive effects on the continuance learning intention. In addition, academic self-efficacy (EF) not only significantly affects continuance learning intention (CI) but also moderates the relationship between the Theory of Planned Behavior (user attitude, perceived behavior control, subjective norms) and the continuance learning intention of accounting MOOC. Therefore, the Theory of Planned Behavior(TPB) is extended in social science accounting Massive open online courses environment. Based on these findings, this paper provides several theoretical and practical implications for researchers and practitioners of MOOC, accounting, and the design of learning systems in higher education contexts.</description>

      <title>A Clinical Trial Design Approach to Auditing Language Models in Healthcare Setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an audit mechanism for language models, with a focus on models deployed in the healthcare setting. Our proposed mechanism takes inspiration from clinical trial design where we posit the language model audit as a single blind equivalence trial, with the comparison of interest being the subject matter experts. We show that using our proposed method, we can follow principled sample size and power calculations, leading to the requirement of sampling minimum number of records while maintaining the audit integrity and statistical soundness. Finally, we provide a real-world example of the audit used in a production environment in a large-scale public health network.</description>

      <title>Post Guidance for Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective content moderation in online communities is often a delicate balance between maintaining content quality and fostering user participation. In this paper, we introduce post guidance, a novel approach to community moderation that proactively guides users' contributions using rules that trigger interventions as users draft a post to be submitted. For instance, rules can surface messages to users, prevent post submissions, or flag posted content for review. This uniquely community-specific, proactive, and user-centric approach can increase adherence to rules without imposing additional burdens on moderators. We evaluate a version of Post Guidance implemented on Reddit, which enables the creation of rules based on both post content and account characteristics, via a large randomized experiment, capturing activity from 97,616 posters in 33 subreddits over 63 days. We find that Post Guidance (1) increased the number of ``successful posts'' (posts not removed after 72 hours), (2) decreased moderators' workload in terms of manually-reviewed reports, (3) increased contribution quality, as measured by community engagement, and (4) had no impact on posters' own subsequent activity, within communities adopting the feature. Post Guidance on Reddit was similarly effective for community veterans and newcomers, with greater benefits in communities that used the feature more extensively. Our findings indicate that post guidance represents a transformative approach to content moderation, embodying a paradigm that can be easily adapted to other platforms to improve online communities across the Web.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Fragmentation of the Social Media Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The entertainment-driven dynamics of social media platforms encourage users to engage with like-minded individuals and consume content aligned with their beliefs. These dynamics may amplify polarization by reinforcing shared perspectives and reducing exposure to diverse viewpoints. Simultaneously, users migrate from one platform to another, either forced by moderation policies, such as de-platforming, or spontaneously seeking environments more aligned with their preferences. These migrations foster the specialization and differentiation of the social media ecosystem, with platforms increasingly organized around specific user communities and shared content preferences. This shift marks an evolution from echo chambers enclosed within platforms to "echo platforms", i.e., entire platforms functioning as ideologically homogeneous niches. This study introduces an operational framework to systematically analyze these dynamics, by examining three key dimensions: platform centrality (central vs. peripheral), news consumption (reliable vs questionable), and user base composition (uniform vs diverse). To this aim, we leverage a dataset of 126M URLs posted by nearly 6M users on nine social media platforms, namely Facebook, Reddit, Twitter (now X), YouTube, BitChute, Gab, Parler, Scored, and Voat. We find a clear separation between mainstream and alt-tech platforms, with the second category being characterized by a peripheral role in the social media ecosystem, a greater prevalence of unreliable content, and a heightened ideological uniformity. These findings outline the main dimensions defining the fragmentation and polarization of the social media ecosystem.</description>

      <title>The Dynamic Creativity of Proto-artifacts in Generative Computational Co-creation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the attributes necessary to determine the creative merit of intermediate artifacts produced during a computational co-creative process (CCC) in which a human and an artificial intelligence system collaborate in the generative phase of a creative project. In an active listening experiment, subjects with diverse musical training (N=43) judged unfinished pieces composed by the New Electronic Assistant (NEA). The results revealed that a two-attribute definition based on the value and novelty of an artifact (e.g., Corazza's effectiveness and novelty) suffices to assess unfinished work leading to innovative products, instead of Boden's classic three-attribute definition of creativity (value, novelty, and surprise). These findings reduce the creativity metrics needed in CCC processes and simplify the evaluation of the numerous unfinished artifacts generated by computational creative assistants.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of semiconductor technology is unprecedented, with profound transformational consequences for society. This includes feeding an over-reliance on digital solutions to systemic problems such as climate change ('techno-solutionism'). Such technologies come at a cost: environmental, social and material. We unpack topics arising from "The True Cost of ICT: From Materiality to Techno-Solutionism (TCICT)", a workshop held at the International ICT for Sustainability (ICT4S) conference 2024 in Stockholm, Sweden -- exploring, as a matter of global climate injustice, the drivers and material dependencies of these technologies. We point to the importance of addressing ICT's impacts as a system, rather than purely in terms of efficiency and energy use. We conclude by calling to build a community of like-minded and critical colleagues to address the intersectional climate impacts of the semiconductor industry and the techno-solutionism it embodies.</description>

      <title>Different Bias Under Different Criteria: Assessing Bias in LLMs with a Fact-Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often reflect real-world biases, leading to efforts to mitigate these effects and make the models unbiased. Achieving this goal requires defining clear criteria for an unbiased state, with any deviation from these criteria considered biased. Some studies define an unbiased state as equal treatment across diverse demographic groups, aiming for balanced outputs from LLMs. However, differing perspectives on equality and the importance of pluralism make it challenging to establish a universal standard. Alternatively, other approaches propose using fact-based criteria for more consistent and objective evaluations, though these methods have not yet been fully applied to LLM bias assessments. Thus, there is a need for a metric with objective criteria that offers a distinct perspective from equality-based approaches. Motivated by this need, we introduce a novel metric to assess bias using fact-based criteria and real-world statistics. In this paper, we conducted a human survey demonstrating that humans tend to perceive LLM outputs more positively when they align closely with real-world demographic distributions. Evaluating various LLMs with our proposed metric reveals that model bias varies depending on the criteria used, highlighting the need for multi-perspective assessment.</description>

      <title>From Fairness to Infinity: Outcome-Indistinguishable (Omni)Prediction in Evolving Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Professional networks provide invaluable entree to opportunity through referrals and introductions. A rich literature shows they also serve to entrench and even exacerbate a status quo of privilege and disadvantage. Hiring platforms, equipped with the ability to nudge link formation, provide a tantalizing opening for beneficial structural change. We anticipate that key to this prospect will be the ability to estimate the likelihood of edge formation in an evolving graph. Outcome-indistinguishable prediction algorithms ensure that the modeled world is indistinguishable from the real world by a family of statistical tests. Omnipredictors ensure that predictions can be post-processed to yield loss minimization competitive with respect to a benchmark class of predictors for many losses simultaneously, with appropriate post-processing. We begin by observing that, by combining a slightly modified form of the online K29 star algorithm of Vovk (2007) with basic facts from the theory of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, one can derive simple and efficient online algorithms satisfying outcome indistinguishability and omniprediction, with guarantees that improve upon, or are complementary to, those currently known. This is of independent interest. We apply these techniques to evolving graphs, obtaining online outcome-indistinguishable omnipredictors for rich -- possibly infinite -- sets of distinguishers that capture properties of pairs of nodes, and their neighborhoods. This yields, inter alia, multicalibrated predictions of edge formation with respect to pairs of demographic groups, and the ability to simultaneously optimize loss as measured by a variety of social welfare functions.</description>

Abstract: ETHICS is probably the most-cited dataset for testing the ethical capabilities of language models. Drawing on moral theory, psychology, and prompt evaluation, we interrogate the validity of the ETHICS benchmark. Adding to prior work, our findings suggest that having a clear understanding of ethics and how it relates to empirical phenomena is key to the validity of ethics evaluations for AI.</description>

      <title>How should AI decisions be explained? Requirements for Explanations from the Perspective of European Law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between law and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI). While there is much discussion about the AI Act, for which the trilogue of the European Parliament, Council and Commission recently concluded, other areas of law seem underexplored. This paper focuses on European (and in part German) law, although with international concepts and regulations such as fiduciary plausibility checks, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and product safety and liability. Based on XAI-taxonomies, requirements for XAI-methods are derived from each of the legal bases, resulting in the conclusion that each legal basis requires different XAI properties and that the current state of the art does not fulfill these to full satisfaction, especially regarding the correctness (sometimes called fidelity) and confidence estimates of XAI-methods.

      <title>Fair Mixed Effects Support Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06433v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To ensure unbiased and ethical automated predictions, fairness must be a core principle in machine learning applications. Fairness in machine learning aims to mitigate biases present in the training data and model imperfections that could lead to discriminatory outcomes. This is achieved by preventing the model from making decisions based on sensitive characteristics like ethnicity or sexual orientation. A fundamental assumption in machine learning is the independence of observations. However, this assumption often does not hold true for data describing social phenomena, where data points are often clustered based. Hence, if the machine learning models do not account for the cluster correlations, the results may be biased. Especially high is the bias in cases where the cluster assignment is correlated to the variable of interest. We present a fair mixed effects support vector machine algorithm that can handle both problems simultaneously. With a reproducible simulation study we demonstrate the impact of clustered data on the quality of fair machine learning predictions.</description>

Abstract: Algorithmic thinking (AT) is a critical skill in today's digital society, and it is indispensable not only in computer science-related fields but also in everyday problem-solving. As a foundational component of digital education and literacy, fostering AT skills is increasingly relevant for all students and should become a standard part of compulsory education. However, successfully integrating AT into formal education requires effective teaching strategies and robust and scalable assessment procedures. In this paper, we present the design and development process of the virtual Cross Array Task (CAT), a digital adaptation of an unplugged assessment activity aimed at evaluating algorithmic skills in Swiss compulsory education. The development process followed iterative design cycles, incorporating expert evaluations to refine the tool's usability, accessibility and functionality. A participatory design study played a dual role in shaping the platform. First, it gathered valuable insights from end users, including students and teachers, to ensure the tool's relevance and practicality in classroom settings. Second, it facilitated the collection and preliminary analysis of data related to students' AT skills, providing an initial evaluation of the tool's assessment capabilities across various developmental stages. This was achieved through a pilot study involving a diverse group of students aged 4 to 12, spanning preschool to lower secondary school levels. The resulting instrument features multilingual support and includes both gesture-based and visual block-based programming interfaces, making it accessible to a broad range of learners. Findings from the pilot study demonstrate the platform's usability and accessibility, as well as its suitability for assessing AT skills, with preliminary results showing its ability to cater to diverse age groups and educational contexts.</description>

      <title>Diagnosing Hate Speech Classification: Where Do Humans and Machines Disagree, and Why?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10153</link>

Abstract: This study uses the cosine similarity ratio, embedding regression, and manual re-annotation to diagnose hate speech classification. We begin by computing cosine similarity ratio on a dataset "Measuring Hate Speech" that contains 135,556 annotated comments on social media. This way, we show a basic use of cosine similarity as a description of hate speech content. We then diagnose hate speech classification starting from understanding the inconsistency of human annotation from the dataset. Using embedding regression as a basic diagnostic, we found that female annotators are more sensitive to racial slurs that target the black population. We perform with a more complicated diagnostic by training a hate speech classifier using a SoTA pre-trained large language model, NV-Embed-v2, to convert texts to embeddings and run a logistic regression. This classifier achieves a testing accuracy of 94%. In diagnosing where machines disagree with human annotators, we found that machines make fewer mistakes than humans despite the fact that human annotations are treated as ground truth in the training set. Machines perform better in correctly labeling long statements of facts, but perform worse in labeling short instances of swear words. We hypothesize that this is due to model alignment - while curating models at their creation prevents the models from producing obvious hate speech, it also reduces the model's ability to detect such content.</description>

      <title>Influencers' Reposts and Viral Diffusion: Prestige Bias in Online Communities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cultural evolution theory suggests that prestige bias (whereby individuals preferentially learn from prestigious figures) has played a key role in human ecological success. However, its impact within online environments remains unclear, particularly regarding whether reposts by prestigious individuals amplify diffusion more effectively than reposts by non-influential users. Here, we analyzed over 55 million posts and 520 million reposts on Twitter (currently X) to examine whether users with high influence scores (hg-index) more effectively amplified the reach of others' content. Our findings indicate that posts shared by influencers were more likely to be further shared compared to those shared by non-influencers. This effect persisted over time, especially in viral posts. Moreover, a small group of highly influential users accounted for approximately half of the information flow within repost cascades. These findings demonstrate a prestige bias in information diffusion within digital society, suggesting that cognitive biases shape content spread through reposting.</description>

      <title>Exploring Privacy and Security as Drivers for Environmental Sustainability in Cloud-Based Office Solutions (Extended Abstract)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of privacy, cybersecurity, and environmental impacts, specifically energy consumption and carbon emissions, in cloud-based office solutions. We hypothesise that solutions that emphasise privacy and security are typically "greener" than solutions that are financed through data collection and advertising. To test our hypothesis, we first investigate how the underlying architectures and business models of these services, e.g., monetisation through (personalised) advertising, contribute to the services' environmental impact. We then explore commonly used methodologies and identify tools that facilitate environmental assessments of software systems. By combining these tools, we develop an approach to systematically assess the environmental footprint of the user-side of online services, which we apply to investigate and compare the influence of service design and ad-blocking technology on the emissions of common web-mail services. Our measurements of a limited selection of such services does not yet conclusively support or falsify our hypothesis regarding primary impacts. However, we are already able to identify the greener web-mail services on the user-side and continue the investigation towards conclusive assessment strategies for online office solutions.</description>
