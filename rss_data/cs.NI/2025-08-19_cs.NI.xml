      <title>Fundamentals of Next-generation Network Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fifth-generation (5G) of cellular communications is expected to be deployed in the next years to support a wide range of services with different demands of peak data rates, latency and quality of experience (QoE). To support higher data rates and latency requirements third-generation partnership project (3GPP) has introduced numerology and bandwidth parts (BWPs), via new radio (NR) for service-tailored resource allocation. Legacy 4G networks have generated extensive data, which combined with crowd-sourced LTE infrastructure insights, enables identification of high-traffic 5G deployment area (5GDA) for planning new services. Given the mission-critical nature of 5G services, QoE is a big challenge for MNOs to guarantee peak data rates for a defined percentage of time. This work studies the fundamentals of 5G network planning methods that reconciles coverage-capacity trade-offs through balanced radio network dimensioning (RND), leveraging pragmatic NR modeling, and data-driven strategies to minimize deployment costs and reduce cost-per-bit.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic Signal Modulation Recognition based on Subgraph Embedding Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) detects
  modulation schemes of received signals for further processing
  of signals without any priori information, which is critically
  important for civil spectrum regulation, information countermea sures, and communication security. Due to the powerful feature
  extraction and classification capabilities of Deep Learning (DL),
  DL-based AMR algorithms have achieved excellent performance
  gains compared with traditional modulation detection algorithms.
  However, all existing DL-based AMR algorithms, to the best of
  our knowledge, are designed for specific channels and systems,
  because data dimension of the used training dataset is fixed. To
  this end, we takes the first step to propose a Subgraph Embedding
  Learning (SEL) structure to address the classical AMR problem,
  and the proposed algorithm is called SEL-AMR. Our algorithm
  treats the communication system as a subgraph and uses the
  relationship between samples to smooth the effects brought by
  noise and different channels to extract robust features. Thus,
  the proposed SEL-AMR algorithm can adapt to any dynamic
  channels and systems. We use 5 public real datasets and a small
  amount of simulation data to evaluate our SEL-AMR algorithm.
  Experimental results reveal that SEL-AMR can well adapt to
  different channels and systems, and always outperforms the state of-the-art algorithms by improving up to 20% macro-average
  recognition precision and 30% recognition accuracy.</description>

      <title>CountingStars: Low-overhead Network-wide Measurement in LEO Mega-constellation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The high mobility of satellites in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) mega-constellations induces a highly dynamic network topology, leading to many problems like frequent service disruptions. To mitigate this, Packet-based Load Balancing (PBLB) is employed. However, this paradigm shift introduces two critical challenges for network measurement stemming from the requirement for port-level granularity: memory inflation and severe hash collisions. To tackle these challenges, we propose CountingStars, a low-overhead network-wide measurement architecture. In the ground controller, CountingStars builds a digital twins system to accurately predict the future network topology. This allows ground controller to generate and distribute collision-free hash seeds to satellites in advance. On the satellite, we introduce a port aggregation data structure that decouples the unique flow identifier from its multi-port counter and updates it through efficient bit operations, solving the memory inflation caused by PBLB. Simulation results show that the memory usage of CountingStars is reduced by 70\% on average, and the relative error of measurement is reduced by 90\% on average. Implementation on FPGA shows its prospect to deploy in real system.</description>

      <title>Security-as-a-Function for IDS/IPS in Softwarized Network and Applications to 5G Network Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The service-based architecture of 5G network allows network operators to place virtualized network functions on commodity hardware, unlike the traditional vendor-specific hardware-based functionalities. However, it expands the security vulnerabilities and threats to the 5G network. While there exist several theoretical studies on network function placement and service routing, a few focused on the security aspects of the 5G network systems.
  This paper focuses on safeguarding the 5G core network systems from DoS and DDoS attacks by placing intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS-IPS) as virtualized network functions following the 5G standalone architecture. To ensure the virtualized placement of IDS-IPS, first, we provide thorough virtual machine (VM)-based and containerized implementation details and evaluate the network performance with two scenarios, IDS and IPS, in the presence of TCP and UDP applications. Second, we apply the VM-based implementation of IDS-IPS on a softwarized 5G core network and study the network performances. The experiment results on network throughput, latency, and packet drop reveal that the softwarized IDS-IPS can meet the QoS requirements of 5G applications, while safeguarding the network from DoS and DDoS attacks.</description>

      <title>Towards Timing Isolation for Mixed-Criticality Communication in Software-Defined Vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the automotive industry transitions toward centralized Linux-based architectures, ensuring the predictable execution of mixed-criticality applications becomes essential. However, concurrent use of the Linux network stack introduces interference, resulting in unpredictable latency and jitter. To address this challenge, we present a layered software architecture that enforces timing isolation for Ethernet-based data exchange between mixed-criticality applications on Linux-based automotive control units. Our approach integrates traffic prioritization strategies at the middleware layer, the network stack layer, and the hardware layer to achieve isolation across the full software stack. At the middleware layer, we implement a fixed-priority, non-preemptive scheduler to manage publishers of varying criticality. At the network layer, we leverage the express data path (XDP) to route high-priority data directly from the network interface driver into critical application memory, bypassing the standard Linux network stack. At the hardware layer, we dedicate a network interface card (NIC) queue exclusively to real-time traffic. We demonstrate how our architecture performs in a Data Distribution Service (DDS)-based system. Our evaluation shows that the approach leads to consistent and predictable latencies for real-time traffic, even under heavy interference from best-effort applications.</description>

      <title>Architecture Considerations for ISAC in 6G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ISAC is emerging as a foundational capability in 6G, enabling mobile networks to not only offer communication services but also to sense and perceive their environment at scale. This paper explores architectural considerations to enable sensing in 6G, extending on recent developments by (pre-)standardisation bodies such as 3GPP and ETSI. Selected ISAC use cases are presented from the European MultiX project including associated potential functional system requirements. The paper proposes a 6G system architecture that integrates newly proposed NFs for the purpose of sensing and demonstrates how they are being used in offering sensing as a service. Protocol stack adaptations for both control and a newly proposed sensing plane are discussed.</description>

      <title>OrbitChain: Orchestrating In-orbit Real-time Analytics of Earth Observation Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Earth observation analytics have the potential to serve many time-sensitive applications. However, due to limited bandwidth and duration of ground-satellite connections, it takes hours or even days to download and analyze data from existing Earth observation satellites, making real-time demands like timely disaster response impossible. Toward real-time analytics, we introduce OrbitChain, a collaborative analytics framework that orchestrates computational resources across multiple satellites in an Earth observation constellation. OrbitChain decomposes analytics applications into microservices and allocates computational resources for time-constrained analysis. A traffic routing algorithm is devised to minimize the inter-satellite communication overhead. OrbitChain adopts a pipeline workflow that completes Earth observation tasks in real-time, facilitates time-sensitive applications and inter-constellation collaborations such as tip-and-cue. To evaluate OrbitChain, we implement a hardware-in-the-loop orbital computing testbed. Experiments show that our system can complete up to 60% analytics workload than existing Earth observation analytics framework while reducing the communication overhead by up to 72%.</description>

      <title>BetaWeb: Towards a Blockchain-enabled Trustworthy Agentic Web</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the development of artificial intelligence (AI) agents, which are increasingly evolving into diverse autonomous entities, advancing the LLM-based multi-agent systems (LaMAS). However, current agentic ecosystems remain fragmented and closed. Establishing an interconnected and scalable paradigm for Agentic AI has become a critical prerequisite. Although Agentic Web proposes an open architecture to break the ecosystem barriers, its implementation still faces core challenges such as privacy protection, data management, and value measurement. Existing centralized or semi-centralized paradigms suffer from inherent limitations, making them inadequate for supporting large-scale, heterogeneous, and cross-domain autonomous interactions. To address these challenges, this paper introduces the blockchain-enabled trustworthy Agentic Web (BetaWeb). By leveraging the inherent strengths of blockchain, BetaWeb not only offers a trustworthy and scalable infrastructure for LaMAS but also has the potential to advance the Web paradigm from Web3 (centered on data ownership) towards Web3.5, which emphasizes ownership of agent capabilities and the monetization of intelligence. Beyond a systematic examination of the BetaWeb framework, this paper presents a five-stage evolutionary roadmap, outlining the path of LaMAS from passive execution to advanced collaboration and autonomous governance. We also conduct a comparative analysis of existing products and discuss key challenges of BetaWeb from multiple perspectives. Ultimately, we argue that deep integration between blockchain and LaMAS can lay the foundation for a resilient, trustworthy, and sustainably incentivized digital ecosystem. A summary of the enabling technologies for each stage is available at https://github.com/MatZaharia/BetaWeb.</description>

      <title>To Theoretically Understand Transformer-Based In-Context Learning for Optimizing CSMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL) theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt. We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.</description>
