      <title>Trade Policy and Structural Change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01360v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine how tariffs affect sectoral composition and welfare in an economy with nonhomothetic preferences and sectors being complements -- key drivers of structural change. Beyond their conventional role in trade protection, tariffs influence industrial structure by altering relative prices and income levels. We qualitatively characterize these mechanisms and use a quantitative dynamic model to show that a counterfactual 20-percentage-point increase in U.S. manufacturing tariffs since 2001 would have raised the manufacturing value-added share by one percentage point and increased welfare by 0.36 percent. However, if all the U.S. trading partners responded reciprocally, U.S. welfare would have declined by 0.12 percent.</description>

      <title>Anchoring-Based Causal Design (ABCD): Estimating the Effects of Beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central challenge in any study of the effects of beliefs on outcomes, such as decisions and behavior, is the risk of omitted variables bias. Omitted variables, frequently unmeasured or even unknown, can induce correlations between beliefs and decisions that are not genuinely causal, in which case the omitted variables are referred to as confounders. To address the challenge of causal inference, researchers frequently rely on information provision experiments to randomly manipulate beliefs. The information supplied in these experiments can serve as an instrumental variable (IV), enabling causal inference, so long as it influences decisions exclusively through its impact on beliefs. However, providing varying information to participants to shape their beliefs can raise both methodological and ethical concerns. Methodological concerns arise from potential violations of the exclusion restriction assumption. Such violations may stem from information source effects, when attitudes toward the source affect the outcome decision directly, thereby introducing a confounder. An ethical concern arises from manipulating the provided information, as it may involve deceiving participants. This paper proposes and empirically demonstrates a new method for treating beliefs and estimating their effects, the Anchoring-Based Causal Design (ABCD), which avoids deception and source influences. ABCD combines the cognitive mechanism known as anchoring with instrumental variable (IV) estimation. Instead of providing substantive information, the method employs a deliberately non-informative procedure in which participants compare their self-assessment of a concept to a randomly assigned anchor value. We present the method and the results of eight experiments demonstrating its application, strengths, and limitations. We conclude by discussing the potential of this design for advancing experimental social science.</description>

      <title>The Role of Digital Payments in Driving Regional Economic Growth: A Panel Data Analysis with Structural Break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using a panel payment system dataset of thirty-three provinces in Indonesia, we examine the impact of digital payment on the regional economy, considering structural breaks induced by unprecedented events and policies. Digital payments were determined to significantly affect regional income and consumption before and after the identified breakpoint, with the impact greater following the break. Employing a novel method for structural break analysis within interactive effects panel data, we demonstrate that the break in retail payment models is due to COVID-19, and the break in the wholesale payment model is associated with the central bank's payment system policy.</description>

      <title>FX-constrained growth: Fundamentalists, chartists and the dynamic trade-multiplier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Behavioural finance offers a valuable framework for examining foreign exchange (FX) market dynamics, including puzzles such as excess volatility and fat-tailed distributions. Yet, when it comes to their interaction with the `real' side of the economy, existing scholarship has overlooked a critical feature of developing countries. They cannot trade in their national currencies and need US dollars to access modern production techniques as well as maintain consumption patterns similar to those of wealthier societies. To address this gap, we present a novel heterogeneous agents model from the perspective of a developing economy that distinguishes between speculative and non-speculative sectors in the FX market. We demonstrate that as long as non-speculative demand responds to domestic economic activity, a market-clearing output growth rate exists that, in steady-state, is equal to the ratio between FX supply growth and the income elasticity of demand for foreign assets, i.e., a generalised dynamic trade-multiplier. Numerical simulations reproduce key stylised facts of exchange rate dynamics and economic growth, including distributions that deviate from the typical bell-shaped curve. Data from a sample of Latin American countries reveal that FX fluctuations exhibit similar statistical properties. Furthermore, we employ time-varying parameter estimation techniques to show that the dynamic trade-multiplier closely tracks observed growth rates in these economies.</description>

      <title>SoK: Stablecoins for Digital Transformation -- Design, Metrics, and Application with Real World Asset Tokenization as a Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stablecoins have become a foundational component of the digital asset ecosystem, with their market capitalization exceeding 230 billion USD as of May 2025. As fiat-referenced and programmable assets, stablecoins provide low-latency, globally interoperable infrastructure for payments, decentralized finance, DeFi, and tokenized commerce. Their accelerated adoption has prompted extensive regulatory engagement, exemplified by the European Union's Markets in Crypto-assets Regulation, MiCA, the US Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stablecoins Act, GENIUS Act, and Hong Kong's Stablecoins Bill. Despite this momentum, academic research remains fragmented across economics, law, and computer science, lacking a unified framework for design, evaluation, and application. This study addresses that gap through a multi-method research design. First, it synthesizes cross-disciplinary literature to construct a taxonomy of stablecoin systems based on custodial structure, stabilization mechanism, and governance. Second, it develops a performance evaluation framework tailored to diverse stakeholder needs, supported by an open-source benchmarking pipeline to ensure transparency and reproducibility. Third, a case study on Real World Asset tokenization illustrates how stablecoins operate as programmable monetary infrastructure in cross-border digital systems. By integrating conceptual theory with empirical tools, the paper contributes: a unified taxonomy for stablecoin design; a stakeholder-oriented performance evaluation framework; an empirical case linking stablecoins to sectoral transformation; and reproducible methods and datasets to inform future research. These contributions support the development of trusted, inclusive, and transparent digital monetary infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Exploring Agentic Artificial Intelligence Systems: Towards a Typological Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are evolving beyond passive tools into autonomous agents capable of reasoning, adapting, and acting with minimal human intervention. Despite their growing presence, a structured framework is lacking to classify and compare these systems. This paper develops a typology of agentic AI systems, introducing eight dimensions that define their cognitive and environmental agency in an ordinal structure. Using a multi-phase methodological approach, we construct and refine this typology, which is then evaluated through a human-AI hybrid approach and further distilled into constructed types. The framework enables researchers and practitioners to analyze varying levels of agency in AI systems. By offering a structured perspective on the progression of AI capabilities, the typology provides a foundation for assessing current systems and anticipating future developments in agentic AI.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Driven Decision-Making for Disease Control and Pandemic Preparedness Model 4.0 in Rural Communities of Bangladesh: Management Informatics Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rural Bangladesh is confronted with substantial healthcare obstacles, such as inadequate infrastructure, inadequate information systems, and restricted access to medical personnel. These obstacles impede effective disease control and pandemic preparedness. This investigation employs a structured methodology to develop and analyze numerous plausible scenarios systematically. A purposive sampling strategy was implemented, which involved the administration of a questionnaire survey to 264 rural residents in the Rangamati district of Bangladesh and the completion of a distinct questionnaire by 103 healthcare and medical personnel. The impact and effectiveness of the study are assessed through logistic regression analysis and a pre-post comparison that employs the Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test and Kendall's coefficient for non-parametric paired and categorical variables. This analysis evaluates the evolution of disease control and preparedness prior to and subsequent to the implementation of the Generative AI-Based Model 4.0. The results indicate that trust in AI (\b{eta} = 1.20, p = 0.020) and confidence in sharing health data (\b{eta} = 9.049, p = 0.020) are the most significant predictors of AI adoption. At the same time, infrastructure limitations and digital access constraints continue to be significant constraints. The study concludes that the health resilience and pandemic preparedness of marginalized rural populations can be improved through AI-driven, localized disease control strategies. The integration of Generative AI into rural healthcare systems offers a transformative opportunity, but it is contingent upon active community engagement, enhanced digital literacy, and strong government involvement.</description>

      <title>Idempotent Equilibrium Analysis of Hybrid Workflow Allocation: A Mathematical Schema for Future Work</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advance of large-scale AI systems is reshaping how work is divided between people and machines. We formalise this reallocation as an iterated task-delegation map and show that--under broad, empirically grounded assumptions--the process converges to a stable idempotent equilibrium in which every task is performed by the agent (human or machine) with enduring comparative advantage. Leveraging lattice-theoretic fixed-point tools (Tarski and Banach), we (i) prove existence of at least one such equilibrium and (ii) derive mild monotonicity conditions that guarantee uniqueness. In a stylised continuous model the long-run automated share takes the closed form $x^* = \alpha / (\alpha + \beta)$, where $\alpha$ captures the pace of automation and $\beta$ the rate at which new, human-centric tasks appear; hence full automation is precluded whenever $\beta &gt; 0$. We embed this analytic result in three complementary dynamical benchmarks--a discrete linear update, an evolutionary replicator dynamic, and a continuous Beta-distributed task spectrum--each of which converges to the same mixed equilibrium and is reproducible from the provided code-free formulas. A 2025-to-2045 simulation calibrated to current adoption rates projects automation rising from approximately 10% of work to approximately 65%, leaving a persistent one-third of tasks to humans. We interpret that residual as a new profession of workflow conductor: humans specialise in assigning, supervising and integrating AI modules rather than competing with them. Finally, we discuss implications for skill development, benchmark design and AI governance, arguing that policies which promote "centaur" human-AI teaming can steer the economy toward the welfare-maximising fixed point.</description>

      <title>Long-term resilience of online battle over vaccines and beyond</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What has been the impact of the enormous amounts of time, effort and money spent promoting pro-vaccine science from pre-COVID-19 to now? We answer this using a unique mapping of online competition between pro- and anti-vaccination views among ~100M Facebook Page members, tracking 1,356 interconnected communities through platform interventions. Remarkably, the network's fundamental architecture shows no change: the isolation of established expertise and the symbiosis of anti and mainstream neutral communities persist. This means that even if the same time, effort and money continue to be spent, nothing will likely change. The reason for this resilience lies in "glocal" evolution: Communities blend multiple topics while bridging neighborhood-level to international scales, creating redundant pathways that transcend categorical targeting. The solution going forward is to focus on the system's network. We show how network engineering approaches can achieve opinion moderation without content removal, representing a paradigm shift from suppression towards structural interventions.</description>

      <title>What Is Your AI Agent Buying? Evaluation, Implications and Emerging Questions for Agentic E-Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online marketplaces will be transformed by autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of consumers. Rather than humans browsing and clicking, vision-language-model (VLM) agents can parse webpages, evaluate products, and transact. This raises a fundamental question: what do AI agents buy, and why? We develop ACES, a sandbox environment that pairs a platform-agnostic VLM agent with a fully programmable mock marketplace to study this question. We first conduct basic rationality checks in the context of simple tasks, and then, by randomizing product positions, prices, ratings, reviews, sponsored tags, and platform endorsements, we obtain causal estimates of how frontier VLMs actually shop. Models show strong but heterogeneous position effects: all favor the top row, yet different models prefer different columns, undermining the assumption of a universal "top" rank. They penalize sponsored tags and reward endorsements. Sensitivities to price, ratings, and reviews are directionally human-like but vary sharply in magnitude across models. Motivated by scenarios where sellers use AI agents to optimize product listings, we show that a seller-side agent that makes minor tweaks to product descriptions, targeting AI buyer preferences, can deliver substantial market-share gains if AI-mediated shopping dominates. We also find that modal product choices can differ across models and, in some cases, demand may concentrate on a few select products, raising competition questions. Together, our results illuminate how AI agents may behave in e-commerce settings and surface concrete seller strategy, platform design, and regulatory questions in an AI-mediated ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Towards Replication-Robust Analytics Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.06000v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advancements in machine learning, in practice, relevant datasets are often distributed among market competitors who are reluctant to share. To incentivize data sharing, recent works propose analytics markets, where multiple agents share features and are rewarded for improving the predictions of others. These rewards can be computed by treating features as players in a coalitional game, with solution concepts that yield desirable market properties. However, this setup incites agents to strategically replicate their data and act under multiple false identities to increase their own revenue and diminish that of others, limiting the viability of such markets in practice. In this work, we develop an analytics market robust to such strategic replication for supervised learning problems. We adopt Pearl's do-calculus from causal inference to refine the coalitional game by differentiating between observational and interventional conditional probabilities. As a result, we derive rewards that are replication-robust by design.</description>

      <title>Where the Trees Fall: Macroeconomic Forecasts for Forest-Reliant States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several key states in various regions of the U.S. have experienced recent sawtimber as well as pulp and paper mill closures, which raises an important policy question: how have and will key macroeconomic and industry specific indicators within the U.S. forest sector likely to change over time? This study provides empirical evidence to support forest-sector policy design by using a vector error correction (VEC) model to forecast economic trends in three major industries - forestry and logging, wood manufacturing, and paper manufacturing - across six of the most forest-dependent states found by the location quotient (LQ) measure: Alabama, Arkansas, Maine, Mississippi, Oregon, and Wisconsin. Overall, the results suggest a general decline in employment and the number of firms in the forestry and logging industry as well as the paper manufacturing industry, while wood manufacturing is projected to see modest employment gains. These results also offer key insights for regional policymakers, industry leaders, and local economic development officials: communities dependent on timber-based manufacturing may be more resilient than other forestry-based industries in the face of economic disruptions. Our findings can help prioritize targeted policy interventions and inform regional economic resilience strategies. We show distinct differences across forest-dependent industries and/or state sectors and geographies, highlighting that policies may have to be specific to each sector and/or geographical area. Finally, our VEC modeling framework is adaptable to other resource-dependent industries that serve as regional economic pillars such as mining, agriculture, and energy production offering a transferable tool for policy analysis in regions with similar economic structures.</description>

      <title>Most likely retail agglomeration patterns: Potential maximization and stochastic stability of spatial equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.06778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a model of retail agglomeration where consumers are more likely to visit zones with a higher concentration of shops. This agglomerative effect makes zones with many retailers more attractive. The spatial distribution of retailers in equilibrium is endogenously determined in response to the spatial pattern of shopping demand. In such a setting, multiple locally stable equilibria may arise, and the outcome can depend on the initial distribution of shops. To address this issue, we apply an approach from evolutionary game theory, selecting the equilibrium that maximizes a potential function representing the incentives of retailers. We demonstrate the method in a two-dimensional spatial setting. Compared to local stability based on gradual, myopic adjustments, this global maximization leads to a unique and more robust prediction. As expected, the number of retail clusters decreases either when shopping costs for immobile consumers fall or when the attractiveness of larger retail concentrations increases.</description>

Abstract: Integrated global food system analysis is hampered by the fragmentation of data among food types, processes, and scales. Studies also often neglect the connection to human metabolism -- the ultimate driver of food demand. Here we use a common energetic framework to harmonize data on 95 individual food commodities across food system processes, including production, processing, animal feed and consumption, and estimate human metabolism from body size, demographic, and activity data. We estimate that the share of unmetabolized food calories globally doubled between 1990 and 2019 (from about 10 to 20% of the total calories available for human consumption) as food supply outpaced energy expenditure. Approximately half (51%) of the global population's metabolic demands could theoretically be met by production in the same local 1-degree grid cell (~ 10,000 km2) when holding diets constant. Our open-source framework can be applied to assess strategies to reduce food system inefficiencies from photosynthesis to metabolism while meeting local energetic demands.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Cooperation and Self-Interest in a Two-Population Occupation Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14996</link>

Abstract: We study the hydrodynamics of a system of agents who optimize either their individual utility (self-interest) or the collective welfare (cooperation). When agents act selfishly, their interactions are non-reciprocal, driving the system out of equilibrium; by contrast, purely altruistic dynamics restore reciprocity and yield an equilibrium-like description. We investigate how mixtures of these two behaviors shape the macroscopic properties of the liquid of agents. For highly rational agents, we find that introducing a small fraction of altruists can suppress the sub-optimal clustering induced by selfish dynamics. This phenomenon can be attributed to altruists localizing at interfaces and acting as effective surfactants, shedding a new light on earlier findings in fixed neighborhood-based models [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{120}, 208301 (2018)]. When agents are boundedly rational, we introduce a well-mixed approximation that reduces the two-population model to a single effective scalar field theory. This allows us to leverage state-of-the-art tools from active matter to analytically characterize how altruism modifies surface tension and nucleation dynamics.</description>

      <title>The Cognitive Foundations of Economic Exchange: A Modular Framework Grounded in Behavioral Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origins of economic behavior remain unresolved-not only in the social sciences but also in AI, where dominant theories often rely on predefined incentives or institutional assumptions. Contrary to the longstanding myth of barter as the foundation of exchange, converging evidence from early human societies suggests that reciprocity-not barter-was the foundational economic logic, enabling communities to sustain exchange and social cohesion long before formal markets emerged. Yet despite its centrality, reciprocity lacks a simulateable and cognitively grounded account. Here, we introduce a minimal behavioral framework based on three empirically supported cognitive primitives-individual recognition, reciprocal credence, and cost--return sensitivity-that enable agents to participate in and sustain reciprocal exchange, laying the foundation for scalable economic behavior. These mechanisms scaffold the emergence of cooperation, proto-economic exchange, and institutional structure from the bottom up. By bridging insights from primatology, developmental psychology, and economic anthropology, this framework offers a unified substrate for modeling trust, coordination, and economic behavior in both human and artificial systems.
