      <title>Optimizing Performance: How Compact Models Match or Exceed GPT's Classification Capabilities through Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we demonstrate that non-generative, small-sized models such as FinBERT and FinDRoBERTa, when fine-tuned, can outperform GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models in zero-shot learning settings in sentiment analysis for financial news. These fine-tuned models show comparable results to GPT-3.5 when it is fine-tuned on the task of determining market sentiment from daily financial news summaries sourced from Bloomberg. To fine-tune and compare these models, we created a novel database, which assigns a market score to each piece of news without human interpretation bias, systematically identifying the mentioned companies and analyzing whether their stocks have gone up, down, or remained neutral. Furthermore, the paper shows that the assumptions of Condorcet's Jury Theorem do not hold suggesting that fine-tuned small models are not independent of the fine-tuned GPT models, indicating behavioural similarities. Lastly, the resulted fine-tuned models are made publicly available on HuggingFace, providing a resource for further research in financial sentiment analysis and text classification.</description>

      <title>Unlocking NACE Classification Embeddings with OpenAI for Enhanced Analysis and Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in the European Community (NACE) is the standard classification system for the categorization of economic and industrial activities within the European Union. This paper proposes a novel approach to transform the NACE classification into low-dimensional embeddings, using state-of-the-art models and dimensionality reduction techniques. The primary challenge is the preservation of the hierarchical structure inherent within the original NACE classification while reducing the number of dimensions. To address this issue, we introduce custom metrics designed to quantify the retention of hierarchical relationships throughout the embedding and reduction processes. The evaluation of these metrics demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in retaining the structural information essential for insightful analysis. This approach not only facilitates the visual exploration of economic activity relationships, but also increases the efficacy of downstream tasks, including clustering, classification, integration with other classifications, and others. Through experimental validation, the utility of our proposed framework in preserving hierarchical structures within the NACE classification is showcased, thereby providing a valuable tool for researchers and policymakers to understand and leverage any hierarchical data.</description>
