      <title>Sparse Interactions Reshape Stability in Random Lotka-Volterra Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical approaches to ecological stability rely on fully connected interaction models, yet real ecosystems are sparse and structured--a feature that qualitatively reshapes their collective dynamics. Here, we establish a thermodynamically exact stability phase diagram for generalized Lotka-Volterra dynamics on sparse random graphs, resolving how finite connectivity and interaction heterogeneity jointly govern ecosystem resilience. Using a small-coupling expansion of the dynamic cavity method, we derive an effective single-site stochastic process that is solvable via population dynamics. Our approach uncovers a topological phase transition--driven purely by the finite connectivity structure of the network--that leads to multi-stability. This instability is fundamentally distinct from the disorder-driven transitions induced by quenched randomness of the couplings. Our framework overcomes the considerable computational cost of direct simulations, offering a scalable and versatile analysis of stability, biodiversity, and alternative stable states in realistic, large-scale ecological ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Localization-landscape generalized Mott-Berezinski\u{i} formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a conceptual reformulation of the Mott-Berezinski\u{i} (MB) theory of low-frequency AC conductivity in disordered systems based on localization landscape theory. Instead of assuming uniform localization and fixed hopping distances, transport is described through an effective potential whose geometry encodes the spatial organization and energy-dependent localization of quantum states. Using the associated Agmon metric, we define a generalized Mott scale that replaces the classical hopping length with a geometric criterion set by the disorder landscape. This framework naturally incorporates strong spatial inhomogeneity and yields the AC conductivity directly from the effective potential. The standard MB result is recovered as a limiting case. Our approach extends the conceptual foundation of MB theory to arbitrary disordered media and energies approaching the mobility edge, providing a unified description of AC transport in complex quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Random geometry of maximum-density dimer packings of the site-diluted kagome lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23639v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent work that analyzed the effect of vacancy disorder on a short-range resonating valence bond spin liquid state of kagome-lattice antiferromagnets argued that such spin liquids are stable to vacancy disorder. The argument relied crucially on a numerical study that identified the following property of the site-diluted kagome lattice: maximum-density dimer packings (maximum matchings) of any connected component of such site-diluted kagome lattices have at most one unmatched vertex that hosts a monomer. Here, we provide an inductive proof of a stronger result that implies this property: If a connected cluster of such a lattice has an odd number of vertices, its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition~\cite{Lovas_Plummer_1986} has exactly one ${\mathcal R}$-type region that spans the entire connected cluster and hosts a single monomer of any maximum-density dimer packing. If on the other hand it has an even number of sites, it admits perfect matchings (fully-packed dimer coverings with no monomers) and its Gallai-Edmonds decomposition consists of a single ${\mathcal P}$-type region that spans the entire cluster. Our proof also applies to the site-diluted Archimedean star lattice, the site-diluted pyrochlore lattice (corner-sharing tetrahedra), the site-diluted hyperkagome lattice, and, more generally, to any lattice satisfying a certain local connectivity property. It does not apply to bond-diluted versions of such lattices.</description>

      <title>Twisted Trilayer Graphene, Quasiperiodic Superconductor</title>

Abstract: Twisted multilayer moir\'e materials are generically quasiperiodic on the moir\'e scale due to the interference of different misaligned moir\'e periodicities. Spatial inhomogeneities such as these can be detrimental to superconductivity; nonetheless, superconductivity has been observed in quasiperiodic twisted trilayer graphene (TTG). Here, we systematically study the superconducting properties of TTG. We reveal that an interplay between quasiperiodicity and topology drives TTG into a critical regime, enabling it to host superconductivity with rigid phase stiffness for a wide range of twist angles, rather than at a fine-tuned value. The criticality in the normal state is due to the Dirac fermions coupled by quasiperiodic tunneling simulating 3D topological superconductor surface states. This critical-metal regime is marked by multifractal wave functions across the spectrum and scale-invariant transport reminiscent of the integer quantum Hall plateau transition. We demonstrate this with large-scale wave function and Kubo conductivity calculations. These observations lead to a clear experimental implication: stronger interlayer coupling in TTG further stabilizes both the criticality and superconductivity, allowing superconductivity to be seen across a wider range of angles with experimentally accessible pressures.</description>

      <title>Decoding the Architecture of Living Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.22651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The possibility that evolutionary forces -- together with a few fundamental factors such as thermodynamic constraints, specific computational features enabling information processing, and ecological processes -- might constrain the logic of living systems is tantalizing. However, it is often overlooked that any practical implementation of such a logic requires complementary circuitry that, in biological systems, happens through complex networks of genetic regulation, metabolic reactions, cellular signalling, communication, social and eusocial non-trivial organization. We review and discuss how circuitries are not merely passive structures, but active agents of change that, by means of hierarchical and modular organization, are able to enhance and catalyze the evolution of evolvability. Using statistical physics to analyze the role of non-trivial topologies in major evolutionary transitions, we show that biological innovations are related to deviation from trivial structures and (thermo)dynamic equilibria.
  We argue that sparse heterogeneous networks such as hierarchical modular, which are ubiquitously observed in nature, are favored in terms of the trade-off between energetic costs for redundancy, error-correction and maintainance. We identify three main features -- namely, interconnectivity, plasticity and interdependency -- pointing towards a unifying framework for modeling the phenomenology, discussing them in terms of dynamical systems theory, non-equilibrium thermodynamics and evolutionary dynamics. Within this unified picture, we also show that slow evolutionary dynamics is an emergent phenomenon governed by the replicator-mutator equation as the direct consequence of a constrained variational nonequilibrium process. Overall, this work highlights how dynamical systems theory and nonequilibrium thermodynamics provide powerful analytical techniques to study biological complexity.</description>

      <title>Beating the aliasing limit with aperiodic monotile arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding optimal wave sampling methods has far-reaching implications in wave physics, such as seismology, acoustics, and telecommunications. A key challenge is surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing a frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However, the WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass aliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of a recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in overcoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing their spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS) arrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing the WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a novel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can outperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming scenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position noise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging applications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both, as they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More generally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient design principle in various fields requiring wave sampling.</description>

      <title>Quantum conditional mutual information as a probe of measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that the quantum conditional mutual information (QCMI), computed with a suitably chosen partition of the system, serves as a powerful probe for detecting measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions in monitored quantum circuits. To demonstrate this, we investigate monitored variable-range Clifford circuits and identify the phase boundary between volume-law and area-law entanglement phases by performing finite-size scaling analyses of the QCMI. Assuming that the entanglement entropy exhibits a logarithmic dependence on system size at criticality in short-range interacting cases, we further show that the QCMI allows for the simultaneous determination of both the critical point and the universal coefficient of the logarithmic term in the entanglement entropy via a crossing-point analysis. For the shortest-range interacting case studied, we obtain the thermodynamic-limit value of the coefficient as $\tilde{c}=1.519(3)$, which is significantly smaller than values reported in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Mixed state deep thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07795v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22720v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.</description>

      <title>Carrier localization and dynamics in In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N: the impact of alloying and Si doping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00603v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Alloying and doping are crucial for enhancing the electronic and optical properties of semiconductors while simultaneously introducing disorder. This report explores the effects of alloying and Si (0.5 at.\%) doping on In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N thin films that were grown by metal-organic vapor phase epitaxy. Post-growth X-ray diffraction measurements indicate that Si doping does not affect the lattice parameters and screw dislocations but significantly increases the edge dislocation density. Temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy shows that Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N exhibits higher photoluminescence intensity, blue-shifted peaks, narrower emission linewidths, and quenching of lower energy sidebands when compared to pristine In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N. The peak energies of the most dominant feature, the donor-bound exciton, for both samples show an $S$-shape behavior indicating the presence of disorder. Although doping improves luminescence, it also introduces deeper localized states. This suggests that impurity-induced disorder outweighs compositional fluctuations, as confirmed by higher disorder parameters and Stokes shifts. Thus, the Si doping leads to increased localization, reducing nonradiative recombination channels while enhancing radiative processes. The deeper states in the doped sample confirm improved carrier confinement, and their saturation leads to early thermalization, thereby lowering the red-blue shift transition from 165 K to about 50 K. Even though the high doping level makes Si-doped In$_{0.10}$Ga$_{0.90}$N a degenerate system, it exhibits enhanced luminescence properties. These findings shed light on the impact of silicon doping on charge transport in InGaN alloys for optoelectronic applications.</description>
