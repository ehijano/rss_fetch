      <title>Simulation of Stochastic Non-Equilibrium Thermal Effects of Particle Inclusions within Fluid Interfaces and Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate theoretical modeling approaches and develop practical computational simulation methods for investigating the non-equilibrium statistical mechanics of fluid interfaces with passive and active immersed particles. Our approaches capture phenomena taking into account thermal and dissipative energy exchanges, hydrodynamic coupling, and correlated spontaneous fluctuations. Our methods allow for modeling non-uniform time-varying temperature fields, fluid momentum fields, and their impacts on particle drift-diffusion dynamics. We show how practical stochastic numerical methods can be developed for these systems by performing analysis to factor operators analytically to obtain efficient algorithms for generating the fluctuating fields. We demonstrate our methods in a few simulation studies showing how they can be used to capture particle heating of the interface and the roles of thermal gradients on hydrodynamic fluctuations. The methods developed provide modeling and simulation approaches that can be used for further investigations of non-equilibrium phenomena in active soft materials, complex fluids, and biophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Organization and Dynamics of Chromosomes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How long threadlike eukaryotic chromosomes fit tidily in the small volume of the nucleus without significant entanglement is just beginning to be understood, thanks to major advances in experimental techniques. Several polymer models, which reproduce contact maps that measure the probabilities that two loci are in spatial contact, have predicted the three-dimensional structures of interphase chromosomes. Data-driven approaches, using contact maps as input, predict that mitotic helical chromosomes are characterized by switch in handedness, referred to as "perversion". By using experimentally derived effective interactions between chromatin loci in simulations, structures of conventional and inverted nuclei have been accurately predicted. Polymer theory and simulations show that the dynamics of individual loci in chromatin exhibit subdiffusive behavior but the diffusion exponents are broadly distributed, which accords well with experiments. Although coarse-grained models are successful, many challenging problems remain, which require the creation of new experimental and computational tools to understand genome biology.</description>

      <title>The exponential distance rule based network model predicts topology and reveals functionally relevant properties of the Drosophila projectome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studying structural brain networks has witnessed significant advancement in recent decades. Findings have revealed a geometric principle, the exponential distance rule (EDR) showing that the number of neurons decreases exponentially with the length of their axons. An EDR based network model explained various characteristics of inter-areal cortical networks in macaques, mice, and rats. The complete connectome of the Drosophila fruit fly has recently been mapped at the neuronal level. Our study demonstrates that the EDR holds true in Drosophila, and the EDR model effectively accounts for numerous binary and weighted properties of neuropil networks, also called projectome. Our study illustrates that the EDR model is a suitable null model for analyzing networks of brain regions, as it captures geometric and physical constraints in very different species. The importance of the null model lies in its ability to facilitate the identification of functionally significant features that are not caused by inevitable geometric constraints, as we illustrate with the pronounced asymmetry of connection weights important for functional hierarchy.</description>

      <title>Manifold-based transformation of the probability distribution for convergence in optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01499v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconstructing probability distributions from experimental data is a crucial problem across various fields. An effective approach is to optimize a theoretical or computational model of the distribution under an objective functional that evaluates consistency with the experimental data. However, achieving convergence in optimization remains a challenge. Given the manifold structure of the probability distribution space, we demonstrate that transformation of distribution in optimization should be infinitesimal displacements along exponential geodesics. Our theory was validated through the reconstruction of protein conformational ensembles, showing its broad applicability.</description>

      <title>Cluster size determines morphology of transcription factories in human cells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.06386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcription is a fundamental cellular process, and the first step of gene expression. In human cells, it depends on the binding to chromatin of various proteins, including RNA polymerases and numerous transcription factors (TFs). Observations indicate that these proteins tend to form macromolecular clusters, known as transcription factories, whose morphology and composition is still debated. While some microscopy experiments have revealed the presence of specialised factories, composed of similar TFs transcribing families of related genes, sequencing experiments suggest instead that mixed clusters may be prevalent, as a panoply of different TFs binds promiscuously the same chromatin region. The mechanisms underlying the formation of specialised or mixed factories remain elusive. With the aim of finding such mechanisms, here we develop a chromatin polymer model mimicking the chromatin binding-unbinding dynamics of different types of complexes of TFs. Surprisingly, both specialised (i.e., demixed) and mixed clusters spontaneously emerge, and which of the two types forms depends mainly on cluster size. The mechanism promoting mixing is the presence of non-specific interactions between chromatin and proteins, which become increasingly important as clusters become larger. This result, that we observe both in simple polymer models and more realistic ones for human chromosomes, reconciles the apparently contrasting experimental results obtained. Additionally, we show how the introduction of different types of TFs strongly affects the emergence of transcriptional networks, providing a pathway to investigate transcriptional changes following gene editing or naturally occurring mutations.</description>

      <title>Dimensional reduction and adaptation-development-evolution relation in evolved biological systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Life systems are complex and hierarchical, with diverse components at different scales, yet they sustain themselves, grow, and evolve over time. How can a theory of such complex biological states be developed? Here we note that for a hierarchical biological system to be robust, it must achieve consistency between micro-scale (e.g. molecular) and macro-scale (e.g. cellular) phenomena. This allows for a universal theory of adaptive change in cells based on biological robustness and consistency between cellular growth and molecular replication. Here, we show how adaptive changes in high-dimensional phenotypes (biological states) are constrained to low-dimensional space, leading to the derivation of a macroscopic law for cellular states. The theory is then extended to evolution, leading to proportionality between evolutionary and environmental responses, as well as proportionality between phenotypic variances due to noise and due to genetic changes. The universality of the results across several models and experiments is demonstrated. Then, by further extending the theory of evolutionary dimensional reduction to multicellular systems, the relationship between multicellular development and evolution, in particular the developmental hourglass, is demonstrated. Finally, the possibility of collapse of dimensional reduction under nutrient limitation is discussed.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer heterogeneities can enhance scroll wave stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electrical scroll waves may cause life-threatening arrhythmias in the heart, and it is therefore important to control their dynamics. We explore how boundary layer heterogeneities affect the scroll wave dynamics in a semidiscrete electrophysiological model. Using simulations, we show that reducing the coupling strength near the boundaries of thin tissues results in a decrease of the angular frequency of the scroll wave, which in turn prevents its meandering instability. Finally, we propose a simplified model that only considers activation in the boundary layer and in one bulk tissue slice, and show that it is able to faithfully capture our numerical observations.</description>

      <title>A conceptual predator-prey model with super-long transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Drawing on the understanding of the logistic map, we propose a simple predator-prey model where predators and prey adapt to each other, leading to the co-evolution of the system. The special dynamics observed in periodic windows contribute to the coexistence of multiple time scales, adding to the complexity of the system. Typical dynamics in ecosystems, such as the persistence and coexistence of population cycles and chaotic behaviors, the emergence of super-long transients, regime shifts, and the quantifying of resilience, are encapsulated within this single model. The simplicity of our model allows for detailed analysis, reinforcing its potential as a conceptual tool for understanding ecosystems deeply.</description>
