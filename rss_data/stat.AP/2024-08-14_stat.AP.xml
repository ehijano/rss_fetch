      <title>Quantifying uncertainty in climate projections with conformal ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce conformal ensembling, a new approach to uncertainty quantification in climate projections based on conformal inference. Unlike traditional methods, conformal ensembling seamlessly integrates climate models and observational data across a range of scales to generate statistically rigorous, easy-to-interpret uncertainty estimates. It can be applied to any climatic variable using any ensemble analysis method and outperforms existing inter-model variability methods in uncertainty quantification across all time horizons and most spatial locations under SSP2-4.5. Conformal ensembling is also computationally efficient, requires minimal assumptions, and is highly robust to the conformity measure. Experiments show that it is effective when conditioning future projections on historical reanalysis data compared with standard ensemble averaging approaches, yielding more physically consistent projections.</description>

      <title>Joint model for interval-censored semi-competing events and longitudinal data with subject-specific within and between visits variabilities</title>

Abstract: Dementia currently affects about 50 million people worldwide, and this number is rising. Since there is still no cure, the primary focus remains on preventing modifiable risk factors such as cardiovascular factors. It is now recognized that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia. An increasing number of studies suggest that blood pressure variability may also be a risk factor for dementia. However, these studies have significant methodological weaknesses and fail to distinguish between long-term and short-term variability. The aim of this work was to propose a new joint model that combines a mixed-effects model, which handles the residual variance distinguishing inter-visit variability from intra-visit variability, and an illness-death model that allows for interval censoring and semi-competing risks. A subject-specific random effect is included in the model for both variances. Risks can simultaneously depend on the current value and slope of the marker, as well as on each of the two components of the residual variance. The model estimation is performed by maximizing the likelihood function using the Marquardt-Levenberg algorithm. A simulation study validates the estimation procedure, which is implemented in an R package. The model was estimated using data from the Three-City (3C) cohort to study the impact of intra- and inter-visits blood pressure variability on the risk of dementia and death.</description>

      <title>Estimating Breakpoints between Climate States in Paleoclimate Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08336v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a statistical time-domain approach for identifying transitions between climate states, referred to as breakpoints, using well-established econometric tools. We analyse a 67.1 million year record of the oxygen isotope ratio delta-18-O derived from benthic foraminifera. The dataset is presented in Westerhold et al. (2020), where the authors use recurrence analysis to identify six climate states. Fixing the number of breakpoints to five, our procedure results in breakpoint estimates that closely align with those identified by Westerhold et al. (2020). By treating the number of breakpoints as a parameter to be estimated, we provide the statistical justification for more than five breakpoints in the time series. Further, our approach offers the advantage of constructing confidence intervals for the breakpoints, and it allows for testing how many breakpoints are present in the time series.</description>

      <title>Assessing variable importance in survival analysis using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a collection of features available for inclusion in a predictive model, it may be of interest to quantify the relative importance of a subset of features for the prediction task at hand. For example, in HIV vaccine trials, participant baseline characteristics are used to predict the probability of HIV acquisition over the intended follow-up period, and investigators may wish to understand how much certain types of predictors, such as behavioral factors, contribute toward overall predictiveness. Time-to-event outcomes such as time to HIV acquisition are often subject to right censoring, and existing methods for assessing variable importance are typically not intended to be used in this setting. We describe a broad class of algorithm-agnostic variable importance measures for prediction in the context of survival data. We propose a nonparametric efficient estimation procedure that incorporates flexible learning of nuisance parameters, yields asymptotically valid inference, and enjoys double-robustness. We assess the performance of our proposed procedure via numerical simulations and analyze data from the HVTN 702 vaccine trial to inform enrollment strategies for future HIV vaccine trials.</description>

      <title>Combining BART and Principal Stratification to estimate the effect of intermediate on primary outcomes with application to estimating the effect of family planning on employment in sub-Saharan Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is interest in learning about the causal effect of family planning (FP) on empowerment related outcomes. Experimental data related to this question are available from trials in which FP programs increase access to FP. While program assignment is unconfounded, FP uptake and subsequent empowerment may share common causes. We use principal stratification to estimate the causal effect of an intermediate FP outcome on a primary outcome of interest, among women affected by a FP program. Within strata defined by the potential reaction to the program, FP uptake is unconfounded. To minimize the need for parametric assumptions, we propose to use Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) for modeling stratum membership and outcomes of interest. We refer to the combined approach as Prince BART. We evaluate Prince BART through a simulation study and use it to assess the causal effect of modern contraceptive use on employment in six cities in Nigeria, based on quasi-experimental data from a FP program trial during the first half of the 2010s. We show that findings differ between Prince BART and alternative modeling approaches based on parametric assumptions.</description>
