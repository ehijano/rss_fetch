      <title>Distributed consensus-based observer design for target state estimation with bearing measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel distributed consensus-based observer design that enables a group of agents in an undirected communication network to solve the problem of target tracking, where the target is modeled as a chain of integrators of arbitrary order. Each agent is assumed to know its own position and simultaneously measure bearing vectors relative to the target. We start by introducing a general continuous time observer design tailored to systems whose state dynamics are modeled as chains of integrators and whose measurement model follows a particular nonlinear but observer-suited form. This design leverages a correction term that combines innovation and consensus components, allowing each agent to broadcast only a part of the state estimate to its neighbours, which effectively reduces the data flowing across the network. To provide uniform exponential stability guarantees, a novel result for a class of nonlinear closed-loop systems in a generalized observer form is introduced and subsequently used as the main tool to derive stability conditions on the observer gains. Then, by exploring the properties of orthogonal projection matrices, the proposed design is used to solve the distributed target tracking problem and provide explicit stability conditions that depend on the target-agents geometric formation. Practical examples are derived for a target modeled as first-, second-, and third-order integrator dynamics, highlighting the design procedure and the stability conditions imposed. Finally, numerical results showcase the properties of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Remote Assistance or Remote Driving: The Impact of Operational Design Domains on ADS-Supporting Systems Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High level Automated Driving Systems (ADS) can handle many situations, but they still encounter situations where human intervention is required. In systems where a physical driver is present in the vehicle, typically SAE Level 3 systems, this intervention is relatively straightforward and is handled by the in-vehicle driver. However, the complexity increases for Level 4 systems, where, in most cases, no physical driver remains in the vehicle. The two common industry solutions for this challenge are the integration of a remote support system, such as a Remote Driving System (RDS) or Remote Assistance System (RAS). While it is clear that ADS will require one of these systems, it is less clear how the suitability of either system for a particular ADS application should be evaluated. Currently, the selection process often focuses on system architecture as well as its design and integration challenges. Furthermore, since many ADS developers choose to develop remote system solutions in-house, it is advantageous to select the simpler approach to streamline development and integration efforts. While these decision points are certainly relevant, this approach overlooks the most critical factors: the use cases and the complementarity of the ADS and the remote support system within the context of the Operational Design Design Domain (ODD). This paper proposes a structured approach for selecting between RDS and RAS as an ADS support system, based on the defined ODD and use case analysis. To achieve this, the paper applies the PEGASUS framework to systematically describe and analyze the ODD. A structured framework is introduced to evaluate and select the most suitable remote support system for an ADS based on clearly defined criteria.</description>

      <title>Bi-level Model Predictive Control for Energy-aware Integrated Product Pricing and Production Scheduling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The manufacturing industry is under growing pressure to enhance sustainability while preserving economic competitiveness. As a result, manufacturers have been trying to determine how to integrate onsite renewable energy and real-time electricity pricing into manufacturing schedules without compromising profitability. To address this challenge, we propose a bi-level model predictive control framework that jointly optimizes product prices and production scheduling with explicit consideration of renewable energy availability. The higher level determines the product price to maximize revenue and renewable energy usage. The lower level controls production scheduling in runtime to minimize operational costs and respond to the product demand. Price elasticity is incorporated to model market response, allowing the system to increase demand by lowering the product price during high renewable energy generation. Results from a lithium-ion battery pack manufacturing system case study demonstrate that our approach enables manufacturers to reduce grid energy costs while increasing profit.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Indirect Influencing and Control on Graphs using Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to solving the indirect influence problem in networked systems, in which cooperative nodes must regulate a target node with uncertain dynamics to follow a desired trajectory. We leverage the message-passing structure of a graph neural network (GNN), allowing nodes to collectively learn the unknown target dynamics in real time. We develop a novel GNN-based backstepping control strategy with formal stability guarantees derived from a Lyapunov-based analysis. Numerical simulations are included to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller.</description>

      <title>A Black Start Strategy for Hydrogen-integrated Renewable Grids with Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing integration of renewable energy, the reliability and resilience of modern power systems are of vital significance. However, large-scale blackouts caused by natural disasters or equipment failures remain a significant threat, necessitating effective restoration strategies. This study proposes novel black start models for modern power systems that integrate fuel cells and battery storage, recognizing their distinct characteristics and contributions to grid resilience. These models specifically address the restoration of electrical grids, including the energization paths and time of the transmission network, while accounting for the unique power output traits of fuel cells and the energy storage capacity of batteries as black start resources. Black start simulations, comparing the generator startup sequence (GSUS) with fuel cell versus battery systems, are performed on the IEEE 39-bus system. We conduct sensitivity analyses on fuel cell capacity, battery storage capacity, initial state of charge (SOC), and resource locations to identify optimal scenarios for black start operations.</description>

      <title>Learning-Augmented Control: Adaptively Confidence Learning for Competitive MPC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce Learning-Augmented Control (LAC), an approach that integrates untrusted machine learning predictions into the control of constrained, nonlinear dynamical systems. LAC is designed to achieve the "best-of-both-worlds" guarantees, i.e, near-optimal performance when predictions are accurate, and robust, safe performance when they are not. The core of our approach is a delayed confidence learning procedure that optimizes a confidence parameter online, adaptively balancing between ML and nominal predictions. We establish formal competitive ratio bounds for general nonlinear systems under standard MPC regularity assumptions. For the linear quadratic case, we derive a competitive ratio bound that is provably tight, thereby characterizing the fundamental limits of this learning-augmented approach. The effectiveness of LAC is demonstrated in numerical studies, where it maintains stability and outperforms standard methods under adversarial prediction errors.</description>

      <title>One-Time Programmable Passive Electromagnetic Skins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The implementation of simple, inexpensive, and mass-production-oriented solutions for smart electromagnetic environments (SEMEs) is dealt with by introducing the concept of "one-time programmable" electromagnetic skins (OTP-EMSs). The simultaneous achievement of modular fabrication, (one-time) configurable reflection properties, passive-static operation, and zero maintenance is yielded by integrating expendable components at the atomic level of EMSs. Towards this end, an OTP meta-atom structure is properly defined and optimized to build EMSs featuring the desired scenario-dependent EM wave manipulation functionalities. In order to illustrate the features as well as to point out the potentialities of OTP-EMSs, a representative set of analytical, numerical, and experimental results is reported by considering different apertures, illuminations, and EM wave manipulation requirements.</description>

      <title>Gait Transitions in Load-Pulling Quadrupeds: Insights from Sled Dogs and a Minimal SLIP Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadrupedal animals employ diverse galloping strategies to optimize speed, stability, and energy efficiency. However, the biomechanical mechanisms that enable adaptive gait transitions during high-speed locomotion under load remain poorly understood. In this study, we present new empirical and modeling insights into the biomechanics of load-pulling quadrupeds, using sprint sled dogs as a model system. High-speed video and force recordings reveal that sled dogs often switch between rotary and transverse galloping gaits within just a few strides and without any observable changes in speed, stride duration, or terrain, providing clear evidence of locomotor multistability during high-speed load-pulling. To investigate the mechanical basis of these transitions, a physics-based quadrupedal Spring-Loaded Inverted Pendulum model with hybrid dynamics and prescribed footfall sequences to reproduce the asymmetric galloping patterns observed in racing sled dogs. Through trajectory optimization, we replicate experimentally observed gait sequences and identify swing-leg stiffness modulation as a key control mechanism for inducing transitions. This work provides a much-needed biomechanical perspective on high-speed animal draft and establishes a modeling framework for studying locomotion in pulling quadrupeds, with implications for both biological understanding and the design of adaptive legged systems.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Sustainability in HAPS-Assisted 6G Networks: Load Estimation Aware Cell Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces and addresses the critical challenge of traffic load estimation in cell switching within vertical heterogeneous networks. The effectiveness of cell switching is significantly limited by the lack of accurate traffic load data for small base stations (SBSs) in sleep mode, making many load-dependent energy-saving approaches impractical, as they assume perfect knowledge of traffic loads, an assumption that is unrealistic when SBSs are inactive. In other words, when SBSs are in sleep mode, their traffic loads cannot be directly known and can only be estimated, inevitably with corresponding errors. Rather than proposing a new switching algorithm, we focus on eliminating this foundational barrier by exploring effective prediction techniques. A novel vertical heterogeneous network model is considered, integrating a high-altitude platform station (HAPS) as a super macro base station (SMBS). We investigate both spatial and temporal load estimation approaches, including three spatial interpolation schemes, random neighboring selection, distance based selection, and multi level clustering (MLC), alongside a temporal deep learning method based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Using a real world dataset for empirical validation, our results show that both spatial and temporal methods significantly improve estimation accuracy, with the MLC and LSTM approaches demonstrating particularly strong performance.</description>

      <title>Multi Target Observability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14765v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly focus on the problem of multi-target observability, focusing on the unique state estimation criteria for multiple targets. We derive the condition which is necessary as well as sufficient for observability using bearing angles with multiple higher-order dynamics observed by a single observer. We then establish an alternative notion of observability by analyzing ambiguous target trajectories and deriving the condition which is NECNDSUF (Nec. and Suff.) for multi-target observability, considering three types of measurements: Doppler-only, bearing-only, and combined Doppler and bearing measurements, which offers insights that can improve target distinguishability, trajectory reconstruction, and overall tracking accuracy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the advanced reasoning and information analysis capabilities, large language models (LLMs) can offer a novel approach for the autonomous generation of dispatch strategies in power systems. This letter proposes an LLM-based experience-driven voltage control solution for distribution networks, which enables the self-evolution of LLM-based voltage control strategies through the collaboration and interaction of multiple modules-specifically, experience storage, experience retrieval, experience generation, and experience modification. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method and highlight the applicability of LLM in addressing power system dispatch challenges.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Destabilization Attacks to Direct Data-Driven Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the vulnerability of direct data-driven control methods, specifically for the linear quadratic regulator problem, to adversarial perturbations in collected data used for controller synthesis. We consider stealthy attacks that subtly manipulate offline-collected data to destabilize the resulting closed-loop system while evading detection. To generate such perturbations, we propose the Directed Gradient Sign Method (DGSM) and its iterative variant (I-DGSM), adaptations of the fast gradient sign method originally developed for neural networks, which align perturbations with the gradient of the spectral radius of the closed-loop matrix to reduce stability. A key contribution is an efficient gradient computation technique based on implicit differentiation through the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions of the underlying semidefinite program, enabling scalable and exact gradient evaluation without repeated optimization computations. To defend against these attacks, we propose two defense strategies: a regularization-based approach that enhances robustness by suppressing controller sensitivity to data perturbations and a robust data-driven control approach that guarantees closed-loop stability within bounded perturbation sets. Extensive numerical experiments on benchmark systems show that adversarial perturbations with magnitudes up to ten times smaller than random noise can destabilize controllers trained on corrupted data and that the proposed defense strategies effectively mitigate attack success rates while maintaining control performance. Additionally, we evaluate attack transferability under partial knowledge scenarios, highlighting the practical importance of protecting training data confidentiality.</description>

      <title>An approach to the LQG/LTR design problem with specifications for finite-dimensional SISO control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is an expository paper which discusses an approach to the LQG/LTR design problem for finite-dimensional SISO control systems. The approach is based on the utilisation of weighting augmentation for incorporating design specifications into the framework of the LTR technique for LQG compensator design. The LQG compensator is to simultaneously meet given analytical low- and high-frequency design specifications expressed in terms of desirable sensitivity and controller noise sensitivity functions. The paper is aimed at nonspecialists and, in particular, practitioners in finite-dimensional LQG theory interested in the design of feedback compensators for closed-loop performance and robustness shaping of SISO control systems in realistic situations. The proposed approach is illustrated by a detailed numerical example: the torque control of a current-controlled DC motor with an elastically mounted rotor.</description>

      <title>Safety Controller Synthesis for Stochastic Networked Systems under Communication Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a framework for synthesizing safety controllers for discrete-time stochastic linear control systems (dt-SLS) operating under communication imperfections. The control unit is remote and communicates with the sensor and actuator through an imperfect wireless network. We consider a constant delay in the sensor-to-controller channel (uplink), and data loss in both sensor-to-controller and controller-to-actuator (downlink) channels. In our proposed scheme, data loss in each channel is modeled as an independent Bernoulli-distributed random process. To systematically handle the uplink delay, we first introduce an augmented discrete-time stochastic linear system (dt-ASLS) by concatenating all states and control inputs that sufficiently represent the state-input evolution of the original dt-SLS under the delay and packet loss constraints. We then leverage control barrier certificates (CBCs) for dt-ASLS to synthesize a controller that guarantees dt-SLS safety in a stochastic sense, ensuring that all trajectories of dt-SLS remain within safe regions with a quantified probabilistic bound. Our approach translates safety constraints into matrix inequalities, leading to an optimization problem that eventually quantifies the probability of satisfying the safety specification in the presence of communication imperfections. We validate our results on an RLC circuit subject to both constant delay and probabilistic data loss.</description>

      <title>On an Abstraction of Lyapunov and Lagrange Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies a set-theoretic generalization of Lyapunov and Lagrange stability for abstract systems described by set-valued maps. Lyapunov stability is characterized as the property of inversely mapping filters to filters, Lagrange stability as that of mapping ideals to ideals. These abstract definitions unveil a deep duality between the two stability notions, enable a definition of global stability for abstract systems, and yield an agile generalization of the stability theorems for basic series, parallel, and feedback interconnections, including a small-gain theorem. Moreover, it is shown that Lagrange stability is abstractly identical to other properties of interest in control theory, such as safety and positivity, whose preservation under interconnections can be thus studied owing to the developed stability results.</description>

      <title>Exact Finite Koopman Embedding of Block-Oriented Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The challenge of finding exact and finite-dimensional Koopman embeddings of nonlinear systems has been largely circumvented by employing data-driven techniques to learn models of different complexities (e.g., linear, bilinear, input affine). Although these models may provide good accuracy, selecting the model structure and dimension is still ad-hoc and it is difficult to quantify the error that is introduced. In contrast to the general trend of data-driven learning, in this paper, we develop a systematic technique for nonlinear systems that produces a finite-dimensional and exact embedding. If the nonlinear system is represented as a network of series and parallel linear and nonlinear (polynomial) blocks, one can derive an associated Koopman model that has constant state and output matrices and the input influence is polynomial. Furthermore, if the linear blocks do not have feedthrough, the Koopman representation simplifies to a bilinear model.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Network Security Policies via Belief Aggregation and Rollout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evolving security vulnerabilities and shifting operational conditions require frequent updates to network security policies. These updates include adjustments to incident response procedures and modifications to access controls, among others. Reinforcement learning methods have been proposed for automating such policy adaptations, but most of the methods in the research literature lack performance guarantees and adapt slowly to changes. In this paper, we address these limitations and present a method for computing security policies that is scalable, offers theoretical guarantees, and adapts quickly to changes. It assumes a model or simulator of the system and comprises three components: belief estimation through particle filtering, offline policy computation through aggregation, and online policy adaptation through rollout. Central to our method is a new feature-based aggregation technique, which improves scalability and flexibility. We analyze the approximation error of aggregation and show that rollout efficiently adapts policies to changes under certain conditions. Simulations and testbed results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks, including CAGE-2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a modular, fast and large-area fabrication of bio-piezoelectric films. The technique is based on the formation of cone-jet mode by applying a high voltage electric field to conductive spiked metal disks. And the self-assembly process of biomolecular materials through nanoconfinement with in-situ poling effect. This job achieved print speeds of up to 9.2 109 um3/s with a combination of only 2 printheads. At the same time, the modular design allows the MLSP to achieve theoretically unlimited print efficiency.

      <title>Energy consumption optimization and self-powered environmental monitoring design for low-carbon smart buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the growing emphasis on intelligent buildings as a cornerstone of sustainable urban development, significant energy inefficiencies persist due to suboptimal design, material choices, and user behavior. The applicability of integrated Building Information Modeling (BIM) and solarpowered environmental monitoring systems for energy optimization in low-carbon smart buildings remains underexplored. Can BIM-driven design improvements, combined with photovoltaic systems, achieve substantial energy savings while enabling self-powered environmental monitoring? This study conducts a case analysis on a retrofitted primary school building in Guangdong, China, utilizing BIM-based energy simulations, material optimization, and solar technology integration. The outcomes reveal that the proposed approach reduced annual energy consumption by 40.68%, with lighting energy use decreasing by 36.59%. A rooftop photovoltaic system demonstrated a payback period of 7.46 years while powering environmental sensors autonomously. Hardware system integrates sensors and an ARDUINO-based controller to detect environmental factors like rainfall, temperature, and air quality. It is powered by a 6W solar panel and a 2200 mAh/7.4 V lithium battery to ensure stable operation. This study underscores the potential of BIM and solar energy integration to transform traditional buildings into energy-efficient, self-sustaining smart structures. Further research can expand the scalability of these methods across diverse climates and building typologies.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Learning of Proprietary Inverter Models for Grid Dynamic Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter develops a novel physics-informed neural ordinary differential equations-based framework to emulate the proprietary dynamics of the inverters -- essential for improved accuracy in grid dynamic simulations. In current industry practice, the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) often do not disclose the exact internal controls and parameters of the inverters, posing significant challenges in performing accurate dynamic simulations and other relevant studies, such as gain tunings for stability analysis and controls. To address this, we propose a Physics-Informed Latent Neural ODE Model (PI-LNM) that integrates system physics with neural learning layers to capture the unmodeled behaviors of proprietary units. The proposed method is validated using a grid-forming inverter (GFM) case study, demonstrating improved dynamic simulation accuracy over approaches that rely solely on data-driven learning without physics-based guidance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Capturing target objects using the quadrotor has gained increasing popularity in recent years, but most studies focus on capturing lightweight objects. The instantaneous contact force generated when capturing objects of a certain mass, along with the payload uncertainty after attachment, will pose significant challenges to the quadrotor control. This paper proposes a novel control architecture, namely Dual-Channel Adaptive Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (DCA-NMPC), which cascades a nonlinear model predictive control with two lower-level model reference adaptive controllers and can resist drastic impact and adapt to uncertain inertial parameters. Numerical simulation experiments are performed for validation.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimisation of Electric Vehicle Routing and Scheduling: A Deep Learning-Driven Approach for Dynamic Fleet Sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric Vehicles (EVs) are becoming increasingly prevalent nowadays, with studies highlighting their potential as mobile energy storage systems to provide grid support. Realising this potential requires effective charging coordination, which are often formulated as mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems. However, MIP problems are NP-hard and often intractable when applied to time-sensitive tasks. To address this limitation, we propose a deep learning assisted approach for optimising a day-ahead EV joint routing and scheduling problem with varying number of EVs. This problem simultaneously optimises EV routing, charging, discharging and generator scheduling within a distribution network with renewable energy sources. A convolutional neural network is trained to predict the binary variables, thereby reducing the solution search space and enabling solvers to determine the remaining variables more efficiently. Additionally, a padding mechanism is included to handle the changes in input and output sizes caused by varying number of EVs, thus eliminating the need for re-training. In a case study on the IEEE 33-bus system and Nguyen-Dupuis transportation network, our approach reduced runtime by 97.8% when compared to an unassisted MIP solver, while retaining 99.5% feasibility and deviating less than 0.01% from the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>RoCoF Constrained Regional Inertia Security Region: Formulation and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The regional inertia, which determines the regional rate of change of frequency (RoCoF), should be kept in a secure status in renewable-penetrated power systems. To break away from mapping the regional maximum RoCoF with regional inertia in a linearized form, this paper comprehensively studies the regional inertia security problem from formulation to applications. Firstly, the regional inertia security region (R-ISR) is defined, whose boundary is non-linear and non-convex. Then, a local linearized method is devised to calculate the global maximum of regional RoCoF. The non-convex ISR boundary is expressed by multiple simple boundaries corresponding to each local solution, which can be obtained by a simple search-based method. Finally, the convexified R-ISR constraint is formed by convex decomposition and embedded in an inertia optimal adjustment model. The results on a 3-region system show some counter-intuitive findings, such as increasing the inertia of one region may worsen its RoCoF.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Effect of Grid-Following Converter on Frequency Dynamics -- Part I: Center of Inertia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the impact of grid-following (GFL) converters on system frequency dynamics is crucial, from both the center of inertia (COI) and frequency spatial variation perspectives. Part I of this series clarifies the mechanisms by which GFLs influence COI frequency dynamics. A multi-generator model of the power system with GFLs is developed, incorporating the local dynamics of GFLs and their interaction with synchronous generators via virtual tie lines. By aggregating the multi-generator model into the COI frame, the interaction between the COI frequency and the equivalent frequency of GFLs is revealed. The equivalent inertia and other components at the GFL side, determined by control parameters and operating conditions, support the COI through virtual tying power. Simulation validates the accuracy of the proposed modeling and demonstrates that the impact of GFLs on COI frequency is relatively weak. The equivalent inertia and other components of GFLs still significantly influence COI frequency dynamics, with their effects being both time-variable and adjustable.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Effect of Grid-Following Converter on Frequency Dynamics -- Part II: Spatial Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Besides the center of inertia (COI) frequency dynamics addressed in Part I, the spatial frequency variation in power systems with grid-following (GFL) converters is also crucial. Part II revisits the effect of GFLs on frequency spatial variation. Leveraging the interfacing state variables and equivalent frequency defined in Part I, an extended frequency divider (FD) formula is proposed. The linearized mapping relationship between network node frequency and synchronous generator (SG) rotor frequency, as well as GFL equivalent frequency, is modeled. The superposition contribution from GFLs is determined by the electrical distance between the generator and the frequency observation node, as well as the system power flow conditions. Additionally, the frequency mapping for branch currents, which is overlooked in previous research, is addressed. Simulation results validate the accuracy of the proposed extended FD formula. They quantitatively demonstrate that the superposition contribution of GFLs to node frequency is relatively weak and that the superposition coefficient is time-varying. The branch frequency superposition reveals a complex and distinctly different pattern.</description>

      <title>Transformer-based Deep Learning Model for Joint Routing and Scheduling with Varying Electric Vehicle Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing integration of renewable energy sources in modern power systems has introduced significant operational challenges due to their intermittent and uncertain outputs. In recent years, mobile energy storage systems (ESSs) have emerged as a popular flexible resource for mitigating these challenges. Compared to stationary ESSs, mobile ESSs offer additional spatial flexibility, enabling cost-effective energy delivery through the transportation network. However, the widespread deployment of mobile ESSs is often hindered by the high investment cost, which has motivated researchers to investigate utilising more readily available alternatives, such as electric vehicles (EVs) as mobile energy storage units instead. Hence, we explore this opportunity with a MIP-based day-ahead electric vehicle joint routing and scheduling problem in this work. However, solving the problem in a practical setting can often be computationally intractable since the existence of binary variables makes it combinatorial challenging. Therefore, we proposed to simplify the problem's solution process for a MIP solver by pruning the solution search space with a transformer-based deep learning (DL) model. This is done by training the model to rapidly predict the optimal binary solutions. In addition, unlike many existing DL approaches that assume fixed problem structures, the proposed model is designed to accommodate problems with EV fleets of any sizes. This flexibility is essential since frequent re-training can introduce significant computational overhead. We evaluated the approach with simulations on the IEEE 33-bus system coupled with the Nguyen-Dupuis transportation network.</description>

      <title>Scaled Relative Graph Analysis of General Interconnections of SISO Nonlinear Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. However, we show that the current SRG analysis suffers from a pitfall that limits its applicability in analyzing practical nonlinear systems. We overcome this pitfall by introducing a novel reformulation of the SRG of a linear time-invariant operator and combining the SRG with the Nyquist criterion. The result is a theorem that can be used to assess stability and $L_2$-gain performance for general interconnections of nonlinear dynamic systems. We provide practical calculation results for canonical interconnections and apply our result to Lur'e systems to obtain a generalization of the celebrated circle criterion, which deals with broader class of nonlinearities, and we derive (incremental) $L_2$-gain performance bounds. We illustrate the power of the new approach on the analysis of several examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous vehicles require reliable hazard detection. However, primary sensor systems may miss near-field obstacles, resulting in safety risks. Although a dedicated fast-reacting near-field monitoring system can mitigate this, it typically suffers from false positives. To mitigate these, in this paper, we introduce three monitoring strategies based on dynamic spatial properties, relevant object sizes, and motion-aware prediction. In experiments in a validated simulation, we compare the initial monitoring strategy against the proposed improvements. The results demonstrate that the proposed strategies can significantly improve the reliability of near-field monitoring systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most important satellite subsystems is its electric power subsystem. The occurrence of a fault in the satellite power system causes the failure of all or part of the satellite. Calculating the overall reliability of the power system before the mission is crucial in improving the design of the satellite power system. Each component of the power system may malfunction due to pressure, launch pressure, and operating conditions. Accordingly, in this paper, first, a healthy and faulty system for the components of the electrical power system is simulated with MATLAB. Finally, by drawing a fault tree to analyze the reliability of the power subsystem, overall mission reliability, power system fault rate, and overall fault rate of the mission are calculated by Windchill software. Finally, a total mission assurance of 0.999 was achieved, indicating the high reliability of the simulated system.</description>

      <title>Density control of multi-agent swarms via bio-inspired leader-follower plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The design of control systems for the spatial self-organization of mobile agents is an open challenge across several engineering domains, including swarm robotics and synthetic biology. Here, we propose a bio-inspired leader-follower solution, which is aware of energy constraints of mobile agents and is apt to deal with large swarms. Akin to many natural systems, control objectives are formulated for the entire collective, and leaders and followers are allowed to plastically switch their role in time. We frame a density control problem, modeling the agents' population via a system of nonlinear partial differential equations. This approach allows for a compact description that inherently avoids the curse of dimensionality and improves analytical tractability. We derive analytical guarantees for the existence of desired steady-state solutions and their local stability for one-dimensional and higher-dimensional problems. We numerically validate our control methodology, offering support to the effectiveness, robustness, and versatility of our proposed bio-inspired control strategy.</description>

Abstract: We prove that any optimal, independent, and zero unanimous fuzzy classification aggregation function of a continuum of individual classifications of $m\ge 3$ objects into $2\le p\le m$ types must be a weighted arithmetic mean. We also provide a characterization for the case when $m=p=2$.</description>

      <title>Machine learning-enabled river water quality monitoring using lithography-free 3D-printed sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: River water quality monitoring is important for aquatic life, livestock, and humans because clean water is critical to meeting food demand during the global food crisis. Excessive contaminants, including phosphate, deplete dissolved oxygen and trigger eutrophication, leading to serious health and ecological problems. Continuous sensors that track phosphate levels can therefore help prevent eutrophication. In this work we present a lithography-free phosphate sensor (P-sensor) that detects phosphate in river water at parts-per-billion levels. The device uses a solid-state indicator electrode formed by 3D-printed periodic polymer patterns (8 um feature size) coated with a thin phosphate ion-selective membrane. The P-sensor detects as little as 1 ppb phosphate across 0 - 475 ppm with a response time under 30 seconds. We validated the sensor on Rappahannock River water, Virginia (less than 0.8 ppm phosphate) at sites upstream and downstream of a sewage treatment plant and benchmarked the results against a commercial phosphate meter. A feed-forward neural network was trained to predict phosphate levels, achieving a mean-squared error below 1e-3, zero standard deviation, and a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.997 for river samples. These results demonstrate a practical tool for continuous water-quality monitoring that can inform stakeholders and policymakers and ultimately improve public health.</description>

      <title>A Multi-Modal IoT Node for Energy-Efficient Environmental Monitoring with Edge AI Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has significantly advanced environmental monitoring (EM) by enabling cost-effective and scalable sensing solutions. Concurrently, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are introducing powerful tools for the efficient and accurate analysis of complex environmental data. However, current IoT platforms for environmental sensing are typically limited to a narrow set of sensors, preventing a comprehensive assessment of environmental conditions and lacking sufficient computational capabilities to support the deployment of advanced ML and AI algorithms on the edge. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a compact (17x38 mm2), multi-modal, MCU-based environmental IoT node integrating 11 sensors, including CO2 concentration, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), light intensity, UV radiation, pressure, temperature, humidity, visual sensing via an RGB camera, and precise geolocation through a GNSS module. It features GAP9, a parallel ultra-low-power system-on-chip, enabling real-time, energy-efficient edge processing of advanced ML models directly on-device. We implemented a YOLOv5-based occupancy detection pipeline (0.3 M parameters, 42 MOP per inference), demonstrating 42% energy savings over raw data streaming. Additionally, we present a smart indoor air quality (IAQ) monitoring setup that combines occupancy detection with adaptive sample rates, achieving operational times of up to 143 h on a single compact 600 mAh, 3.7 V battery. Our platform lays the groundwork for innovative applications such as predictive indoor IAQ, enabling efficient AI-driven on-edge forecasting for energy-efficient and autonomous, proactive pollution-mitigation control strategies</description>

      <title>Boosted Enhanced Quantile Regression Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Permutation Entropy for Complex System Prognostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for pattern prediction and system prognostics centered on Spatiotemporal Permutation Entropy analysis integrated with Boosted Enhanced Quantile Regression Neural Networks (BEQRNNs). We address the challenge of understanding complex dynamical patterns in multidimensional systems through an approach that combines entropy-based complexity measures with advanced neural architectures. The system leverages dual computational stages: first implementing spatiotemporal entropy extraction optimized for multiscale temporal and spatial data streams, followed by an integrated BEQRNN layer that enables probabilistic pattern prediction with uncertainty quantification. This architecture achieves 81.17% accuracy in spatiotemporal pattern classification with prediction horizons up to 200 time steps and maintains robust performance across diverse regimes. Field testing across chaotic attractors, reaction-diffusion systems, and industrial datasets shows a 79% increase in critical transition detection accuracy and 81.22% improvement in long-term prediction reliability. The framework's effectiveness in processing complex, multimodal entropy features demonstrates significant potential for real-time prognostic applications.</description>

      <title>Secure Goal-Oriented Communication: Defending against Eavesdropping Timing Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Goal-oriented Communication (GoC) is a new paradigm that plans data transmission to occur only when it is instrumental for the receiver to achieve a certain goal. This leads to the advantage of reducing the frequency of transmissions significantly while maintaining adherence to the receiver's objectives. However, GoC scheduling also opens a timing-based side channel that an eavesdropper can exploit to obtain information about the state of the system. This type of attack sidesteps even information-theoretic security, as it exploits the timing of updates rather than their content. In this work, we study such an eavesdropping attack against pull-based goal-oriented scheduling for remote monitoring and control of Markov processes. We provide a theoretical framework for defining the effectiveness of the attack and propose possible countermeasures, including two practical heuristics that provide a balance between the performance gains offered by GoC and the amount of leaked information. Our results show that, while a naive goal-oriented scheduler allows the eavesdropper to correctly guess the system state about 60% of the time, our heuristic defenses can halve the leakage with a marginal reduction of the benefits of goal-oriented approaches.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for Green Hydrogen Yield Prediction and Site Suitability using SHAP-Based Composite Index: Focus on Oman</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As nations seek sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels, green hydrogen has emerged as a promising strategic pathway toward decarbonisation, particularly in solar-rich arid regions. However, identifying optimal locations for hydrogen production requires the integration of complex environmental, atmospheric, and infrastructural factors, often compounded by limited availability of direct hydrogen yield data. This study presents a novel Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework for computing green hydrogen yield and site suitability index using mean absolute SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values. This framework consists of a multi-stage pipeline of unsupervised multi-variable clustering, supervised machine learning classifier and SHAP algorithm. The pipeline trains on an integrated meteorological, topographic and temporal dataset and the results revealed distinct spatial patterns of suitability and relative influence of the variables. With model predictive accuracy of 98%, the result also showed that water proximity, elevation and seasonal variation are the most influential factors determining green hydrogen site suitability in Oman with mean absolute shap values of 2.470891, 2.376296 and 1.273216 respectively. Given limited or absence of ground-truth yield data in many countries that have green hydrogen prospects and ambitions, this study offers an objective and reproducible alternative to subjective expert weightings, thus allowing the data to speak for itself and potentially discover novel latent groupings without pre-imposed assumptions. This study offers industry stakeholders and policymakers a replicable and scalable tool for green hydrogen infrastructure planning and other decision making in data-scarce regions.</description>

Abstract: We derive a decomposition for the gradient of the innovation loss with respect to the filter gain in a linear time-invariant system, decomposing as a product of an observability Gramian and a term quantifying the ``non-orthogonality" between the estimation error and the innovation. We leverage this decomposition to give a convergence proof of gradient descent to the optimal Kalman gain, specifically identifying how recovery of the Kalman gain depends on a non-standard observability condition, and obtaining an interpretable geometric convergence rate.</description>

      <title>Fail Fast, or Ask: Mitigating the Deficiencies of Reasoning LLMs with Human-in-the-Loop Systems Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14406v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art reasoning LLMs are powerful problem solvers, but they still occasionally make mistakes. However, adopting AI models in risk-sensitive domains often requires error rates near 0%. To address this gap, we propose collaboration between a reasoning model and a human expert who resolves queries the model cannot confidently answer. We find that quantifying the uncertainty of a reasoning model through the length of its reasoning trace yields an effective basis for deferral to a human, e.g., cutting the error rate of Qwen3 235B-A22B on difficult MATH problems from 3% to less than 1% when deferring 7.5% of queries. However, the high latency of reasoning models still makes them challenging to deploy on use cases with high query volume. To address this challenge, we explore fronting a reasoning model with a large non-reasoning model. We call this modified human-in-the-loop system "Fail Fast, or Ask", since the non-reasoning model may defer difficult queries to the human expert directly ("failing fast"), without incurring the reasoning model's higher latency. We show that this approach yields around 40% latency reduction and about 50% cost savings for DeepSeek R1 while maintaining 90+% area under the accuracy-rejection curve. However, we observe that latency savings are lower than expected because of "latency drag", the phenomenon that processing easier queries with a non-reasoning model pushes the reasoning model's latency distribution towards longer latencies. Broadly, our results suggest that the deficiencies of state-of-the-art reasoning models -- nontrivial error rates and high latency -- can be substantially mitigated through black-box systems engineering, without requiring access to LLM internals.</description>

      <title>UAV-Enabled Wireless-Powered Underground Communication Networks: A Novel Time Allocation Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless-powered underground communication networks (WPUCNs), which allow underground devices (UDs) to harvest energy from wireless signals for battery-free communication, offer a promising solution for sustainable underground monitoring. However, the severe wireless signal attenuation in challenging underground environments and the costly acquisition of channel state information (CSI) make large-scale WPUCNs economically infeasible in practice. To address this challenge, we introduce flexible unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into WPUCNs, leading to UAV-enabled WPUCN systems. In this system, a UAV is first charged by a terrestrial hybrid access point (HAP), then flies to the monitoring area to wirelessly charge UDs. Afterwards, the UAV collects data from the UDs and finally returns to the HAP for data offloading. Based on the proposed UAV-enabled WPUCN system, we first propose its energy consumption model and a hybrid wireless energy transfer (WET) approach (i.e., UDs can harvest energy from both the HAP and the UAV) relying on full-CSI and CSI-free multi-antenna beamforming. Then, we formulate and address a time allocation problem to minimize the energy consumption of UAV, while ensuring that the throughput requirements of all UDs are met and all sensor data is offloaded. Through simulations of a realistic farming scenario, we demonstrate that the proposed hybrid WET approach outperforms other WET approaches, with performance gains influenced by the number of antennas, communication distance, number of UDs, and underground conditions. Additionally, under the optimized time allocation, we found that the proposed hybrid WET approach based on a CSI-free multi-antenna scheme achieves the lowest UAV's energy consumption among all WET mechanisms, thereby enabling sustainable underground monitoring in WPUCNs.</description>

Abstract: Safe navigation in unknown and cluttered environments remains a challenging problem in robotics. Model Predictive Contour Control (MPCC) has shown promise for performant obstacle avoidance by enabling precise and agile trajectory tracking, however, existing methods lack formal safety assurances. To address this issue, we propose a general Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) and Control Barrier Function (CBF) enabled MPCC framework that enforces safety constraints derived from a free-space corridor around the planned trajectory. To enhance feasibility, we dynamically adapt the CBF parameters at runtime using a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) policy. The approach is validated with extensive simulations and an experiment on mobile robot navigation in unknown cluttered environments.</description>

      <title>Preventing an Extractive Green Hydrogen Industry: Risks and Benefits of Grid Expansion and Green Hydrogen in and for Kenya</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study evaluates the role of grid-connected hydrogen electrolyzers in advancing a cost-effective and in particular an equitable green hydrogen industry in Kenya to serve both domestic and international needs and markets. Using a multi-nodal capacity expansion model with county-level spatial resolution, we assess how electrolyzer deployment affects electricity cost, grid flexibility, and carbon intensity under various renewable and demand scenarios. Results show that electrolyzers enable up to 30 percent reduction in levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) and US\$460 million in cumulative system cost savings by 2050 compared to a business-as-usual scenario. As a flexible demand available to absorb surplus generation, electrolyzers reduce curtailment and support large-scale wind integration while still requiring a diverse mix of renewable electricity. The resulting hydrogen reaches a levelized cost of \$3.2 per kg by 2050, and its carbon intensity from electricity use falls below one kg carbon dioxide per kg of hydrogen, suggesting likely compliance with international certification thresholds. Benefits persist across all demand trajectories, though their scale depends on the pace of wind expansion. Spatial analyses reveal unequal distribution of infrastructure gains, underscoring the need for equity-oriented planning. These findings suggest that grid-integrated hydrogen, if planned in coordination with wind investment, transmission, and equitable infrastructure deployment, can reduce costs, support certification, and promote a more equitable model of hydrogen development. In other words, connecting electrolyzers to the grid will not only make green hydrogen in Kenya but also for Kenya.</description>

      <title>Holistic Specification of the Human Digital Twin: Stakeholders, Users, Functionalities, and Applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The digital twin of humans is a relatively new concept. While many diverse definitions, architectures, and applications exist, a clear picture is missing on what, in fact, makes a human digital twin. Within this context, researchers and industrial use-case owners alike are unaware about the market potential of the - at the moment - rather theoretical construct. In this work, we draw a holistic vision of the human digital twin, and derive the specification of this holistic human digital twin in form of requirements, stakeholders, and users. For each group of users, we define exemplary applications that fall into the six levels of functionality: store, analyze, personalize, predict, control, and optimize. The functionality levels facilitate an abstraction of abilities of the human digital twin. From the manifold applications, we discuss three in detail to showcase the feasibility of the abstraction levels and the analysis of stakeholders and users. Based on the deep discussion, we derive a comprehensive list of requirements on the holistic human digital twin. These considerations shall be used as a guideline for research and industries for the implementation of human digital twins, particularly in context of reusability in multiple target applications.</description>

      <title>Clustered Federated Learning for Generalizable FDIA Detection in Smart Grids with Heterogeneous Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14999v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs) pose severe security risks to smart grids by manipulating measurement data collected from spatially distributed devices such as SCADA systems and PMUs. These measurements typically exhibit Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (Non-IID) characteristics across different regions, which significantly challenges the generalization ability of detection models. Traditional centralized training approaches not only face privacy risks and data sharing constraints but also incur high transmission costs, limiting their scalability and deployment feasibility. To address these issues, this paper proposes a privacy-preserving federated learning framework, termed Federated Cluster Average (FedClusAvg), designed to improve FDIA detection in Non-IID and resource-constrained environments. FedClusAvg incorporates cluster-based stratified sampling and hierarchical communication (client-subserver-server) to enhance model generalization and reduce communication overhead. By enabling localized training and weighted parameter aggregation, the algorithm achieves accurate model convergence without centralizing sensitive data. Experimental results on benchmark smart grid datasets demonstrate that FedClusAvg not only improves detection accuracy under heterogeneous data distributions but also significantly reduces communication rounds and bandwidth consumption. This work provides an effective solution for secure and efficient FDIA detection in large-scale distributed power systems.</description>

      <title>CPED-NCBFs: A Conformal Prediction for Expert Demonstration-based Neural Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Among the promising approaches to enforce safety in control systems, learning Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) from expert demonstrations has emerged as an effective strategy. However, a critical challenge remains: verifying that the learned CBFs truly enforce safety across the entire state space. This is especially difficult when CBF is represented using neural networks (NCBFs). Several existing verification techniques attempt to address this problem including SMT-based solvers, mixed-integer programming (MIP), and interval or bound-propagation methods but these approaches often introduce loose, conservative bounds. To overcome these limitations, in this work we use CPED-NCBFs a split-conformal prediction based verification strategy to verify the learned NCBF from the expert demonstrations. We further validate our method on point mass systems and unicycle models to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed theory.</description>

      <title>Sequential feedback optimization with application to wind farm control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a sequential-linearization feedback optimization framework for driving nonlinear dynamical systems to an
  optimal steady state. A fundamental challenge in feedback optimization is the requirement of accurate first-order information
  of the steady-state input-output mapping, which is computationally prohibitive for high-dimensional nonlinear systems and
  often leads to poor performance when approximated around a fixed operating point. To address this limitation, we propose a
  sequential algorithm that adaptively updates the linearization point during optimization, maintaining local accuracy throughout
  the trajectory. We prove convergence to a neighborhood of the optimal steady state with explicit error bounds. To reduce the
  computational burden of repeated linearization operations, we further develop a multi-timescale variant where linearization
  updates occur at a slower timescale than optimization iterations, achieving significant computational savings while preserving
  convergence guarantees. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated via numerical simulations of a realistic
  wind farm control problem. The results validate both the theoretical convergence predictions and the expected computational
  advantages of our multi-timescale formulation.</description>

      <title>VLM-UDMC: VLM-Enhanced Unified Decision-Making and Motion Control for Urban Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scene understanding and risk-aware attentions are crucial for human drivers to make safe and effective driving decisions. To imitate this cognitive ability in urban autonomous driving while ensuring the transparency and interpretability, we propose a vision-language model (VLM)-enhanced unified decision-making and motion control framework, named VLM-UDMC. This framework incorporates scene reasoning and risk-aware insights into an upper-level slow system, which dynamically reconfigures the optimal motion planning for the downstream fast system. The reconfiguration is based on real-time environmental changes, which are encoded through context-aware potential functions. More specifically, the upper-level slow system employs a two-step reasoning policy with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), leveraging foundation models to process multimodal inputs and retrieve contextual knowledge, thereby generating risk-aware insights. Meanwhile, a lightweight multi-kernel decomposed LSTM provides real-time trajectory predictions for heterogeneous traffic participants by extracting smoother trend representations for short-horizon trajectory prediction. The effectiveness of the proposed VLM-UDMC framework is verified via both simulations and real-world experiments with a full-size autonomous vehicle. It is demonstrated that the presented VLM-UDMC effectively leverages scene understanding and attention decomposition for rational driving decisions, thus improving the overall urban driving performance. Our open-source project is available at https://github.com/henryhcliu/vlmudmc.git.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered Resilient Consensus of Networked Euler-Lagrange Systems Under Byzantine Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The resilient consensus problem is investigated in this paper for a class of networked Euler-Lagrange systems with event-triggered communication in the presence of Byzantine attacks. One challenge that we face in addressing the considered problem is the inapplicability of existing resilient decision algorithms designed for one-dimensional multi-agent systems. This is because the networked Euler-Lagrange systems fall into the category of multi-dimensional multi-agent systems with coupling among state vector components. To address this problem, we propose a new resilient decision algorithm. This algorithm constructs auxiliary variables related to the coordinative objectives for each normal agent, and transforms the considered resilient consensus problem into the consensus problem of the designed auxiliary variables. Furthermore, to relax the constraints imposed on Byzantine agent behavior patterns within continuous-time scenarios, the event-triggered communication scheme is adopted. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated through case studies.</description>

      <title>Constrained Control Allocation With Continuous-Time Rate Constraints: Three-Dimensional Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15489v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel quadratic programming (QP) approach for constrained control allocation that directly incorporates continuous-time actuator rate constraints without requiring slack variables. Over-actuated aircraft configurations, particularly prevalent in eVTOL and military applications, require control allocation algorithms to distribute commanded control moments among available actuators while respecting position and rate constraints. Existing methods such as direct allocation, pseudo-inverse, cascaded generalized inverse, and exact redistributed pseudo-inverse either cannot handle rate constraints in continuous time or require discretization approaches that compromise performance. Current QP methods that incorporate rate constraints rely on slack variables to ensure feasibility, which prevents full utilization of the attainable moment set and degrades allocation performance. The proposed methodology addresses this limitation by calculating the attainable moment set from both position and rate constraints through convex hull operations, then ensuring feasibility by scaling unattainable commanded moments to the boundary of the attainable moment set while preserving their direction. This approach guarantees the feasibility of the optimization problem without slack variables. The method is validated through simulation on an F-18 fighter aircraft control allocation problem, demonstrating equivalent performance to the established exact redistributed pseudo-inverse method while providing smoother actuator behavior and enhanced constraint satisfaction. Results show that incorporating continuous-time rate constraints leads to improved actuator tracking, reduced overshoot, and more precise adherence to position limits, which is essential for aircraft safety, ride comfort, and actuator longevity.</description>

      <title>Optimal Batch-Size Control for Low-Latency Federated Learning with Device Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a popular approach for collaborative machine learning in sixth-generation (6G) networks, primarily due to its privacy-preserving capabilities. The deployment of FL algorithms is expected to empower a wide range of Internet-of-Things (IoT) applications, e.g., autonomous driving, augmented reality, and healthcare. The mission-critical and time-sensitive nature of these applications necessitates the design of low-latency FL frameworks that guarantee high learning performance. In practice, achieving low-latency FL faces two challenges: the overhead of computing and transmitting high-dimensional model updates, and the heterogeneity in communication-and-computation (C$^2$) capabilities across devices. To address these challenges, we propose a novel C$^2$-aware framework for optimal batch-size control that minimizes end-to-end (E2E) learning latency while ensuring convergence. The framework is designed to balance a fundamental C$^2$ tradeoff as revealed through convergence analysis. Specifically, increasing batch sizes improves the accuracy of gradient estimation in FL and thus reduces the number of communication rounds required for convergence, but results in higher per-round latency, and vice versa. The associated problem of latency minimization is intractable; however, we solve it by designing an accurate and tractable surrogate for convergence speed, with parameters fitted to real data. This approach yields two batch-size control strategies tailored to scenarios with slow and fast fading, while also accommodating device heterogeneity. Extensive experiments using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed strategies outperform conventional batch-size adaptation schemes that do not consider the C$^2$ tradeoff or device heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>Maximum Causal Entropy IRL in Mean-Field Games and GNEP Framework for Forward RL</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the use of Maximum Causal Entropy Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) within the context of discrete-time stationary Mean-Field Games (MFGs) characterized by finite state spaces and an infinite-horizon, discounted-reward setting. Although the resulting optimization problem is non-convex with respect to policies, we reformulate it as a convex optimization problem in terms of state-action occupation measures by leveraging the linear programming framework of Markov Decision Processes. Based on this convex reformulation, we introduce a gradient descent algorithm with a guaranteed convergence rate to efficiently compute the optimal solution. Moreover, we develop a new method that conceptualizes the MFG problem as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP), enabling effective computation of the mean-field equilibrium for forward reinforcement learning (RL) problems and marking an advancement in MFG solution techniques. We further illustrate the practical applicability of our GNEP approach by employing this algorithm to generate data for numerical MFG examples.</description>

Abstract: Conventional vehicle dynamics estimation methods suffer from the drawback of employing independent, separately calibrated filtering modules for each variable. To address this limitation, a recent proposal introduces a unified Twin-in-the-Loop (TiL) Observer architecture. This architecture replaces the simplified control-oriented vehicle model with a full-fledged vehicle simulator (digital twin), and employs a real-time correction mechanism using a linear time-invariant output error law. Bayesian Optimization is utilized to tune the observer due to the simulator's black-box nature, leading to a high-dimensional optimization problem. This paper focuses on developing a procedure to reduce the observer's complexity by exploring both supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. The effectiveness of these strategies is validated for longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics using real-world data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider dynamic games with linear dynamics and quadratic objective functions. We observe that the unconstrained open-loop Nash equilibrium coincides with a linear quadratic regulator in an augmented space, thus deriving an explicit expression of the cost-to-go. With such cost-to-go as a terminal cost, we show asymptotic stability for the receding-horizon solution of the finite-horizon, constrained game. Furthermore, we show that the problem is equivalent to a non-symmetric variational inequality, which does not correspond to any Nash equilibrium problem. For unconstrained closed-loop Nash equilibria, we derive a receding-horizon controller that is equivalent to the infinite-horizon one and ensures asymptotic stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00002v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several data compressors have been proposed in distributed optimization frameworks of network systems to reduce communication overhead in large-scale applications. In this paper, we demonstrate that effective information compression may occur over time or space during sequences of node communications in distributed algorithms, leading to the concept of spatio-temporal compressors. This abstraction classifies existing compressors and inspires new compressors as spatio-temporal compressors, with their effectiveness described by constructive stability criteria from nonlinear system theory. Subsequently, we incorporate these spatio-temporal compressors directly into standard continuous-time consensus flows and distributed primal-dual flows, establishing conditions ensuring exponential convergence. Additionally, we introduce a novel observer-based distributed primal-dual continuous flow integrated with spatio-temporal compressors, which provides broader convergence conditions. These continuous flows achieve exponential convergence to the global optimum when the objective function is strongly convex and can be discretized using Euler approximations. Finally, numerical simulations illustrate the versatility of the proposed spatio-temporal compressors and verify the convergence of</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06771v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method that allows efficient and safe approximation of model predictive controllers using kernel interpolation. Since the computational complexity of the approximating function scales linearly with the number of data points, we propose to use a scoring function which chooses the most promising data. To further reduce the complexity of the approximation, we restrict our considerations to the set of closed-loop reachable states. That is, the approximating function only has to be accurate within this set. This makes our method especially suited for systems, where the set of initial conditions is small. In order to guarantee safety and high performance of the designed approximated controller, we use reachability analysis based on Monte Carlo methods.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Optimistic Bias in the Natural Inflow Forecasts: A Call for Model Monitoring in Brazil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hydroelectricity accounted for roughly 61.4% of Brazil's total generation in 2024 and addressed most of the intermittency of wind and solar generation. Thus, inflow forecasting plays a critical role in the operation, planning, and market in this country, as well as in any other hydro-dependent power system. These forecasts influence generation schedules, reservoir management, and market pricing, shaping the dynamics of the entire electricity sector. The objective of this paper is to measure and present empirical evidence of a systematic optimistic bias in the official inflow forecast methodology, which is based on the PAR(p)-A model. Additionally, we discuss possible sources of this bias and recommend ways to mitigate it. By analyzing 14 years of historical data from the Brazilian system through rolling-window multistep (out-of-sample) forecasts, results indicate that the official forecast model exhibits statistically significant biases of 1.28, 3.83, 5.39, and 6.73 average GW for 1-, 6-, 12-, and 24-step-ahead forecasts in the Southeast subsystem, and 0.54, 1.66, 2.32, and 3.17 average GW in the Northeast subsystem. These findings uncover the limitations of current inflow forecasting methodologies used in Brazil and call for new governance and monitoring policies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18669v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies trajectory optimization of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to track an unknown maneuvering target. Due to the restrictions on sensing capabilities in the underwater scenario, the AUV is limited to collecting only bearing measurements to the target. A framework called GBT is proposed with integration of online learning and planning. First, a Gaussian process learning method is proposed for the AUV to handle unknown target motion, wherein pseudo linear transformation of bearing measurements is introduced to address nonlinearity of bearings. A probabilistic bearing-data-dependent bound on tracking error is then rigorously established. Based on it, optimal desired bearings that can reduce tracking uncertainty are obtained analytically. Finally, the trajectory optimization problem is formulated and transformed into an easily solved one with parametric transformation. Numerical examples and comparison with existing methods verify the feasibility and superior performance of our proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Modelling and Control of Subsonic Missile for Air-to-Air Interception</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07594v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Subsonic missiles play an important role in modern air-to-air combat scenarios - utilized by the F-35 Lightning II - but require complex Guidance, Navigation and Control systems to manoeuvre with 30G's of acceleration to intercept successfully. Challenges with mathematically modelling and controlling such a dynamic system must be addressed, high frequency noise rejected, and actuator delay compensated for. This paper aims to investigate the control systems necessary for interception. It also proposes a subsonic design utilizing literature and prior research, suggests aerodynamic derivatives, and analyses a designed 2D reduced pitch autopilot control system response against performances. The pitch autopilot model contains an optimized PID controller, 2nd order actuator, lead compensator and Kalman Filter, that rejects time varying disturbances and high frequency noise expected during flight. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method through reduction in rise time (21%), settle time (10%), and highlighted its high frequency deficiency with respect to the compensator integration. The actuator delay of 100ms has been negated by the augmented compensator autopilot controller so that it exceeds system performance requirements (1) &amp; (3). However, (2) is not satisfied as 370% overshoot exists. This research confirms the importance of a lead compensator in missile GNC systems and furthers control design application through a specific configuration. Future research should build upon methods and models presented to construct and test an interception scenario.</description>

      <title>Existence of $\epsilon$-Nash Equilibria in Nonzero-Sum and Zero-Sum Markov Games with Standard Borel Spaces via Finite Model Approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10805v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Establishing the existence of exact or near Markov or stationary perfect Nash equilibria in nonzero-sum Markov games over Borel spaces is a challenging problem with limited positive results. Motivated by problems in multi-agent and Bayesian learning, this paper demonstrates the existence of approximate Markov and stationary Nash equilibria for such games under mild regularity conditions. Our approach is constructive: For both compact and non-compact state spaces, we approximate the Borel model with finite state-action models and show that their equilibria correspond to \(\epsilon\)-equilibria for the original game. Compared with previous results in the literature, which we comprehensively review, we provide more general and complementary conditions, along with explicit approximation models whose equilibria are $\epsilon$-equilibria for the original model. For completeness, we also study the approximation of zero-sum Markov games and Markov teams to highlight the key differences between zero-sum and nonzero-sum settings. In particular, while for zero-sum and team games, joint weak (Feller) continuity of the transition kernel is sufficient (as the value function is continuous), this is not the case for general nonzero-sum games.</description>

      <title>Learning Robust Safety Controllers for Uncertain Input-Affine Polynomial Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper offers a direct data-driven approach for learning robust control barrier certificates (R-CBCs) and robust safety controllers (R-SCs) for discrete-time input-affine polynomial systems with unknown dynamics under unknown-but-bounded disturbances. The proposed method relies on data from input-state observations collected over a finite-time horizon while satisfying a specific rank condition to ensure the system is persistently excited. Our data-driven scheme enables the synthesis of R-CBCs and R-SCs directly from observed data, bypassing the need for explicit modeling of the system's dynamics and thus ensuring robust system safety against disturbances within an infinite time horizon. Our proposed approach is formulated as a sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization problem, providing a structured design framework. Two case studies showcase our method's capability to provide robust safety guarantees for unknown input-affine polynomial systems under bounded disturbances, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>A Cyber Insurance Policy for Hedging Against Load-Altering Attacks and Extreme Load Variations in Distribution Grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainties in renewable energy resources (RES) and load variations can lead to elevated system operational costs. Moreover, the emergence of large-scale distributed threats, such as load-altering attacks (LAAs), can induce substantial load variations, further exacerbating these costs. Although traditional defense measures can reduce the likelihood of such attacks, considerable residual risks remain. Thus, this paper proposes a cyber insurance framework designed to hedge against additional operational costs resulting from LAAs and substantial load variations in renewable-rich grids. The insurance framework determines both the insurance coverage and premium based on the Value at Risk (VaR) and Tail Value at Risk (TVaR). These risk metrics are calculated using the system failure probability and the probability density function (PDF) of the system operation cost. The system failure probability is assessed through a semi-Markov process (SMP), while the cost distribution is estimated through a cost minimization model of a distribution grid combined with a Monte-Carlo simulation to capture load variability. Furthermore, we employ a bi-level optimization scheme that identifies the specific load distribution leading to the maximum system cost, thereby enhancing the accuracy of the operation cost PDF estimation. The effectiveness and scalability of the proposed cyber insurance policy are evaluated considering a modified IEEE-118 test bus system and the IEEE European low-voltage (LV) test feeders model. The case study shows that with a relatively low premium, the network operator can hedge against additional operational costs caused by malicious load manipulations.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Polynomial Zonotopes: A Set Representation for Reachability Analysis in Hybrid Nonaffine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13567v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reachability analysis for hybrid nonaffine systems remains computationally challenging, as existing set representations--including constrained, polynomial, and hybrid zonotopes--either lose tightness under high-order nonaffine maps or suffer exponential blow-up after discrete jumps. This paper introduces Hybrid Polynomial Zonotope (HPZ), a novel set representation that combines the mode-dependent generator structure of hybrid zonotopes with the algebraic expressiveness of polynomial zonotopes. HPZs compactly encode non-convex reachable states across modes by attaching polynomial exponents to each hybrid generator, enabling precise capture of high-order state-input couplings without vertex enumeration. We develop a comprehensive library of HPZ operations, including Minkowski sum, linear transformation, and intersection. Theoretical analysis and computational experiments demonstrate that HPZs achieve superior tightness preservation and computational efficiency compared to existing approaches for hybrid system reachability analysis.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Robustness in the Gap Metric</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.10010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uncertainties influencing the dynamical systems pose a significant challenge in estimating the achievable performance of a controller aiming to control such uncertain systems. When the uncertainties are of stochastic nature, obtaining hard guarantees for the robustness of a controller aiming to hedge against the uncertainty is not possible. This issue set the platform for the development of probabilistic robust control approaches. In this work, we utilise the gap metric between the known nominal model and the unknown perturbed model of the uncertain system as a tool to gauge the robustness of a controller and formulate the gap as a random variable in the setting with stochastic uncertainties. The main results of this paper include giving a probabilistic bound on the gap exceeding a known threshold, followed by bounds on the expected gap value and probabilistic robust stability and performance guarantees in terms of the gap metric. We also provide a probabilistic controller performance certification under gap uncertainty and probabilistic guarantee on the achievable $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ robustness. Numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Recursive and non-recursive filters for sequential smoothing and prediction with instantaneous phase and frequency estimation applications (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07089v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A simple procedure for the design of recursive digital filters with an infinite impulse response (IIR) and non-recursive digital filters with a finite impulse response (FIR) is described. The fixed-lag smoothing filters are designed to track an approximately polynomial signal of specified degree without bias at steady state, while minimizing the gain of high-frequency (coloured) noise with a specified power spectral density. For the IIR variant, the procedure determines the optimal lag (i.e. the passband group delay) yielding a recursive low-complexity smoother of low order, with a specified bandwidth, and excellent passband phase linearity. The filters are applied to the problem of instantaneous frequency estimation, e.g. for Doppler-shift measurement, for a complex exponential with polynomial phase progression in additive white noise. For this classical problem, simulations show that the incorporation of a prediction filter (with a one-sample lead) reduces the incidence of (phase or frequency) angle unwrapping errors, particularly for signals with high rates of angle change, which are known to limit the performance of standard FIR estimators at low SNR. This improvement allows the instantaneous phase of low-frequency signals to be estimated, e.g. for time-delay measurement, and/or the instantaneous frequency of frequency-modulated signals, down to a lower SNR. In the absence of unwrapping errors, the error variance of the IIR estimators (with the optimal phase lag) reaches the FIR lower bound, at a significantly lower computational cost. Guidelines for configuring and tuning both FIR and IIR filters are provided.</description>

      <title>LSTP-Nav: Lightweight Spatiotemporal Policy for Map-free Multi-agent Navigation with LiDAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16370v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Safe and efficient multi-agent navigation in dynamic environments remains inherently challenging, particularly when real-time decision-making is required on resource-constrained platforms. Ensuring collision-free trajectories while adapting to uncertainties without relying on pre-built maps further complicates real-world deployment. To address these challenges, we propose LSTP-Nav, a lightweight end-to-end policy for multi-agent navigation that enables map-free collision avoidance in complex environments by directly mapping raw LiDAR point clouds to motion commands. At the core of this framework lies LSTP-Net, an efficient network that processes raw LiDAR data using a GRU architecture, enhanced with attention mechanisms to dynamically focus on critical environmental features while minimizing computational overhead. Additionally, a novel HS reward optimizes collision avoidance by incorporating angular velocity, prioritizing obstacles along the predicted heading, and enhancing training stability. To narrow the sim-to-real gap, we develop PhysReplay-Simlab, a physics-realistic multi-agent simulator, employs localized replay to mine near-failure experiences. Relying solely on LiDA, LSTP-Nav achieves efficient zero-shot sim-to-real transfer on a CPU-only robotic platform, enabling robust navigation in dynamic environments while maintaining computation frequencies above 40 Hz. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LSTP-Nav outperforms baselines with a 9.58% higher success rate and a 12.30% lower collision rate, underscoring its practicality and robustness for real-world applications.</description>

      <title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10283v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</description>

      <title>Constrained Optimal Fuel Consumption of HEVs under Observational Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our prior work, we investigated the minimum fuel consumption of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) under a state-of-charge (SOC) balance constraint, assuming perfect SOC measurements and accurate reference speed profiles. The constrained optimal fuel consumption (COFC) problem was addressed using a constrained reinforcement learning (CRL) framework. However, in real-world scenarios, SOC readings are often corrupted by sensor noise, and reference speeds may deviate from actual driving conditions. To account for these imperfections, this study reformulates the COFC problem by explicitly incorporating observational noise in both SOC and reference speed. We adopt a robust CRL approach, where the noise is modeled as a uniform distribution, and employ a structured training procedure to ensure stability. The proposed method is evaluated through simulations on the Toyota Prius hybrid system (THS), using both the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) and the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Results show that fuel consumption and SOC constraint satisfaction remain robust across varying noise levels. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that observational noise in SOC and speed can impact fuel consumption to different extents. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to explicitly examine how observational noise -- commonly encountered in dynamometer testing and predictive energy control (PEC) applications -- affects constrained optimal fuel consumption in HEVs.</description>

      <title>Modeling nonuniform energy decay through the modal decomposition of acoustic radiance transfer (MoD-ART)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04534v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modeling late reverberation in real-time interactive applications is a challenging task when multiple sound sources and listeners are present in the same environment. This is especially problematic when the environment is geometrically complex and/or features uneven energy absorption (e.g. coupled volumes), because in such cases the late reverberation is dependent on the sound sources' and listeners' positions, and therefore must be adapted to their movements in real time. We present a novel approach to the task, named modal decomposition of acoustic radiance transfer (MoD-ART), which can handle highly complex scenarios with efficiency. The approach is based on the geometrical acoustics method of acoustic radiance transfer, from which we extract a set of energy decay modes and their positional relationships with sources and listeners. In this paper, we describe the physical and mathematical significance of MoD-ART, highlighting its advantages and applicability to different scenarios. Through an analysis of the method's computational complexity, we show that it compares very favorably with ray-tracing. We also present simulation results showing that MoD-ART can capture multiple decay slopes and flutter echoes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: System identification is normally involved in augmenting time series data by time shifting and nonlinearisation (e.g., polynomial basis), both of which introduce redundancy in features and samples. Many research works focus on reducing redundancy feature-wise, while less attention is paid to sample-wise redundancy. This paper proposes a novel data pruning method, called mini-batch FastCan, to reduce sample-wise redundancy based on dictionary learning. Time series data is represented by some representative samples, called atoms, via dictionary learning. The useful samples are selected based on their correlation with the atoms. The method is tested on one simulated dataset and two benchmark datasets. The R-squared between the coefficients of models trained on the full datasets and the coefficients of models trained on pruned datasets is adopted to evaluate the performance of data pruning methods. It is found that the proposed method significantly outperforms the random pruning method.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetically Reconfigurable Fluid Antenna System for Wireless Communications: Design, Modeling, Algorithm, Fabrication, and Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the concept, design, channel modeling, beamforming algorithm development, prototype fabrication, and experimental measurement of an electromagnetically reconfigurable fluid antenna system (ER-FAS), in which each FAS array element features electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability. Unlike most existing FAS works that investigate spatial reconfigurability by adjusting the position and/or orientation of array elements, the proposed ER-FAS enables direct control over the EM characteristics of each element, allowing for dynamic radiation pattern reconfigurability. Specifically, a novel ER-FAS architecture leveraging software-controlled fluidics is proposed, and corresponding wireless channel models are established. Based on this ER-FAS channel model, a low-complexity greedy beamforming algorithm is developed to jointly optimize the analog phase shift and the radiation state of each array element. The accuracy of the ER-FAS channel model and the effectiveness of the beamforming algorithm are validated through (i) full-wave EM simulations and (ii) numerical spectral efficiency evaluations. These results confirm that the proposed ER-FAS significantly enhances spectral efficiency in both near-field and far-field scenarios compared to conventional antenna arrays. To further validate this design, we fabricate prototypes for both the ER-FAS element and array, using Galinstan liquid metal alloy, fluid silver paste, and software-controlled fluidic channels. The simulation results are experimentally validated through prototype measurements conducted in an anechoic chamber. Additionally, several indoor communication experiments using a pair of software-defined radios demonstrate the superior received power and bit error rate performance of the ER-FAS prototype.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we introduce a novel Decision Flow (DF) framework for sampling decisions from a target distribution while incorporating additional guidance from a prior sampler. DF can be viewed as an AI-driven algorithmic reincarnation of the Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach in stochastic optimal control. It extends the continuous-space, continuous-time Path Integral Diffusion sampling technique of [Behjoo, Chertkov 2025] to discrete time and space, while also generalizing the Generative Flow Network (GFN) framework of [Bengio, et al 2021]. In its most basic form an explicit formulation that does not require Neural Networks (NNs), DF leverages the linear solvability of the underlying MDP [Todorov, 2007] to adjust the transition probabilities of the prior sampler. The resulting Markov process is expressed as a convolution of the reverse-time Green's function of the prior sampling with the target distribution. We illustrate the DF framework through an example of sampling from the Ising model -- compare DF to Metropolis-Hastings to quantify its efficiency, discuss potential NN-based extensions, and outline how DF can enhance guided sampling across various applications.</description>

      <title>Feedback Optimization with State Constraints through Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of research on a class of methods called feedback optimization. These are methods to steer the state of a control system to an equilibrium that arises as the solution of an optimization problem. Despite the growing literature on the topic, the important problem of enforcing state constraints at all times remains unaddressed. In this work, we present the first feedback-optimization method that enforces state constraints. The method combines a class of dynamics called safe gradient flows with high-order control barrier functions. We provide a number of results on our proposed controller, including well-posedness guarantees, anytime constraint-satisfaction guarantees, equivalence between the closed-loop's equilibria and the optimization problem's critical points, and local asymptotic stability of optima.</description>

      <title>How to Adapt Control Barrier Functions? A Learning-Based Approach with Applications to a VTOL Quadplane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel theoretical framework for online adaptation of Control Barrier Function (CBF) parameters, i.e., of the class K functions included in the CBF condition, under input constraints. We introduce the concept of locally validated CBF parameters, which are adapted online to guarantee finite-horizon safety, based on conditions derived from Nagumo's theorem and tangent cone analysis. To identify these parameters online, we integrate a learning-based approach with an uncertainty-aware verification process that account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties inherent in neural network predictions. Our method is demonstrated on a VTOL quadplane model during challenging transition and landing maneuvers, showcasing enhanced performance while maintaining safety.</description>

      <title>Joint Travel Route Optimization Framework for Platooning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Platooning represents an advanced driving technology designed to assist drivers in traffic convoys of varying lengths, enhancing road safety, reducing driver fatigue, and improving fuel efficiency. Sophisticated automated driving assistance systems have facilitated this innovation. Recent advancements in platooning emphasize cooperative mechanisms within both centralized and decentralized architectures enabled by vehicular communication technologies. This study introduces a cooperative route planning optimization framework aimed at promoting the adoption of platooning through a centralized platoon formation strategy at the system level. This approach is envisioned as a transitional phase from individual (ego) driving to fully collaborative driving. Additionally, this research formulates and incorporates travel cost metrics related to fuel consumption, driver fatigue, and travel time, considering regulatory constraints on consecutive driving durations. The performance of these cost metrics has been evaluated using Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms within a network graph framework. The results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves an average cost improvement of 14 % compared to individual route planning for long road trips.</description>

      <title>Platoon Coordination and Leader Selection in Mixed Transportation Systems via Dynamic Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the growing penetration of electric trucks, freight transportation is transitioning toward a mixed system comprising both fuel-powered and electric trucks. Enhancing truck platoon formation in such a heterogeneous environment presents new challenges. This paper investigates the hub-based platoon coordination problem in a mixed truck fleet, where the focus is to optimize the trucks' waiting times, charging amounts for electric trucks, and platoon leader assignments. The objective is to maximize the overall platoon revenue of the fleet while accounting for the associated waiting and charging costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and present a dynamic programming approach to compute its sub-optimal solution efficiently. The proposed method operates in polynomial time, ensuring scalable computational efficiency. Simulation studies involving 1,000 trucks traveling between two hubs in Sweden demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Fast Bilateral Teleoperation and Imitation Learning Using Sensorless Force Control via Accurate Dynamics Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06174v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In recent years, the advancement of imitation learning has led to increased interest in teleoperating low-cost manipulators to collect demonstration data. However, most existing systems rely on unilateral control, which only transmits target position values. While this approach is easy to implement and suitable for slow, non-contact tasks, it struggles with fast or contact-rich operations due to the absence of force feedback. This work demonstrates that fast teleoperation with force feedback is feasible even with force-sensorless, low-cost manipulators by leveraging 4-channel bilateral control. Based on accurately identified manipulator dynamics, our method integrates nonlinear terms compensation, velocity and external force estimation, and variable gain corresponding to inertial variation. Furthermore, using data collected by 4-channel bilateral control, we show that incorporating force information into both the input and output of learned policies improves performance in imitation learning. These results highlight the practical effectiveness of our system for high-fidelity teleoperation and data collection on affordable hardware.</description>

      <title>Active Probing with Multimodal Predictions for Motion Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Navigation in dynamic environments requires autonomous systems to reason about uncertainties in the behavior of other agents. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework that combines trajectory planning with multimodal predictions and active probing to enhance decision-making under uncertainty. We develop a novel risk metric that seamlessly integrates multimodal prediction uncertainties through mixture models. When these uncertainties follow a Gaussian mixture distribution, we prove that our risk metric admits a closed-form solution, and is always finite, thus ensuring analytical tractability. To reduce prediction ambiguity, we incorporate an active probing mechanism that strategically selects actions to improve its estimates of behavioral parameters of other agents, while simultaneously handling multimodal uncertainties. We extensively evaluate our framework in autonomous navigation scenarios using the MetaDrive simulation environment. Results demonstrate that our active probing approach successfully navigates complex traffic scenarios with uncertain predictions. Additionally, our framework shows robust performance across diverse traffic agent behavior models, indicating its broad applicability to real-world autonomous navigation challenges.

      <title>Characterizing State Space Model (SSM) and SSM-Transformer Hybrid Language Model Performance with Long Context Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12442v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for machine intelligence capable of processing continuous, long-context inputs on local devices is growing rapidly. However, the quadratic complexity and memory requirements of traditional Transformer architectures make them inefficient and often unusable for these tasks. This has spurred a paradigm shift towards new architectures like State Space Models (SSMs) and hybrids, which promise near-linear scaling. While most current research focuses on the accuracy and theoretical throughput of these models, a systematic performance characterization on practical consumer hardware is critically needed to guide system-level optimization and unlock new applications.
  To address this gap, we present a comprehensive, comparative benchmarking of carefully selected Transformer, SSM, and hybrid models specifically for long-context inference on consumer and embedded GPUs. Our analysis reveals that SSMs are not only viable but superior for this domain, capable of processing sequences up to 220K tokens on a 24GB consumer GPU-approximately 4x longer than comparable Transformers. While Transformers may be up to 1.8x faster at short sequences, SSMs demonstrate a dramatic performance inversion, becoming up to 4x faster at very long contexts (~57K tokens). Our operator-level analysis reveals that custom, hardware-aware SSM kernels dominate the inference runtime, accounting for over 55% of latency on edge platforms, identifying them as a primary target for future hardware acceleration. We also provide detailed, device-specific characterization results to guide system co-design for the edge. To foster further research, we will open-source our characterization framework.</description>
