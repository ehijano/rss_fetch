      <title>Photo-ionization structures of Planetary Nebula IC 2003 with [WR] central star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present ionization structures of IC 2003, a planetary nebula with [WR] central star, using a 1-D dusty photo-ionization code: \textit{"CLOUDY 17.03"}. The photo-ionization model is constrained by archival UV emission line fluxes, medium-resolution optical spectroscopy, $IRAS$ $25 \mu m$ flux, absolute $H\beta$ flux, and the mean angular size of the nearly spherical optical nebula. To constrain the carbon abundance and the effect of photo-electric heating in the ionized gas, we used UV emission lines. We considered an amorphous carbon dust grain with MRN and KMH size distributions to address the importance of photo-electric heating in the ionized nebula. We show that KMH grain size distribution with quantum dust heating reproduces the observations quite well. We construct the ionization structures of different elements at their different ionization stages in the nebula. We derive the physical properties of the planetary nebula and its chemical composition, as well as the parameters of its central star. The estimated nebular dust-to-gas mass ratio is $2.37\times 10^{-3}$, and the enhanced photo-electric heating yielded by small dust grains is $9.4\%$ of the total heating. We considered the H-poor model atmosphere for the central star; the effective temperature of the central star is 177kK, the specific gravity log(g) is 6, and its luminosity ($L_*$) is 6425 $L_\odot$. The derived central star parameters plotted on stellar evolutionary tracks correspond to a central star mass of 0.636$M_\odot $ and to a progenitor mass of 3.26$M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>The impact of stellar metallicity on rotation and activity evolution in the Kepler field using gyro-kinematic ages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a push to understand how chemical composition affects the magnetic activity levels of main sequence low-mass stars. Results indicate that more metal-rich stars are more magnetically active for a given stellar mass and rotation period. This metallicity dependence has implications for how the rotation periods and activity levels of low-mass stars evolve over their lifetimes. Numerical modelling suggests that at late ages more metal-rich stars should be rotating more slowly and be more magnetically active. In this work, we study the rotation and activity evolution of low-mass stars using a sample of Kepler field stars. We use the gyro-kinematic age dating technique to estimate ages for our sample and use the photometric activity index as our proxy for magnetic activity. We find clear evidence that, at late ages, more metal-rich stars have spun down to slower rotation in agreement with the theoretical modeling. However, further investigation is required to definitively determine whether the magnetic activity evolution occurs in a metallicity dependent way.</description>

      <title>No longer impossible: the self-lensing binary KIC 8145411 is a triple</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Five self-lensing binaries (SLBs) have been discovered with data from the \textit{Kepler} mission. One of these systems is KIC 8145411, which was reported to host an extremely low mass (ELM; $0.2\,M_{\odot}$) white dwarf (WD) in a 456-day orbit with a solar-type companion. The system has been dubbed ``impossible'', because evolutionary models predict that $\sim 0.2\,M_{\odot}$ WDs should only be found in tight orbits ($P_{\rm orb} \lesssim$ days). In this work, we show that KIC 8145411 is in fact a hierarchical triple system: it contains a WD orbiting a solar-type star, with another solar-type star $\sim 700\,$AU away. The wide companion was unresolved in the Kepler light curves, was just barely resolved in Gaia DR3, and is resolved beyond any doubt by high-resolution imaging. We show that the presence of this tertiary confounded previous mass measurements of the WD for two reason: it dilutes the amplitude of the self-lensing pulses, and it reduces the apparent radial velocity (RV) variability amplitude of the WD's companion due to line blending. By jointly fitting the system's light curves, RVs, and multi-band photometry using a model with two luminous stars, we obtain a revised WD mass of $(0.53 \pm 0.01)\,M_{\odot}$. Both luminous stars are near the end of their main-sequence evolution. The WD is thus not an ELM WD, and the system does not suffer the previously proposed challenges to its formation history. Similar to the other SLBs and the population of astrometric WD binaries recently identified from Gaia data, KIC 8145411 has parameters in tension with standard expectations for formation through both stable and unstable mass transfer. The system's properties are likely best understood as a result of unstable mass transfer from an AGB star donor.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Flare Activity in GKM Stars Younger than 300 Myr over Five Years of TESS Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar flares are short-duration ($&lt;$ hours) bursts of radiation associated with surface magnetic reconnection events. Stellar magnetic activity generally decreases as a function of both age and Rossby number, $R_0$, a measure of the relative importance of the convective and rotational dynamos. Young stars ($&lt;300$ Myr) have typically been overlooked in population-level flare studies due to challenges with flare-detection methods. Here, we select a sample of stars that are members of 26 nearby moving groups, clusters, or associations with ages $&lt;$300 Myr that have been observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite at 2-minute cadence. We identified 26,355 flares originating from 3,157 stars and robustly measure the rotation periods of 1,847 stars. We measure and find the flare frequency distribution (FFD) slope, $\alpha$, saturates for all spectral types at $\alpha \sim -0.5$ and is constant over 300 Myr. Additionally, we find that flare rates for stars $t_\textrm{age} = 50 - 250$ Myr are saturated below $R_0 &lt; 0.14$, which is consistent with other indicators of magnetic activity. We find evidence of annual flare rate variability in eleven stars, potentially correlated with long term stellar activity cycles. Additionally, we cross match our entire sample with GALEX and find no correlation between flare rate and Far- and Near-Ultraviolet flux. Finally, we find the flare rates of planet hosting stars are relatively lower than comparable, larger samples of stars, which may have ramifications for the atmospheric evolution of short-period exoplanets.</description>

      <title>Solar Radio Bursts and Space Weather</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space Weather is the study of the conditions in the solar wind that can affect life on the surface of the Earth, particularly the increasingly technologically sophisticated devices that are part of modern life. Solar radio observations are relevant to such phenomena because they generally originate as events in the solar atmosphere, including flares, coronal mass ejections and shocks, that produce electromagnetic and particle radiations that impact the Earth. Low frequency solar radio emission arises in the solar atmosphere at the levels where these events occur: we can use frequency as a direct measure of density, and an indirect measure of height, in the atmosphere. The main radio burst types are described and illustrated using data from the Green Bank Solar Radio Burst Spectrometer, and their potential use as diagnostics of Space Weather is discussed.</description>

      <title>Recurrent Nova V2487 Oph Had Superflares in 1941 and 1942 With Radiant Energies 10$^{42.5\pm1.6}$ Ergs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: V2487 Ophiuchi (V2487 Oph) is a recurrent nova with classical nova eruptions in 1900 and 1998, and it is also the most extreme known superflare star. These superflares are roughly-hour-long flares with amplitudes and optical energies reaching up to 1.10 mag and $10^{39.21}$ ergs, with the superflares recurring once-a-day. The V2487 Oph superflares are certainly operating with the same mechanism as all the other types of superflare stars, where magnetic loops are twisted and stretched until reconnection occurs, whereupon ambient electrons are accelerated to relativistic energies and then emitted bremsstrahlung radiation from X-ray to radio. V2487 Oph is unique among known superflare stars in that one of the loop footprints is in an accretion disk. This exact mechanism was theoretically predicted by M. R. Hayashi and colleagues in 1996. Now, I have found two superflares recorded on Harvard archival photographs from the years 1941 and 1942. These two superflares have $B$ magnitude amplitudes of $&gt;$1.83 and $&gt;$2.00 mag and total radiated energies of $10^{42.4}$ and $10^{42.5}$ ergs with bolometric corrections. Each has emitted energies of $\sim$30-billion Carringtons, in units of the most energetic solar flare. Further, I find superflares in the Zwicky Transient Factory light curves, so V2487 Oph has been superflaring from 1941 to 2023. For the observed number distribution of $dN/dE$=$4E^{-2}$ superflares per year, for $E$ in units of $10^{41}$ ergs, the emitted energy in superflare light is $10^{42.1}$ erg in each year, or $10^{44.1}$ ergs from 1941 to 2023.</description>

      <title>Probing the dynamical and kinematical structures of detached shells around AGB stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to resolve the spatial and kinematic sub-structures in five detached-shell sources to provide detailed constraints for hydrodynamic models that describe the formation and evolution of the shells. Methods. We use observations of the 12 CO (1-0) emission towards five carbon-AGB stars with ALMA. The data have angular resolutions of 0.3 arcsec to 1arcsec and a velocity resolution of 0.3 km/s . This enables us to quantify spatial and kinematic structures in the shells. Results. The observed emission is separated into two distinct components: a more coherent, bright outer shell and a more filamentary, fainter inner shell. The kinematic information shows that the inner sub-shells move at a higher velocity relative to the outer sub-shells. The observed sub-structures confirm the predictions from hydrodynamical models. However, the models do not predict a double-shell structure, and the CO emission likely only traces the inner and outer edges of the shell, implying a lack of CO in the middle layers of the detached shell. Previous estimates of the masses and temperatures are consistent with originating mainly from the brighter subshell, but the total shell masses are likely lower limits. Conclusions. The observed spatial and kinematical splittings of the shells appear consistent with results from hydrodynamical models, provided the CO emission does not trace the H2 density distribution in the shell but rather traces the edges of the shells. It is therefore not possible to constrain the total shell mass based on the CO observations alone. Complementary observations of, e.g., CI as a dissociation product of CO would be necessary to understand the distribution of CO compared to H2.</description>

      <title>X-Shooting ULLYSES: Massive stars at low metallicity -- V. Effect of metallicity on surface abundances of O stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive stars rotate faster, on average, than lower mass stars. Stellar rotation triggers hydrodynamical instabilities which transport angular momentum and chemical species from the core to the surface. Models of high-mass stars that include these processes predict that chemical mixing is stronger at lower metallicity. We aim to test this prediction by comparing the surface abundances of massive stars at different metallicities. We performed a spectroscopic analysis of single O stars in the Magellanic Clouds (MCs) based on the ULLYSES and XshootU surveys. We determined the fundamental parameters and helium, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen surface abundances of 17 LMC and 17 SMC non-supergiant O6-9.5 stars. We complemented these determinations by literature results for additional MCs and also Galactic stars to increase the sample size and metallicity coverage. We investigated the differences in the surface chemical enrichment at different metallicities and compared them with predictions of three sets of evolutionary models. Surface abundances are consistent with CNO-cycle nucleosynthesis. The maximum surface nitrogen enrichment is stronger in MC stars than in Galactic stars. Nitrogen enrichment is also observed in stars with higher surface gravities in the SMC than in the Galaxy. This trend is predicted by models that incorporate chemical transport caused by stellar rotation. The distributions of projected rotational velocities in our samples are likely biased towards slow rotators. A metallicity dependence of surface abundances is demonstrated. The analysis of larger samples with an unbiased distribution of projected rotational velocities is required to better constrain the treatment of chemical mixing and angular momentum transport in massive single and binary stars.</description>

      <title>The spectral evolution of white dwarfs: where do we stand?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs are the dense, burnt-out remnants of the vast majority of stars, condemned to cool over billions of years as they steadily radiate away their residual thermal energy. To first order, their atmosphere is expected to be made purely of hydrogen due to the efficient gravitational settling of heavier elements. However, observations reveal a much more complex situation, as the surface of a white dwarf (1) can be dominated by helium rather than hydrogen, (2) can be polluted by trace chemical species, and (3) can undergo significant composition changes with time. This indicates that various mechanisms of element transport effectively compete against gravitational settling in the stellar envelope. This phenomenon is known as the spectral evolution of white dwarfs and has important implications for Galactic, stellar, and planetary astrophysics. This invited review provides a comprehensive picture of our current understanding of white dwarf spectral evolution. We first describe the latest observational constraints on the variations in atmospheric composition along the cooling sequence, covering both the dominant and trace constituents. We then summarise the predictions of state-of-the-art models of element transport in white dwarfs and assess their ability to explain the observed spectral evolution. Finally, we highlight remaining open questions and suggest avenues for future work.</description>

      <title>Satellite lines from autoionizing states of Fe XVI and the problems with the X-ray Fe XVII lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new calculations of atomic data needed to model autoionizing states of Fe XVI. We compare the state energies, radiative and excitation data with a sample of results from previous literature. We find a large scatter of results, the most significant ones in the autoionization rates, which are very sensitive to the configuration interaction and state mixing. We find relatively good agreement between the autoionization rates and the collisional excitation rates calculated with the R-matrix suite of programs and autostructure. The largest model, which includes J-resolved states up to n=10, produces ab-initio wavelengths and intensities of the satellite lines which agree well with solar high-resolution spectra of active regions, with few minor wavelength adjustements. We review previous literature, finding many incorrect identifications, most notably those in the NIST database. We provide several new tentative identifications in the 15-15.7 A range, and several new ones at shorter wavelengths, where previous lines were unidentified. Compared to the previous CHIANTI model, the present one has an increased flux in the 15--15.7 A range at 2 MK of a factor of 1.9, resolving the discrepancies found in the analysis of the Marshall Grazing Incidence X-Ray Spectrometer (MaGIXS) observation. It appears that the satellite lines also resolve the long-standing discrepancy in the intensity of the important Fe XVII 3D line at 15.26 A.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Imaging Observations of a C2.3 White-Light Flare from the Advanced Space-Based Solar Observatory (ASO-S) and the Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer (CHASE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar white-light flares are characterized by an enhancement in the optical continuum, which are usually large flares (say X- and M-class flares). Here we report a small C2.3 white-light flare (SOL2022-12-20T04:10) observed by the \emph{Advanced Space-based Solar Observatory} and the \emph{Chinese H$\alpha$ Solar Explorer}. This flare exhibits an increase of $\approx$6.4\% in the photospheric Fe \textsc{i} line at 6569.2\,\AA\ and {$\approx$3.2\%} in the nearby continuum. The continuum at 3600\,\AA\ also shows an enhancement of $\approx$4.7\%. The white-light brightening kernels are mainly located at the flare ribbons and co-spatial with nonthermal hard X-ray sources, which implies that the enhanced white-light emissions are related to nonthermal electron-beam heating. At the brightening kernels, the Fe \textsc{i} line displays an absorption profile that has a good Gaussian shape, with a redshift up to $\approx$1.7 km s$^{-1}$, while the H$\alpha$ line shows an emission profile though having a central reversal. The H$\alpha$ line profile also shows a red or blue asymmetry caused by plasma flows with a velocity of several to tens of km s$^{-1}$. It is interesting to find that the H$\alpha$ asymmetry is opposite at the conjugate footpoints. It is also found that the CHASE continuum increase seems to be related to the change of photospheric magnetic field. Our study provides comprehensive characteristics of a small white-light flare that help understand the energy release process of white-light flares.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constraining the processes that drive coronal heating from observations is a difficult task due to the complexity of the solar atmosphere. As upcoming missions such as MUSE will provide coronal observations with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution, numerical simulations are becoming increasingly realistic. Despite the availability of synthetic observations from numerical models, line-of-sight effects and the complexity of the magnetic topology in a realistic setup still complicate the prediction of signatures for specific heating processes. 3D MHD simulations have shown that a significant part of the Poynting flux injected into the solar atmosphere is carried by small-scale motions, such as vortices driven by rotational flows inside intergranular lanes. MHD waves excited by these vortices have been suggested to play an important role in the energy transfer between different atmospheric layers. Using synthetic spectroscopic data generated from a coronal loop model incorporating realistic driving by magnetoconvection, we study whether signatures of energy transport by vortices and eventual dissipation can be identified with future missions such as MUSE.</description>

      <title>Modeling of Granulation in Red Supergiants in the Magellanic Clouds with the Gaussian Process Regressions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The granulation of red supergiants (RSGs) in the Magellanic Clouds are systematically investigated by combining the latest RSGs samples and light curves from the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment and the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. The present RSGs samples are firstly examined for foreground stars and possible misidentified sources, and the light curves are sequentially checked to remove the outliers by white noise and photometric quality. The Gaussian Process regression is used to model the granulation, and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo is applied to derive the granulation amplitude $\sigma$ and the period of the undamped oscillator $\rho$, as well as the damping timescale $\tau$. The dimensionless quality factor $Q$ is then calculated through $Q=\pi \tau/\rho$. RSGs around $Q = 1/\sqrt{2}$ are considered to have significant granulation signals and are used for further analysis. Combining granulation parameters with stellar parameters, robust scaling relations for the timescale $\rho$ are established, while the scaling relations for amplitude $\sigma$ are represented by a piecewise function, possibly related to the tendency of amplitudes in faint RSGs to converge towards a certain value. Comparing results between the SMC and LMC confirms that amplitudes and timescales become larger with metallicity. In examining the scaling relations between the two galaxies, it is found that $\rho$ is nearly independent of metallicity, whereas $\sigma$ is more significantly affected by metallicity. The Gaussian Process method is compared with the periodogram fitting of the granulations, and the advantages of either are discussed.</description>

      <title>Symbiotic stars in X-rays IV: XMM-Newton, Swift and TESS observations</title>

Abstract: White dwarf symbiotic binaries are detected in X-rays with luminosities in the range of 10$^{30}$ to 10$^{34}$ lumcgs. Their X-ray emission arises either from the accretion disk boundary layer, from a region where the winds from both components collide or from nuclear burning on the white dwarf surface. In our continuous effort to identify X-ray emitting symbiotic stars, we studied four systems using observations from the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory and XMM-Newton satellites in X-rays and from TESS in the optical. The X-ray spectra were fit with absorbed optically thin thermal plasma models, either single- or multitemperature with kT $&lt;$ 8 keV for all targets. Based on the characteristics of their X-ray spectra, we classified BD Cam as possible $\beta$-type, V1261 Ori and CD -27 8661 as $\delta$-type, and confirmed NQ Gem as $\beta$/$\delta$-type. The $\delta$-type X-ray emission most likely arise in the boundary layer of the accretion disk, while in the case of BD Cam, its mostly-soft emission originates from shocks, possibly between the red giant and WD/disk winds. In general, we have found that the observed X-ray emission is powered by accretion at a low accretion rate of about 10$^{-11}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The low ratio of X-ray to optical luminosities, however indicates that the accretion-disk boundary layer is mostly optically thick and tends to emit in the far or extreme UV. The detection of flickering in optical data provides evidence of the existence of an accretion disk.</description>

      <title>Confronting sparse Gaia DR3 photometry with TESS for a sample of about 60,000 hot massive non-radial pulsators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01539v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gaia mission has delivered hundreds of thousands of variable star light curves in multiple wavelengths. Recent work demonstrates that these light curves can be used to identify (non-)radial pulsations in the OBAF-type stars, despite the irregular cadence and low light curve precision of order a few mmag. With the considerably more precise TESS photometry, we revisit these candidate pulsators to conclusively ascertain the nature of their variability. We seek to re-classify the Gaia light curves with the first two years of TESS photometry for a sample of 58,970 p- and g- mode pulsators, encompassing gamma Dor, delta Scuti, SPB, and beta Cep variables. We also supply four new catalogues containing the confirmed pulsators, along with their dominant and secondary pulsation frequencies, the number of independent mode frequencies, and a ranking according to their usefulness for future asteroseismic ensemble analysis. We find that the Gaia photometry is exceptionally accurate for detecting the dominant and secondary frequencies, reaching approximately 80% accuracy in frequency for p- and g-mode pulsators. The majority of Gaia classifications are consistent with the classifications from the TESS data, illustrating the power of the low-cadence Gaia photometry for pulsation studies. We find that the sample of g-mode pulsators forms a continuous group of variable stars along the main sequence across B, A, and F spectral types, implying that the mode excitation mechanisms for all these pulsators need to be updated with improved physics. Finally, we provide a rank-ordered table of pulsators according to their asteroseismic potential for follow-up studies. Our catalogue offers a major increase in the number of confirmed gravity-mode pulsators with an identified dominant mode suitable for follow-up TESS ensemble asteroseismology of such stars.</description>

      <title>Bumpy Superluminous Supernovae Powered by Magnetar-star Binary Engine</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01224v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wolf-Rayet stars in close binary systems can be tidally spun up by their companions, potentially leaving behind fast-spinning highly-magnetized neutron stars, known as ``magnetars", after core collapse. These newborn magnetars can transfer rotational energy into heating and accelerating the ejecta, producing hydrogen-poor superluminous supernovae (SLSNe). In this {\em{Letter}}, we propose that the magnetar wind of the newborn magnetar could significantly evaporate its companion star, typically a main-sequence or helium star, if the binary system is not disrupted by the SN kick. The subsequent heating and acceleration of the evaporated star material along with the SN ejecta by the magnetar wind can produce a post-peak bump in the SLSN lightcurve. Our model can reproduce the primary peaks and post-peak bumps of four example observed multiband SLSN lightcurves, revealing that the mass of the evaporated material could be $\sim0.4-0.6\,M_\odot$ if the material is hydrogen-rich. We suggest that the magnetar could induce strongly enhanced evaporation from its companion star near the pericenter if the orbit of the post-SN binary is highly eccentric, ultimately generating multiple post-peak bumps in the SLSN lightcurves. This ``magnetar-star binary engine" model offers a possible explanation for the evolution of polarization, along with the origin and velocity broadening of late-time hydrogen or helium broad spectral features observed in some bumpy SLSNe. The diversity in the lightcurves and spectra of SLSNe may be attributed to the wide variety of companion stars and post-SN binary systems.</description>

      <title>The rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal and confirmation of its detection toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 3-Hydroxypropenal (HOCHCHCHO) is the lower energy tautomer of malonaldehyde which displays a complex rotation-tunneling spectrum. It was detected tentatively toward the solar-type protostar IRAS 16293$-$2422 B with ALMA in the framework of the Protostellar Interferometric Line Survey (PILS). Several transitions, however, had large residuals, preventing not only their detection, but also the excitation temperature of the species from being determined unambiguously. We want to extend the existing rotational line list of 3-hydroxypropenal to shed more light on the recent observational results and to facilitate additional radio astronomical searches for this molecule. We analyzed the rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal in the frequency regions between 150 and 330 GHz and between 400 and 660 GHz. Transitions were searched for in the PILS observations of IRAS 16293$-$2422. Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) models were carried out and compared to the observations to constrain the excitation temperature. Additional transitions were searched for in other ALMA archival data of the same source to confirm the presence of 3-hydroxypropenal. More than 11500 transitions were assigned in the course of our investigation with quantum numbers $2 \le J \le 100$, $K_a \le 59$, and $K_c \le 97$, resulting in a greatly improved set of spectroscopic parameters. The comparison between the LTE models and the observations yields an excitation temperature of 125 K with a column density $N = 1.0 \times 10^{15}$ cm$^{-2}$ for this species. We identified seven additional lines of 3-hydroxypropenal that show a good agreement with the model in the ALMA archive data. The calculated rotation-tunneling spectrum of 3-hydroxypropenal has sufficient accuracy for radio astronomical searches. The detection of 3-hydroxypropenal toward IRAS 16293$-$2422 B is now secure.</description>

      <title>Convection and the Core $g$-mode in Proto-Compact Stars -- A detailed analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of the dynamics of proto-compact star (PCS) convection and the core ${}^2\!g_1$-mode in core-collapse supernovae based on general relativistic 2D and 3D neutrino hydrodynamics simulations. Based on 2D simulations, we derive a mode relation for the core $g$-mode frequency in terms of PCS and equation of state parameters, and discuss its limits of accuracy. This relation may prove useful for parameter inference from future supernova gravitational wave (GW) signals if the core $g$-mode or an emission gap at the avoided crossing with the fundamental mode can be detected. The current 3D simulation does not show GW emission from the core $g$-mode due to less power in high-frequency convective motions to excite the mode, however. Analysing the dynamics of PCS convection in 3D, we find that simple scaling laws for convective velocity from mixing-length theory (MLT) do not apply. Energy and lepton number transport is instead governed by a more complex balance between neutrino fluxes and turbulent fluxes that results in roughly uniform rates of change of entropy and lepton number in the PCS convection zone. Electron fraction and enthalpy contrasts in PCS convection are not well captured by the MLT gradient approximation. We find distinctly different spectra for the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent fluctuations in the electron fraction, which scale approximately as $l^{-1}$ without a downturn at low $l$. We suggest that the different turbulence spectrum of the electron fraction is naturally expected for a passive scalar quantity.</description>

      <title>The Digitization of Photographic Spectra in the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory Plate Collection with Commercial Scanners: A Pilot Study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01456v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commercial flatbed scanners have the potential to deliver a quick and efficient means of capturing the scientific content of spectra recorded on photographic plates. We discuss the digitization of selected spectra in the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory (DAO) photographic plate collection with commercial scanners. In this pilot study, emphasis is placed on assessing if the information on the plates can be recovered using Epson V800 and 12000XL scanners; the more complicated issues associated with the shortcomings of photographic materials, such as correcting for nonlinearity, are deferred to a future study. Spectra of Vega that were recorded over ~4 decades with the DAO 1.8 meter telescope are examined. These spectra sample a range of photographic emulsions, plate preparation techniques, calibration information, observing techniques, and spectrograph configuration. A scanning density of 2400 elements per inch recovers information in the spectra. Differences in the modulation transfer function (MTF) of the two scanners are found, with the Epson 12000XL having a superior MTF. Comparisons with a CCD spectrum of Vega confirm that moderately weak features are faithfully recovered in photographic spectra that have been digitized with the 12000XL scanner. The importance of scanning the full plate to cover the light profile of the target and calibration information is emphasized. Lessons learned from these experiments are also presented.</description>

      <title>Advancements in Streamlining Time-Domain and Multi-Messenger Astronomy Follow-Up Infrastructure at Keck Observatory</title>

Abstract: With active time-domain surveys like the Zwicky Transient Facility, the anticipated Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and multi-messenger experiments such as LIGO/VIRGO/KANGRA for gravitational wave detection and IceCube for high-energy neutrino events, there is a new era in both time-domain and multi-messenger astronomy. The Astro2020 decadal survey highlights effectively responding to these astronomical alerts in a timely manner as a priority, and thus, there is an urgent need for the development of a seamless follow-up infrastructure at existing facilities that are capable of following up on detections at the survey depths. At the W. M. Keck Observatory (WMKO), we are actively constructing critical infrastructure, aimed at facilitating the Target-of-Opportunity (ToO) trigger, optimizing observational planning, streamlining data acquisition, and enhancing data product accessibility. In this document, we provide an overview of these developing services and place them in context of existing observatory infrastructure like the Keck Observatory Archive (KOA) and Data Services Initiative (DSI).</description>

      <title>Boron Abundances in Early B Dwarfs of the Galactic Open Cluster NGC 3293</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12918v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New boron abundances or upper limits have been determined for 8 early-B stars in the young Galactic open cluster NGC 3293, using ultraviolet spectra obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origins Spectrograph. With previous observations, there are now 18 early-B stars in this cluster with boron measurements. Six of the newly observed stars have projected rotational velocities greater than 200 km/s, allowing new constraints on rotationally driven mixing in main-sequence stars. When comparing to synthetic model populations, we find that the majority of our sample stars agree well with the predicted trends of stronger boron depletion for larger rotation and for larger mass or luminosity. Based on those, a smaller than the canonical rotational mixing efficiency,(fc = 0.0165 vs the more standard value of 0.033), appears to be required. However, our five most slowly rotating stars are not well explained by rotational mixing, and we speculate that they originate from binary mergers.</description>

      <title>On Binary Formation from Three Initially Unbound Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore three-body binary formation (3BBF), the formation of a bound system via gravitational scattering of three initially unbound bodies (3UB), using direct numerical integrations. For the first time, we consider systems with unequal masses, as well as finite-size and post-Newtonian effects. Our analytically derived encounter rates and numerical scattering results reproduce the 3BBF rate predicted by Goodman \&amp; Hut (1993) for hard binaries in dense star clusters. We find that 3BBF occurs overwhelmingly through nonresonant encounters and that the two most massive bodies are never the most likely to bind. Instead, 3BBF favors pairing the two least massive bodies (for wide binaries) or the most plus least massive bodies (for hard binaries). 3BBF overwhelmingly favors wide binary formation with super-thermal eccentricities, perhaps helping to explain the eccentric wide binaries observed by Gaia. Hard binary formation is far rarer, but with a thermal eccentricity distribution. The semimajor axis distribution scales cumulatively as $a^3$ for hard and slightly wider binaries. Though mergers are rare between black holes when including relativistic effects, direct collisions occur frequently between main-sequence stars -- more often than hard 3BBF. Yet, these collisions do not significantly suppress hard 3BBF at the low velocity dispersions typical of open or globular clusters. Energy dissipation through gravitational radiation leads to a small probability of a bound, hierarchical triple system forming directly from 3UB.</description>

      <title>Type Ia Supernova Progenitor Properties and Their Host Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.03473v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an eigenfunction method to analyze 161 visual light curves (LCs) of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) obtained by the Carnegie Supernova Project to characterize their diversity and host-galaxy correlations. The eigenfunctions are based on the delayed-detonation scenario using three parameters: the LC stretch being determined by the amount of deflagration-burning governing the 56Ni production, the main-sequence mass M_MS of the progenitor white dwarf controlling the explosion energy, and its central density rho_c shifting the 56Ni distribution. Our analysis tool (SPAT) extracts the parameters from observations and projects them into physical space using their allowed ranges M_MS &lt; 8 M_sun, rho_c &lt; 7-8x10^9g/cc. The residuals between fits and individual LC-points are ~ 1-3% for ~ 92% of objects. We find two distinct M_MS groups corresponding to a fast (~ 40-65 Myrs) and a slow(~ 200-500 Myrs) stellar evolution. Most underluminous SNe Ia have hosts with low star formation but high M_MS, suggesting slow evolution times of the progenitor system. 91T-likes SNe show very similar LCs and high M_MS and are correlated to star formation regions, making them potentially important tracers of star formation in the early Universe out to z = 4-11. Some 6% outliers with `non-physical' parameters can be attributed to superluminous SNe Ia and subluminous SNe Ia with hosts of active star formation. For deciphering the SNe Ia diversity and high-precision SNe Ia cosmology, the importance is shown for LCs covering out to ~ 60 days past maximum. Finally, our method and results are discussed within the framework of multiple explosion scenarios, and in light of upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Effects of wave damping and finite perpendicular scale on three-dimensional Alfven wave parametric decay in low-beta plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08179v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Shear Alfven wave parametric decay instability (PDI) provides a potential path toward significant wave dissipation and plasma heating. However, fundamental questions regarding how PDI is excited in a realistic three-dimensional (3D) open system and how critically the finite perpendicular wave scale--as found in both laboratory and space plasmas--affects the excitation remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first 3D, open-boundary, hybrid kinetic-fluid simulations of kinetic Alfven wave PDI in low-beta plasmas. Key findings are that the PDI excitation is strongly limited by the wave damping present, including electron-ion collisional damping (represented by a constant resistivity) and geometrical attenuation associated with the finite-scale Alfven wave, and ion Landau damping of the child acoustic wave. The perpendicular wave scale alone, however, plays no discernible role: waves of different perpendicular scales exhibit similar instability growth as long as the magnitude of the parallel ponderomotive force remains unchanged. These findings are corroborated by theoretical analysis and estimates. The new understanding of 3D kinetic Alfv\'en wave PDI physics is essential for laboratory study of the basic plasma process and may also help evaluate the relevance/role of PDI in low-beta space plasmas.</description>
