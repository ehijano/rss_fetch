      <title>The saddlepoint approximation for averages of conditionally independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the application of saddlepoint approximations to resampling-based statistical tests, we prove that a Lugananni-Rice style approximation for conditional tail probabilities of averages of conditionally independent random variables has vanishing relative error. We also provide a general condition on the existence and uniqueness of the solution to the corresponding saddlepoint equation. The results are valid under a broad class of distributions involving no restrictions on the smoothness of the distribution function. The derived saddlepoint approximation formula can be directly applied to resampling-based hypothesis tests, including bootstrap, sign-flipping and conditional randomization tests. Our results extend and connect several classical saddlepoint approximation results. On the way to proving our main results, we prove a new conditional Berry-Esseen inequality for the sum of conditionally independent random variables, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Error Bounds for a Kernel-Based Constrained Optimal Smoothing Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes error bounds for the convergence of a piecewise linear approximation of the constrained optimal smoothing problem posed in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). This problem can be reformulated as a Bayesian estimation problem involving a Gaussian process related to the kernel of the RKHS. Consequently, error bounds can be interpreted as a quantification of the maximum a posteriori (MAP) accuracy. To our knowledge, no error bounds have been proposed for this type of problem so far. The convergence results are provided as a function of the grid size, the regularity of the kernel, and the distance from the kernel interpolant of the approximation to the set of constraints. Inspired by the MaxMod algorithm from recent literature, which sequentially allocates knots for the piecewise linear approximation, we conduct our analysis for non-equispaced knots. These knots are even allowed to be non-dense, which impacts the definition of the optimal smoothing solution and our error bound quantifiers. Finally, we illustrate our theorems through several numerical experiments involving constraints such as boundedness and monotonicity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.09130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the wide usage of parametric point processes in theory and applications, a sound goodness-of-fit procedure to test whether a given parametric model is appropriate for data coming from a self-exciting point processes has been missing in the literature. In this work, we establish a bootstrap-based goodness-of-fit test which empirically works for all kinds of self-exciting point processes (and even beyond). In an infill-asymptotic setting we also prove its asymptotic consistency, albeit only in the particular case that the underlying point process is inhomogeneous Poisson.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bayesian Regression on Data with Low Intrinsic Dimensionality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09286v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study how the posterior contraction rate under a Gaussian process (GP) prior depends on the intrinsic dimension of the predictors and smoothness of the regression function. An open question is whether a generic GP prior that does not incorporate knowledge of the intrinsic lower-dimensional structure of the predictors can attain an adaptive rate for a broad class of such structures. We show that this is indeed the case, establishing conditions under which the posterior contraction rates become adaptive to the intrinsic dimension $\varrho$ in terms of the covering number of the data domain $X$ (the Minkowski dimension), and prove the optimal posterior contraction rate $O(n^{-s/(2s +\varrho)})$, up to a logarithmic factor, assuming an approximation order $s$ of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) on ${X}$. When ${X}$ is a $\varrho$-dimensional compact smooth manifold, we study RKHS approximations to intrinsically defined $s$-order H\"older functions on the manifold for any positive $s$ by a novel analysis of kernel approximations on manifolds, leading to the optimal adaptive posterior contraction rate. We propose an empirical Bayes prior on the kernel bandwidth using kernel affinity and $k$-nearest neighbor statistics, eliminating the need for prior knowledge of the intrinsic dimension. The efficiency of the proposed Bayesian regression approach is demonstrated on various numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Covariate Assisted Entity Ranking with Sparse Intrinsic Scores</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the item ranking problem with associate covariates, focusing on scenarios where the preference scores can not be fully explained by covariates, and the remaining intrinsic scores, are sparse. Specifically, we extend the pioneering Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model by incorporating covariate information and considering sparse individual intrinsic scores. Our work introduces novel model identification conditions and examines the regularized penalized Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) statistical rates. We then construct a debiased estimator for the penalized MLE and analyze its distributional properties. Additionally, we apply our method to the goodness-of-fit test for models with no latent intrinsic scores, namely, the covariates fully explaining the preference scores of individual items. We also offer confidence intervals for ranks. Our numerical studies lend further support to our theoretical findings, demonstrating validation for our proposed method</description>

      <title>Computational-Statistical Trade-off in Kernel Two-Sample Testing with Random Fourier Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in methods for two-sample testing, among which the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) test has emerged as an effective tool for handling complex and high-dimensional data. Despite its success and widespread adoption, the primary limitation of the MMD test has been its quadratic-time complexity, which poses challenges for large-scale analysis. While various approaches have been proposed to expedite the procedure, it has been unclear whether it is possible to attain the same power guarantee as the MMD test at sub-quadratic time cost. To fill this gap, we revisit the approximated MMD test using random Fourier features, and investigate its computational-statistical trade-off. We start by revealing that the approximated MMD test is pointwise consistent in power only when the number of random features approaches infinity. We then consider the uniform power of the test and study the time-power trade-off under the minimax testing framework. Our result shows that, by carefully choosing the number of random features, it is possible to attain the same minimax separation rates as the MMD test within sub-quadratic time. We demonstrate this point under different distributional assumptions such as densities in a Sobolev ball. Our theoretical findings are corroborated by simulation studies.</description>

      <title>On the Structural Dimension of Sliced Inverse Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address the longstanding puzzle that Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR) often performs poorly for sufficient dimension reduction when the structural dimension $d$ (the dimension of the central space) exceeds 4. We first show that in the multiple index model $Y=f( \mathbf{P} \boldsymbol{X})+\epsilon$ where $\boldsymbol{X}$ is a $p$-standard normal vector, $\epsilon$ is an independent noise, and $\mathbf{P}$ is a projection operator from $\mathbb R^{p}$ to $\mathbb R^{d}$, if the link function $f$ follows the law of a Gaussian process, then with high probability, the $d$-th eigenvalue $\lambda_{d}$ of $\mathrm{Cov}\left[\mathbb{E}(\boldsymbol{X}\mid Y)\right]$ satisfies $\lambda_{d}\leq C e^{-\theta d}$ for some positive constants $C$ and $\theta$. We then focus on the low signal regime where $\lambda_{d}$ can be arbitrarily small and not larger than $d^{-8.1}$, and prove that the minimax risk of estimating the central space is lower bounded by $\frac{dp}{n\lambda_{d}}$. Combining these two results, we provide a convincing explanation for the poor performance of SIR when $d$ is large, a phenomenon that has perplexed researchers for nearly three decades. The technical tools developed here may be of independent interest for studying other sufficient dimension reduction methods.</description>

      <title>Kernel Stein Discrepancy on Lie Groups: Theory and Applications</title>

Abstract: Distributional approximation is a fundamental problem in machine learning with numerous applications across all fields of science and engineering and beyond. The key challenge in most approximation methods is the need to tackle the intractable normalization constant pertaining to the parametrized distributions used to model the data. In this paper, we present a novel Stein operator on Lie groups leading to a kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD) which is a normalization-free loss function. We present several theoretical results characterizing the properties of this new KSD on Lie groups and its minimizers namely, the minimum KSD estimator (MKSDE). Proof of several properties of MKSDE are presented, including strong consistency, CLT and a closed form of the MKSDE for the von Mises-Fisher distribution on SO(N). Finally, we present experimental evidence depicting advantages of minimizing KSD over maximum likelihood estimation.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma with the Bivariate Gamma Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Probabilistic proofs of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma imply that random projection can reduce the dimension of a data set and approximately preserve pairwise distances. If a distance being approximately preserved is called a success, and the complement of this event is called a failure, then such a random projection likely results in no failures. Assuming a Gaussian random projection, the lemma is proved by showing that the no-failure probability is positive using a combination of Bonferroni's inequality and Markov's inequality. This paper modifies this proof in two ways to obtain a greater lower bound on the no-failure probability. First, Bonferroni's inequality is applied to pairs of failures instead of individual failures. Second, since a pair of projection errors has a bivariate gamma distribution, the probability of a pair of successes is bounded using an inequality from Jensen (1969). If $n$ is the number of points to be embedded and $\mu$ is the probability of a success, then this leads to an increase in the lower bound on the no-failure probability of $\frac{1}{2}\binom{n}{2}(1-\mu)^2$ if $\binom{n}{2}$ is even and $\frac{1}{2}\left(\binom{n}{2}-1\right)(1-\mu)^2$ if $\binom{n}{2}$ is odd. For example, if $n=10^5$ points are to be embedded in $k=10^4$ dimensions with a tolerance of $\epsilon=0.1$, then the improvement in the lower bound is on the order of $10^{-14}$. We also show that further improvement is possible if the inequality in Jensen (1969) extends to three successes, though we do not have a proof of this result.</description>

      <title>Invariant correlation under marginal transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.11188v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A useful property of independent samples is that their correlation remains the same after applying marginal transforms. This invariance property plays a fundamental role in statistical inference, but does not hold in general for dependent samples. In this paper, we study this invariance property on the Pearson correlation coefficient and its applications. A multivariate random vector is said to have an invariant correlation if its pairwise correlation coefficients remain unchanged under any common marginal transforms. For a bivariate case, we characterize all models of such a random vector via a certain combination of comonotonicity -- the strongest form of positive dependence -- and independence. In particular, we show that the class of exchangeable copulas with invariant correlation is precisely described by what we call positive Fr\'echet copulas. In the general multivariate case, we characterize the set of all invariant correlation matrices via the clique partition polytope. We also propose a positive regression dependent model that admits any prescribed invariant correlation matrix. This model turns out to be the joint distribution of samples with duplicate records. In this context, we provide an application of invariant correlation to the statistical inference in the presence of sample duplication. Finally, we show that all our characterization results of invariant correlation, except one special case, remain the same if the common marginal transforms are confined to the set of increasing ones.</description>

      <title>Low-order outcomes and clustered designs: combining design and analysis for causal inference under network interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07979v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Variance reduction for causal inference in the presence of network interference is often achieved through either outcome modeling, which is typically analyzed under unit-randomized Bernoulli designs, or clustered experimental designs, which are typically analyzed without strong parametric assumptions. In this work, we study the intersection of these two approaches and consider the problem of estimation in low-order outcome models using data from a general experimental design. Our contributions are threefold. First, we present an estimator of the total treatment effect (also called the global average treatment effect) in a low-degree outcome model when the data are collected under general experimental designs, generalizing previous results for Bernoulli designs. We refer to this estimator as the pseudoinverse estimator and give bounds on its bias and variance in terms of properties of the experimental design. Second, we evaluate these bounds for the case of cluster randomized designs with both Bernoulli and complete randomization. For clustered Bernoulli randomization, we find that our estimator is always unbiased and that its variance scales like the smaller of the variance obtained from a low-order assumption and the variance obtained from cluster randomization, showing that combining these variance reduction strategies is preferable to using either individually. For clustered complete randomization, we find a notable bias-variance trade-off mediated by specific features of the clustering. Third, when choosing a clustered experimental design, our bounds can be used to select a clustering from a set of candidate clusterings. Across a range of graphs and clustering algorithms, we show that our method consistently selects clusterings that perform well on a range of response models, suggesting that our bounds are useful to practitioners.</description>

      <title>When can weak latent factors be statistically inferred?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a new and comprehensive estimation and inference theory for principal component analysis (PCA) under the weak factor model that allow for cross-sectional dependent idiosyncratic components under nearly minimal the factor strength relative to the noise level or signal-to-noise ratio. Our theory is applicable regardless of the relative growth rate between the cross-sectional dimension $N$ and temporal dimension $T$. This more realistic assumption and noticeable result requires completely new technical device, as the commonly-used leave-one-out trick is no longer applicable to the case with cross-sectional dependence. Another notable advancement of our theory is on PCA inference $ - $ for example, under the regime where $N\asymp T$, we show that the asymptotic normality for the PCA-based estimator holds as long as the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) grows faster than a polynomial rate of $\log N$. This finding significantly surpasses prior work that required a polynomial rate of $N$. Our theory is entirely non-asymptotic, offering finite-sample characterizations for both the estimation error and the uncertainty level of statistical inference. A notable technical innovation is our closed-form first-order approximation of PCA-based estimator, which paves the way for various statistical tests. Furthermore, we apply our theories to design easy-to-implement statistics for validating whether given factors fall in the linear spans of unknown latent factors, testing structural breaks in the factor loadings for an individual unit, checking whether two units have the same risk exposures, and constructing confidence intervals for systematic risks. Our empirical studies uncover insightful correlations between our test results and economic cycles.</description>
