      <title>Studying geometry of the ultraluminous X-ray pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 using X-ray and optical polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discovery of pulsations from a number of ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) sources proved that accretion onto neutron stars can produce luminosities exceeding the Eddington limit by a couple of orders of magnitude. The conditions necessary to achieve such high luminosities as well as the exact geometry of the accretion flow in the neutron star vicinity are, however, a matter of debate. The pulse phase-resolved polarization measurements that became possible with the launch of the IXPE can be used to determine the pulsar geometry and its orientation relative to the orbital plane. They provide an avenue to test different theoretical models of ULX pulsars. In this paper we present the results of three IXPE observations of the first Galactic ULX pulsar Swift J0243.6+6124 during its 2023 outburst. We find strong variations of the polarization characteristics with the pulsar phase. The average polarization degree increases from about 5% to 15% as the flux dropped by a factor of three in the course of the outburst. The polarization angle (PA) as function of the pulsar phase shows two peaks in the first two observations, but changes to a characteristic sawtooth pattern in the remaining data set. This is not consistent with a simple rotating vector model. Assuming the existence of an additional constant polarized component, we were able to fit the three observations with a common rotating vector model and obtain constraints on the pulsar geometry. In particular, we find the pulsar angular momentum inclination with respect to the line-of-sight of 15-40 deg, the magnetic obliquity of 60-80 deg, and the pulsar spin position angle of -50 deg, which differs from the constant component PA of about 10 deg. Combining these X-ray measurements with the optical PA, we find evidence for a 30 deg misalignment between the pulsar spin and the binary orbital axis.</description>

      <title>On the width of a collisionless shock and the index of the cosmic rays it accelerates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being studied for many years, the structure of collisionless shocks is still not fully determined. Such shocks are known to be accelerators of cosmic rays, which, in turn, modify the shock structure. The shock width $\lambda$ is known to be connected to the cosmic rays (CRs) spectral index, $a$. Here, we use an instability analysis to derive the shock width in the presence of CRs. We obtain an analytical expression connecting the shock width to the CRs index and to the fraction of upstream particles that are accelerated. We find that when this fraction becomes larger than $\sim$~30\%, a new instability becomes dominant. The shock undergoes a transition where its width increases by a factor $\sim 8- 10$, and the CRs acceleration effectively ends. Our analysis is valid for strong, non-relativistic and unmagnetized shocks. We discuss the implication of these results to the expected range of CRs spectra and flux observed, and on the structure of non-relativistic collisionless shocks.</description>

      <title>Deep TOV to characterize Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical observations, theoretical models, and terrestrial experiments probe different regions of neutron star (NS) interior. Therefore, it is essential to consistently combine the information from these sources. This analysis requires multiple evaluations of Tolman Oppenheimer Volkoff equations which can become computationally expensive with a large number of observations. Further, multi-messenger astronomy requires rapid NS characterization via gravitational waves for efficient electromagnetic follow-up. In this work, we develop a novel neural network-based map from the EoS curve to the mass and radius of cold non-rotating NS. We estimate a speed-up of an order of magnitude when compared with the state-of-the-art RePrimAnd solver and an average error of 1e-3 when calculating the mass and radius of the neutron star. Additionally, we also develop neural network solvers for obtaining EoS curves from a physics conforming EoS model, FRZ$\chi_{1.5}$. We utilize this efficient continuous map to measure the sensitivity of model parameters of FRZ$\chi_{1.5}$ towards mass and radius. We show that 8 out of 18 parameters of this model are sensitive by at least three orders of magnitude higher than the remaining 10 parameters. This information will be useful in further speeding up, as well as probing the crucial parameter space, in the parameter estimation from astrophysical observations using this physics-conforming EoS model.</description>

      <title>Ten Supernova-rise in Binary Driven Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The observation of a gamma-ray burst (GRB) associated with a supernova (SN) coincides remarkably with the energy output from a binary system comprising a very massive carbon-oxygen (CO) core and an associated binary neutron star (NS) by the Binary-Driven Hypernova (BdHN) model. The dragging effect in the late evolution of such systems leads to co-rotation, with binary periods on the order of minutes, resulting in a very fast rotating core and a binary NS companion at a distance of $\sim 10^5$ km. Such a fast-rotating CO core, stripped of its hydrogen and helium, undergoes gravitational collapse and, within a fraction of seconds, leads to a supernova (SN) and a newly born, fast-spinning neutron star ($\nu$NS), we name the emergence of the SN and the $\nu$NS as the SN-rise and $\nu$NS-rise. Typically, the SN energies range from $10^{51}$ to $10^{53}$ erg. We address this issue by examining 10 cases of Type-I BdHNe, the most energetic ones, in which SN accretion onto the companion NS leads to the formation of a black hole (BH). In all ten cases, the energetics of the SN events are estimated, ranging between $0.18$ and $12 \times 10^{52}$ erg. Additionally, in all 8 sources at redshift $z$ closer than $4.61$, a clear thermal blackbody component has been identified, with temperatures between $6.2$ and $39.99$ keV, as a possible signature of pair-driven SN. The triggering of the X-ray afterglow induced by the $\nu$NS-rise are identified in three cases at high redshift where early X-ray observations are achievable, benefits from the interplay of cosmological effects.</description>

      <title>Periodic Activities of Fast Radio Burst Repeaters from Precessing Magnetars with Evolving Obliquity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are cosmological radio transients with millisecond durations and extremely high brightness temperatures. One FRB repeater, FRB 180916.J0158+65 (FRB 180916B), was confirmed to appear 16.35-day periodic activities with 5-day activity window. Another FRB repeater, FRB 121102, and two soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs), SGR 1935+2154 and SGR 1806-20, also show possible periodic activities. These periodicities might originate from the precession process of young magnetars due to the anisotropic pressure from the inner magnetic fields as proposed in the literature. In this work, we analyze a self-consistent model for the rotation evolution of magnetars and obtain the evolutions of magnetar precession and obliquity. We find that if the FRB repeaters and the SGRs with (possible) periodic activities originate from the magnetar precession, their ages would be constrained to be hundreds to tens of thousands of years, which is consistent with the typical ages of magnetars. Assuming that the FRB emission is beaming in the magnetosphere as proposed in the literature, we calculate the evolution of the observable probability and the duty cycle of the active window period. We find that for a given magnetar the observable probability increases with the magnetar age in the early stage and decreases with the magnetar age in the later stage, meanwhile, there are one or two active windows in one precession period if the emission is not perfectly axisymmetric with respect to the deformation axis of a magnetar, which could be tested by the future observation for repeating FRB sources.</description>

      <title>Multiband Simultaneous Photometry of Type II SN 2023ixf with Mephisto and the Twin 50-cm Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SN 2023ixf, recently reported in the nearby galaxy M101 at a distance of $6.85~{\rm Mpc}$, was one of the closest and brightest core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) in the last decade. In this work, we present multi-wavelength photometric observation of SN 2023ixf with the Multi-channel Photometric Survey Telescope (Mephisto) in $uvgr$ bands and with the twin 50-cm telescopes in $griz$ bands. We find that the bolometric luminosity reached the maximum value of $3\times10^{43}~{\rm erg~s^{-1}}$ at 3.9 days after the explosion and fully settled onto the radioactive tail at $\sim90$ days. The effective temperature decreased from $3.2\times10^4~{\rm K}$ at the first observation and approached to a constant of $\sim(3000-4000)~{\rm K}$ after the first two months. The evolution of the photospheric radius is consistent with a homologous expansion with a velocity of $8700~{\rm km~s^{-1}}$ in the first two months, and it shrunk subsequently. Based on the radioactive tail, the initial nickel mass is about $M_{\rm Ni}\sim 0.098M_\odot$. The explosion energy and the ejecta mass are estimated to be $E\simeq(1.0-5.7)\times10^{51}~{\rm erg}$ and $M_{\rm ej}\simeq(3.8-16)M_\odot$, respectively. The peak bolometric luminosity is proposed to be contributed by the interaction between the ejecta and the circumstellar medium (CSM). We find a shocked CSM mass of $M_{\rm CSM}\sim0.013M_\odot$, a CSM density of $\rho_{\rm CSM}\sim2.5\times10^{-13}~{\rm g~cm^{-3}}$ and a mass loss rate of the progenitor of $\dot M\sim0.022M_\odot~{\rm yr^{-1}}$.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Magneto-hydrodynamic Simulations of Core-collapse Supernovae: I. Hydrodynamic evolution and protoneutron star properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results from three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamic, core-collapse simulations of sixteen progenitors following until 0.5 s after bounce. We use non-rotating solar-metallicity progenitor models with zero-age main-sequence mass between 9 and 24 $M_{\odot}$. The examined progenitors cover a wide range of the compactness parameter including a peak around $23 M_{\odot}$. We find that neutrino-driven explosions occur for all models within 0.3 s after bounce. We also find that the properties of the explosions and the central remnants are well correlated with the compactness. Early shock evolution is sensitive to the mass accretion rate onto the central core, reflecting the density profile of the progenitor stars. The most powerful explosions with diagnostic explosion energy $E_{\rm exp} \sim 0.75 \times 10^{51}$ erg are obtained by 23 and 24 $M_{\odot}$ models, which have the highest compactness among the examined models. These two models exhibit spiral SASI motions during 150-230 ms after bounce preceding a runaway shock expansion and leave a rapidly rotating neutron star with spin periods $\sim 50$ ms. Our models predict the gravitational masses of the neutron star ranging between $1.22 M_{\odot}$ and $1.67 M_{\odot}$ and their spin periods 0.04-4 s. The number distribution of these values roughly matches observation. On the other hand, our models predict small hydrodynamic kick velocity (15-260 km/s), although they are still growing at the end of our simulations. Further systematic studies, including rotation and binary effects, as well as long-term simulations up to several seconds, will enable us to explore the origin of various core-collapse supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Regions of suppressed diffusion around supernova remnants?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of the so-called TeV halos has attracted much attention. The morphology of the emission requires that the region is characterized by severe suppression of the diffusion coefficient. This finding raises many questions as to its origin: 1) is the suppressed diffusion {\bf to be} attributed to instabilities induced by the same radiating particles? 2) or does it actually show that the diffusion coefficient is small throughout the disc of the Galaxy? In both cases, one would expect that the surroundings of supernova remnants (SNRs) should also show evidence of reduced diffusion coefficient, since most remnants are located in the disc and are expected to be sites of effective particle acceleration. Should we expect the existence of regions of extended $\gamma$-ray emission from these regions as well? {\bf Here we investigate the transport of cosmic rays (CRs) escaped from SNRs in order to assess the viability of the idea of having a cocoon of suppressed diffusion around them. A comparison of our results with the $\gamma$-ray emission from the regions around HB9 and W28 does not provide solid evidence of reduced diffusivity. However, if indeed the phenomenon of reduced diffusivity occurs around SNRs surrounded by molecular clouds, our calculations show that the effects on the grammage of Galactic CRs can be significant.}</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results from a long term X-ray analysis of Mrk 279 during the period 2018-2020. We use data from multiple missions - AstroSat, NuSTAR and XMM-Newton, for the purpose. The X-ray spectrum can be modelled as a double Comptonisation along with the presence of neutral Fe K${\alpha}$ line emission, at all epochs. We determined the source's X-ray flux and luminosity at these different epochs. We find significant variations in the source's flux state. We also investigated the variations in the source's spectral components during the observation period. We find that the photon index and hence the spectral shape follow the variations only over longer time periods. We probe the correlations between fluxes of different bands and their photon indices, and found no significant correlations between the parameters.</description>

      <title>Influence of the gravitational darkening effect on the spectrum of a hot, rapidly rotating neutron star. II. Iron lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapidly rotating neutron stars are similar to highly flattened ellipsoids. Observed spectra of flattened stars must exhibit effects of non spherical shape and the gravitational darkening. We examined in detail the influence of both effects on the observed central energies and profiles of lines of highly ionized iron, FeXXV and FeXXVI. We note that the gravitational darkening effect do not change the central energy of lines. What is important, spectra of neutron stars that rotate with different frequencies and are seen at various inclinations angles differ significantly. The appearance and the depth of lines strongly depends on the parameters like the inclination angle of the star or the frequency of the star rotation. In this paper we clearly show that the gravitational darkening effect should be included in realistic model of the atmospheres of the neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Evidence of jet activity from the secondary black hole in the OJ287 binary system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the study of a huge optical intraday flare on November 12, 2021, at 2 am UT, in the blazar OJ287. In the binary black hole model it is associated with an impact of the secondary black hole on the accretion disk of the primary. Our multifrequency observing campaign was set up to search for such a signature of the impact, based on a prediction made eight years earlier. The first I-band results of the flare have already been reported by \cite{2024ApJ...960...11K}. Here we combine these data with our monitoring in the R-band. There is a big change in the R-I spectral index by $1.0\pm0.1$ between the normal background and the flare, suggesting a new component of radiation. The polarization variation during the rise of the flare suggests the same. The limits on the source size place it most reasonably in the jet of the secondary black hole. We then ask why we have not seen this phenomenon before. We show that OJ287 was never before observed with sufficient sensitivity on the night when the flare should have happened according to the binary model. We also study the probability that this flare is just an oversized example of intraday variability, using the Krakow-dataset of intense monitoring between 2015 and 2023. We find that the occurrence of a flare of this size and rapidity is unlikely. In the Appendix, we give the full orbit-linked historical light curve of OJ287 as well as the dense monitoring sample of Krakow.</description>

      <title>On the origin of the quasi-periodic micro-pulses observed in the radio-frequency emission of some neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear relationship between pulsar micro-pulse widths and rotation period is consistent with the existence of a physical length L on the neutron-star surface and seen on the observer arc of transit across the polar cap. Within the ion-proton model it is the width of the minimum area of surface that can support the critical growth rate of the unstable two-beam Langmuir mode that is the source of the radio emission.</description>

      <title>Low Mass Naked Singularities from Dark Core Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-solar mass black holes (BHs) could have been involved in the two recent gravitational wave events, GW190425 and GW190814. Since such a low mass BH cannot be formed via stellar evolution, a model has been proposed based on the core collapse of a neutron star initiated by a certain number of dark matter (DM) particles. In this process, the accumulated DM particles collapse to form a tiny BH inside the neutron star, and the entire neutron star is transmuted into a BH after a certain time due to the accretion of matter by the endoparasitic BH from its host. Here, we argue that, depending on the initial conditions, a dark core collapse could give rise to either a BH or a naked singularity. For example, if the accumulated cloud of DM particles in the core of a neutron star can be modeled as an anisotropic fluid and it fulfils the criterion for collapse, an endoparasitic naked singularity could form instead of an endoparasitic BH. Immediately after its formation, the naked singularity should begin accreting matter from the host neutron star, thus eventually transmuting the entire host into a near-solar mass, relatively slowly-spinning naked singularity. We also propose a general technique to constrain the DM particle--neutron scattering cross section using the lack of pulsars near the Galactic centre and assuming that these missing pulsars have already been transmuted into BHs and/or naked singularities. Thus, the missing pulsars also indicate the existence of many such singularities near the Galactic center.</description>

      <title>A Hot Mess: The Rich and Complex Soft Emitting Regions Surrounding the Reflection Dominated Flaring Central Engine of Mrk 1239</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previous X-ray works on Mrk 1239 have revealed a complex Narrow Line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) that exhibits substantial absorption and strong emission from both collisional (CIE) and photoionized (PIE) plasmas. Here, we report on deep-pointed observations with $XMM{\rm -}Newton$ and $NuSTAR$, along with $Swift$ monitoring, to understand the $0.3-30$ keV continuum emission and the central engine geometry. A strong X-ray flare, where the AGN brightens by a factor of five in $\sim30$ ks, is captured between $4-30$ keV and can be attributed to a brightening of the primary continuum. However, the lack of any variability below $\sim3$ keV on long- or short-time scales requires complete absorption of the AGN continuum with a neutral medium of column density $\sim 10^{23.5}{\rm cm}^{-2}$. The timing and spectral properties are consistent with a blurred reflection interpretation for the primary emission. The variability and presence of a Compton hump disfavours ionized partial covering. The neutral absorber, if outflowing, could be crashing into the surrounding medium and ISM to produce the low-energy continuum and CIE. Scattered emission off the inner torus could produce the PIE. The intricate scenario is demanded by the data and highlights the complexity of the environment that is normally invisible when overwhelmed by the AGN continuum. Objects like Mrk 1239 serve as important sources for unveiling the interface between the AGN and host galaxy environments.</description>

      <title>Photon Ring Interferometric Signatures Beyond The Universal Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the interferometric signatures of black hole photon rings beyond the universal regime by perturbatively including the effects of finite ring width. Our approach first slices a thick ring into a series of thin rings, each of which falls within the universal regime. We thus calculate the visibility of the thick ring by aggregating the contributions from each thin ring, and then perturbatively expand the result into polynomials of the baseline length $u$. We show that the visibility amplitude of a thick ring depends on its "center-of-light" diameter; it also includes additional higher-order corrections due to the width of the ring, with the leading correction terms proportional to $u^2$ for the envelope and $u^3$ for the phase. We apply our method to images ray traced from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations and demonstrate that incorporating the higher-order corrections is crucial for accurately modeling the visibility of the first photon ring around M87*.</description>

      <title>Testing gravity with Extreme-Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08085v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme-mass-ratio inspirals consist of binary systems of compact objects, with orders of magnitude differences in their masses, in the regime where the dynamics are driven by gravitational wave emission. The unique nature of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals facilitates the exploration of diverse and stimulating tests related to various aspects of black holes and General Relativity. These tests encompass investigations into the spacetime geometry, the dissipation of the binary system energy and angular momentum, and the impact of the intrinsic non-linear effects of the gravitational interaction. This review accounts for the manifold opportunities for testing General Relativity, ranging from examinations of black hole properties to cosmological and multimessenger tests.</description>

      <title>New sources of ghost fields in $k$-essence theories for black-bounce solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present study, we generalize the possible ghost field configurations within the framework of $k$-essence theory to the Simpson-Visser metric area function $\Sigma^2=x^2+a^2$. Our analysis encompasses field configurations for the region-defined metric function $dA_\pm$ as well as the general solution that asymptotically behaves as Schwarzschild-de Sitter for $x\to-\infty$. Specifically, we investigate two scalar field configurations and define the associated potential for each one. Through rigorous calculations, we verify that all equations of motion are satisfied. Notably, our findings indicate that even when proposing new configurations of ghost scalar fields, the energy conditions remain unchanged. This result serves to validate the wormhole solutions obtained in previous studies.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Guiding-Center Motion: Action Principle, Kinetic Theory, and Hydrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We treat the guiding-center dynamics in a non-uniform external Maxwell field using a manifestly Lorentz covariant action principle which easily reproduces the known Vandervoort equations of motion. We derive the corresponding kinetic theory and ideal hydrodynamic theory. In contrast to conventional five-equation hydrodynamics, the guiding-center hydrodynamics needs only three equations due to a constraint on the motion across magnetic field. We argue that this hydrodynamics applies more generally than the kinetic theory, e.g., for strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>A JVLA, LOFAR, e-Merlin, VLBA and EVN study of RBS 797: can binary SMBHs explain the outburst history of the central radio galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a multi-frequency (144 MHz - 9 GHz) and multi-scale (5 pc - 50 kpc) investigation of the central radio galaxy in RBS 797, by means of JVLA, LOFAR (with international stations), e-Merlin, VLBA and EVN data. We investigate the morphological and spectral properties of the radio lobes, the jets, and the active core. We confirm the co-spatiality of the radio lobes with the four perpendicular X-ray cavities (see arXiv:2111.03679). The radiative ages of the E-W lobes ($31.4\pm6.6$ Myr) and of the N-S lobes ($32.1\pm9.9$ Myr) support a coeval origin of the perpendicular outbursts, that also have similar active phase duration ($\sim$12 Myr). For the inner N-S jets (on scales of $\leq10$ kpc), we (a) confirm the S-shaped jet morphology; (b) show the presence of two hotspots per jet with a similar spectral index; (c) estimate the age of the twisting jets to be less than $\sim8$ Myr. Based on these results, we determine that jet precession, with period $\sim$9 Myr, half-opening angle $\sim$24$^{\circ}$ and jet speed $\sim$0.01$c$, can explain the properties of the N-S jets. We also find that the synchrotron injection index has steepened from the large, older outbursts ($\Gamma\sim0.5$) to the younger S-shaped jets ($\Gamma\sim0.9$), possibly due to a transition from an FR I-like to an FR II-like activity. The VLBI data reveal a single, compact core at the heart of RBS 797, surrounded by extended radio emission whose orientation depends on the spatial scale sampled by the data. We explore several engine-based scenarios to explain these results. Piecing together the available evidence, we argue that RBS 797 likely hosts (or hosted) binary active SMBHs. This is still consistent with the detection of a single component in the VLBI data, since the predicted separation of the binary SMBHs ($\leq$0.6 pc) is an order of magnitude smaller than the resolution of the available radio data (5 pc).</description>

      <title>Superconducting multi-vortices and a novel BPS bound in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We derive a novel BPS bound from chiral perturbation theory minimally coupled to electrodynamics at finite isospin chemical potential. At a critical value of the isospin chemical potential, a system of three first-order differential field equations (which implies the second-order field equations) for the gauge field and the hadronic profile can be derived from the requirement to saturate the bound. These BPS configurations represent magnetic multi-vortices with quantized flux supported by a superconducting current. The corresponding topological charge density is related to the magnetic flux density, but is screened by the hadronic profile. Such a screening effect allows to derive the maximal value of the magnetic field generated by these BPS magnetic vortices, being $B_{max}=2,04 \times 10^{14}G$. The solution for a single BPS vortex is discussed in detail, and some physical consequences, together with the comparison with the magnetic vortices in the Ginzburg-Landau theory at critical coupling, are described.</description>

      <title>Orbital motion of primordial black holes crossing Solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical objects that could have originated from density fluctuations in a very early phase of our Universe. Recent observations restrict the masses that such PBHs could have, if they are to constitute all of dark matter today: $10^{17} \, {\rm g} \leq m \leq 10^{23} \, {\rm g}$. With such low masses, general relativity predicts that the corresponding radii for the PBHs would be atomic or subatomic in size. When captured by a star, such a tiny PBH could exhibit an orbit completely or partially inside the body of the star, without significantly changing its mass for quite a long time. Here we examine the possible trajectories of a PBH that is captured by a Sun-like star. When in motion in the interior of the star, the amount of stellar mass that effectively interacts with the PBH will be a function of its distance to the center of the star. As a consequence, a strong effect on the shape of the orbits emerges, leading to PBH trajectories that could be open or closed, and exhibiting a rich variety of patterns.</description>

      <title>On the single versus the repetitive Penrose process in a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extracting the rotational energy from a Kerr black hole (BH) is one of the crucial topics in relativistic astrophysics. Here, we give special attention to the Penrose ballistic process based on the fission of a massive particle $\mu_0$ into two particles $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$, occurring in the ergosphere of a Kerr BH. Bardeen et al. indicated that for the process to occur, some additional "{\it hydrodynamical forces or superstrong radiation reactions}" were needed. This idea was further expanded by Wald and Chandrasekhar. This animosity convinced T. Piran and collaborators to move from a simple three-body system characterizing the original Penrose process to a many-body system. This many-body approach was further largely expanded by others, introducing additional processes, some questionable in their validity. In this letter, we return to the simplest original Penrose process and show that the solution of the equations of motion, imposing the turning point condition on their trajectories, leads to the rotational energy extraction from the BH expected by Penrose. The efficiency of energy extraction by a single process is precisely quantified for three different single decay processes occurring respectively at $r=1.2 M$, $r=1.5 M$, and $r=1.9 M$. An interesting repetitive model has been proposed by Misner, Thorne \&amp; Wheeler. Indeed, it would appear that a repetitive sequence of $246$ decays of the above injection process at $r=1.2 M$ and the corresponding ones at $r=1.5 M$ and $r=1.9 M$ could extract $100\%$ of the rotational energy of the BH. The accompanying paper shows that accounting for the irreducible mass introduces a non-linear approach that avoids violating energy conservation, leading to new energy extraction processes and demonstrating the impossibility of extracting the whole BH rotational energy by a sequence of Penrose processes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent observations of the galactic center of the M87 galaxy have made the field of observing black holes and calculating its shadow much more intriguing. Approaching the question of calculating shadows, many approximations are made in order to simplify the equations which makes the considered case less realistic. Understanding the shadow of different singularities under the influence of magnetic field is of more importance astrophysically as the accreting matter around the singularity would generate electromagnetic fields as it would be in plasma state due to the high tidal effects. Here, we use Ernst technique to immerse spacetimes in uniform, sourceless and asymptotic magnetic field. Later, we compare the effective potential of null geodesics in magnetized and non-magnetized cases. This study would be helpful in understanding the M87 shadow and the forthcoming image of shadow of SagA*.</description>

      <title>$\gamma$ rays from in-flight positron annihilation as a probe of new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\gamma$ ray emission originating from in-flight annihilation (IA) of positrons is a powerful observable for constraining high-energy positron production from exotic sources. By comparing diffuse $\gamma$ ray observations of INTEGRAL, COMPTEL and EGRET to theoretical predictions, we set the most stringent constraints on electrophilic feebly interacting particles (FIPs), thereby proving IA as a valuable probe of new physics. In particular, we extensively discuss the case of MeV-scale sterile neutrinos, where IA sets the most stringent constraints, excluding $|U_{\mu4}|^{2} \gtrsim 10^{-13}$ and $|U_{\tau4}|^{2} \gtrsim 2\times 10^{-13}$ for sterile neutrinos mixed with $\mu$ and $\tau$ neutrinos respectively. These constraints improve existing limits by more than an order of magnitude. We briefly discuss the application of these results to a host of exotic positron sources such as dark photons, axion-like particles, primordial black holes (PBHs) and sub-GeV dark matter (DM).</description>

Abstract: Many galaxies contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs), whose formation and history raise many puzzles. Pulsar timing arrays have recently discovered a low-frequency cosmological "hum" of gravitational waves that may be emitted by SMBH binary systems, and the JWST and other telescopes have discovered an unexpectedly large population of high-redshift SMBHs. We argue that these two discoveries may be linked, and that they may enhance the prospects for measuring gravitational waves emitted during the mergers of massive black holes, thereby opening the way towards resolving many puzzles about SMBHs as well as providing new opportunities to probe general relativity.</description>

      <title>Degeneracy Enhancement of Neutron-Antineutron Oscillation in Neutron Star</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the fermion oscillation in a degenerate environment. The direct consequence is introducing a Pauli blocking factor $1 - f_i$, where $f_i$ is the phase space distribution function, for each intermediate mass eigenstate during propagation. It is then much easier for a state with larger existing fraction or density to oscillate into other states with less degeneracy while the reversed process is not enhanced. This can significantly modify the oscillation behaviors. We apply this degenerate fermion oscillation to a concrete scenario of neutron-antineutron oscillation in neutron star. It turns out antineutrons receive a standing fraction to annihilate with the environmental neutrons. The subsequent neutron star heating can put an extremely stringent bound on the baryon number violating cross mass term between neutron and antineutron.</description>

      <title>The evolution of stellar X-ray activity and angular momentum as seen by eROSITA, TESS, and Gaia</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have assembled a sample of $\sim$8200 stars with spectral types F5V-M5V, all having directly measured X-ray luminosities from eROSITA and rotation periods from TESS, and having empirically estimated ages via their membership in stellar clusters and groups identified in Gaia astrometry (ages 3-500 Myr). This is the largest such study sample yet assembled for the purpose of empirically constraining the evolution of rotationally driven stellar X-ray activity. We observe rotation-age-activity correlations that are qualitatively as expected: stars of a given spectral type spin down with age and they become less X-ray active as they do so. We provide simple functional representations of these empirical relationships that predict X-ray luminosity from basic observables to within 0.3 dex. Interestingly, we find that the rotation-activity relationship is far simpler and more monotonic in form when expressed in terms of stellar angular momentum instead of rotation period. We discuss how this finding may relate to the long-established idea that rotation-activity relationships are mediated by stellar structure (e.g., convective turnover time, surface area). Finally, we provide an empirical relation that predicts stellar angular momentum from basic observables, and without requiring a direct measurement of stellar rotation, to within 0.5 dex.</description>

Abstract: With the direct discovery of gravitational waves, black holes have regain interest in the recent years. In particular primordial black holes (PBHs), which originate from the very early Universe, may constitute (at least in part) dark matter. The possibility that dark matter is made of black holes is particularly appealing, and multi-messenger searches are important to probe this hypothesis. In this paper I will discuss the concept of primordial black holes, their origins, their characteristics and the current constraints. In addition I will explain that the study of black holes is of utmost interest since they may constitute portals to new physics and to quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Improving pulsar timing precision through superior Time-of-Arrival creation</title>

Abstract: The measurement of pulsar pulse times-of-arrival (ToAs) is a crucial step in detecting low-frequency gravitational waves. To determine ToAs, we can use template-matching to compare each observed pulse profile with a standard template. However, using different combinations of templates and template-matching methods (TMMs) without careful consideration may lead to inconsistent results. In pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments, distinct ToAs from the same observations can be obtained, due to the use of diverse templates and TMMs. In other words, employing diverse approaches can yield different timing results and would thus have a significant impact on subsequent gravitational wave searches. In this paper, we examine several commonly used combinations to analyze their effect on pulse ToAs. we evaluate the potential impact of template and TMM selection on thirteen typical millisecond pulsars within the European PTA. We employ pulsar timing methods, specifically the root mean square and reduced chi-square $\chi_r^2$ of the residuals of the best timing solution to assess the outcomes. Additionally, we evaluate the system-limited noise floor (SLNF) for each pulsar at various telescopes operating around 1.4~GHz using frequency-resolved templates.
  Our findings suggest that utilizing data-derived and smoothed templates in conjunction with the Fourier-domain with Markov-chain Monte Carlo (FDM) TMM is generally the most effective approach, though there may be exceptions that require further attention. Furthermore, we determine that pulse phase jitter noise does not significantly limit the current precision of the European PTA's timing, as jitter levels derived from other studies are much smaller than the SLNF.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array V. Search for continuous gravitational wave signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16226v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for continuous gravitational wave signals (CGWs) in the second data release (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) collaboration. The most significant candidate event from this search has a gravitational wave frequency of 4-5 nHz. Such a signal could be generated by a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the local Universe. We present the results of a follow-up analysis of this candidate using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The Bayesian analysis gives a Bayes factor of 4 in favor of the presence of the CGW over a common uncorrelated noise process, while the frequentist analysis estimates the p-value of the candidate to be 1%, also assuming the presence of common uncorrelated red noise. However, comparing a model that includes both a CGW and a gravitational wave background (GWB) to a GWB only, the Bayes factor in favour of the CGW model is only 0.7. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the origin of the observed feature, but we cannot rule it out as a CGW source. We present results of simulations that demonstrate that data containing a weak gravitational wave background can be misinterpreted as data including a CGW and vice versa, providing two plausible explanations of the EPTA DR2 data. Further investigations combining data from all PTA collaborations will be needed to reveal the true origin of this feature.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Gamma-Ray Burst Jet Collimation on Black Hole Spin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-Ray Bursts are the most luminous events in the Universe, and are excellent laboratories to study extreme physical phenomena in the cosmos. Despite a long trajectory of progress in understanding these highly energetic events, there are still many observed features that are yet to be fully explained. Observations of the jet opening angle of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) suggest that LGRB jets are narrower for those GRBs at higher redshift. This phenomenon has been explained in the context of collimation by the stellar envelope, with denser (lower metallicity) stars at higher redshifts able to collimate the jet more effectively. However, until now, the dependence of jet opening angle on the properties of the central engine has not been explored. We investigate the effect of black hole spin on the jet collimation angle for a magnetically launched jet, using the General Relativistic Radiation Magnetohydrodynamical (GRRMHD) code \nubhlight. We present 3D results for a range of spin values. The simulations show that higher spinning black holes tend to create narrower jets. If indeed LGRB progenitors in the early universe are able to produce black hole central engines with higher spin, this could account for at least some of the observed jet opening angle-redshift correlation.</description>

      <title>The physical origin of the periodic activity for FRB 20180916B</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16307v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are transient radio signals with millisecond-duration, large dispersion measure (DM) and extremely high brightness temperature. Among them, FRB 20180916B has been found to have a 16-day periodically modulated activity. However, the physical origin of the periodicity is still a mystery. Here, we utilize the comprehensive observational data to diagnose the periodic models. We find that the ultra-long rotation model is the most probable one for the periodic activity. However, this model cannot reproduce the observed rotation measure (RM) variations. We propose a self-consistent model, i.e., a massive star binary containing a slowly rotational neutron star and a massive star with large mass loss, which can naturally accommodate the wealth of observational features for FRB 20180916B. In this model, the RM variation is periodic, which can be tested by future observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multiwavelength observations have revealed that dense, confined circumstellar material (CCSM) commonly exists in the vicinity of supernova (SN) progenitors, suggesting enhanced mass losses years to centuries before their core collapse. Interacting SNe, which are powered or aided by interaction with the CCSM, are considered to be promising high-energy multimessenger transient sources. We present detailed results of broadband electromagnetic emission, following the time-dependent model proposed in the previous work on high-energy SN neutrinos [K. Murase, New prospects for detecting high-energy neutrinos from nearby supernovae, Phys. Rev. D 97, 081301(R) (2018)]. We investigate electromagnetic cascades in the presence of Coulomb losses, including inverse-Compton and synchrotron components that significantly contribute to MeV and high-frequency radio bands, respectively. We also discuss the application to SN 2023ixf.</description>

      <title>Near- and sub-solar-mass naked singularities and black holes from transmutation of white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08462v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave events have suggested the existence of near-solar-mass black holes which cannot be formed via stellar evolution. This has opened up a tantalizing possibility of future detections of both black holes and naked singularities in this mass range. Existence of naked singularities is a topical and fundamental physics issue, but their formation mechanism is not yet clear. Here, we show that some white dwarfs can realistically transmute into black holes and naked singularities with a wide range of near- and sub-solar-mass values by capturing asymmetric or non-self-annihilating primordial dark matter (PDM) particles. We argue that, while a type Ia supernova due to the accumulation of dark matter at the core of a white dwarf could also be a possibility, the transmutation of a white dwarf into a black hole or a naked singularity is a viable consequence of the capture of non-self-annihilating PDM particles. These white dwarf transmutations can have a significant role in probing the physics of dark matter and compact objects, and could be tested using the rates and locations of mergers over the cosmological time scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Models of accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) find vast applications in high-energy astrophysics. The broad strategy is to parametrize some of the key disc properties such as gas density and temperature as a function of the radial coordinate from a given set of assumptions on the underlying physics. Two of the most popular approaches in this context were presented by Sirko &amp; Goodman (2003) and Thompson et al. (2005). We present a critical reanalysis of these widely used models, detailing their assumptions and clarifying some steps in their derivation that were previously left unsaid. Our findings are implemented in the pAGN module for the Python programming language, which is the first public implementation of these accretion-disc models. We further apply pAGN to the evolution of stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN discs, addressing the potential occurrence of migration traps.</description>

Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>

Abstract: We present the discovery, with the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER), that SRGA J144459.2-604207 is a 447.9 Hz accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP), which underwent a four-week long outburst starting on 2024 February 15. The AMXP resides in a 5.22 hr binary, orbiting a low-mass companion donor with $M_d&gt;0.1M_\odot$. We report on the temporal and spectral properties from NICER observations during the early days of the outburst, from 2024 February 21 through 2024 February 23, during which NICER also detected a type-I X-ray burst that exhibited a plateau lasting ~6 s. The spectra of the persistent emission were well described by an absorbed thermal blackbody and power-law model, with blackbody temperature $kT\approx0.9{\rm\,keV}$ and power-law photon index $\Gamma\approx1.9$. Time-resolved burst spectroscopy confirmed the thermonuclear nature of the burst, where an additional blackbody component reached a maximum temperature of nearly $kT\approx3{\rm\,keV}$ at the peak of the burst. We discuss the nature of the companion as well as the type-I X-ray burst.</description>

Abstract: The millihertz gravitational wave band is expected to be opened by space-borne detectors like TianQin. Various mechanisms can produce short outbursts of gravitational waves, whose actual waveform can be hard to model. In order to identify such gravitational wave bursts and not to misclassify them as noise transients, we proposed a proof-of-principle energy excess method, that utilized the signal-insensitive channel to veto noise transients. We perform a test on simulated data, and for bursts with a signal-to-noise ratio of 20, even with the contamination of noise transient, our methods can reach a detection efficiency of 97.4% under a false alarm rate of once per year. However, more frequent occurrences of noise transients would lower the detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Astronomical Image Blurring from Transversely Correlated Quantum Gravity Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations in spacetime can, in some cases, lead to distortion in astronomical images of faraway objects. In particular, a stochastic model of quantum gravity predicts an accumulated fluctuation in the path length $\Delta L$ with variance $\langle \Delta L^2\rangle\sim l_pL$ over a distance $L$, similar to a random walk, and assuming no spatial correlation above length $l_p$; it has been argued that such an effect is ruled out by observation of sharp images from distant stars. However, in other theories, such as the pixellon (modeled on the Verlinde-Zurek (VZ) effect), quantum fluctuations can still accumulate as in the random walk model while simultaneously having large distance correlations in the fluctuations. Using renormalization by analytic continuation, we derive the correlation transverse to the light propagation, and show that image distortion effects in the pixellon model are strongly suppressed in comparison to the random walk model, thus evading all existing and future constraints. We also find that the diffraction of light rays does not lead to qualitative changes in the blurring effect.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves carry information beyond effective spin parameters but it is hard to extract</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave observations of binary black hole mergers probe their astrophysical origins via the binary spin, namely the spin magnitudes and directions of each component black hole, together described by six degrees of freedom. However, the emitted signals primarily depend on two effective spin parameters that condense the spin degrees of freedom to those parallel and those perpendicular to the orbital plane. Given this reduction in dimensionality between the physically relevant problem and what is typically measurable, we revisit the question of whether information about the component spin magnitudes and directions can successfully be recovered via gravitational-wave observations, or if we simply extrapolate information about the distributions of effective spin parameters. To this end, we simulate three astrophysical populations with the same underlying effective-spin distribution but different spin magnitude and tilt distributions, on which we conduct full individual-event and population-level parameter estimation. We find that parameterized population models can indeed qualitatively distinguish between populations with different spin magnitude and tilt distributions at current sensitivity. However, it remains challenging to either accurately recover the true distribution or to diagnose biases due to model misspecification. We attribute the former to practical challenges of dealing with high-dimensional posterior distributions, and the latter to the fact that each individual event carries very little information about the full six spin degrees of freedom.</description>

Abstract: Gravitational-wave observations provide the unique opportunity of studying black hole formation channels and histories -- but only if we can identify their origin. One such formation mechanism is the dynamical synthesis of black hole binaries in dense stellar systems. Given the expected isotropic distribution of component spins of binary black hole in gas-free dynamical environments, the presence of anti-aligned or in-plane spins with respect to the orbital angular momentum is considered a tell-tale sign of a merger's dynamical origin. Even in the scenario where birth spins of black holes are low, hierarchical mergers attain large component spins due to the orbital angular momentum of the prior merger. However, measuring such spin configurations is difficult. Here, we quantify the efficacy of the spin parameters encoding aligned-spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) and in-plane spin ($\chi_{\rm p}$) at classifying such hierarchical systems. Using Monte Carlo cluster simulations to generate a realistic distribution of hierarchical merger parameters from globular clusters, we can infer mergers' $\chi_{\rm eff}$ and $\chi_{rm p}$. The cluster populations are simulated using Advanced LIGO-Virgo sensitivity during the detector network's third observing period and projections for design sensitivity. Using a "likelihood-ratio"-based statistic, we find that $\sim2\%$ of the recovered population by the current gravitational-wave detector network has a statistically significant $\chi_{\rm p}$ measurement, whereas no $\chi_{\rm eff}$ measurement was capable of confidently determining a system to be anti-aligned with the orbital angular momentum at current detector sensitivities. These results indicate that measuring spin-precession through $\chi_{\rm p}$ is a more detectable signature of a hierarchical mergers and dynamical formation than anti-aligned spins.</description>

      <title>Gaia's binary star renaissance</title>

Abstract: Stellar multiplicity is among the oldest and richest problems in astrophysics. Binary stars are a cornerstone of stellar mass and radius measurements that underpin modern stellar evolutionary models. Binaries are the progenitors of many of the most interesting and exotic astrophysical phenomena, ranging from type Ia supernovae to gamma ray bursts, hypervelocity stars, and most detectable stellar black holes. They are also ubiquitous, accounting for about half of all stars in the Universe. In the era of gravitational waves, wide-field surveys, and open-source stellar models, binaries are coming back stronger than a nineties trend. Much of the progress in the last decade has been enabled by the Gaia mission, which provides high-precision astrometry for more than a billion stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia data probe a wider range of binary separations and mass ratios than most previous surveys, enabling both an improved binary population census and discovery of rare objects. I summarize recent results in the study of binary stars brought about by Gaia, focusing in particular on developments related to wide ($a \gtrsim 100$ au) binaries, evidence of binarity from astrometric noise and proper motion anomaly, astrometric and radial velocity orbits from Gaia DR3, and binaries containing non-accreting compact objects. Limitations of the Gaia data, the importance of ground-based follow-up, and anticipated improvements with Gaia DR4 are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Connection formulae in the Collision Limit I: Case Studies in Lifshitz Geometry</title>

Abstract: The connection formulae provide a systematic way to compute physical quantities, such as the quasinormal modes, Green functions, in blackhole perturbation theories. In this work, we test whether it is possible to consistently take the collision limit, which bring two or more regular singularities into an irregular one, of the connection formulae, and we provide some supportive evidence for it.</description>

      <title>The miniJPAS Survey: The radial distribution of star formation rates in faint X-ray active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06010v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the impact of black hole nuclear activity on both the global and radial star formation rate (SFR) profiles in X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the field of miniJPAS, the precursor of the much wider J-PAS project. Our sample includes 32 AGN with z &lt; 0.3 detected via the XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys. For comparison, we assembled a control sample of 71 star-forming (SF) galaxies with similar magnitudes, sizes, and redshifts.
  To derive the global properties of both the AGN and the control SF sample, we used CIGALE to fit the spectral energy distributions derived from the 56 narrowband and 4 broadband filters from miniJPAS. We find that AGN tend to reside in more massive galaxies than their SF counterparts. After matching samples based on stellar mass and comparing their SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs), no significant differences appear. This suggests that the presence of AGN does not strongly influence overall star formation.
  However, when we used miniJPAS as an integral field unit (IFU) to dissect galaxies along their position angle, a different picture emerges. We find that AGN tend to be more centrally concentrated in mass with respect to SF galaxies. Moreover, we find a suppression of the sSFR up to 1Re and then an enhancement beyond 1Re , strongly contrasting with the decreasing radial profile of sSFRs in SF galaxies. This could point to an inside-out quenching of AGN host galaxies. These findings suggest that the reason we do not see differences on a global scale is because star formation is suppressed in the central regions and enhanced in the outer regions of AGN host galaxies. While limited in terms of sample size, this work highlights the potential of the upcoming J-PAS as a wide-field low-resolution IFU for thousands of nearby galaxies and AGN.</description>
