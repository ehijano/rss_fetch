      <title>Universal trimers with p-wave interactions and the faux-Efimov effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An unusual class of $p$-wave universal trimers with symmetry $L^{\Pi}=1^{\pm}$ is identified, for both a two-component fermionic trimer with $s$- and $p$-wave scattering length close to unitarity and for a one-component fermionic trimer at $p$-wave unitarity. Moreover, fermionic trimers made of atoms with two internal spin components are found for $L^{\Pi}=1^{\pm}$, when the $p$-wave interaction between spin-up and spin-down fermions is close to unitarity and/or when the interaction between two spin-up fermions is close to the $p$-wave unitary limit. The universality of these $p$-wave universal trimers is tested here by considering van der Waals interactions in a Lennard-Jones potential with different numbers of two-body bound states; our calculations also determine the value of the scattering volume or length where the trimer state hits zero energy and can be observed as a recombination resonance. The faux-Efimov effect appears with trimer symmetry $L^{\Pi}=1^{-}$ when the two fermion interactions are close to $p$-wave unitarity and the lowest $1/R^2$ coefficient gets modified, thereby altering the usual Wigner threshold law for inelastic processes involving 3-body continuum channels.</description>

      <title>Application of the Variational R-matrix Method for the Dirac Equation to the Be Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an implementation of the non-iterative eigenchannel R-matrix method for the Dirac equation. It includes a brief introduction, implementation details, and results for the photoionization cross-section of the beryllium atom. Beryllium is a convenient test due to small but significant relativistic effects. The current calculation aligns with other R-matrix calculations and experiments. It observes the change in the Fano line shape of the (2pnd)1P series and, reveals a previously unnoticed coupling between triplet and singlet series observable in the ground state photoionization cross-section.</description>

      <title>Low frequency communication based on Rydberg-atom receiver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low frequency communication has a wide range of applications in the fields of satellite detection, underground mining, disaster relief. Rydberg atom sensor has rapidly developed in recent years, capitalizing on its calibration-free SI-traceability, large polarizabilities and transition dipole moments. A Rydberg atom sensor is capable of sensitively detecting electric field signals from DC to THz. In this work, we demonstrate low frequency communication using Rydberg atoms in a vapor cell with two parallel electrode plates inside. Three modulations, BPSK, OOK, and 2FSK, are used for the communication by Rydberg atom receiver near 100kHz. We have measured the SNR of the modulated low frequency signal received by Rydberg atoms at various emission voltages. Meanwhile, we have demonstrated IQ constellation diagram, EVM and eye diagram of the demodulated signal at different symbol rate. The EVM is measured to be 8.8% when the symbol rate is 2Kbps, 9.4% when the symbol rate is 4Kbps, and 13.7% when the symbol rate is 8Kbps. The high-fidelity digital color image transmission resulted in a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 70dB. This study proves that Rydberg-atom receiver can finely work in low frequency communication.</description>

      <title>Recent advancements in atomic many-body methods for high-precision studies of isotope shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of atomic many-body methods, capable of incorporating electron correlation effects accurately, is required for isotope shift (IS) studies. In combination with precise measurements, such calculations help to extract nuclear charge radii differences, and to probe for signatures of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. We review here a few recently-developed methods in the relativistic many-body perturbation theory (RMBPT) and relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory frameworks for calculations of IS factors in the highly charged ions (HCIs), and neutral or singly-charged ions, respectively. The results are presented for a wide range of atomic systems in order to demonstrate the interplay between quantum electrodynamics (QED) and electron correlation effects. In view of this, we start our discussions with the RMBPT calculations for a few HCIs by rigorously treating QED effects; then we outline methods to calculate IS factors in the one-valence atomic systems using two formulations of the RCC approach. Then we present calculations for two valence atomic systems, by employing the Fock-space RCC methods. For completeness, we briefly discuss theoretical input required for the upcoming experiments, their possibilities to probe nuclear properties and implications to fundamental physics studies.</description>

      <title>Stopping of very heavy ions in Mylar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Available experimental data on Mylar stopping powers (SPs) for heavy ions (HIs) at energies 0.04 &lt; E/A &lt; 15 MeV/nucleon have been compared to different semi-empirical model calculations with the aim of their possible usage for the estimates of ranges for very heavy ions at E/A &lt; 0.5 MeV/nucleon, which are of practical interest. Significant deviations from the calculated SP values were found for fission fragments and lighter HIs at E/A &lt; 1 MeV/nucleon. A new model parameterization for Mylar SP has been proposed. Range estimates obtained with any SP model calculation show a critical dependence of their mean values on the approximated electronic stopping powers and the nuclear (collisional) SP component. The last plays a crucial role at the end of the range and could only be obtained by calculations. Practical applicability of the results of investigation for very heavy evaporation residues (products of complete fusion reactions induced by HIs) implies the use of a thick catcher foil corresponding to the largest ranges derived in the estimates or the range measurements for these products.</description>

      <title>Isotope-Selective Strong Field Ionization of Semi-Heavy Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-heavy water (HOD) is one of the simplest molecules in which the bonds are labelled by isotope. We demonstrate that a pair of intense few-femtosecond infrared laser pulses can be used to selectively tunnel ionize along one of the two bonds. The first pulse doubly ionizes HOD, inducing rapid bond stretching and unbending. Femtoseconds later, the second pulse arrives and further ionization is selectively enhanced along the OH bond. These conclusions arise from 3D time-resolved measurements of H$^+$, D$^+$, and O$^+$ momenta following triple ionization.</description>

      <title>Optical Two-Tone Time Transfer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09290v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sub-picosecond timing synchronization can enable future optical timekeeping networks, including coherent phased array radar imaging at GHz levels, intercontinental clock comparisons for the redefinition of the second, chronometric leveling, and synchronization of remote assets, including future satellite-based optical time standards. With optical clocks now operating on mobile platforms, free-space synchronization networks with compatible performance and the ability to operate under platform motion are essential to expand the reach of precision timing. Recently, femtosecond (fs)-level optical time-transfer techniques have been developed that can operate over hundreds of kilometers despite atmospheric turbulence, signal fade, and dropouts. Here we report a two-tone optical time transfer scheme with comparable performance that reduces hardware requirements and can support both fiber and free-space networks. Using this technique, sub-fs synchronization was demonstrated over a $\sim$100 m free-space link for several hours. In addition, the link was used to syntonize two iodine optical clocks and then compare them over four days. The set-up employs an integrated photonics transceiver and telecom-band lasers that are compatible with full photonic integration.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of a superradiance-sideband-assisted laser with a zero frequency pulling and a narrow linewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerical simulations based on the quantum Langevin equations have been performed for a large number of two-level atoms in a beam interacting with a low-Q cavity with the atomic initial superposition states close to the north pole of the Bloch sphere. When the pump Rabi frequency was modulated at $\Delta_{pa}$ with zero pump-atom detuning for various cavity-atom detunings, we obtained a lasing peak at the atomic resonance and superradiant lasing peaks at $\pm\Delta_{pa}$ simultaneously while the central peak exhibiting a zero frequency pulling coefficient. The linewidth of the central peak was reduced beyond the gain narrowing as the mean number of atoms was increased, resulting in a minimum linewidth as small as a millionth of the atomic or cavity linewdith. A pump carrier detuning caused asymmetric heights for the side superradiant peaks, the height difference of which can be used to lock the pump laser to the atom within the linewidth of the central lasing peak. Our results may lead to development of a new type of ultra-stable active optical clocks for future frequency standards when applied to proper atomic systems.</description>

      <title>On the non-Markovian quantum control dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09637v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study both open-loop control and closed-loop measurement feedback control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics resulting from the interaction between a quantum system and its environment. We use the widely studied cavity quantum electrodynamics (cavity-QED) system as an example, where an atom interacts with the environment composed of a collection of oscillators. In this scenario, the stochastic interactions between the atom and the environment can introduce non-Markovian characteristics into the evolution of quantum states, differing from the conventional Markovian dynamics observed in open quantum systems. As a result, the atom's decay rate to the environment varies with time and can be described by nonlinear equations. The solutions to these nonlinear equations can be analyzed in terms of the stability of a nonlinear control system. Consequently, the evolution of quantum state amplitudes follows linear time-varying equations as a result of the non-Markovian quantum transient process. Additionally, by using measurement feedback through homodyne detection of the cavity output, we can modulate the steady atomic and photonic states in the non-Markovian process. When multiple coupled cavity-QED systems are involved, measurement-based feedback control can influence the dynamics of high-dimensional quantum states, as well as the resulting stable and unstable subspaces.</description>

      <title>Optically pumped vector magnetometer using a strong bias magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach allowing an optically pumped magnetometer (OPM) to be operated within Earth's magnetic field as a vector magnetometer whose sensitive axis can be freely defined. This approach enables the measurement of any vector component of the Earth's magnetic field with the same sensitivity. The OPM is realized by a microfabricated cesium vapor cell with nitrogen buffer gas, which is immersed into a homogeneous bias field of about 730 $\mathrm{\mu T}$. Since this bias field is about one order of magnitude stronger than Earth's magnetic field, it defines the sensitive axis of the OPM. The bias field is generated by solid-state magnets and was designed to exhibit a very low relative inhomogeneity ($&lt; 10^{-4}$ in relative units) within the vapor cell dimensions as well as a point of vanishing temperature dependence at around 40{\deg}C. The OPM utilizes the light narrowing effect, which enables effective suppression of spin-exchange relaxation even in such large magnetic field amplitude. Based on this implementation, we demonstrate a white noise floor of below 60 $\mathrm{fT/\sqrt{Hz}}$ in the interval between 100 Hz and 600 Hz and a sensor bandwidth of $&gt; 2$ kHz. Our approach enables unshielded ultrasensitive vectorial measurement capabilities relevant in many important applications.</description>

      <title>Realization of Landau-Zener Rabi Oscillations on optical lattice clock</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Manipulating quantum states is at the heart of quantum information processing and quantum metrology. Landau-Zener Rabi oscillation (LZRO), which arises from a quantum two-level system swept repeatedly across the avoided crossing point in the time domain, has been suggested for widespread use in manipulating quantum states. Cold atom is one of the most prominent platforms for quantum computing and precision measurement. However, LZRO has never been observed in cold atoms due to its stringent requirements. By compensating for the linear drift of the clock laser and optimizing experimental parameters, we successfully measured LZRO on the strontium atomic optical clock platform under both fast and slow passage limits within $4$ to $6$ driving periods. Compared to previous results on other platforms, the duration of the plateau is $10^4$ times longer in the optical lattice clock. The experimental data also suggest that destructive Landau-Zener interference can effectively suppress dephasing effects in the optical lattice clock, paving the way for manipulating quantum states against various environmental effects in cold atomic systems.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Four-Wave Mixing in Rydberg Atoms for Microwave-Optical Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a numerical and analytical investigation of microwave-to-optical conversion based on four-wave mixing in Rydberg atoms. Our work demonstrates that both all-resonant and off-resonant frequency-mixing configurations achieve near-unit photon conversion efficiencies. We review the conditions that can lead to the presence of two possible dark states. We find that for both configurations, one of the dark states can be detrimental at high microwave powers, and show that an additional limitation to all-resonant frequency mixing is microwave-induced fluorescence. Finally, we confirm that the off-resonant configuration is more appropriate as it allows for efficient photon conversion on a wider range of input microwave intensities with reduced total power of the auxiliary fields.</description>

Abstract: Coherent dynamics of interacting quantum particles plays a central role in the study of strongly correlated quantum matter and the pursuit of quantum information processors. Here, we present the state-space of interacting Rydberg atoms as a synthetic landscape on which to control and observe coherent and correlated dynamics. With full control of the coupling strengths and energy offsets between the pairs of sites in a nine-site synthetic lattice, we realize quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and dynamics in an Escher-type "continuous staircase". In the interacting regime, we observe correlated quantum walks, Bloch oscillations, and confinement of particle pairs. Additionally, we simultaneously tilt our lattice both up and down to achieve coherent pair oscillations. When combined with a few straightforward upgrades, this work establishes synthetic Rydberg lattices of interacting atom arrays as a promising platform for programmable quantum many-body dynamics with access to features that are difficult to realize in real-space lattices.</description>

Abstract: The hydrogen atom perturbed by a constant 1-dimensional weak quadratic potential $\lambda z^2$ is solved at first-order perturbation theory using the eigenstates of the total angular momentum operator - the coupled basis. Physical applications of this result could be found, for example, in the study of a quadratic Zeeman effect weaker than fine-structure effects, or in a perturbation caused by instantaneous generalised van der Waals interactions.</description>

      <title>Long-lived metastable-qubit memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coherent storage of quantum information is crucial to many quantum technologies. Long coherence times have been demonstrated in trapped-ion qubits, typically using the hyperfine levels within the ground state of a single ion. However, recent research suggests qubits encoded in metastable states could provide architectural benefits for quantum information processing, such as the possibility of effective dual-species operation in a single-species system and erasure-error conversion for fault-tolerant quantum computing. Here we demonstrate long-lived encoding of a quantum state in the metastable states of a trapped ion. By sympathetically cooling with another ion of the same species and constantly monitoring for erasure errors, we demonstrate a coherence time of 136(42) seconds with a qubit encoded in the metastable $5D_{5/2}$ state of a single $^{137}$Ba$^+$ ion. In agreement with a model based on empirical results from dynamical-decoupling-based noise spectroscopy, we find that dephasing of the metastable levels is the dominant source of error once erasure errors are removed.</description>
