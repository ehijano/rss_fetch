      <title>The Impact of Digitalisation and Sustainability on Inclusiveness: Inclusive Growth Determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inclusiveness and economic development have been slowed by the pandemics and military conflicts. This study investigates the main determinants of inclusiveness at the European level. A multi-method approach is used, with Principal Component Analysis (PCA) applied to create the Inclusiveness Index and Generalised Method of Moments (GMM) analysis used to investigate the determinants of inclusiveness. The data comprises a range of 22 years, from 2000 to 2021, for 32 European countries. The determinants of inclusiveness and their effects were identified. First, economic growth, industrial upgrading, electricity consumption, digitalisation, and the quantitative aspect of governance, all have a positive impact on inclusive growth in Europe. Second, the level of CO2 emissions and inflation have a negative impact on inclusiveness. Tomorrow's inclusive and sustainable growth must include investments in renewable energy, digital infrastructure, inequality policies, sustainable governance, human capital, and inflation management. These findings can help decision makers design inclusive growth policies.</description>

      <title>Assets Forecasting with Feature Engineering and Transformation Methods for LightGBM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations in the stock market rapidly shape the economic world and consumer markets, impacting millions of individuals. Hence, accurately forecasting it is essential for mitigating risks, including those associated with inactivity. Although research shows that hybrid models of Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) yield promising results, their computational requirements often exceed the capabilities of average personal computers, rendering them inaccessible to many. In order to address this challenge in this paper we optimize LightGBM (an efficient implementation of gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDT)) for maximum performance, while maintaining low computational requirements. We introduce novel feature engineering techniques including indicator-price slope ratios and differences of close and open prices divided by the corresponding 14-period Exponential Moving Average (EMA), designed to capture market dynamics and enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, we test seven different feature and target variable transformation methods, including returns, logarithmic returns, EMA ratios and their standardized counterparts as well as EMA difference ratios, so as to identify the most effective ones weighing in both efficiency and accuracy. The results demonstrate Log Returns, Returns and EMA Difference Ratio constitute the best target variable transformation methods, with EMA ratios having a lower percentage of correct directional forecasts, and standardized versions of target variable transformations requiring significantly more training time. Moreover, the introduced features demonstrate high feature importance in predictive performance across all target variable transformation methods. This study highlights an accessible, computationally efficient approach to stock market forecasting using LightGBM, making advanced forecasting techniques more widely attainable.</description>

      <title>Social and Genetic Ties Drive Skewed Cross-Border Media Coverage of Disasters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07615v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters worldwide. Media coverage of these events may be vital to generate empathy and mobilize global populations to address the common threat posed by climate change. Using a dataset of 466 news sources from 123 countries, covering 135 million news articles since 2016, we apply an event study framework to measure cross-border media activity following natural disasters. Our results shows that while media attention rises after disasters, it is heavily skewed towards certain events, notably earthquakes, accidents, and wildfires. In contrast, climatologically salient events such as floods, droughts, or extreme temperatures receive less coverage. This cross-border disaster reporting is strongly related to the number of deaths associated with the event, especially when the affected populations share strong social ties or genetic similarities with those in the reporting country. Achieving more balanced media coverage across different types of natural disasters may be essential to counteract skewed perceptions. Further, fostering closer social connections between countries may enhance empathy and mobilize the resources necessary to confront the global threat of climate change.</description>

      <title>Bridging Root-$n$ and Non-standard Asymptotics: Dimension-agnostic Adaptive Inference in M-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This manuscript studies a general approach to construct confidence sets for the solution of population-level optimization, commonly referred to as M-estimation. Statistical inference for M-estimation poses significant challenges due to the non-standard limiting behaviors of the corresponding estimator, which arise in settings with increasing dimension of parameters, non-smooth objectives, or constraints. We propose a simple and unified method that guarantees validity in both regular and irregular cases. Moreover, we provide a comprehensive width analysis of the proposed confidence set, showing that the convergence rate of the diameter is adaptive to the unknown degree of instance-specific regularity. We apply the proposed method to several high-dimensional and irregular statistical problems.</description>

      <title>Simple Estimation of Semiparametric Models with Measurement Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14311v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a practical way of addressing the Errors-In-Variables (EIV) problem in the Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) framework. We focus on the settings in which the variability of the EIV is a fraction of that of the mismeasured variables, which is typical for empirical applications. For any initial set of moment conditions our approach provides a "corrected" set of moment conditions that are robust to the EIV. We show that the GMM estimator based on these moments is root-n-consistent, with the standard tests and confidence intervals providing valid inference. This is true even when the EIV are so large that naive estimators (that ignore the EIV problem) are heavily biased with their confidence intervals having 0% coverage. Our approach involves no nonparametric estimation, which is especially important for applications with many covariates, and settings with multivariate or non-classical EIV. In particular, the approach makes it easy to use instrumental variables to address EIV in nonlinear models.</description>

      <title>Regression Adjustment for Estimating Distributional Treatment Effects in Randomized Controlled Trials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14074v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the issue of estimating and inferring distributional treatment effects in randomized experiments. The distributional treatment effect provides a more comprehensive understanding of treatment heterogeneity compared to average treatment effects. We propose a regression adjustment method that utilizes distributional regression and pre-treatment information, establishing theoretical efficiency gains without imposing restrictive distributional assumptions. We develop a practical inferential framework and demonstrate its advantages through extensive simulations. Analyzing water conservation policies, our method reveals that behavioral nudges systematically shift consumption from high to moderate levels. Examining health insurance coverage, we show the treatment reduces the probability of zero doctor visits by 6.6 percentage points while increasing the likelihood of 3-6 visits. In both applications, our regression adjustment method substantially improves precision and identifies treatment effects that were statistically insignificant under conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Factorial Difference-in-Differences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.11937v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In many panel data settings, researchers apply the difference-in-differences (DID) estimator, exploiting cross-sectional variation in a baseline factor and temporal variation in exposure to an event affecting all units. However, the exact estimand is often unspecified and the justification for this method remains unclear. This paper formalizes this empirical approach, which we term factorial DID (FDID), as a research design including its data structure, estimands, and identifying assumptions. We frame it as a factorial design with two factors - the baseline factor G and exposure level Z - and define effect modification and causal moderation as the associative and causal effects of G on the effect of Z, respectively. We show that under standard assumptions, including no anticipation and parallel trends, the DID estimator identifies effect modification but not causal moderation. To identify the latter, we propose an additional factorial parallel trends assumption. Moreover, we reconcile canonical DID as a special case of FDID with an additional exclusion restriction and link causal moderation to G's conditional effect with another exclusion restriction. We extend our framework to conditionally valid assumptions, clarify regression-based approaches, and illustrate our findings with an empirical example. We offer practical recommendations for FDID applications.</description>
