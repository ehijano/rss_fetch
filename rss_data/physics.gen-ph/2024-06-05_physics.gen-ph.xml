      <title>Reexamination of the hierarchy problem from a novel geometric perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A lucid interpretation of the longstanding hierarchy problem is proposed based on the unconventional model of the universe recently proposed by the authors. Our heuristic cosmological model is developed by considering Penrose and Petit's original ideas as the Weyl curvature hypothesis, conformal cyclic cosmology, and the twin universe model. The uniqueness of our model lies in its incorporation of dark energy and matter, and its single key parameter, adjusted by observational data, is the radius ($R_{dS}$) of a four-dimensional ($4D$) hypersphere called de Sitter space. We presuppose that our $4D$ universe originated from the spontaneous conformal symmetry (SCS) breaking of a light field with a null distance. We show that in this SCS breaking state, the energy--momentum tensor of the space-like electromagnetic field, whose existence is inevitable for quantum electromagnetic field interactions (Greenberg--Robinson theorem), becomes isomorphic to the divergence-free Einstein tensor in the general theory of relativity. Furthermore, we reveal the $R_{dS}$ dependency of the $4D$ gravitational field. Based on these findings, we show an intriguing relation between the magnitude of the gravitational coupling constant and $R_{dS}$. A solution to the hierarchy problem is derived by assuming that $R_{dS}$ depends on the "newly defined cosmological time".</description>

      <title>Emergence of the wavefunction of a non-relativistic quantum particle from QFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nonrelativistic wavefunction of a quantum state that contains all its information is derived directly from the effective quantum fields of the standard model of particle physics, which are the fundamental elements of reality of the universe unveiled to us so far. Consequently, the endless debate about the reality of a wavefunction can now be reasonably put to rest and nonrelativistic quantum mechanics can cogently be considered as a genuine theory.</description>

      <title>Complexified spinor fields in operator form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.13106v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The formalism of quantum field theory in operator form, based on the anti self-adjoint operators of the imaginary coordinate and momentum and the self-adjoint operators of the real coordinate, momentum, energy and time, is used in considerations of the spinor fields and related topics. The unitary representation of the Lorentz boosts in the spin-orbital space is given. The operators that mirror-reflect the spin are introduced and then used in discussion of the spin parity. The conclusion that the spin is odd is used in the analyze of the parity violation in the cobalt-60 beta decay and it is found that the parity is not broken. The explanation why there are only right-handed antineutrinos and left-handed neutrinos is offered on the basis of appropriate treatment of the influence of spin on momentum. The inversion of time is treated within the framework of the operators of time and energy and this symmetry is represented in a way that respects the Schr\"odinger equation and this is done by the Wick rotations of involved operators and vectors of the complexified formalism.</description>

      <title>Does there exist the applicability limit of PDE to describe physical phenomena? -- A personal survey of Quantization, QED, Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: What does it mean to study PDE(=Partial Differential Equation)? How and what to do "to claim proudly that I'm studying a certain PDE"? Newton mechanic uses mainly ODE(=Ordinary Differential Equation) and describes nicely movements of Sun, Moon and Earth etc. Now, so-called quantum phenomenum is described by, say Schr\"odinger equation, PDE which explains both wave and particle characters after quantization of ODE. The coupled Maxwell-Dirac equation is also "quantized" and QED(=Quantum Electro-Dynamics) theory is invented by physicists. Though it is said this QED gives very good coincidence between theoretical and experimental observed quantities, but what is the equation corresponding to QED? Or, is it possible to describe QED by "equation" in naive sense?</description>

      <title>Fundamental role of Dirac supersingletons in particle theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As shown in the famous Dyson's paper "Missed Opportunities", even from purely mathematical considerations (without any physics) it follows that Poincare quantum symmetry is a special degenerate case of de Sitter quantum symmetries. Then the question arises why in particle physics Poincare symmetry works with a very high accuracy. The usual answer to this question is that a theory in de Sitter space becomes a theory in Minkowski space in the formal limit when the radius of de Sitter space tends to infinity. However, de Sitter and Minkowski spaces are purely classical concepts, and in quantum theory the answer to this question must be given only in terms of quantum concepts. At the quantum level, Poincare symmetry is a good approximate symmetry if the eigenvalues of the representation operators $M_{4\mu}$ of the anti-de Sitter algebra are much greater than the eigenvalues of the operators $M_{\mu\nu}$ ($\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3$). We show that explicit solutions with such properties exist within the framework of the approach proposed by Flato and Fronsdal where particles that are considered elementary in the standard theory are bound states of two Dirac singletons.</description>
