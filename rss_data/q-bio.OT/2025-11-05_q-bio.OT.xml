      <title>Towards a Unified Framework for Statistical and Mathematical Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the biological, physical, and social sciences, there are two broad quantitative traditions: statistical and mathematical modeling. Both traditions have the common pursuit of advancing our scientific knowledge, but these traditions have developed largely independently using distinct languages and inferential frameworks. This paper uses the notion of identification from causal inference, a field originating from the statistical modeling tradition, to develop a shared language. I first review foundational identification results for statistical models and then extend these ideas to mathematical models. Central to this framework is the use of bounds, ranges of plausible numerical values, to analyze both statistical and mathematical models. I discuss the implications of this perspective for the interpretation, comparison, and integration of different modeling approaches, and illustrate the framework with a simple pharmacodynamic model for hypertension. To conclude, I describe areas where the approach taken here should be extended in the future. By formalizing connections between statistical and mathematical modeling, this work contributes to a shared framework for quantitative science. My hope is that this work will advance interactions between these two traditions.</description>

      <title>Chronic Kidney Disease Prognosis Prediction Using Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects nearly 10\% of the global population and often progresses to end-stage renal failure. Accurate prognosis prediction is vital for timely interventions and resource optimization. We present a transformer-based framework for predicting CKD progression using multi-modal electronic health records (EHR) from the Seoul National University Hospital OMOP Common Data Model. Our approach (\textbf{ProQ-BERT}) integrates demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, employing quantization-based tokenization for continuous lab values and attention mechanisms for interpretability. The model was pretrained with masked language modeling and fine-tuned for binary classification tasks predicting progression from stage 3a to stage 5 across varying follow-up and assessment periods. Evaluated on a cohort of 91,816 patients, our model consistently outperformed CEHR-BERT, achieving ROC-AUC up to 0.995 and PR-AUC up to 0.989 for short-term prediction. These results highlight the effectiveness of transformer architectures and temporal design choices in clinical prognosis modeling, offering a promising direction for personalized CKD care.</description>
