      <title>Unveiling Long-Range Forces in Light Harvesting Proteins: Pivotal Roles of Temperature and Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electrodynamic interactions between biomolecules are of potential biological interest for signaling warranting investigation of their activation through various mechanisms in living systems. Here, using as model system a light harvesting protein within the phycobilisome antenna system of red algae, we proved that not only light exposure but also thermal energy alone can trigger attractive electrodynamic interactions up to hundreds of nanometer. The latter are sustained by low frequency collective modes and while the second mode appears only upon illumination, the fundamental one can be activated by temperature alone. Activation of such collective modes and ED interactions might influence conformational rearrangements and energy transport within the phycobilisome antenna system. This is a paradigm-shift that underscores the immense potential of biological systems in exploiting different forms of input energy to achieve optimal energy transfer.</description>

      <title>MDRefine: a Python package for refining Molecular Dynamics trajectories with experimental data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play a crucial role in resolving the underlying conformational dynamics of molecular systems. However, their capability to correctly reproduce and predict dynamics in agreement with experiments is limited by the accuracy of the force-field model. This capability can be improved by refining the structural ensembles or the force-field parameters. Furthermore, discrepancies with experimental data can be due to imprecise forward models, namely, functions mapping simulated structures to experimental observables. Here, we introduce MDRefine, a Python package aimed at implementing the refinement of the ensemble, the force-field and/or the forward model by comparing MD-generated trajectories with experimental data. The software consists of several tools that can be employed separately from each other or combined together in different ways, providing a seamless interpolation between these three different types of refinement. We use some benchmark cases to show that the combined approach is superior to separately applied refinements. Source code, documentation and examples are freely available at https://pypi.org/project/MDRefine and https://github.com/bussilab/MDRefine.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium phase transitions in hybrid Voronoi models of cell colonies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eukaryotic cells are characterized by a stiff nucleus whose effect in modeling the collective behavior of cell aggregates is usually underestimated. However, increasing experimental evidence links nuclear modifications with phenotypic transition, like the one between epithelial and mesenchymal states. In this work, we explore the effect of short-range repulsive forces in the non-equilibrium dynamics of the self-propelled Voronoi model. We show that the competition between steric repulsions (representing nuclear/cellular compressibility) and Vertex interactions (mimicking cell-cell adhesion/interaction and cytoskeleton organization) generate a variety of non-equilibrium phase transitions from Motility-Induced Phase Separation to mesenchymal-like phases up to disordered confluent configurations. Notably, we found that tuning the nucleus's effective size/compressibility provides an additional way to cross the boundary between the different possible phases in line with experimental observations.</description>

      <title>A quantum picture of light-suppressed photosynthetic charge transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a dynamic mechanism for the reversible regulation of photosynthesis in varying light environments. We employ a three-level quantum model to take into account the correlations between charge donors and charge acceptors immediately before photoexcitation, and show that under continuous illumination, the transfer efficiency of a single charge is inversely proportional to the intensity of light, which can be suppressed so severely that it becomes a limiting factor on linear electron transport. This result is used to derive a set of analytical expressions that characterize the light response curves of photosynthetic parameters, including that of gross photosynthetic rate which saturates in high light and has long been assumed to obey a Michaelis-Menten function. We discuss the implications of thermal fluctuation in the light source, and argue that at a given intensity of light, the quantum yields measured with an incandescent lamp may be higher than those measured with a laser, a manifestation of thermal fluctuation in lamp illumination. Our new picture helps understand the observed plastocyanin-dependent electron transport in photosystem I and provides a donor-side scheme for the onset of irreversible damage to photosystem II by visible light.</description>

      <title>Information theory, Signal Analysis and Inverse Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This book is intended for teaching Signal Analysis methods and Inverse Problems theory. It is completely open access and will remain free. It is currently illustrated with examples that we have actually encountered in geophysics, but will eventually evolve to address problems in biology. The main idea is to develop this material over time (probably every six months) and throughout our careers. Therefore, it is not yet complete and some minor points need to be corrected in this English version. A French version is also available. The MATLAB codes we used can be found at the following address: https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/6tedk1xyquswmh0vcekfi/matlab_book.zip?rlkey=cbj5ura63qy6u57ij2yzgggkw&amp;st=8gp4gddd&amp;dl=0</description>
