      <title>An insertable glucose sensor using a compact and cost-effective phosphorescence lifetime imager and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) systems are emerging for personalized glucose management owing to their lower cost and prolonged durability compared to conventional electrochemical CGMs. Here, we report a computational CGM system, which integrates a biocompatible phosphorescence-based insertable biosensor and a custom-designed phosphorescence lifetime imager (PLI). This compact and cost-effective PLI is designed to capture phosphorescence lifetime images of an insertable sensor through the skin, where the lifetime of the emitted phosphorescence signal is modulated by the local concentration of glucose. Because this phosphorescence signal has a very long lifetime compared to tissue autofluorescence or excitation leakage processes, it completely bypasses these noise sources by measuring the sensor emission over several tens of microseconds after the excitation light is turned off. The lifetime images acquired through the skin are processed by neural network-based models for misalignment-tolerant inference of glucose levels, accurately revealing normal, low (hypoglycemia) and high (hyperglycemia) concentration ranges. Using a 1-mm thick skin phantom mimicking the optical properties of human skin, we performed in vitro testing of the PLI using glucose-spiked samples, yielding 88.8% inference accuracy, also showing resilience to random and unknown misalignments within a lateral distance of ~4.7 mm with respect to the position of the insertable sensor underneath the skin phantom. Furthermore, the PLI accurately identified larger lateral misalignments beyond 5 mm, prompting user intervention for re-alignment. The misalignment-resilient glucose concentration inference capability of this compact and cost-effective phosphorescence lifetime imager makes it an appealing wearable diagnostics tool for real-time tracking of glucose and other biomarkers.</description>

      <title>Diffuse optical tomography in time domain with the inverse Rytov series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rytov approximation has been commonly used to obtain reconstructed images for optical tomography. However, the method requires linearization of the nonlinear inverse problem. Here, we demonstrate nonlinear Rytov approximations by developing the inverse Rytov series for the time-dependent diffusion equation. The method is experimentally verified.</description>

      <title>Total-Body Parametric Imaging Using Relative Patlak Plot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard Patlak plot is widely used to describe FDG kinetics for dynamic PET imaging. Whole-body Patlak parametric imaging remains constrained due to the need for a full-time input function. Here, we demonstrate the Relative Patlak (RP) plot, which eliminates the need for the early-time input function, for total-body parametric imaging and its application to clinical 20-min "static" scans. We demonstrated that the RP intercept b' is equivalent to a ratio of standardized uptake value relative to the blood, while the RP slope Ki' is equal to the standard Patlak Ki multiplied by a global scaling factor for each subject. One challenge in applying RP to a short scan duration (20 min) is the high noise in parametric images. We applied a deep kernel method for noise reduction. Using the standard Patlak plot as the reference, the RP method was evaluated for lesion quantification, lesion-to-background contrast, and myocardial visualization in total-body parametric imaging with uEXPLORER in 22 human subjects who underwent a 1-h dynamic 18F-FDG scan. The RP method was also applied to the dynamic data regenerated from a clinical standard 20-min "static" scan either at 1-h or 2-h post-injection for two cancer patients. We demonstrated that it is feasible to obtain high-quality parametric images from 20-min dynamic scans using the RP plot with a self-supervised deep-kernel noise reduction strategy. The RP Ki' highly correlated with Ki in lesions and major organs, demonstrating its quantitative potential across subjects. Compared to conventional SUVs, the Ki' images significantly improved lesion contrast and enabled visualization of the myocardium for potential cardiac assessment. The application of RP parametric imaging to two "static" scans also showed similar benefits. Total-body PET with the RP plot is feasible to generate parametric images from the dynamic data of a 20-min clinical "static" scan.</description>

      <title>Assessment of scattered and leakage radiation from ultra-portable digital chest X-ray systems: An independent study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultraportable X-ray devices are ideal for TB screening in resource-limited settings. Unfortunately, guidelines on the radiation safety of these devices are lacking. The aim of the study was to determine the radiation dose by scattered and leakage radiation of ultraportable X-ray devices to provide a basis for these guidelines. Radiation dose measurements were performed with four ultraportable X-ray devices that meet the WHO-IAEA criteria. An anthropomorphic thorax phantom was positioned in posterior-anterior orientation in a clinically representative X-ray setup. X-ray exams were acquired with the following scan parameters: 90kV, 2.5mAs and maximum mAs, 1m and 1.8m source-to-skin distance. The entrance skin dose was measured at the center of the phantom. The scattered radiation dose was measured at 1m from the phantom as a function of scatter angle. Leakage radiation was measured at 0.5m from the X-ray tube with collimators closed and covered with additional lead. From the scatter measurements, the 'safe distance bunny' was determined, which was the minimum distance to the phantom to stay below the international dose limit to the public (1mSv per year) at a given workload. The longest distance (related to highest scatter dose) was observed behind the edges of the detector and back towards the X-ray tube, whereas the shortest distance (related to lowest scatter dose) was observed to the sides of the phantom. For the radiographer position, the total radiation dose by scattered and leakage radiation was determined in various scenarios. In most cases, the total radiation dose of ultraportable X-ray devices can be kept below 1mSv per year by employing basic radiation safety rules:1. Reduce time in the field, 2. Increase distance to the X-ray source, and 3. Use shielding measures (lead apron). Ultraportable X-ray devices can be safely used for TB screening when using adequate precautions.</description>

      <title>Non-negative Matrix Factorization using Partial Prior Knowledge for Radiation Dosimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09360v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at decomposing a given signal into its spectral signatures and its associated fractional abundances. To improve the accuracy of this decomposition, algorithms have included different assumptions depending on the application. The goal of this study is to develop a new unmixing algorithm that can be applied for the calibration of multi-point scintillation dosimeters used in the field of radiation therapy. This new algorithm is based on a non-negative matrix factorization. It incorporates a partial prior knowledge on both the abundances and the endmembers of a given signal. It is shown herein that, following a precise calibration routine, it is possible to use partial prior information about the fractional abundances, as well as on the endmembers, in order to perform a simplified yet precise calibration of these dosimeters. Validation and characterization of this algorithm is made using both simulations and experiments. The experimental validation shows an improvement in accuracy compared to previous algorithms with a mean spectral angle distance (SAD) on the estimated endmembers of 0.0766, leading to an average error of $(0.25 \pm 0.73)$ % on dose measurements.</description>

      <title>Segmentation of dense and multi-species bacterial colonies achieved using models trained on synthetic microscopy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spread of microbial infections is governed by the self-organization of bacteria on surfaces. Limitations of live imaging techniques make collective behaviors in clinically relevant systems challenging to quantify. Here, novel experimental and image analysis techniques for high-fidelity single-cell segmentation of bacterial colonies are developed. Machine learning-based segmentation models are trained solely using synthetic microscopy images that are processed to look realistic using state-of-the-art image-to-image translation methods, requiring no biophysical modeling. Accurate single-cell segmentation is achieved for densely packed single-species colonies and multi-species colonies of common pathogenic bacteria, even under suboptimal imaging conditions and for both brightfield and confocal laser scanning microscopy. The resulting data provide quantitative insights into the self-organization of bacteria on soft surfaces. Thanks to their high adaptability and relatively simple implementation, these methods promise to greatly facilitate quantitative descriptions of bacterial infections in varied environments.</description>
