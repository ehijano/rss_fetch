      <title>Mass Prediction of the Weak and Higgs Bosons Using the Massless Spin-Exchange Preons Model: An Alternative to the Higgs Mechanism in Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We modify the Yang-Mills model using massless preon pairs to describe the photon isospin singlet and the Z and W bosons. Unlike the Higgs mechanism, which depends on a scalar field, our model employs Gell-Mann generators, revealing that the masses of W and Z bosons arise from the internal dynamics of chiral preon pairs. With no adjustable parameters, we predict 0.87 (experimental value: 0.88), a Weinberg angle of 30{\deg} (vs. 29{\deg}), and a decay width ratio of 0.87 (vs. 0.84). Additionally, we find (vs. 1.56) for the Higgs boson. Our approach introduces a curl operator leading to chirality, characterized by a topological structure of M\"obius tori, providing new insights into particle interactions and challenging existing theoretical paradigms.</description>

      <title>Application of Machine Learning Based Top Quark and W Jet Tagging to Hadronic Four-Top Final States Induced by SM and BSM Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply both cut-based and machine learning techniques using the same inputs to the challenge of hadronic jet substructure recognition, utilizing classical subjettiness variables within the Delphes parameterized detector simulation framework. We focus on jets generated in simulated proton-proton collisions, identifying those consistent with the decay signatures of top quarks or W bosons. Such jets are employed in four-top quark events in fully hadronic final states stemming from both the Standard Model as well as from a new physics process of a hypothetical scalar resonance y0 decaying into a pair of top quarks. We reconstruct the resonance invariant mass and compare it properties over the falling background using the two tagging approaches, with implications to LHC searches.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Interactions in White Dwarfs: A Multi-Energy Approach to Capture Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs offer a compelling avenue for probing interactions of dark matter particles, particularly in the challenging sub-GeV mass regime. The constraints derived from these celestial objects strongly depend on the existence of high dark matter densities in the corresponding regions of the Universe, where white dwarfs are observed. This implies that excluding the parameter space using local white dwarfs would present a significant challenge, primarily due to the low dark matter density in the solar neighbourhood. This limitation prompts the exploration of alternative scenarios involving dark matter particles with a diverse spectrum of kinetic energies. In this work, we investigate how these dark matter particles traverse the star, interact with stellar matter, and ultimately get captured. To accomplish this, we approximate the dark matter flux as a delta function and inspired on the Three Portal Model, we assume that fermionic dark matter interacts with stellar matter either through a broken $U(1)$ gauge vector mediator or a scalar. In our computations, we consider how interactions might vary across different energy regimes, from high-energy deep inelastic scattering and inelastic scatterings via the production of $N-$ and $\Delta-$ resonances to lower-energy elastic interactions with nucleons and nuclei. Our study models these inelastic resonant interactions with dark matter and vector or scalar mediators for the very first time. We provide insights into the specific conditions required for successfully boosted dark matter capture in white dwarfs. We found that, in general, dark matter capture is most likely to occur at low energies, as expected. However, in the high-energy regime, there remains a small window for capture through resonant and deep inelastic scattering processes.</description>

      <title>How large could CP violation in neutral $B$ meson mixing be? Implications for baryogenesis and upcoming searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP violation in neutral $B$ meson oscillations is an experimental observable that could be directly related to the baryon asymmetry of the Universe through the $B$-Mesogenesis mechanism. As this phenomenon is highly suppressed in the Standard Model, it could also be a sensitive probe for many new physics scenarios that modify neutral meson mixing. Motivated by these facts, and the timely $B$ physics program at the LHC and Belle II, we analyze how large CP violation in the mixing of neutral $B_d$ and $B_s$ meson systems could be. We answer this question, in light of current experimental data, within three different scenarios, namely: (i) generic heavy new physics only affecting the mass mixing $M_{12}^q$, (ii) vector-like quark extensions that introduce deviations of 3$\times$3 CKM unitarity, and (iii) light new physics modifying the decay mixing $\Gamma_{12}^q$. We find that enhancements of the semileptonic asymmetries, that measure the amount of CP violation in mixing, at the level of $10^{-3}$ for the $B_d$ system and $10^{-4}$ for the $B_s$ system can be achieved within scenarios (i) and (ii), while they are much more suppressed in realistic UV completions triggering scenario (iii). With respect to cosmology, the difficulty of finding large CP asymmetries in our analysis puts the $B$-Mesogenesis mechanism in tension. Finally, we conclude that upcoming experimental searches for CP violation in $B$ meson mixing at LHCb and Belle II are unlikely to detect a new physics signal for the most generic models.</description>

      <title>Displaced Searches for Axion-Like Particles and Heavy Neutral Leptons at Mu3e</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present strategies for the Mu3e experiment to search for light, weakly coupled particles produced in rare muon decays, focusing on displaced $e^+e^-$ decays within the hollow target. In most scenarios the backgrounds can be fully suppressed with a suitable set of cuts. We furthermore quantify the interplay between displaced and prompt searches at Mu3e and existing constraints, showing how Mu3e has a unique opportunity to probe unexplored parameter space.</description>

      <title>MACK: Mismodeling Addressed with Contrastive Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning methods in high energy physics typically relies on large volumes of precise simulation for training. As machine learning models become more complex they can become increasingly sensitive to differences between this simulation and the real data collected by experiments. We present a generic methodology based on contrastive learning which is able to greatly mitigate this negative effect. Crucially, the method does not require prior knowledge of the specifics of the mismodeling. While we demonstrate the efficacy of this technique using the task of jet-tagging at the Large Hadron Collider, it is applicable to a wide array of different tasks both in and out of the field of high energy physics.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Mass and Decay Characteristics of the All-light Tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mass spectra and decay properties of pions and all light tetraquarks using both semi-relativistic and non-relativistic frameworks. By applying a Cornell-like potential and a spin-dependent potential, we generate the mass spectra. The decay properties of tetraquarks are evaluated using the annihilation model and the spectator model. Potential tetraquark candidates are interpreted for quantum numbers $J^{PC} = 0^{++}, 0^{-+}, 1^{-+}, 1^{+-}, 1^{--}, 2^{+-}, 2^{-+},$ and $2^{--}$. Additionally, we compare our results with existing experimental data and theoretical predictions to validate our findings. This study aims to enhance the understanding of tetraquarks in the light-light sector.</description>

      <title>Degenerate scalar scenario of two Higgs doublet model with a complex singlet scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two Higgs doublet model with a complex singlet scalar whose imaginary part acts as a dark matter (DM). The scattering of DM and quarks, mediated by three CP-even scalars in this model, is suppressed when masses of CP-even scalars are degenerate; that is called the ``degenerate scalar scenario''. Based on this scenario, we show that the strong first-order electroweak phase transition (EWPT) can be achieved without conflicting with constraints from the DM relic density and the direct detection experiments. We also discuss a shift of scalar trilinear coupling from the Standard Model prediction, which could be a test of this model in collider experiments.</description>

      <title>$D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing from nonlocal condensate contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant discrepancy, spanning multiple orders of magnitude, exists between the leading order contribution to the $D^0\overline{D^0}$ mixing parameters and experimental values. This is largely due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism, which results in substantial suppression of the theoretical predictions. To bridge this gap, various efforts have been made to account for higher-order terms and nonperturbative effects, which, although suppressed in the operator product expansion (OPE), could potentially lead to a larger contribution by weakening the GIM cancellation through flavour SU(3) symmetry breaking. In this work, we compute the long-distance contributions of nonlocal QCD condensates within different models and, for the first time, determine the impact of the mixed condensate. Although our results still fall short of the experimental value, they represent an improvement over current theoretical estimates by an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Nature of X(3872) from recent BESIII data: Considering the universal feature of an S-wave threshold resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the recent data from the BESIII collaboration on the $X(3872)$ state in the $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ decay channels. The quantum number and mass of the $X(3872)$ state allow us to exploit the universal feature of the very near-threshold $D\bar D^*$ scattering in the $S$ wave. The analysis of $J/\psi\pi^+\pi^-$ data and $D^0\bar{D}^0\pi^0$ data separately as well as the combined analysis of these data together, all support the conclusion that $X(3872)$ is an extremely weakly bound charm meson molecule.</description>

      <title>$\widetilde{\tau}$ searches at future e$^+$e$^-$ colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The direct pair-production of the superpartner of the $\tau$-lepton, the $\widetilde{\tau}$, is one of the most interesting channels to search for SUSY in: the $\widetilde{\tau}$ is likely to be the lightest of the scalar leptons, and is one of the most experimentally chalanging ones. The current model-independent $\widetilde{\tau}$ limits come from LEP, while limits obtained at the LHC do extend to higher masses, but are model-dependent. The future Higgs factories will be powerful facilities for SUSY searches, offering advantages with respect to previous electron-positron colliders as well as to hadron machines. In order to quantify the capabilities of these future $e^+e^-$ colliders, the "worst-case" scenario for $\widetilde{\tau}$ exclusion/discovery has been studied, taking into account the effect of the $\widetilde{\tau}$ mixing on $\widetilde{\tau}$ production cross-section and detection efficiency. To evaluate the latter, the ILD concept, originally developed for the International Linear Collider (ILC), and the ILC beam conditions at a centre-of-mass energy of 500 GeV have been used for detailed simulations. The obtained exclusion and discovery reaches extend to only a few GeV below the kinematic limit even in the worst-case scenario.
  The results of the detailed simulation study are then discussed in view of the experimental environment of other proposed Higgs factory projects.</description>

      <title>First constraints on general neutrino interactions based on KATRIN data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision measurement of the tritium $\beta$-decay spectrum performed by the KATRIN experiment provides a unique way to search for general neutrino interactions (GNI). All theoretical allowed GNI terms involving neutrinos are incorporated into a low-energy effective field theory, and can be identified by specific signatures in the measured tritium $\beta$-spectrum. In this paper an effective description of the impact of GNI on the $\beta$-spectrum is formulated and the first constraints on the effective GNI parameters are derived based on the 4 Mio. electrons collected in the second measurement campaign of KATRIN in 2019. In addition, constraints on selected types of interactions are investigated, thereby exploring the potential of KATRIN to search for more specific new physics cases, including a right-handed W boson, a charged Higgs or leptoquarks.</description>

      <title>Tensor Integrals in the Large-Scale Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method for evaluating tensor integrals in the large-scale structure. Decomposing a $\Lambda$CDM-like universe into a finite sum of scaling universes using the FFTLog, we can recast loop integrals for biased tracers in the large-scale structure as certain tensor integrals in quantum field theory. While rotational symmetry is spontaneously broken by the fixed reference frame in which biased tracers are observed, the tensor structures can still be organized to respect the underlying symmetry. Projecting the loop integrands for scaling universes onto spherical harmonics, the problem effectively reduces to the evaluation of one-dimensional radial integrals, which can be solved analytically. Using this method, we derive analytic expressions for the one-loop power spectrum, bispectrum, and trispectrum for arbitrary multipole moments in the basis of scaling universes.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Analysis of Insight-HXMT Gamma-Ray Burst Data. I. Power Density Spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14119v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Power Density Spectrum (PDS) is one of the powerful tools to study light curves of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). We show the average PDS and individual PDS analysis with {\it Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope} (also named \insighthxmt) GRBs data. The values of power-law index of average PDS ($\alpha_{\bar{P}}$) for long GRBs (LGRBs) vary from 1.58-1.29 (for 100-245, 245-600, and 600-2000 keV). The \insighthxmt\ data allow us to extend the energy of the LGRBs up to 2000 keV, and a relation between $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$ and energy $E$, $\alpha_{\bar{P}}\propto E^{-0.09}$ (8-2000 keV) is obtained. We first systematically investigate the average PDS and individual PDS for short GRBs (SGRBs), and obtain $\alpha_{\bar{P}}\propto E^{-0.07}$ (8-1000 keV), where the values of $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$ vary from 1.86 to 1.34. The distribution of power-law index of individual PDS ($\alpha$) of SGRB, is consistent with that of LGRB, and the $\alpha$ value for the dominant timescale group (the bent power-law, BPL) is higher than that for the no-dominant timescale group (the single power-law, PL). Both LGRBs and SGRBs show similar $\alpha$ and $\alpha_{\bar{P}}$, which indicates that they may be the result of similar stochastic processes. The typical value of dominant timescale $\tau$ for LGRBs and SGRBs is 1.58 s and 0.02 s, respectively. It seems that the $\tau$ in proportion to the duration of GRBs $T_{90}$, with a relation $\tau \propto T_{90}^{0.86}$. The GRB light curve may result from superposing a number of pulses with different timescales. No periodic and quasi-periodical signal above the 3$\sigma$ significance threshold is found in our sample.</description>

      <title>Structure of nuclei in dileptons production in proton-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate production of electron-positron pairs (dileptons) in the scattering of protons off nuclei. Focus is directed on clarifying role of nuclear interactions which make basis in mechanisms of scattering process and structure of nuclei. For that, we constructed a new model of production of dileptons, where scattering of nuclei and their structure are described on the basis of quantum mechanics. Cross sections of dilepton production are calculated in the scattering of protons on \isotope[9]{B} at energy of proton beam of 2.1~GeV. Tendency of the calculated full spectrum is in good agreement with experimental data of DLS Collaboration. Contribution of incoherent processes has a leading role in production of dileptons in comparison with coherent one. In our model calculated cross section of dileptons is sensitive to nuclear part of potential of interactions between proton and nucleus in scattering. Influence of structure of nucleus on calculations of cross sections of production of dileptons is essential. This result provides save basis for new opportunity to extract new information about structure of nuclei, nuclear part of potential from experimental data of dileptons at studied energies of proton beam.</description>

      <title>Quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for multijet clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jet clustering or reconstruction, a procedure to identify sprays of collimated particles originating from the fragmentation and hadronization of quarks and gluons, is a key component at high energy colliders. It is a complicated combinatorial optimization problem and requires intensive computing resources. In this study, we formulate jet reconstruction as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem and introduce novel quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms for clustering multiple jets in electron-positron collision events. One of these quantum-annealing-inspired algorithms, ballistic simulated bifurcation, overcomes problems previously observed in multijet clustering with quantum-annealing approaches. We find that both the distance defined in the QUBO matrix as well as the prediction power of the QUBO solvers have crucial impacts on the multijet clustering performance. This study opens up a new approach to globally reconstruct multijet beyond dijet in one-go, in contrast to the traditional iterative method.</description>

      <title>Efficient charge-preserving excited state preparation with variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the spectrum and wave functions of excited states of a system is crucial in quantum physics and chemistry. Low-depth quantum algorithms, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its variants, can be used to determine the ground-state energy. However, current approaches to computing excited states require numerous controlled unitaries, making the application of the original Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to problems in chemistry or physics suboptimal. In this study, we introduce a charge-preserving VQD (CPVQD) algorithm, designed to incorporate symmetry and the corresponding conserved charge into the VQD framework. This results in dimension reduction, significantly enhancing the efficiency of excited-state computations. We present benchmark results with GPU-accelerated simulations using systems up to 24 qubits, showcasing applications in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and quantum chemistry. This work is performed on NERSC's Perlmutter system using NVIDIA's open-source platform for accelerated quantum supercomputing - CUDA-Q.</description>

      <title>Constrains on dark matter cross section with standard model particles from the orbital period decay of binary pulsars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the data from the orbital period decay of binary pulsars give strong constraints on the dark matter-nucleons cross section. The limits are robust and competitive because this new method for testing dark matter interactions with standard model particles has a minimal number of assumptions combined with the extremely high accuracy on the measurement of the decay rate of the orbital period of binary systems. Our results exclude (with 95% confidence) spin independent interactions with cross sections greater that 3.1x10-31 cm2 for a dark matter particle with mass mc2 = 1 keV and 3.7x10-31 cm2 for mc2= 1 TeV which improves by several orders of magnitude previous constraints.</description>

      <title>Chiral gauge theories, generalized anomalies and breaking of the color-flavor-locked center symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the strong-interaction dynamics of a class of $4D$ chiral $SU(N)$ gauge theories with a fermion in a symmetric second-rank tensor representation and a number of fermions in an anti-antisymmetric tensor representation, extending the previous work on chiral gauge theories such as the Bars-Yankielowicz and the generalized Georgi-Glashow models. The main tool of our analysis is the anomalies obstructing the gauging of certain 1-form color-flavor-locked center symmetry, together with some flavor symmetries. The matching requirement for these mixed-anomalies strongly favors dynamical Higgs phases caused by bifermion condensate formation, against a confinement phase with no condensates and no symmetry breaking, or a confinement phase with multifermion color-singlet condensates only. Dynamical gauge symmetry breaking and the spontaneous breaking of a $U(1)$ symmetry caused by such condensates mean that the color-flavor-locked 1-form center symmetry itself is lost in the infrared. One is led to a solution, if not unique, which satisfies fully the conventional as well as the new, generalized 't Hooft anomaly matching requirements.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Four-Body Decays of Charged Higgs Bosons into Off-Shell Pseudoscalar Higgs and $W^\pm$ Boson Pairs in a Lepton-Specific 2-Higgs Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.12627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time-honoured decay $H^\pm\to A W^\pm$ but for the first time, we do so for the case of both $A$ and $W^\pm$ being off-shell, therefore computing a $1\to 4$ body decay. We show that the corresponding decay rate not only extends the reach of $H^\pm$ searches to small masses of the latter but also that the results of our implementation differ significantly from the yield of the $1\to3$ body decay over the phase space region in which the latter is normally used. We show the phenomenological relevance of this implementation in the case of the so-called lepton-specific 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) over the mass region wherein the aforementioned $1\to 4$ body decay can dominate just beyond the top (anti)quark mass. This mass region is accessible in the lepton-specific 2HDM as the Yukawa couplings are such that limits from $b \to s \gamma$ and $\tau \to \mu \nu_{\tau} \bar{\nu_\mu}$ observables on $M_{H^\pm}$ are rather mild. However, we emphasise that similar effects may occur in other 2HDM types, as the $W^\pm H^\mp A$ vertex is 2HDM type independent.</description>

      <title>Patchy Screening of the CMB from Dark Photons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15124v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study anisotropic (patchy) screening induced by the resonant conversion of cosmic microwave background (CMB) photons into dark-sector massive vector bosons (dark photons) as they cross non-linear large scale structure (LSS). Resonant conversion takes place through the kinetic mixing of the photon with the dark photon, one of the simplest low energy extensions to the Standard Model. In the early Universe, resonant conversion can occur when the photon plasma mass, obtained as the photon propagates through the ionized interstellar and intergalactic media, matches the dark photon mass. After the epoch of reionization, resonant conversion occurs mainly in the ionized gas that occupies virialized dark matter halos, for a range of dark photon masses between $10^{-13} {\rm \; eV} \lesssim m_{{\rm A^{\prime}}} \lesssim 10^{-11} {\rm \; eV}$. This leads to new CMB anisotropies that are correlated with LSS, which we refer to as patchy dark screening, in analogy with anisotropies from Thomson screening. Its unique frequency dependence allows it to be distinguished from the blackbody CMB. In this paper, we use a halo model approach to predict the imprint of dark screening on the CMB temperature and polarization anisotropies, as well as their correlation with LSS. We then examine the two- and three-point correlation functions of the dark-screened CMB, as well as correlation functions between CMB and LSS observables, to project the sensitivity of future measurements to the kinetic mixing parameter and dark photon mass. We demonstrate that an analysis with existing CMB data can improve upon current constraints on the kinetic mixing parameter by two orders of magnitude with the two-point correlation functions, while data from upcoming CMB experiments and LSS surveys can further improve the reach by another order of magnitude with two- and three-point correlation functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04184v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to search for light dark matter (DM), with keV-GeV mass, via inelastic nucleus scattering at large-volume neutrino detectors such as Borexino, DUNE, Super-K, Hyper-K, and JUNO. The approach uses inelastic nuclear scattering of cosmic-ray boosted DM, enabling a low background search for DM in these experiments. Large neutrino detectors, with higher thresholds than dark matter detectors, can be used, since the nuclear deexcitation lines are O(10) MeV. Using a hadrophilic dark-gauge-boson-portal model as a benchmark, we show that the nuclear inelastic channels generally provide better sensitivity than the elastic scattering for a large region of light DM parameter space.</description>

      <title>T-odd Parton Distribution Functions and Azimuthal Anisotropy at High Transverse Momentum in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$ Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05287v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Various azimuthal anisotropies ($v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4$), at high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$), are shown to arise from the asymmetric scattering of transverse polarized quarks and gluons, arising from unpolarized nucleons (the Boer-Mulders' effect) and resulting in unpolarized hadrons (the Collins effect). Combined with the asymmetric scattering of partons from polarization independent but transverse momentum dependent (TMD) distributions, we obtain a possible mechanism to understand the azimuthal anisotropy of hadrons at large transverse momentum observed in $p$-$p$ collisions. Constraining the ratio of polarization dependent TMD distributions to polarization independent distributions by comparing with the data from $p$-$p$ collisions, we find that a simple $A^{1/3}$ enhancement of the intrinsic transverse momentum $(k_\perp^2)$ distribution, of the initial state partons from the proton, straightforwardly yields the azimuthal anisotropy at high $p_T$ in $p$-$A$ collisions.</description>

Abstract: We propose new classes of inflation models based on the modular symmetry, where the modulus field $\tau$ serves as the inflaton. We establish a connection between modular inflation and modular stabilization, wherein the modulus field rolls towards a fixed point along the boundary of the fundamental domain. We find the modular symmetry strongly constrain the possible shape of the potential and identify some parameter space where the inflation predictions agree with cosmic microwave background observations. The tensor-to-scalar ratio is predicted to be smaller than $10^{-6}$ in our models, while the running of spectral index is of the order of $10^{-4}$.</description>

      <title>QCD Axion Strings or Seeds?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08060v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of QCD axion strings in the cosmological history of electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking, focussing on the minimal KSVZ axion model. We consider the case of the pure SM Higgs potential as well as a simple scenario with a first order EW phase transition. We capture the effect of the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) sector within an effective-theory approach for the Higgs field, where the axion string core and the heavy PQ states are integrated out. The relevant parameters in this effective theory are controlled by the size of the portal coupling between the Higgs and the PQ scalar, and the mass of the PQ radial excitation. We determine the range of portal couplings for which the axion strings can strongly affect the dynamics of EW symmetry breaking. In the case of a first order EW phase transition, the strings can act as seeds by either catalyzing the nucleation of (non-spherical) bubbles, or leading to the completion of the phase transition by triggering a classical instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore the application of the $\Gamma_{3}$ modular group, which is isomorphic to the $A_{4}$ symmetric group in developing a model for neutrino mass. We realized a non-supersymmetric left-right asymmetric model incorporating modular symmetry, where the modular forms consist of both holomorphic and non-holomorphic components and the Yukawa couplings expressed through polyharmonic $Maa\beta$ forms. To effectively implement the extended see-saw process in this model, we introduce one fermion singlet for each generation. We compute the effective mass and the associated half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ by accounting for both standard and non-standard contributions. Additionally, our study investigates the non-unitary effects and CP-violation arising from non-unitarity in this context. The model predicts values for the sum of neutrino masses and neutrino oscillation parameters are constraints with experiments. Furthermore, it yields satisfactory results in calculating the effective mass and half-life of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. These findings highlight the possibility and benefit of employing modular symmetry in neutrino mass model construction.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquarks from LHC to FCC: Natural stability from fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ or $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, named TQ4Q1.0 determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization and make use of the JETHAD numeric interface along with the symJETHAD symbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to $T_{4c}$ plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.</description>

      <title>Elaborating Higgs to dimuon decay from gluon fusion by decorrelation and jet substructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discovery of the Higgs boson decay to dimuon is anticipated soon based on the current evidence. Precise categorization of the events without affecting the invariant mass shape is crucial in the analysis. Decorrelation of the invariant mass and the output of discriminators (the score of discriminators) is essential for consistent and precise analysis. In this paper we use distance correlation as the additional loss function to achieve the decorrelation for discriminators and examine various analysis methods. The analyses with and without jet substructure variables are presented. Adding jet substructure variables considerably improves the significance of the Higgs to dimuon signal from gluon fusion.</description>

      <title>Probing axion-like particles in leptonic decays of heavy mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility to find the axion-like particles (ALPs) through the leptonic decays of heavy mesons. There are some deviations between the Standard Model (SM) predictions of the branching ratios of the leptonic decays of mesons and the experimental data. This provides some space for the existence of decay channels where the ALP is one of the products. Three scenarios are considered: first, the ALP is only coupled to one single charged fermion, namely, the quark, the antiquark, or the charged lepton; second, the ALP is only coupled to quark and antiquark with the same strength; third, the ALP is coupled to all the charged fermions with the same strength. The constraints of the coupling strength in different scenarios are obtained by comparing the experimental data of the branching ratios of leptonic decays of $B^-$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons with the theoretical predictions which are achieved by using the Bethe-Salpeter (BS) method. These constraints are further applied to predict the upper limits of the leptonic decay processes of the $B_c^-$ meson in which the ALP participates.</description>

      <title>Revisiting for maximal flavor violating $Z^{'}_{e\mu}$ and its phenomenology constraints</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05831v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lepton flavor violation (LFV), observed conclusively in neutrino oscillations, remains a pivotal area of investigation due to its absence in the Standard Model (SM). Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics explores charged lepton flavor violation (CLFV), particularly through new particle candidates such as the $Z'$. This article focuses on maximal LFV interactions facilitated by the $Z'$ boson, specifically targeting its off-diagonal interactions with the first and second generations of charged and neutral leptons. In our ultraviolet (UV) model for the origin of the $Z'$, inspired by the work of [R.Foot \textit{et al.,}, Phys.Rev. D50 (1994) 4571-4580], we utilize the discrete $Z_2$ symmetry to investigate the maximal LFV mediated by the $Z'$ between the muon ($\mu$) and electron ($e$) arising from the additional scalars. This symmetry prohibits flavor-conserving interactions between $Z'$ and $\mu^+\mu^-,\, e^+e^-$. In conjunction with collider, $(g-2)_{\mu}, (g-2)_e$, inverse $\mu$ decay, Muonium-to-Antimuonium conversion and LFV decay constraints, we provide forecasts for anticipated limits derived from processes such as $\nu_\mu N \to \nu_e \mu^+ e^- N$ in neutrino trident experiments like the DUNE search at the first time. These limits highlight the prospective scope and significance of LFV investigations within these experimental frameworks. Within the mass range of 0.01 GeV to 10 GeV, the most stringent limit arises from $\it{B} (\mu \to e + X + \gamma)$ when $M_{Z'} &lt; m_\mu$, while $\Delta a_e$ provides effective constraints as $M_{Z'}$ approaches 10 GeV. Looking ahead, the proposed Muonium-to-Antimuonium Conversion Experiment (MACE) is expected to impose the most stringent constraints on Muonium-to-Antimuonium oscillation, improving sensitivity by about one order of magnitude against $\Delta a_e$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06408v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Light bosonic dark matter fields that can be treated like a classical wave have non-linear field values close to massive bodies. Here we make the important observation that the quadratic interactions of axion dark matter lead to non-perturbative axion field values for values of the decay constant of $f\lesssim 10^{15}$ GeV and masses $m_a\lesssim 7\times10^{8}/f\ {\rm eV^2}$ and generalise this result for axion-like particles. We identify experimental observables impacted by this effect.</description>

      <title>Axion Bounds from Quantum Technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06412v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A consistent treatment of the quantum field theory of an axion-like particle (ALP) interacting with Standard Model fields requires to account for renormalisation group running and matching to the low-energy theory. Quantum sensor experiments designed to search for very light ALPs are particularly sensitive to these effects because they probe large values of the decay constant for which running effects become important. In addition, while linear axion interactions are set by its pseudoscalar nature, quadratic interactions are indistinguishable from scalar interactions. We show how the Wilson coefficients of linear and quadratic ALP interactions are related, including running effects above and below the QCD scale and provide a comprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of current and future experiments. We identify the reach of different experiments for the case of ALP dark matter and comment on how it could be distinguished from the case where it is not the dark matter. We present novel search strategies to observe quadratic ALP interactions via fifth force searches, haloscopes, helioscopes and quantum sensors. We emphasize the nonlinear behaviour of the ALP field close to the surface of the earth and point out which experimental results are independent on the local background field value.</description>

      <title>Spin Alignment of Vector Mesons Induced by Local Spin Density Fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel mechanism that the spin alignment of vector meson $\phi$ and $K^{*0}$ in most central heavy ion collisions is induced by intrinsic QCD dynamics without external vortical/ magnetic fields. The local spin density fluctuation of quarks due to the axial-vector and tensor interactions between quarks can induce the spin alignments of vector meson. It is found that axial-vector interaction results in $\rho_{00}&lt;1/3$ for the spin alignment of $\phi$ meson, while tensor interaction results in $\rho_{00}&gt;1/3$. We argue that the spin alignment of $K^{*0}$ due to the spin density fluctuation from flavor-mixing would be a signature or hint of instanton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the connection of baryogenesis at temperatures below the electroweak scale and signals for long-lived particles at the LHC. The model features new SM singlets, with a long-lived fermion decaying to quarks to generate the baryon asymmetry. The model avoids strong flavor physics bounds while predicting a rich diquark phenomenology, monojet signals, and displaced vertices. We show how the displaced vertex signals can be probed at the HL-LHC. The large transverse production makes a strong physics case for constructing far detector experiments such as MATHUSLA, ANUBIS, and CODEX-b, complementary to the central and forward long-lived particle program.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous breaking of baryon number, baryogenesis and the bajoron</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00964v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the spontaneous breaking of global baryon number for baryogenesis. We introduce a model with three majorana fermions and a complex scalar carrying baryon number charge. After symmetry breaking, the baryon asymmetry is generated below the electroweak scale via the decays of one of the majorana fermions. The main focus of the paper is the phenomenology of the Nambu--Goldstone boson of $U(1)_B$, which we call the bajoron. With small sources of explicit baryon number violation, the bajoron acquires a small mass and is generally very long-lived. The model avoids proton decay, satisfies cosmological constraints, and offers interesting collider phenomenology for the Large Hadron Collider. These long-lived particles tied to baryogenesis strongly support the development of far-detector experiments such as MATHUSLA, FASER, SHiP, and others.</description>

Abstract: We present superconducting vortex solutions in the two-Higgs doublet model which has a gauged $U(1)$ Higgs-family symmetry. We write down an ansatz for the solution and study its basic properties, for the case of both global and gauged symmetries. We demonstrate its prima-facie stability using 3D numerical simulations of a global version of the theory, observing the flow of current along the string. We discuss how generic such a phenomena might be and the possible consequences if such a model is found in nature.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

      <title>Robust Constraints on the Physics of the MeV Emission Line in GRB 221009A from Optical Depth Arguments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The brightest-of-all-time gamma-ray burst (GRB), GRB 221009A, is the first GRB observed to have emission line (up to 37 MeV) in its prompt emission spectra. It is naturally explained as \pair annihilation line that was Doppler boosted in the relativistic jet of the GRB. In this work, we repeatedly apply the simple optical depth argument to different physical processes necessary to produce an observable \pair annihilation line. This approach results in robust constraints on the physics of the line: We conclude that in GRB 221009A, the \pair pairs were produced at a radius greater than $4.3\times 10^{15}$\,cm from the central engine, and annihilated in a region between $1.4\times 10^{16}$\,cm and $4.3\times 10^{16}$\,cm. From these constraints, we established a self-consistent picture of \pair production, cooling, and annihilation. We also derived a criterion for pair production in the GRB prompt emission: $E_{\rm{iso}} \gtrsim3.3\times 10^{53} E_{\rm{peak},100} (1+z) R^2_{\rm{prod},16}~\text{erg}$. Using this criterion, we find tens of candidate GRBs that could have produced \pair in prompt emissions to annihilate. GRB 221009A is with the highest likelihood according to this criterion. We also predict the presence of a thermal radiation, with a time-evolving black body temperature, sweeping through soft X-ray during the prompt emission phase.</description>

      <title>New insights into the analytic structure of correlation functions via kinetic theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The way a relativistic system approaches fluid dynamical behaviour can be understood physically through the signals that will contribute to its linear response to perturbations. What these signals are is captured in the analytic structure of the retarded correlation function. The non-analyticities can be grouped into three types based on their dimension in the complex frequency plane. In this paper, we will use kinetic theory to find how we can calculate their corresponding signals. In the most general case of a system with particles that have a continuum of thermalization rates, we find that a non-analytic region appears. To calculate its signal, we introduce the non-analytic area density that describes the properties of this region, and we construct a method to calculate it. Further, to take into account the ambiguity present in signal analysis, following from manipulations of the non-analyticities, we will identify two specific choices called pictures with interesting analytic properties and compare in what scenarios each picture is most useful.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spectral densities encode non-perturbative information crucial in computing physical observables in strongly coupled field theories. Using lattice gauge theory data, we perform a systematic study to demonstrate the potential of recent technological advances in the reconstruction of spectral densities. We develop, maintain and make publicly available dedicated analysis code that can be used for broad classes of lattice theories. As a test case, we analyse the Sp(4) gauge theory coupled to an admixture of fermions transforming in the fundamental and two-index antisymmetric representations. We measure the masses of mesons in energy-smeared spectral densities, after optimising the smearing parameters for available lattice ensembles. We present a summary of the mesons mass spectrum in all the twelve (flavored) channels available, including also several excited states.</description>
