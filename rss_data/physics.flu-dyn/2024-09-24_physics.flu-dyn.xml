      <title>Effects of Trailing Edge Thickness on NACA 4412 Airfoil Performance at Low Reynolds Numbers: A CFD Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the augmentation of the significance of wind energy, giving a high priority to the \text{airfoil's} efficiency enhancement is obligatory. To improve the performance of airfoils, many impressive techniques are already invented. In this article, the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil is modified by changing the thickness. CFD is used in this study, which aids in the identification of several important details. For our investigation, we choose the reliable Spalart Almaras model and the Reynolds number is 300k. Overall, the results demonstrate that using \(0.8\%\) thickness at the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil is viable to obtain the best output. The predominant reason is that not only the better coefficient of lift but also the preferable lift-to-drag \(\frac{C_L}{C_D}\) ratio is found in this configuration. However, using \(0.2\%\) thickness at the trailing edge reduces performance as a whole. So, it is recommended to utilize \(0.2\%\) thickness on the trailing edge of the NACA 4412 airfoil.</description>

      <title>Simplified unified wave-particle method for diatomic gases based on Rykov model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the past decades, the numerical methods based on Navier-Stokes (N-S) equations and direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods have been proved effective in simulating flows in the continuum and rarefied regimes, respectively. However, as single-scale methods, they face challenges in addressing common multi-scale problems, which are essential to simulate hypersonic flows around near-space vehicles and the flows in the micro-electro-mechanical systems. Hence, there is an urgent need for a method to predict multi-scale flows. In this work, a quantified model-competition (QMC) mechanism for diatomic multi-scale flows is derived from the integral solution of the Rykov model equations. This mechanism encapsulates both continuum and rarefied behaviors in a cell, weighted according to its local physical scale. By building upon the QMC mechanism, the N-S solver and DSMC solver are directly integrated within a cell to devise a simplified unified wave-particle (SUWP) method for diatomic gases. Specifically, the two-temperature equations considering the rotational energy are introduced into the kinetic inviscid flux (KIF) scheme and the N-S solver. As to the particle part, the collisionless DSMC solver is utilized to describe the non-equilibrium phenomenon. The proposed SUWP method for diatomic gases undergoes validation across a series of cases, including zero-dimensional homogeneous gas relaxation, one-dimensional normal shock structure, two-dimensional flow around the flat and the cylinder, and three-dimensional flows past the sphere and the blunt cone. Additionally, the implementation details of multi-scale wave-particle methods analysis and discussion are also undertaken in this work.</description>

      <title>The role of disordered dynamics on the nature of transition in a turbulent reactive flow system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transition from a chaotic to a periodic oscillatory state can be smooth or abrupt in real-world turbulent systems. Although there have been several mathematical studies, the occurrence of abrupt transitions in real-world systems such as turbulent reactive flow systems is not well understood. A turbulent reactive flow system consists of the flame, the acoustic field, and the hydrodynamic field interacting nonlinearly. Generally, as the Reynolds number is increased, a laminar flow becomes turbulent, and the range of time scales associated with the flow broadens. Yet, as the Reynolds number is increased in a turbulent reactive flow system, a single dominant time scale emerges in the acoustic pressure oscillations, indicated by its loss of multifractality. For such smooth and abrupt transitions from chaos to order, we study the evolution of correlated and uncorrelated dynamics between the acoustic pressure and the heat release rate oscillations in the spatiotemporal domain of the turbulent reactive system. The correlated dynamics that add or remove energy from the acoustic field are defined as conformists and contrarians, respectively. The uncorrelated dynamics, neither adds nor removes energy is defined as disorder. Conformist dynamics dominate the contrarian dynamics as order emerges from chaos. We discover that the spatial extent of the disordered dynamics plays a critical role in deciding the nature of the transition. During the smooth transition, we observe a significant presence of disordered dynamics in the spatial domain. In contrast, abrupt transitions are accompanied by the disappearance of disordered dynamics from the spatial domain.</description>

      <title>Improvement of NACA6309 Airfoil with Passive Air-Flow Control by using Trailing Edge Flap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When fossil fuel supplies can no longer be replenished and hence fossil fuel power generation becomes outdated, wind energy will become a vital solution to the impending energy crisis. A horizontal-axis wind turbine is a widely used technology that is highly dependent on the design of high-performing airfoils. In this paper, we have studied the performance of the NACA6309 airfoil and designed it by modifying the airfoil with a trailing edge plain flap. Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulations are utilized for this purpose. We have designed sixteen configurations of NACA 6309 airfoil by using plain flaps at the trailing edge and studied their aerodynamic performance. After comparing the lift, drag, and lift-to-drag ratios, it is evident that the \(1^\circ\) up-flap configuration generates the best output. In addition, the \(10^\circ\) down flap provides the worst performance among all configurations. Finally, pressure contours and velocity contours around the airfoils are presented, which describe the overall characteristics.</description>

      <title>Nonmodal stability analysis of the plane Poiseuille flow in a multilayer porous-fluid channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of plane Poiseuille flow of a viscous Newtonian fluid in a multilayer channel with anisotropic porous walls is analyzed using the classical modal analysis, the energy method, and the non-modal analysis. The influence of porous wall parameters such as depth ratio (ratio of porous layer thickness to fluid layer thickness) and anisotropic permeability (in terms of meanpermeability and anisotropy parameter) on flow instability are investigated. The modal stability analysis and energy method show that the anisotropy parameter can stabilize the flow, whereas the depth ratio and mean permeability effects can cause destabilization. Furthermore, the energy budget analysis reveals that the energy production term transfers energy to the disturbance from the base flow through the Reynolds stress, amplifying the kinetic energies in all layers and, hence, enhancing the growth rates of the unstable modes. A significant disparity is observed between the critical Reynolds number obtained through modal analysis and the one determined by the energy method, which confirms the growth of transient perturbation kinetic energy. Specifically, transient growth and response functions are examined to understand the flow response to initial conditions and external excitation (receptivity analysis). It turns out that there is substantial transient growth at a sub-critical Reynolds number. These transient growths are greatly enhanced by increasing the mean permeability or the depth ratio and reducing the anisotropy parameter. The optimal perturbations leading to the maximum transient amplification are determined for various parameters, including counter-rotating vortices (rolls) and streaks.</description>

      <title>Capillary-size Flow of Human Blood Plasma: Revealing Hidden Elasticity and Scale Dependence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamical mechanical analysis of blood generally uses models inspired by conventional flows, assuming scale-independent homogeneous flows and without considering fluid-surface boundary interactions. The present experimental study highlights the relevance of using an approach in line with physiological reality providing a strong interaction between the fluid and the boundary interface. New dynamic properties of human blood plasma are found: a finite shear elastic response (solid-like property) is identified in nearly static conditions, which also depends on the scale (being reinforced at small scales). The elastic behavior is confirmed by the induction of local hot and cold thermodynamic states evidencing a thermo-mechanical coupling in blood plasma so far known only in elastic materials. This finding opens new routes for medical diagnosis and device fabrication.</description>

      <title>Fourier neural operators for spatiotemporal dynamics in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity direct numerical simulation of turbulent flows for most real-world applications remains an outstanding computational challenge. Several machine learning approaches have recently been proposed to alleviate the computational cost even though they become unstable or unphysical for long time predictions. We identify that the Fourier neural operator (FNO) based models combined with a partial differential equation (PDE) solver can accelerate fluid dynamic simulations and thus address computational expense of large-scale turbulence simulations. We treat the FNO model on the same footing as a PDE solver and answer important questions about the volume and temporal resolution of data required to build pre-trained models for turbulence. We also discuss the pitfalls of purely data-driven approaches that need to be avoided by the machine learning models to become viable and competitive tools for long time simulations of turbulence.</description>

      <title>Neural refractive index field: Unlocking the Potential of Background-oriented Schlieren Tomography in Volumetric Flow Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background-oriented Schlieren tomography (BOST) is a prevalent method for visualizing intricate turbulent flows, valued for its ease of implementation and capacity to capture three-dimensional distributions of a multitude of flow parameters. However, the voxel-based meshing scheme leads to significant challenges, such as inadequate spatial resolution, substantial discretization errors, poor noise immunity, and excessive computational costs. This work presents an innovative reconstruction approach termed neural refractive index field (NeRIF) which implicitly represents the flow field with a neural network, which is trained with tailored strategies. Both numerical simulations and experimental demonstrations on turbulent Bunsen flames suggest that our approach can significantly improve the reconstruction accuracy and spatial resolution while concurrently reducing computational expenses. Although showcased in the context of background-oriented schlieren tomography here, the key idea embedded in the NeRIF can be readily adapted to various other tomographic modalities including tomographic absorption spectroscopy and tomographic particle imaging velocimetry, broadening its potential impact across different domains of flow visualization and analysis.</description>

      <title>Bursting bubble in an elasto-viscoplastic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A gas bubble sitting at a liquid-gas interface can burst following the rupture of the thin liquid film separating it from the ambient, owing to the large surface energy of the resultant cavity. This bursting bubble forms capillary waves, a Worthington jet, and subsequent droplets for a Newtonian liquid medium. However, rheological properties of the liquid medium like elasto-viscoplasticity can greatly affect these dynamics. Using direct numerical simulations, this study exemplifies how the complex interplay between elasticity (in terms of elastic stress relaxation) and yield stress influences the transient interfacial phenomena of bursting bubbles. We investigate how bursting dynamics depends on capillary, elastic, and yield stresses by exploring the parameter space of the Deborah number $De$ (dimensionless relaxation time of elastic stresses) and the plastocapillary number $\mathcal{J}$ (dimensionless yield-stress of the medium), delineating four distinct characteristic behaviours. Overall, we observe a non-monotonic effect of elastic stress relaxation on the jet development while plasticity of the elasto-viscoplastic medium is shown to affect primarily the jet evolution only at faster relaxation times (low $De$). The role of elastic stresses on jet development is elucidated with the support of energy budgets identifying different modes of energy transfer within the elasto-viscoplastic medium. The effects of elasticity on the initial progression of capillary waves and droplet formation are also studied. In passing, we study the effects of solvent-polymer-viscosity ratio on bursting dynamics and show that polymer viscosity can increase the jet thickness apart from reducing the maximum height of the jet.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of laminar acoustic streaming jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work identifies the physical mechanisms at play in the different flow regions along an Eckart acoustic streaming jet by means of numerical simulation based on a novel modeling of the driving acoustic force including attenuation effects. The flow is forced by an axisymmetric beam of progressive sound waves attenuating over a significant part of a closed cylindrical vessel where the jet is confined. We focus on the steady, axisymmetric and laminar regime. The jet typically displays a strong acceleration close to the source before reaching a peak velocity. At further distances from the transducer, the on-axis jet velocity smoothly decays before reaching the opposite wall. For each of these flow regions along the jet, we derive scaling laws for the on-axis velocity with the magnitude of the acoustic force and the diffraction of the driving acoustic beam. These laws highlight the different flow regimes along the jet and establish a clear picture of its spatial structure, able to inform the design of experimental or industrial setups involving Eckart streaming jets.</description>

      <title>Shape dynamics of nearly spherical, multicomponent vesicles under shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In biology, cells undergo deformations under the action of flow caused by the fluid surrounding them. These flows lead to shape changes and instabilities that have been explored in detail for single component vesicles. However, cell membranes are often multi-component in nature, made up of multiple phospholipids and cholesterol mixtures that give rise to interesting thermodynamics and fluid mechanics. Our work analyses linear flows around a multi-component vesicle using a small-deformation theory based on vector and scalar spherical harmonics. We set up the problem by laying out the governing momentum equations and the traction {balance } arising from the phase separation and bending. These equations are solved along with a Cahn-Hilliard equation that governs the coarsening dynamics of the phospholipid-cholesterol mixture. We provide a detailed analysis of the vesicle dynamics (e.g., tumbling, breathing, tank-treading, swinging, and phase treading) in two regimes -- when flow is faster than coarsening dynamics (Peclet number $Pe \gg 1$) and when the two time scales are comparable ($Pe \sim O(1)$) -- and provide a discussion on {when these behaviours occur}. The analysis aims to provide an experimentalist with important insights pertaining to the phase separation dynamics and their effect on the deformation dynamics of a vesicle.</description>

      <title>Enhancing heat transfer in a channel with unsteady flow perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute unsteady perturbations that optimally increase the heat transfer (Nu) of optimal steady unidirectional channel flows, for a given average rate of power consumption Pe$^2$. The perturbations are expanded in a basis of modes, and the heat transfer enhancement corresponds to eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix of second derivatives of the Nusselt number with respect to the mode coefficients. Enhanced heat transfer, i.e. positive eigenvalues, occur in a range of temporal periods $\tau$ that scale as Pe$^{-1}$. At small to moderate $\tau$Pe values the corresponding flows are chains of eddies near the walls that move as traveling waves at the steady background flow speed. At large $\tau$Pe the flows have eddies of multiple scales ranging up to the domain size. We use an unsteady solver to simulate these flows with perturbation sizes ranging from small to large, and find increases in Nu of up to 56% at Pe = 2$^{19}$. Large Nu can be obtained by eddies with small spatial/temporal scales and by eddies with a range of spatial scales and large temporal scales.</description>

      <title>Geometric, Variational, and Bracket Descriptions of Fluid Motion with Open Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a Lie group geometric framework for the motion of fluids with permeable boundaries that extends Arnold's geometric description of fluid in closed domains. Our setting is based on the classical Hamilton principle applied to fluid trajectories, appropriately amended to incorporate bulk and boundary forces via a Lagrange-d'Alembert approach, and to take into account only the fluid particles present in the fluid domain at a given time. By applying a reduction by relabelling symmetries, we deduce a variational formulation in the Eulerian description that extends the Euler-Poincar\'e framework to open fluids. On the Hamiltonian side, our approach yields a bracket formulation that consistently extends the Lie-Poisson bracket of fluid dynamics and contains as a particular case a bulk+boundary bracket formulation proposed earlier. We illustrate the geometric framework with several examples, and also consider the extension of this setting to include multicomponent fluids, the consideration of general advected quantities, the analysis of higher-order fluids, and the incorporation of boundary stresses. Open fluids are found in a wide range of physical systems, including geophysical fluid dynamics, porous media, incompressible flow and magnetohydrodynamics. This new formulation permits a description based on geometric mechanics that can be applied to a broad class of models.</description>

      <title>Blockage of thermocapillary flows by surface-active impurities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermocapillary convection is particularly effective for the control of thin liquid film topography or for the actuation of microparticles at the liquid-air interface. Experiments with water are challenging, however, as its interface is prone to contamination by surface-active impurities that profoundly alter its hydrodynamic response. Despite numerous reports highlighting the hindrance of thermocapillary flows, quantitative information on interface contamination is definitely lacking. We therefore introduce a general framework in order to account for the presence of a low concentration of insoluble surfactants at the water-air interface. Focusing on the low-compressibility limit, we identify the inverse Marangoni number as the appropriate small parameter in the modeling. The transport equations can then be linearized without any further assumption regarding the other dimensionless groups. It is shown in particular that the surfactant concentration adapts to the thermocapillary forcing in order to cancel the interfacial viscous stress. Several experimentally relevant situations are discussed with emphasis on physical observables. Besides the excellent agreement between theory and experiment, our predictions provide a quantitative assessment of the impurity concentration.</description>

      <title>Almost anomalous dissipation in advection-diffusion of a divergence-free passive vector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the advection-diffusion of a passive vector described by $\partial_t u + U \cdot \nabla u = - \nabla p + \nu \Delta u$, where both $U$ and $u$ are divergence-free velocity fields. We approach this equation from an input/output perspective, with $U$ as the input and $u$ as the output. This input/output viewpoint has been widely applied in recent studies on passive scalar equation, in the context of anomalous dissipation, mixing, optimal scalar transport, and nonuniqueness problems. What makes the passive vector equation considerably more challenging compared to the passive scalar equation is the lack of a Lagrangian perspective due to the presence of pressure.
  In this paper, rather than requiring $U$ and $u$ to be identical (as in the Navier-Stokes equation), we require $U$ and $u$ to be identical only in certain characteristics. We focus on the case where the characteristics in question are anomalous and enhanced dissipation. We study the advection-diffusion of a passive vector in a Couette flow configuration. The main result of this paper is a construction of the velocity field $U$ for which the energy dissipation scales as $(\log \nu^{-1})^{-2}$ such that the energy dissipation in velocity field $u$ scales at least as $(\log \nu^{-1})^{-2}$. This means that both $U$ and $u$ exhibit near-anomalous dissipation, where the rate of energy dissipation decreases more slowly than any power-law $\nu^{\alpha}$ for any $\alpha &gt; 0$. The result in this paper is not just a mathematical construct; it closely resembles the behavior of turbulent flow in a channel. The $(\log \nu^{-1})^{-2}$ decrease of energy dissipation is predicted by phenomenological theories of wall-bounded turbulence, a prediction that has been extensively validated through experiments and numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>TURB-Lagr. A database of 3d Lagrangian trajectories in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.08662v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present TURB-Lagr, a new open database of 3d turbulent Lagrangian trajectories, obtained by Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of the original Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of a homogeneous and isotropic forcing. The aim is to provide the community interested in data-assimilation and/or Lagrangian-properties of turbulence a new testing-ground made of roughly 300K different Lagrangian trajectories. TURB-Lagr data are influenced by the strong non-Gaussian fluctuations characteristic of turbulence and by the rough and non differentiable fields. In addition, coming from fully resolved numerical simulations of the original partial differential equations, they offer the possibility to apply a wide range of approaches, from equation-free to physics-based models. TURB-Lagr data are reachable at http://smart-turb.roma2.infn.it</description>

      <title>Reynolds number required to accurately discriminate between proposed trends of skin friction and normal stress in wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01184v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Nagib, Chauhan and Monkewitz~\cite{NCM07} we concluded that nearly all available $C_f$ relations for zero-pressure-gradient boundary layers are in remarkable agreement over the entire range $Re_\theta$ $&lt;$ O($10^8$), provided one coefficient is adjusted in each relation by anchoring it to accurate measurements. Regarding the peak of the streamwise turbulence intensity $&lt;uu&gt;^+_P$, we conclude here that accurate measurements in flows with $Re_\tau$ $&gt;$ O($10^6$) are required, especially when looking only at the peak $&lt;uu&gt;^+_P$ to discriminate between recently proposed trends. We also find remarkable agreement between the three analyses of Monkewitz \cite{M22}, Chen and Sreenivasan \cite{CS22} and Monkewitz and Nagib \cite{MN15}, with some coefficients slightly modified, by underpinning them with the same accurate measurements of $&lt;uu&gt;^+_P$ from reliable channel and boundary layer data. All the three analyses conclude that the inner peak of $&lt;uu&gt;^+$ remains finite in the limit of infinite Reynolds number, which is at variance with the unlimited growth of $&lt;uu&gt;^+_P$ as $\ln{Re}$ $_\tau$ predicted by the attached eddy model \cite{MM19}. Accurate measurements of high-order moments and the guidance of consistent asymptotic expansions may help clarify the issue at lower $Re_\tau$ values.</description>

      <title>Interaction of vortex ring with perforated plate at different included angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Experiments are performed to investigate the interaction of a vortex ring (Reynolds number based on circulation (Re_Gamma = 10500) with perforated surface (open area ratio, phi_1 = 0.24 and phi_2 = 0.44) with different included angles (theta = 60deg-180deg). The phenomenon is characterized using techniques like planer laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) imaging and particle image velocimetry (PIV). Lagrangian analysis using finite-time Lyapunov exponents (FTLE) and Gamma_2 vortex identification methods are utilized to understand flow physics. We observe the development of mushroom-like structures at the holes, driven by the induced flow of the vortex ring. These formations, together with Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, introduce initial instability to the emerging jets. We discern a sequential emergence of the vortex ring in the form of jets at lower theta value that diminishes at higher values. Notably, a single vortex ring is split into two distinct vortex rings for theta less than equal to 120deg. On either side of the perforated plate, the sense of circulation after interaction does not show bias towards the sense of flow on the upstream region for some values of theta. We further show the evolution of circulation by jets in the downstream region aligns with the proposed cumulative slug flow model using the centre line peak velocity of individual jets.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Eddy Identification with Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale eddies are critical in ocean circulation and the global climate system. Standard eddy identification methods are usually based on deterministic optimal point estimates of the ocean flow field. However, uncertainty exists in estimating the flow field due to noisy, sparse, and indirect observations and turbulent flow models. Because of the intrinsic strong nonlinearity in the eddy identification diagnostics, even a small uncertainty in estimating the flow field can cause a significant error in the identified eddies. This paper presents a general probabilistic eddy identification framework that adapts existing identification methods to incorporate uncertainty into the diagnostic, emphasizing the interaction between the uncertainty in state estimation and the nonlinearity in diagnostics for affecting the identification results. The probabilistic eddy identification framework starts by sampling an ensemble of flow realizations from the probabilistic state estimation, followed by applying traditional nonlinear eddy diagnostics to individual realizations. The corresponding eddy statistics are then aggregated from the diagnostic results based on these realizations. The framework is applied to a scenario mimicking the Beaufort Gyre marginal ice zone, where large uncertainty appears in estimating the ocean field using Lagrangian data assimilation with sparse ice floe trajectories. The skills in counting the number of eddies and computing the probability of each eddy event are significantly improved under the probabilistic framework. Notably, incorporating the nonlinear propagation of uncertainty in diagnostics provides a more accurate mean estimate than standard deterministic methods in estimating eddy lifetime. It also facilitates uncertainty quantification in inferring such a crucial dynamical quantity.</description>
