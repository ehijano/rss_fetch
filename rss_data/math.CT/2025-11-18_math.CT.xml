      <title>Soft Connectedness, Soft Path Connectedness and the Category of Soft Topological Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the soft usual topology compatible with the usual topology of $\mathbb{R}$ is defined, and using its subspace topology on the interval $[0,1]$, the concept of a soft path is introduced. Within this context, the notions of soft connectedness and soft path connectedness are developed, their relationship is analyzed, and it is shown that these properties are preserved under soft continuous mappings. Moreover, the behavior of these concepts within soft topological groups is investigated in detail. Finally, the category of soft topological groups is constructed, its morphisms are identified, and it is shown that this category forms a symmetric monoidal category.</description>

      <title>The extension dimension of group graded rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of graded extension dimension for a group graded ring R, denoted by gr.ext.dim(R). We prove that when R is strongly graded, its graded extension dimension coincides with the non-graded extension dimension of both R itself and its degree-zero subring Re. Furthermore, we demonstrate that graded equivalence and graded separable equivalence preserve the extension dimension under appropriate conditions.</description>

      <title>Cofinality via Weighted Colimits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a refinement of Quillen's Theorem A, providing necessary and sufficient conditions for a functor to be cofinal with respect to diagrams valued in a fixed $\infty$-category. We deduce this from a general duality phenomenon for weighted colimits, which is of independent interest. As a sample application, due to Betts and Dan-Cohen, we describe a simplified formula for the free $\mathbb{E}_\infty$-algebra on an $\mathbb{E}_0$-algebra in a stable rational $\infty$-category .</description>

      <title>A monoidal category of dependently sorted algebraic theories I: syntax</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is the first of a pair of papers where we construct and investigate a closed monoidal structure on the category of generalized algebraic theories (in the sense of Cartmell).
  In the present text, as a starting point, we define the tensor product, $A \otimes B$, between two generalized algebraic theories $A$ and $B$. This is done syntactically via an algorithm that uses the axioms of $A$ and $B$ in a recursive manner to produce those of $A \otimes B$. We provide examples of known structures that are recovered by our construction, such as tensor products of Lawvere theories, "cellular" products of dependent type signatures, and theories of diagrams and of displayed structures. It will be verified in the second volume that, as suggested by these special cases, the category of family-valued models $\text{Mod}(A \otimes B,\text{Fam})$ is isomorphic to $\text{Mod}(A,\textbf{Mod}(B))$ and to $\text{Mod}(B,\textbf{Mod}(A))$ for certain contextual categories $\textbf{Mod}(A)$ and $\textbf{Mod}(B)$ whose underlying categories are equivalent to $\text{Mod}(A,\text{Fam})$ and to $\text{Mod}(B,\text{Fam})$, respectively. Moreover, the cellular structure of the tensor product is obtained by combining, via a pushout-product operation, those of the two theories.
  We also construct a functor $\otimes_{A,B}:\mathcal C(A) \times \mathcal C(B) \rightarrow \mathcal C(A \otimes B)$ comparing the associated contextual categories, and describe isomorphisms of the forms $(A \otimes B) \otimes C \cong A \otimes (B \otimes C)$ and $A \otimes B \cong B \otimes A$. In the sequel paper we will describe a universal property of $\otimes_{A,B}$, which will induce functoriality of the tensor product and thus allow us to check the monoidal category conditions.</description>

      <title>HilbMult: A Banach-Enriched Multicategory for Operator Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Category and multicategory theory provide abstract frameworks for describing structures and their compositions, with multicategories extending traditional categories to handle multi-input operations. These theories enable modular reasoning and coherent composition of complex systems, and have found applications in computer science, physics, and mathematics, including programming language semantics, quantum processes, tensor networks, operads, and higher algebra. Operator theory, in contrast, studies linear and multilinear transformations in functional spaces, forming the analytic backbone of modern analysis and quantum mechanics, with applications ranging from signal processing and control theory to data science. This paper explores the synergy between these two areas by showing how operator theory provides concrete analytic structures that naturally enrich multicategories, while multicategory theory supplies a unifying framework for organizing multi-input operators and ensuring coherence in complex networks. We develop a comprehensive categorical framework integrating operator theory with multicategories, introducing a symmetric monoidal multicategory of Hilbert spaces with bounded multilinear maps and establishing its enrichment and coherence properties. The framework includes a functorial spectral theorem, covariance under unitary transformations, and universality as a semantic target, providing a unified language for linking analytic structure, categorical semantics, and operator representations. This work lays the foundation for a broader research program uniting operator theory, category theory, and noncommutative geometry.</description>

      <title>Composition and Coherence: The Syntax of Operator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coherence is a central issue in category theory and multicategory theory, ensuring that formally distinct compositions of morphisms, such as tensor reorderings or diagrammatic rewiring, represent the same underlying transformation. In operator theory and in Hilbert space based systems, coherence guarantees that equivalent operator networks produce identical effects on states and signals, maintaining both mathematical consistency and computational interpretability. This paper, the second installment of the Categorical Spectral Architecture (CSA) program, develops a unified framework that integrates operator theory, spectral analysis, and categorical algebra. Building on the functorial and spectral foundations established in the first paper, we introduce the Synergy Operad, a syntactic framework that extends the multicategory of Hilbert spaces and bounded multilinear maps. The Canonical Representation Theorem provides a structure-preserving functor that aligns syntactic compositions with operator semantics. Another central component, the Coherence Theorem, ensures that grammatical equivalences correspond to identical semantic results. Together these contributions identify a syntactic-semantic duality at the core of CSA and provide a rigorous basis for analyzing and constructing complex systems of operators with coherent and predictable meaning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.13167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bisch and Jones established a bijection between the intermediate subfactors of an irreducible subfactor and certain idempotents satisfying exchange relations. In this paper, we generalize this result to abelian monoidal categories through Frobenius subalgebras. As an application, we show that certain morphisms on a C*-correspondence arise from intermediate C*-subalgebras if and only if they are averaging operators.</description>

      <title>Equivariant Banach-bundle germs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.13511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.13511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a continuous bundle $\mathcal{E}\to X$ of Banach/Hilbert spaces or Banach/$C^*$-algebras over a paracompact base space, equivariant for a compact Lie group $\mathbb{U}$ operating on all structures involved. We prove that in all cases homogeneous equivariant subbundles extend equivariantly from $\mathbb{U}$-invariant closed subsets of $X$ to closed invariant neighborhoods thereof (provided the fibers are semisimple in the Banach-algebra variant). This extends a number of results in the literature (due to Fell for non-equivariant local extensibility around a single point for $C^*$-algebras and the author for semisimple Banach algebras). The proofs are based in part on auxiliary results on (a) the extensibility of equivariant compact-Lie-group principal bundles locally around invariant closed subsets of paracompact spaces, as a consequence of equivariant-bundle classifying spaces being absolute neighborhood extensors in the relevant setting and (b) an equivariant-bundle version of Johnson's approximability of almost-multiplicative maps from finite-dimensional semisimple Banach algebras with Banach morphisms.</description>

      <title>A bialgebraic characterization of symmetric powers in $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear symmetric monoidal categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In any symmetric monoidal category, the $n$-th (co)equalizer symmetric power of an object $A$ is the (co)equalizer of all the permutations from $A^{\otimes n}$ to itself. If the symmetric monoidal is $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear, that is, enriched in $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-modules, the notions of $n$-th equalizer symmetric power and $n$-th coequalizer symmetric power are equivalent. In this context, the $n$-th symmetric power of $A$ can be described as the intermediate object $A_n$ in a splitting of the idempotent $\frac{1}{n!}\underset{\sigma \in S_n}{\sum}\sigma\colon A^{\otimes n} \rightarrow A^{\otimes n}$. We define a permutation splitting as a countable family of such splittings.
  The main goal of this paper is to prove two theorems. The first theorem exhibits in any $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear symmetric monoidal category a bijection between operations making a graded object $(A_n)_{n \ge 0}$ into a permutation splitting and operations making this graded object into a bialgebraic structure that we call a binomial bimonoid. Binomial bimonoids can be defined in any additive symmetric monoidal category. The second theorem shows that, in any $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear symmetric monoidal category, the biassociativity and bicommutativity axioms may be omitted from the definition of a binomial bimonoid.
  We then show that being a binomial bimonoid in a $\mathbb{Q}_{\ge 0}$-linear symmetric monoidal category is a property: two binomial bimonoids are isomorphic whenever their underlying graded objects are isomorphic. This result does not extend to arbitrary additive symmetric monoidal categories since both the one-variable polynomial algebra and the one-variable divided power polynomial algebra over a field $k$ of positive characteristic are non-isomorphic binomial $k$-bialgebras with isomorphic underlying $\mathbb{N}$-graded vector spaces.</description>

      <title>Dagger categories and the complex numbers: Axioms for the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear contractions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06584v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We unravel a deep connection between limits of real numbers and limits in category theory. Using a new variant of the classical characterisation of the real numbers, we characterise the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and linear contractions in terms of simple category-theoretic structures and properties that do not refer to norms, continuity, or real numbers. This builds on Heunen, Kornell, and Van der Schaaf's easier characterisation of the category of all Hilbert spaces and linear contractions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12251v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce notions of lax semiadditive and lax additive $(\infty,2)$-categories, categorifying the classical notions of semiadditive and additive 1-categories. To establish a well-behaved axiomatic framework, we develop a calculus of lax matrices and use it to prove that in locally cocomplete $(\infty,2)$-categories lax limits and lax colimits agree and are absolute. In the lax additive setting, we categorify fundamental constructions from homological algebra such as mapping complexes and mapping cones and establish their basic properties.</description>

      <title>Hilbert $*$-categories: Where limits in analysis and category theory meet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.17432v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces Hilbert $*$-categories: an abstraction of categories with similar algebraic and analytic properties to the categories of real, complex, and quaternionic Hilbert spaces and bounded linear maps. Other examples include categories of Hilbert W*-modules and of unitary group-representations. Hilbert $*$-categories are "analytically" complete in two ways: every bounded increasing sequence of Hermitian endomorphisms has a supremum, and every suitably bounded orthogonal family of parallel morphisms is summable. These "analytic" completeness properties are not assumed outright; rather, they are derived, respectively, from two new universal constructions: codirected $\ell^2$-limits of contractions and $\ell^2$-products. In turn, these are built from directed colimits in the wide subcategory of isometries.</description>

      <title>Dagger categories of relations: The equivalence of dilatory dagger categories and epi-regular independence categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several categories look like categories of relations, but do not fit the established theory of relations in regular categories. They include the category of surjective multivalued functions, the category of injective partial functions, the category of finite probability spaces and stochastic matrices, and the category of Hilbert spaces and linear contractions. To explain these anomalous examples, we develop a parallel theory of relations in epi-regular independence categories. Just as regular categories correspond to tabular allegories, epi-regular independence categories correspond to dilatory dagger categories. The equivalence maps epi-regular independence categories to their associated dagger category of relations, and dilatory dagger categories to their wide subcategory of coisometries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02425v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a compositional framework for generalized reversible computing using copy-discard categories and resource theories. We introduce partitioned matrices between partitioned sets as subdistribution matrices which preserve the equivalence relation of its domain. We model computational and physical transformations as subdistribution matrices over the category of sets and partitioned matrices on partitioned sets, respectively. We show that the interactions between the physical and computational transformations are governed by an aggregation functor whose functoriality and monoidality we deduce from general principles of the formal theory of monads. We study the associated copy-discard structures, in particular, general conditions for determinism and partial invertibility. We then define several notions of entropies that we use to state and prove the fundamental theorem of generalized reversible computing.</description>

      <title>Assembly of Constructible Factorization Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19472v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a toolbox of extension, gluing, and assembly techniques for factorization algebras.
  Using these tools, we fill various gaps in the literature on factorization algebras on stratified manifolds, the main one being that constructible factorization algebras form a sheaf of symmetric monoidal $\infty$-categories. Additionally, we explain how to assemble constructible factorization algebras from the data on the individual strata together with module structures associated to the relative links; thus answering a question by Ayala.
  Along the way, we give detailed proofs of the following facts which are also of independent interest: constructibility is a local condition; the $\infty$-category of disks is a localization of any sufficiently fine poset of disks; constructibility implies the Weiss condition on disks; constructible factorization algebras are algebras for the $\infty$-operad of embedded disks. For each of these, variants or special cases already existed, but they were either incomplete or not general enough.</description>

      <title>From Semantics to Syntax: A Type Theory for Comprehension Categories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent models of intensional type theory have been constructed in algebraic weak factorization systems (AWFSs). AWFSs give rise to comprehension categories that feature non-trivial morphisms between types; these morphisms are not used in the standard interpretation of Martin-L\"of type theory in comprehension categories.
  We develop a type theory that internalizes morphisms between types, reflecting this semantic feature back into syntax. Our type theory comes with $\Pi$-, $\Sigma$-, and identity types. We discuss how it can be viewed as an extension of Martin-L\"of type theory with coercive subtyping, as sketched by Coraglia and Emmenegger. We furthermore define semantic structure that interprets our type theory and prove a soundness result. Finally, we exhibit many examples of the semantic structure, yielding a plethora of interpretations.</description>
