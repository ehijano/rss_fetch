      <title>Metal-insulator transition in a CuO chain created by Kondo interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over twenty years ago Alexei Abrikosov [A.A. Abrikosov, Metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates (SDW model), Physica C: Supercond. Vol. 391, 2, 147-159 (2003)] considered the Spin-Density-Waves (SDW) model for the metal-insulator transition in layered cuprates. In one of those cuprates, YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$, there are one-dimensional (1D) CuO chains of copper and oxygen ions. In the present work we consider the metal-insulator transition in the model case of a 1D CuO chain in the regime of half-filling of the band. Our model is essentially the same, but as an exchange interaction causing the metal-insulator transition, we consider Kondo-Zener two-electron exchange, which successfully describes many of the electronic properties of the layered cuprates.</description>

      <title>Origin of Spin Stripes in Bilayer Nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new high temperature superconductor. We propose and study a microscopic Hamiltonian that addresses the interplay of lattice structure and magnetism in this system. Using state-of-the-art density matrix renormalization group calculations, we show that $(\pi/2,\pi/2)$ spin stripe order emerges in our model and exhibits a hidden quasi-one dimensionality. The spin stripe order occurs over a range of electron concentrations, but requires a sizable Hund's coupling $J_H$. Our model exhibits superconducting tendency only when the interlayer antiferromagnetic coupling $J_\bot$ becomes sufficiently large, which naturally occurs under pressure. Our study unveils the microscopic origin of both the unusual spin stripes and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, and highlights the indispensable role of Hund's coupling $J_H$ in this system.</description>

      <title>Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.</description>

      <title>Effect of Deposition Pressure on the Superconductivity of Ti40V60 Alloy Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth and characterization of high quality superconducting thin films is essential for fundamental understanding and also for the use of these films in technological applications. In the present study, Ti40V60 alloy thin films have been deposited using DC magnetron co sputtering of Ti and V at ambient temperatures. The effect of deposition pressure on the film morphology, superconducting and normal state properties has been studied. Measurement of electrical resistance as a function of temperature indicates that up to a certain deposition pressure, the 20 nm thick Ti40V60 films exhibit metallic behavior in the normal state and superconductivity at low temperatures. Beyond a threshold pressure, the films show a negative temperature coefficient of resistance with a residual resistance ratio less than one. Electrical transport measurements in the presence of magnetic field were performed to find the current voltage characteristics of the thin films. Analysis of the I V curves indicates that the Ti40V60 alloy thin films have a large transport critical current density (JC) e.g. 1.475E10 A per m2 in zero magnetic field and 2.657E09 A per m2 in 4 T (both at 4 K). Analysis of the field dependence of flux line pinning force density indicates a combined effect of core delta k surface and core delta k point pinning mechanisms (where k is the Ginzburg Landau parameter). Additionally, spatial variations in the superconducting critical temperature (TC ) across the sample contribute to delta TC pinning. In higher magnetic fields, a contribution from delta l pinning (where l is the electron mean free path) also becomes significant. The findings indicate the potential of Ti40V60 alloy thin film for superconducting device applications like cryogenic radiation detectors.</description>

      <title>Growth Optimization of MoSi Thin Film and Measurement of Transport Critical Current Density of its Meander Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amorphous thin film superconductors are promising alternatives for the development of superconducting radiation detectors, especially superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) and superconducting microwire single photon detectors (SWSPDs), due to their homogeneous nature, ease of deposition, and superconducting parameters comparable to the materials currently being used. A study on the optimization of the growth technology and superconducting transition temperature (TC) of MoSi thin films grown on SiO2 coated Si substrate is reported here. These films have been synthesized by co sputtering of Mo and Si targets with varying compositions and thicknesses to achieve optimized TC values close to that of the bulk. Mo80Si20 and Mo83Si17 compositions of the film, each with a thickness of 17 nm, exhibited the highest TC of 6.4 K and 5.9 K, respectively. Additionally, a meander structure with a 17 um wire width was patterned to estimate the transport critical current density (JC), which was measured to be 1.4E9 A per m2 at 4 K. Variation of the TC with film thickness and deposition pressure has been studied. Electrical resistance as a function of temperature of the film before and after meandering was also studied. These properties are compatible with the fabrication of superconducting nanowire, microwire and wide strip single photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Superconducting gap structures in wallpaper fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the superconducting gap structures in wallpaper fermions, which are surface states of topological nonsymmorphic crystalline insulators, based on a two-dimensional effective model. A symmetry analysis identifies six types of momentum-independent pair potentials. One hosts a point node, two host line nodes, and the remaining three are fully gapped. By classifying the Bogoliubov--de Gennes Hamiltonian in the zero-dimensional symmetry class, we show that the point and line nodes are protected by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariants. In addition, for the twofold-rotation-odd pair potential, nodes appear on the glide-invariant line and are protected by crystalline symmetries, as clarified by the Mackey--Bradley theorem.</description>

      <title>Half-filled metal and molecular-orbital-mediated pairing in cuprate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cuprates exhibit anomalous momentum-space structure with antinodal gap and nodal arc in the underdoped regime, which evolves into a complete hole-type Fermi surface with a large Luttinger volume in the overdoped regime. The real-space electronic structure is also quite complex, as characterized by microscopic inhomogeneities and intertwined density wave orders. Here we show that doped holes in cuprate form localized electronic molecules consisting of 4a0 plaquettes, and each plaquette contains approximately two holes. The effective local doping level is thus around 1/8, which is sufficient to destroy the underlying AF order and more importantly, recovers the half-filled metallic state of the original CuO2 plane. The restored Fermi surface, hosting one hole per unit cell, is consistent with experimental results and satisfies the Luttinger theorem. We then construct the momentum-space structure of the half-filled metal by considering the real-space configuration of electronic molecules. We show that the electronic potential with 4a0 periodicity imposed by the plaquettes and the quantum size effect of electronic molecules obliterate the nested antinodal Fermi surface sheets, leaving behind short arcs with coherent quasiparticles around the node. We propose that two doped holes in each plaquette occupy the shared molecular orbital and form a spin singlet, which can mediate the pairing of itinerant holes on the remnant Fermi surface of the half-filled metal. The electric dipole moment between the molecular orbitals and the dopant ions may also provide a novel attractive interaction between itinerant holes. This phenomenological model for pair formation between itinerant holes on the half-filled Fermi surface mediated by localized molecular orbitals resolves several core issues concerning the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprates.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Nernst Effect from Berry Curvature in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nernst effect in superconductors is typically linked to fluctuating Cooper pairs above $T_c$ or vortex motion below $T_c$. We show instead that Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles can generate an intrinsic Nernst response in a clean, vortex-free superconducting state. Focusing on two-dimensional (2D) systems with Ising spin-orbit coupling, relevant to transition-metal dichalcogenides, we identify two regimes: an intervalley $s$-wave paired state where a weak magnetic field activates the effect, and an intravalley chiral $p$-wave paired state that exhibits a spontaneous charge or spin Nernst response without a field. We propose an experimental setup that circumvents screening and provide estimates of the signal magnitude. Our results establish the Nernst effect as a direct probe of Berry curvature and pairing symmetry in 2D spin-orbit-coupled superconductors.</description>

      <title>Strong-coupling superconductivity near Gross-Neveu quantum criticality in Dirac systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions at neutrality, coupled to bosonic modes through a Yukawa interaction. We then examine the intriguing possibility that such a system, devoid of carriers at zero temperature, might nevertheless exhibit superconductivity. Remarkably, we find that superconductivity emerges in the vicinity of Gross-Neveu quantum criticality, provided the fermions cease to behave as well-defined quasiparticles, that is, once their anomalous dimension in the normal state becomes sufficiently large. In other words, well-defined fermions do not superconduct, whereas ill-defined ones do. We analyze four symmetry-distinct bosonic modes, each capable of driving normal-state criticality and, in three of the four cases, giving rise to a distinct superconducting phase. While phase fluctuations are strong in this regime, we argue that they do not destroy the superconducting state. We further characterize the resulting pairing states for a concrete Dirac model of spin-orbit coupled systems with orbitals of different parity. Our results are obtained using the SYK-inspired framework for Dirac systems introduced by Kim et al.[1], which provides a controlled approach to the strongly coupled regime of Dirac fluids near Gross-Neveu criticality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fully tunable flux qubits offer in-situ and independent controls of their energy potential asymmetry and tunnel barrier, making them versatile tools for quantum computation and the study of decoherence sources. However, only short coherence times have been demonstrated so far with this type of qubit. Here, we present a capacitively shunted flux qubit featuring improved relaxation times up to T1 = 25 $\mu$s and a frequency tunability range of $\sim$ 20 GHz at the flux-insensitive sweet spot. As a model application, we demonstrate detection of two-level tunneling defects in a frequency range spanning one octave.</description>

      <title>The diffusion-driven orthorhombic to tetragonal transition in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ derived with a machine learning interatomic potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defects in high temperature superconductors such as YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ (YBCO) critically influence their superconducting behavior, as they substantially degrade or even suppress superconductivity. With the renewed interest in cuprates for next-generation superconducting magnets operating in radiation-harsh environments such as fusion reactors and particle accelerators, accurate atomistic modeling of defects and their dynamics has become essential. Here, we present a general-purpose machine-learning interatomic potential for YBCO, based on the Atomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) method and trained on Density Functional Theory (DFT) data, with particular emphasis on defects and their diffusion mechanisms. The potential is validated against DFT calculations of ground-state properties, defect formation energies of oxygen Frenkel pairs and diffusion barriers for their formation. Remarkably, the potential captures the diffusion-driven orthorhombic to tetragonal transition at elevated temperatures, a transformation that is difficult to describe with empirical potentials, elucidating how the formation of oxygen Frenkel pairs in the basal plane governs this order-disorder transition. The ACE potential introduced here enables large-scale, predictive atomistic simulations of defect dynamics and transport processes in YBCO, providing a powerful tool to explore its stability, performance, and functionality under realistic operating conditions. Moreover, this work proves that machine learning interatomic potentials are suitable for studies of quaternary oxides with complex chemistry.</description>

      <title>From Shapiro steps to photon-assisted tunneling in microwave-driven atomic-scale Josephson junctions with a single (magnetic) adatom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-small Josephson junctions are strongly influenced by noise and damping due to energy dissipation into the environment, which are expected to suppress phase coherence. Here, we investigate the coherence properties of atomic-scale Josephson junctions in a scanning tunneling microscope under microwave excitation. Plain Pb-Pb junctions exhibit hysteretic Shapiro steps as signature of a coherent resonant state. With increasing AC amplitude, phase coherence is reduced due to an increase of thermal fluctuations. In the presence of magnetic adatoms the Josephson coupling energy is reduced and quasi-particle tunneling is enhanced. With AC driving we observe a rapid suppression of coherence that we ascribe to photon-assisted quasi-particle tunneling through Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states. Our results highlight the presence of phase coherence and shed light on the origin of the transition to incoherent transport, thereby revealing the importance of controlling dissipation in nanoscale superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Non-local edge mode hybridization in the long-range interacting Kitaev chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26447v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In one-dimensional p-wave superconductors with short-range interactions, topologically protected Majorana modes emerge, whose mass decays exponentially with system size, as first shown by Kitaev. In this work, we extend this prototypical model by including power law long-range interactions within a self-consistent framework, leading to the self-consistent long-range Kitaev chain (seco-LRKC). In this model, the gap matrix acquires a rich structure where short-range superconducting correlations coexist with long-range correlations that are exponentially localized at both chain edges simultaneously. As a direct consequence, the topological edge modes hybridize even if their wavefunction overlap vanishes, and the edge mode mass inherits the asymptotic scaling of the interaction. In contrast to models with imposed power law pairing, where massive Dirac modes emerge for exponents $\nu &lt; d$, we analytically motivate and numerically demonstrate that, in the fully self-consistent model, algebraic edge mode decay with system size persists for all interaction exponents $\nu &gt; 0$, despite exponential wave function localization. While the edge mode remains massless in the thermodynamic limit, finite-size corrections can be experimentally relevant in mesoscopic systems with effective long-range interactions that decay sufficiently slowly.</description>

      <title>Universal electronic structure of multi-layered nickelates via oxygen-centered planar orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconductivity has been demonstrated in the family of multi-layered nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. Key questions remain open regarding the low-energy electronic states that support superconductivity in these compounds. Here we take advantage of the natural polymorphism between bilayer (2222) and alternating monolayer-trilayer (1313) stacking sequences that arises in bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ crystals, and by employing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) we identify a universal low-energy electronic structure in this family of materials. We observe the fingerprint of a doping-dependent spin-density wave (SDW) instability -- strong and coherent enough to reconstruct the Fermi surface, both by gapping out regions of the low-energy electronic structure as well as translating the $\beta$ pocket by a vector $Q_{t\beta}$ consistent with the results of previous neutron and x-ray scattering experiments. Using an effective tight-binding model, we simulate the spectral weight distribution observed in our ARPES dichroism experiments and establish that the low-energy electronic phenomenology is dominated by oxygen-centered planar orbitals, which evolve from the $d_{3x^2-r^2}$ and $d_{3y^2-r^2}$ symmetry characteristic of 3-spin polarons (3SP) to the familiar $d_{x^2-y^2}$ Zhang-Rice singlets (ZRS) that support high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates. By inclusion of magnetic moments on plaquettes of oxygen orbitals in our model, we show that ZRS-like states mediate the SDW. Combined with the observation that oxygen annealing is required to induce superconductivity in both thin films and bulk La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, this demonstrates that the ZRS population dictates whether the ground state favors density-wave order or superconductivity -- with hole doping suppressing the former and stabilizing the latter, as in the cuprates.</description>

      <title>Ratchet Hall Effect in Fluctuating Superconductors</title>

Abstract: We propose a superconducting ratchet-induced Hall effect (RHE), characterized by the emergence of a unidirectional, rectified flux of fluctuating Cooper pairs in a two-dimensional thin film exposed to an external electromagnetic field. The RHE is a second-order response with respect to the electromagnetic field amplitude. It consists of a nonzero photocurrent due to the breaking of the system's inversion symmetry driven by the combined action of the in-plane time-dependent electric field and a spatial modulation of the critical temperature. We explore a means to control the electric current by the polarization of the external field accompanied by a non-linear Hall effect of fluctuating Cooper pairs caused by circularly polarized irradiation. Moreover, the nonlinear conductivity tensor exhibits a higher-power dependence on the reduced temperature compared to that of the conventional Aslamazov-Larkin correction (or other fluctuating second-order nonlinear responses). It results in a dramatic enhancement of the non-linear Hall response of fluctuating Cooper pairs in the vicinity of the superconducting criticality.</description>

      <title>The Two-Dimensional Rashba-Holstein Model: A Quantum Monte Carlo Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) on the formation of charge-density wave (CDW) and superconducting (SC) phases in the Holstein model on a half-filled square lattice. Using unbiased finite-temperature Quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we go beyond mean-field approaches to determine the ground state order parameter as a function of RSOC and phonon frequency. Our results reveal that the Rashba metal is unstable due to particle-hole instabilities, favoring the emergence of a CDW phase for any RSOC value. In the limit of a pure Rashba hopping, the model exhibits a distinct behavior with the appearance of four Weyl cones at half-filling, where quantum phase transitions are expected to occur at strong interactions. Indeed, a quantum phase transition, belonging to the Gross-Neveu Ising universality class between a semi-metal and CDW emerges at finite phonon frequency dependent coupling $\lambda_c$. In the antiadiabatic limit we observe an enhanced symmetry in the infrared that unifies SC and CDW orders. These results advance our understanding of competing CDW and SC phases in systems with spin-orbit coupling, providing insights that may help clarify the behavior of related materials.</description>
