      <title>Leveraging the Spatial Hierarchy: Coarse-to-fine Trajectory Generation via Cascaded Hybrid Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban mobility data has significant connections with economic growth and plays an essential role in various smart-city applications. However, due to privacy concerns and substantial data collection costs, fine-grained human mobility trajectories are difficult to become publicly available on a large scale. A promising solution to address this issue is trajectory synthesizing. However, existing works often ignore the inherent structural complexity of trajectories, unable to handle complicated high-dimensional distributions and generate realistic fine-grained trajectories. In this paper, we propose Cardiff, a coarse-to-fine Cascaded hybrid diffusion-based trajectory synthesizing framework for fine-grained and privacy-preserving mobility generation. By leveraging the hierarchical nature of urban mobility, Cardiff decomposes the generation process into two distinct levels, i.e., discrete road segment-level and continuous fine-grained GPS-level: (i) In the segment-level, to reduce computational costs and redundancy in raw trajectories, we first encode the discrete road segments into low-dimensional latent embeddings and design a diffusion transformer-based latent denoising network for segment-level trajectory synthesis. (ii) Taking the first stage of generation as conditions, we then design a fine-grained GPS-level conditional denoising network with a noise augmentation mechanism to achieve robust and high-fidelity generation. Additionally, the Cardiff framework not only progressively generates high-fidelity trajectories through cascaded denoising but also flexibly enables a tunable balance between privacy preservation and utility. Experimental results on three large real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in various metrics.</description>

      <title>Scalable Attribute-Missing Graph Clustering via Neighborhood Differentiatio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep graph clustering (DGC), which aims to unsupervisedly separate the nodes in an attribute graph into different clusters, has seen substantial potential in various industrial scenarios like community detection and recommendation. However, the real-world attribute graphs, e.g., social networks interactions, are usually large-scale and attribute-missing. To solve these two problems, we propose a novel DGC method termed \underline{\textbf{C}}omplementary \underline{\textbf{M}}ulti-\underline{\textbf{V}}iew \underline{\textbf{N}}eighborhood \underline{\textbf{D}}ifferentiation (\textit{CMV-ND}), which preprocesses graph structural information into multiple views in a complete but non-redundant manner. First, to ensure completeness of the structural information, we propose a recursive neighborhood search that recursively explores the local structure of the graph by completely expanding node neighborhoods across different hop distances. Second, to eliminate the redundancy between neighborhoods at different hops, we introduce a neighborhood differential strategy that ensures no overlapping nodes between the differential hop representations. Then, we construct $K+1$ complementary views from the $K$ differential hop representations and the features of the target node. Last, we apply existing multi-view clustering or DGC methods to the views. Experimental results on six widely used graph datasets demonstrate that CMV-ND significantly improves the performance of various methods.</description>

      <title>H-NeiFi: Non-Invasive and Consensus-Efficient Multi-Agent Opinion Guidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The openness of social media enables the free exchange of opinions, but it also presents challenges in guiding opinion evolution towards global consensus. Existing methods often directly modify user views or enforce cross-group connections. These intrusive interventions undermine user autonomy, provoke psychological resistance, and reduce the efficiency of global consensus. Additionally, due to the lack of a long-term perspective, promoting local consensus often exacerbates divisions at the macro level. To address these issues, we propose the hierarchical, non-intrusive opinion guidance framework, H-NeiFi. It first establishes a two-layer dynamic model based on social roles, considering the behavioral characteristics of both experts and non-experts. Additionally, we introduce a non-intrusive neighbor filtering method that adaptively controls user communication channels. Using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), we optimize information propagation paths through a long-term reward function, avoiding direct interference with user interactions. Experiments show that H-NeiFi increases consensus speed by 22.0% to 30.7% and maintains global convergence even in the absence of experts. This approach enables natural and efficient consensus guidance by protecting user interaction autonomy, offering a new paradigm for social network governance.</description>

      <title>Patterns, Models, and Challenges in Online Social Media: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of digital platforms has enabled the large scale observation of individual and collective behavior through high resolution interaction data. This development has opened new analytical pathways for investigating how information circulates, how opinions evolve, and how coordination emerges in online environments. Yet despite a growing body of research, the field remains fragmented and marked by methodological heterogeneity, limited model validation, and weak integration across domains. This survey offers a systematic synthesis of empirical findings and formal models. We examine platform-level regularities, assess the methodological architectures that generate them, and evaluate the extent to which current modeling frameworks account for observed dynamics. The goal is to consolidate a shared empirical baseline and clarify the structural constraints that shape inference in this domain, laying the groundwork for more robust, comparable, and actionable analyses of online social systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Dynamics of Conspiracy Related German Telegram Conversations during COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conspiracy theories have long drawn public attention, but their explosive growth on platforms like Telegram during the COVID-19 pandemic raises pressing questions about their impact on societal trust, democracy, and public health. We provide a geographical, temporal and network analysis of the structure of of conspiracy-related German-language Telegram chats in a novel large-scale data set. We examine how information flows between regional user groups and influential broadcasting channels, revealing the interplay between decentralized discussions and content spread driven by a small number of key actors.
  Our findings reveal that conspiracy-related activity spikes during major COVID-19-related events, correlating with societal stressors and mirroring prior research on how crises amplify conspiratorial beliefs. By analysing the interplay between regional, national and transnational chats, we uncover how information flows from larger national or transnational discourse to localised, community-driven discussions. Furthermore, we find that the top 10% of chats account for 94% of all forwarded content, portraying the large influence of a few actors in disseminating information. However, these chats operate independently, with minimal interconnection between each other, primarily forwarding messages to low-traffic groups. Notably, 43% of links shared in the data set point to untrustworthy sources as identified by NewsGuard, a proportion far exceeding their share on other platforms and in other discourse contexts, underscoring the role of conspiracy-related discussions on Telegram as vector for the spread of misinformation.</description>

      <title>Linking Multi-Site Sex Ad Data at the Individual Level to Aid Counter-Trafficking Efforts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Internet facilitates sex trafficking through adult service websites (ASWs) that host online advertisements for sexual services (sex ads). Since the closure of the popular site Backpage.com, the ecosystem of ASWs has expanded to include multiple competing sites that are hosted outside US jurisdiction. Gaining intelligence for counter-trafficking efforts requires collecting, linking, and cleaning the data from multiple sites. However, high ad volumes, disparate data types, and the existence of generic and misappropriated data make this process challenging. We present an end-to-end process for linking sex ad data and filtering potentially erroneous links. Outputs of the developed process have been used to inform counter-trafficking operations that have helped identify more than 60 potential victims of sex trafficking, some of whom are getting help to transition out of the life. Our process leverages concepts and techniques from network science, information systems, and artificial intelligence to link ads across sites at the level of an individual or unique posting entity. Our approach is computationally efficient, allowing millions of ads to be processed in under an hour. A key component of our process is an edge filtering procedure that identifies and removes potentially erroneous links in a graph representation of sex ad data. A comparison of the proposed process to an existing approach shows that our process is typically more computationally efficient and yields substantial increases in the number of individuals for which we can derive actionable intelligence. The proposed process is an efficient and effective approach for transforming the high volumes of disparate data from sex ads into intelligence that can save lives. It has been refined over years of collaboration with practitioners and represents a strong foundation upon which further counter-trafficking tools can be built.</description>

      <title>LLM-Based Community Surveys for Operational Decision Making in Interconnected Utility Infrastructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We represent interdependent infrastructure systems and communities alike with a hetero-functional graph (HFG) that encodes the dependencies between functionalities. This graph naturally imposes a partial order of functionalities that can inform the sequence of repair decisions to be made during a disaster across affected communities. However, using such technical criteria alone provides limited guidance at the point where the functionalities directly impact the communities, since these can be repaired in any order without violating the system constraints. To address this gap and improve resilience, we integrate community preferences to refine this partial order from the HFG into a total order. Our strategy involves getting the communities' opinions on their preferred sequence for repair crews to address infrastructure issues, considering potential constraints on resources. Due to the delay and cost associated with real-world survey data, we utilize a Large Language Model (LLM) as a proxy survey tool. We use the LLM to craft distinct personas representing individuals, each with varied disaster experiences. We construct diverse disaster scenarios, and each simulated persona provides input on prioritizing infrastructure repair needs across various communities. Finally, we apply learning algorithms to generate a global order based on the aggregated responses from these LLM-generated personas.</description>

      <title>Duplicating Deceit: Inauthentic Behavior Among Indian Misinformation Duplicators on X/Twitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates inauthentic duplication on social media, where multiple accounts share identical misinformation tweets. Leveraging a dataset of misinformation verified by AltNews, an Indian fact-checking organization, we analyze over 12 million posts from 5,493 accounts known to have duplicated such content. Contrary to common assumptions that bots are primarily responsible for spreading false information, fewer than 1\% of these accounts exhibit bot-like behavior. We present TweeXster, a framework for detecting and analyzing duplication campaigns, revealing clusters of accounts involved in repeated and sometimes revived dissemination of false or abusive content.</description>

      <title>Automated Route-based Conflation Between Linear Referencing System Maps And OpenStreetMap Using Open-source Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transportation researchers and planners utilize a wide range of roadway metrics that are usually associated with different basemaps. Conflation is an important process for transferring these metrics onto a single basemap. However, conflation is often an expensive and time-consuming process based on proprietary algorithms that require manual verification.
  In this paper, an automated open-source process is used to conflate two basemaps: the linear reference system (LRS) basemap produced by the Virginia Department of Transportation and the OpenStreetMap (OSM) basemap for Virginia. This process loads one LRS route at a time, determines the correct direction of travel, interpolates to fill gaps larger than 12 meters, and then uses Valhalla's map-matching algorithm to find the corresponding points along OSM's segments. Valhalla's map-matching process uses a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Viterbi search-based approach to find the most likely OSM segments matching the LRS route.
  This work has three key contributions. First, it conflates the Virginia roadway network LRS map with OSM using an automated conflation method based on HMM and Viterbi search. Second, it demonstrates a novel open-source processing pipeline that could be replicated without the need for proprietary licenses. Finally, the overall conflation process yields over 98% successful matches, which is an improvement over most automated processes currently available for this type of conflation.</description>

      <title>Evaluating link prediction: New perspectives and recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12777v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Link prediction (LP) is an important problem in network science and machine learning research. The state-of-the-art LP methods are usually evaluated in a uniform setup, ignoring several factors associated with the data and application specific needs. We identify a number of such factors, such as, network-type, problem-type, geodesic distance between the end nodes and its distribution over the classes, nature and applicability of LP methods, class imbalance and its impact on early retrieval, evaluation metric, etc., and present an experimental setup which allows us to evaluate LP methods in a rigorous and controlled manner. We perform extensive experiments with a variety of LP methods over real network datasets in this controlled setup, and gather valuable insights on the interactions of these factors with the performance of LP through an array of carefully designed hypotheses. Following the insights, we provide recommendations to be followed as best practice for evaluating LP methods.</description>

      <title>Rumour Spreading Depends on the Latent Geometry and Degree Distribution in Social Network Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01268v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study push-pull rumour spreading in ultra-small-world models for social networks where the degrees follow a power-law distribution. In a non-geometric setting, Fountoulakis, Panagiotou and Sauerwald have shown that rumours always spread ultra-fast (SODA 2012), i.e. in doubly logarithmic time. On the other hand, Janssen and Mehrabian have found that rumours spread slowly (polynomial time) in a spatial preferential attachment model (SIDMA 2017). We study the question systematically for the model of Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs (GIRGs). Our results are two-fold: first, with Euclidean geometry slow, fast (polylogarithmic) and ultra-fast rumour spreading may occur, depending on the exponent of the power law and the strength of the geometry in the networks, and we fully characterise the phase boundaries in between. The regimes do not coincide with the graph distance regimes, i.e., polylogarithmic or even polynomial rumour spreading may occur even if graph distances are doubly logarithmic. We expect these results to hold with little effort for related models, e.g. Scale-Free Percolation. Second, we show that rumour spreading is always (at least) fast in a non-metric geometry. The considered non-metric geometry allows to model social connections where resemblance of vertices in a single attribute, such as familial kinship, already strongly indicates the presence of an edge. Euclidean geometry fails to capture such ties.
  For some regimes in the Euclidean setting, the efficient pathways for spreading rumours differ from previously identified paths. For example, a vertex of degree $d$ can transmit the rumour to a vertex of larger degree by a chain of length $3$, where one of the two intermediaries has constant degree, and the other has degree $d^{c}$ for some constant $c&lt;1$. Similar but longer chains of vertices, all having non-constant degree, turn out to be useful as well.</description>

      <title>Modelling the spillover from online engagement to offline protest: stochastic dynamics and mean-field approximations on networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social media is transforming various aspects of offline life, from everyday decisions such as dining choices to the progression of conflicts. In this study, we propose a coupled modelling framework with an online social network layer to analyse how engagement on a specific topic spills over into offline protest activities. We develop a stochastic model and derive several mean-field models of varying complexity. These models allow us to estimate the reproductive number and anticipate when surges in activity are likely to occur. A key factor is the transmission rate between the online and offline domains; for offline outbursts to emerge, this rate must fall within a critical range, neither too low nor too high. Additionally, using synthetic networks, we examine how network structure influences the accuracy of these approximations. Our findings indicate that low-density networks need more complex approximations, whereas simpler models can effectively represent higher-density networks. When tested on two real-world networks, however, increased complexity did not enhance accuracy.</description>
