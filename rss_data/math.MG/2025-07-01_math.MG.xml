      <title>Some Mathematical Problems Behind Lattice-Based Cryptography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1994, P. Shor discovered quantum algorithms which can break both the RSA cryptosystem and the ElGamal cryptosystem. In 2007, D-Wave demonstrated the first quantum computer. These events and further developments have brought a crisis to secret communication. In 2016, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) launched a global project to solicit and select a handful of encryption algorithms with the ability to resist quantum computer attacks. In 2022, it announced four candidates, CRYSTALS-Kyber, CRYSTALS-Dilithium, Falcon and Sphincs$+$ for post-quantum cryptography standards. The first three are based on lattice theory and the last on the Hash function. It is well known that the security of the lattice-based cryptosystems relies on the computational complexity of the shortest vector problem (SVP), the closest vector problem (CVP) and their generalizations. In fact, the SVP is a ball packing problem and the CVP is a ball covering problem. Furthermore, both SVP and CVP are equivalent to arithmetic problems for positive definite quadratic forms. Therefore, post-quantum cryptography provides unprecedented opportunities for mathematicians to make contributions in modern technology. This paper will briefly review the mathematical problems on which the lattice-based cryptography is built up, so that mathematicians can see that they are indeed in the game.</description>

      <title>On the Unimodular Isomorphism Problem of Convex Lattice Polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the \emph{unimodular isomorphism problem} (UIP) of convex lattice polytopes: given two convex lattice polytopes $P$ and $P'$, decide whether there exists a unimodular affine transformation mapping $P$ to $P'$. We show that UIP is graph isomorphism hard, while the polytope congruence problem and the combinatorial polytope isomorphism problem (Akutsu, 1998; Kaibel, Schwartz, 2003) were shown to be graph isomorphism complete, and both the lattice isomorphism problem ( $\mathrm{Sikiri\acute{c}}$, $\mathrm{Sch\ddot{u}rmann}$, Vallentin, 2009) and the projective/affine polytope isomorphism problem (Kaibel, Schwartz, 2003) were shown to be graph isomorphism hard. Furthermore, inspired by protocols for lattice (non-) isomorphism (Ducas, van Woerden, 2022; Haviv, Regev, 2014), we present a statistical zero-knowledge proof system for unimodular isomorphism of lattice polytopes. Finally, we propose an algorithm that given two lattice polytopes computes all unimodular affine transformations mapping one polytope to another and, in particular, decides UIP.</description>

      <title>Escher Tile Deformation via Closed-Form Solution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23388v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a real-time deformation method for Escher tiles -- interlocking organic forms that seamlessly tessellate the plane following symmetry rules. We formulate the problem as determining a periodic displacement field. The goal is to deform Escher tiles without introducing gaps or overlaps. The resulting displacement field is obtained in closed form by an analytical solution. Our method processes tiles of 17 wallpaper groups across various representations such as images and meshes. Rather than treating tiles as mere boundaries, we consider them as textured shapes, ensuring that both the boundary and interior deform simultaneously. To enable fine-grained artistic input, our interactive tool features a user-controllable adaptive fall-off parameter, allowing precise adjustment of locality and supporting deformations with meaningful semantic control. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method through various examples, including photo editing and shape sculpting, showing its use in applications such as fabrication and animation.</description>

      <title>Spaces of polygonal triangulations and Monsky polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a combinatorial triangulation of an $n$-gon, we study (a) the space of all possible drawings in the plane such the edges are straight line segments and the boundary has a fixed shape, and (b) the algebraic variety of possibilities for the areas of the triangles in such drawings. We define a generalized notion of triangulation, and we show that the areas of the triangles in a generalized triangulation $\T$ of a square must satisfy a single irreducible homogeneous polynomial relation $p(\T)$ depending only on the combinatorics of $\T$. The invariant $p(\T)$ is called the \emph{Monsky polynomial}; it captures algebraic, geometric, and combinatorial information about $\T$. We give an algorithm that computes a lower bound on the degree of $p(\T)$, and we present several examples in which the algorithm is used to compute the degree.</description>

      <title>Quasi-isometric embeddings of Ramanujan complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ramanujan complexes were defined as high dimensional analogues of the optimal expanders, Ramanujan graphs. They were constructed as quotients of the Euclidean building (also called the affine building and the Bruhat-Tits building) of $\mathrm{PGL}_d(\mathbb{F}_p((y)))$ for any prime $p$ by Lubotzky-Samuels-Vishne. We distinguish the Ramanujan complexes up to large-scale geometry. More precisely, we show that if $p$ and $q$ are distinct primes, then the associated Ramanujan complexes do not quasi-isometrically embed into one another. The main tools are the box space rigidity of Khukhro-Valette and the Euclidean building rigidity of Kleiner-Leeb and Fisher-Whyte.</description>

      <title>A Minkowski problem for $\alpha$-concave functions via optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14735v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notions of the Euclidean surface area measure and the spherical surface area measure of $\alpha$-concave functions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with $-\frac{1}{n}&lt;\alpha&lt;0$, are introduced via a first variation of the total mass functional with respect to the $\alpha$-sum operation. Subsequently, these notions are extended to those for $\alpha$-concave measures. We then study the Minkowski problem associated with the Euclidean surface area measures of $\alpha$-concave measures via optimal transport.</description>
