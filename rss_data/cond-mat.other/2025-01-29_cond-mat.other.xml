      <title>Crosstalk analysis in single hole-spin qubits within highly anisotropic g-tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin qubits based on valence band hole states are highly promising for quantum information processing due to their strong spin-orbit coupling and ultrafast operation speed. As these systems scale up, achieving high-fidelity single-qubit operations becomes essential. However, mitigating crosstalk effects from neighboring qubits in larger arrays, particularly for anisotropic qubits with strong spin-orbit coupling, presents a significant challenge. We investigate the impact of crosstalk on qubit fidelities during single-qubit operations and derive an analytical equation that serves as a synchronization condition to eliminate crosstalk in anisotropic media. Our analysis proposes optimized driving field conditions that can robustly synchronize Rabi oscillations and minimize crosstalk, showing a strong dependence on qubit anisotropy and the orientation of the external magnetic field. Taking experimental data into our analysis, we identify a set of parameter values that enable nearly crosstalk-free single-qubit gates, thereby paving the way for scalable quantum computing architectures.</description>

      <title>Tunable quantum light by modulated free electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonclassical states of light are fundamental in various applications, spanning quantum computation to enhanced sensing. Fast free electrons, which emit light into photonic structures through the mechanism of spontaneous emission, represent a promising platform for generating diverse types of states. Indeed, the intrinsic connection between the input electron wave function and the output light field suggests that electron-shaping schemes, based on light-induced scattering, facilitates their synthesis. In this article, we present a theoretical framework capable of predicting the final optical density matrix of a generic N-electron state that can also account for post-sample energy filtering. By using such framework, we study the modulation-dependent fluctuations of the N-electron emission and identify regions of Poissonian and super-Poissonian statistics. In the single-electron case, we show how coherent states with nearly 90% purity can be formed by pre-filtering a portion of the spectrum after modulation, and how non-Gaussian states are generated after a precise energy measurement. Furthermore, we present a strategy combining a single-stage electron modulation and post-filtering to harness tailored light states, such as squeezed vacuum, cat, and triangular cat states, with fidelity close to 100%.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic galvanomagnetic effects in single-crystal Fe(001) films elucidated by a phenomenological theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the phenomenological theory based on crystal symmetry operation, we have established the complete angular dependencies of the galvanomagnetic effects, encompassing both anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE), for the ferromagnetic films with C4v symmetry. These dependencies were experimentally confirmed via comprehensive angular-mapping of AMR and PHE in single-crystal Fe(001) films at room temperature. We demonstrated that the intrinsic magnetization-induced effects are independent of the field strength by carefully separating the field-induced and magnetization-induced galvanomagnetic effects. Our theoretical and experimental findings highlight the absence of in-plane four-fold angular dependence in PHE, a feature prohibited by the Onsager relation in systems with C4 symmetry. This study affirms that the universal angular dependencies of AMR and PHE in single crystals can be accurately predicted by the conventional phenomenological theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical deconfinement transition driven by density of excitations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02320v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the deconfinement transition driven by excitations in long-range spin models. At low temperatures, these models exhibit a confined phase where domain-wall (or kinks) are localized. As temperature increases, kinks interact and propagate, leading to a transition to a de-confined phase. This transition is influenced by the interplay between thermal energy and interaction effects, resulting in extended, de-confined regions. Although kinks density is dynamically stable, non-equilibrium changes in their fluctuations characterize the transition. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms of confinement and deconfinement in long-range spin models, with implications for both condensed matter physics and lattice gauge theories. Bridging these fields, this study sheds light on the universal aspects of confinement and opens avenues for further exploration and experimental verification.</description>

      <title>Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts.
  The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.</description>
