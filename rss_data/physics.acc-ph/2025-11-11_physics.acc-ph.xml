      <title>About maximum energy acquired by a charged particles in the field of a plane electromagnetic wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The energy characteristics of a relativistic charged particle in the field of a plane electromagnetic wave of a given amplitude are studied. The dependence of the particle's energy on its phase coordinate is obtained. The maximum value of the particle's energy during acceleration, as well as the acceleration length and time, are determined. The transverse displacement of the particle over the maximum acceleration length is determined.</description>

      <title>Beam Halo Formation via Longitudinal-Transverse Coupling in Continuous-Wave Photoinjectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beam halo formation poses a critical challenge for high-repetition-rate continuous-wave (CW) free-electron lasers (FELs), directly affecting beam quality and machine protection, as observed during the LCLS-II commissioning. We identify and experimentally validate a previously unrecognized three-step mechanism for halo generation in the photoinjector, arising from coupled longitudinal-transverse dynamics in the low-energy beam. Theoretical analysis reveals that (i) the RF buncher induces an energy-radius correlation, (ii) velocity bunching transforms this correlation into hollowed density structures in the bunch head and tail, and (iii) differential overfocusing of these hollowed regions by downstream focusing forms the observed halo. This mechanism is confirmed by particle-in-cell simulations and direct experimental measurements, including controlled formation of a core-ring profile via solenoid tuning. The results establish the physical origin of the halo and demonstrate a mitigation via buncher compression tuning that reduces halo and downstream loss, supporting sustained high-repetition-rate FEL operation.</description>

      <title>Report on first plasma processing trial for a FRIB quarter-wave resonator cryomodule</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma processing has been shown to help mitigate degradation of the performance of superconducting radio-frequency cavities, providing an alternative to removal of cryomodules from the accelerator for refurbishment. Studies of plasma processing for quarter-wave resonators (QWRs) and half-wave resonators (HWRs) are underway at the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams (FRIB), where a total of 324 such resonators are presently in operation. Plasma processing tests were done on several QWRs using the fundamental power coupler (FPC) to drive the plasma, with promising results. Driving the plasma with a higher-order mode allows for less mismatch at the FPC and higher plasma density. The first plasma processing trial for FRIB QWRs in a cryomodule was conducted in January 2024. Cold tests of the cryomodule showed a significant reduction in field emission X-rays after plasma processing.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Control Systems with GitOps: A Path to Automation and Reliability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GitOps is a foundational approach for modernizing infrastructure by leveraging Git as the single source of truth for declarative configurations. The poster explores how GitOps transforms traditional control system infrastructure, services and applications by enabling fully automated, auditable, and version-controlled infrastructure management. Cloud-native and containerized environments are shifting the ecosystem not only in the IT industry but also within the computational science field, as is the case of CERN [1] and Diamond Light Source [2] among other Accelerator/Science facilities which are slowly shifting towards modern software and infrastructure paradigms. The ACORN project, which aims to modernize Fermilab's control system infrastructure and software is implementing proven best-practices and cutting-edge technology standards including GitOps, containerization, infrastructure as code and modern data pipelines for control system data acquisition and the inclusion of AI/ML in our accelerator complex.</description>

      <title>Beam-commissioning-oriented optics study of HFRS Phase-I based on measured magnetic field data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14343v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The construction of the first phase of the High energy FRagment Separator (HFRS Phase-I) has already been completed and it is anticipated to start beam commissioning in autumn 2025. This paper presents the first order and higher order beam optics calculations for the HFRS Phase-I, using measured magnet data, and evaluates its experimental performance in preparation for beam commissioning. The first order optics of HFRS is calculated based on the sliced magnetic fields and the higher order aberrations are corrected using a self-compiled program. Monte Carlo particle tracking is employed to analyze the beam phase spaces on the focal planes. The experimental performance of the machine is evaluated through Monte Carlo simulations. The beam phase spaces on the focal planes are thoroughly examined, demonstrating that the higher order aberrations have been well corrected. Moreover, the experimental performance of HFRS is evaluated based on the corrected higher order optics, yielding satisfactory results: the secondary beams of interest can be well separated and exhibit high transmission efficiency. This work provides valuable insights for the upcoming beam commissioning of HFRS Phase-I. The effective correction of higher order aberrations and optimized magnet settings lay a solid foundation for future experiments.</description>

      <title>A further study on the high-precision optics for HIAF-BRing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The High Intensity heavy ion Accelerator Facility (HIAF) successfully accelerated the 18O6+ beam on October 27, 2025. This paper presents a further simulation study on the high-precision optics, namely sliced optics, of the Booster Ring (BRing) at HIAF based on measured magnetic fields, focusing on three aspects: (1) closed-orbit distortion (COD) and variations in optical parameters induced by errors; (2) closed-orbit correction; (3) dynamic aperture. Specifically, detailed investigations are conducted on COD and optical parameter variations caused by magnet alignment errors and dipole magnet field errors, alongside simulations of closed-orbit correction and detailed calculations of BRing's dynamic aperture. Results show the sliced optics outperforms the original optics in COD control. Without chromaticity correction, its dynamic aperture is superior to the original; after chromaticity correction, it remains comparable. This study provides valuable insights for accelerator tuning and optimization.</description>
