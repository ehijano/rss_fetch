      <title>Dark matter effects on the properties of neutron stars: compactness and tidal deformability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically study the observable properties of dark-matter admixed neutron stars, employing a realistic nuclear EOS in combination with self-interacting fermionic dark matter respecting constraints on the self-interaction cross section. Deviations from universal relations valid for nucleonic neutron stars are analyzed over the whole parameter space of the model and unequivocal signals for the presence of dark matter in neutron stars are identified.</description>

      <title>Axion-Polaritons in quark stars: a possible solution to the missing pulsar problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an alternative mechanism to solve the so-called missing pulsar problem, a standing paradox between the theoretical expectations about the number of pulsars that should exist in the galaxy center of the Milky Way and their absence in the observations. The mechanism is based on the transformation of incident $\gamma$ rays into hybridized modes, known as axion-polaritons, which can exist inside highly magnetized quark stars with a quark matter phase known as the magnetic dual chiral density wave phase. This phase, which is favored over several other dense matter phases candidates at densities a few times nuclear saturation density, has already passed several important astrophysical tests. In the proposed mechanism, the absence of young magnetars occurs because as electromagnetic waves inside the star can only propagate through the hybridized modes, incident photons coming from a $\gamma$-ray burst get transformed into massless and massive axion polaritons by the Primakoff effect. Once thermalized, the massive axion-polaritons can self-gravitate up to a situation where their total mass overpasses the Chandrasekhar limit for these bosons, producing a mini blackhole that collapses the star.</description>

      <title>Competition between allowed and first-forbidden $\beta$ decay in $r$-process waiting-point nuclei within a relativistic beyond-mean-field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute $\beta$-decay half-lives of isotonic nuclear chains located at neutron shell closures $N=50$, $82$, $126$ and $184$, which are of particular importance for the $r$-process nucleosynthesis, and study the role of first-forbidden transitions in a framework that includes complex nucleonic correlations beyond the quasiparticle random phase approximation. Such correlations are accounted for by coupling single nucleons to collective degrees of freedom (nuclear vibrations), and are found essential to reproduce available experimental $\beta$-decay rates and more precise many-body methods. We find that the nucleon-vibration correlations tend to decrease the probability of decay via first-forbidden transition near stability, as they enhance Gamow-Teller transitions at low energy. While in the lighter systems allowed transitions dominate, the decay of $N=126$ and $N=184$ nuclei is found to occur to a large extent via first-forbidden transitions, and in particular those induced by $1^-$ and $0^-$ operators. Overall the many-body method based on nucleon-vibration coupling provides an ideal framework for future large-scale calculations. Upcoming experimental measurements of $\beta$-decay rates in the $N=126$ region by radioactive-beam facilities will be crucial in order to validate the approach.</description>

      <title>Time-dependent nuclear energy-density functional theory toolkit for neutron star crust: Dynamics of a nucleus in a neutron superfluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new numerical tool designed to probe the dense layers of neutron star crusts. It is based on the Time-Dependent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory with generalized Skyrme nuclear energy density functionals, such as the Brussels-Montreal ones. We use it to study the time evolution of a nucleus accelerating through superfluid neutron medium in the inner crust of a neutron star. We extract an effective mass in the low velocity limit. We observe a threshold velocity and specify mechanisms of dissipation: phonon emission, Cooper pairs breaking, and vortex rings creation. The microscopic effects we study have impact on neutron star. Moreover, the mechanisms, we described, are general and apply also to other fermionic superfluid mixtures like liquid helium, or ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Determination of nuclear matter radii by means of microscopic optical potentials: the case of $^{78}$Kr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we use microscopic Nucleon-Nucleus Optical Potentials (OP) to analyze elastic scattering data for the differential cross section of the $^{78}$Kr (p,p) $^{78}$Kr reaction, with the goal of extracting the matter radius and estimating the neutron skin, quantities that are both needed to determine the slope parameter $L$ of the nuclear symmetry energy. Our analysis is performed with the factorized version of the microscopic OP obtained in a previous series of papers within the Watson multiple scattering theory at the first order of the spectator expansion, which is based on the underlying nucleon-nucleon dynamics and is free from phenomenological inputs. Differently from our previous applications, the proton and neutron densities are described with a two-parameter Fermi (2pF) distribution, which makes the extraction of the matter radius easier and allows us to make a meaningful comparison with the original analysis, that was performed with the Glauber model. With standard minimization techniques we performed data analysis and extracted the matter radius and the neutron skin. Our analysis produces a matter radius of $R_m^{{\rm (rms)}} = 4.12$ fm, in good agreement with previous matter radii extracted from $^{76}$Kr and $^{80}$Kr, and a neutron skin of $\Delta R_{np} \simeq - 0.1$ fm, compatible with a previous analysis. Our factorized microscopic OP, supplied with 2pF densities, is a valuable tool to perform the analysis of the experimental differential cross section and extract information such as matter radius and neutron skin. Without any free parameters it provides a reasonably good description of the experimental differential cross section for scattering angles up to $\approx$ 40 degrees. Compared to the Glauber model our OP can be applied to a wider range of scattering angles and allows one to probe the nuclear systems in a more internal region.</description>

      <title>Nuclear matrix elements of neutrinoless double-beta decay in covariant density functional theory with different mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) for neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay in candidate nuclei play a crucial role in interpreting results from current experiments and in designing future ones. Accurate NME values serve as important nuclear inputs for constraining parameters in new physics, such as neutrino mass and the Wilson coefficients of lepton-number-violating (LNV) operators. In this study, we present a comprehensive calculation of NMEs for $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in $^{76}$Ge, $^{82}$Se, $^{100}$Mo, $^{130}$Te, and $^{136}$Xe, using nuclear wave functions obtained from multi-reference covariant density functional theory (MR-CDFT). We employ three types of transition potentials at the leading order in chiral effective field theory. Our results, along with recent data, are utilized to constrain the coefficients of LNV operators. We find that NMEs for the standard and short-range mechanisms are significantly larger than those for the non-standard long-range mechanism. The use of NMEs from various nuclear models does not notably change the parameter space intervals for the coefficients, although MR-CDFT yields the most stringent constraint. Furthermore, our NMEs can also be used to perform a more comprehensive analysis with multiple isotopes.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of super-heavy elements in the outer crust of a magnetar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A theoretical understanding of a possible mechanism for synthesizing super-heavy elements in the outer crust of magnetars is presented. We demonstrate that such a mechanism can be present whenever the baryon density in the outer crust of a neutron star reaches values around $10^{-2}$ fm$^{-3}$. This scenario could be realized in magnetars with hypothetical large magnetic fields, $B \geq 10^{18}$ G. Under such conditions, the Coulomb lattice, formed by ionized nuclei, enables a mechanism that synthesizes super-heavy elements.</description>

      <title>Rapid neutron star equation of state inference with Normalising Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first direct detection of gravitational waves from binary neutron stars on the 17th of August, 2017, (GW170817) heralded the arrival of a new messenger for probing neutron star astrophysics and provided the first constraints on neutron star equation of state from gravitational wave observations. Significant computational effort was expended to obtain these first results and therefore, as observations of binary neutron star coalescence become more routine in the coming observing runs, there is a need to improve the analysis speed and flexibility. Here, we present a rapid approach for inferring the neutron star equation of state based on Normalising Flows. As a demonstration, using the same input data, our approach, ASTREOS, produces results consistent with those presented by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration but requires &lt; 1 sec to generate neutron star equation of state confidence intervals. Furthermore, ASTREOS allows for non-parametric equation of state inference. This rapid analysis will not only facilitate neutron star equation of state studies but can potentially enhance future alerts for electromagnetic follow-up observations of binary neutron star mergers.</description>

      <title>Hidden-charm pentaquark states $qqqc\bar{c}$ $(q = u,d)$ in the chiral SU(3) quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically calculate the spectrum of hidden-charm pentaquark states $qqqc\bar{c}$ $(q = u,d)$ in the chiral SU(3) quark model, which has been quite successful in reproducing consistently the energies of octet and decuplet baryon ground states, the binding energy of deuteron, and the nucleon-nucleon ($NN$) scattering phase shifts and mixing parameters for partial waves with total angular momentum up to $J=6$. The Hamiltonian contains the one-gluon-exchange (OGE) potential, the Goldstone-boson-exchange (GBE) potential, the confinement potential, and the kinetic energy of the system. We solve the Schr\"odinger equation by use of the variational method. It is found that the masses of all the experimentally observed $P_c(4312)$, $P_c(4380)$, $P_c(4440)$, and $P_c(4457)$ states are much overestimated, indicating that these states are not compact pentaquark states in the chiral SU(3) quark model. All other $qqqc\bar{c}$ $(q = u,d)$ states are found to lie much above the corresponding baryon-meson thresholds, and thus are not suggested as stable pentaquark states due to their fall-apart decays. A detailed comparison of the results with those obtained in the OGE model and the chromomagnetic interaction (CMI) model is further given.</description>

      <title>Spectra of correlators in the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation time approximation (RTA) of the kinetic Boltzmann equation is likely the simplest window into the microscopic properties of collective real-time transport. Within this framework, we analytically compute all retarded two-point Green's functions of the energy-momentum tensor and a conserved $U(1)$ current in thermal states with classical massless particles (a `CFT') at non-zero density, and in the absence and presence of broken translational symmetry. This is done in $2+1$ and $3+1$ dimensions. RTA allows a full explicit analysis of the analytic structure of different correlators (poles versus branch cuts) and the transport properties that they imply (the thermoelectric conductivities, and the hydrodynamic, quasihydrodynamic and gapped mode dispersion relations). Our inherently weakly coupled analysis thereby also enables a direct comparison with previously known strongly coupled results in holographic CFTs dual to the Einstein-Maxwell-axion theories.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions through two avenues: high-$p_{\perp}$ frameworks and hydrodynamic modeling. Using the T$_{\text{R}}$ENTo model, we find that IP-Glasma mimicking $p=0$ value aligns well with high-$p_{\perp}$ data, in agreement with Bayesian analysis of the low-$p_{\perp}$ regime. While adjusting $p$ values may improve a fit to a particular high-$p_{\perp}$ observable, it does not permit an earlier onset of transverse expansion.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity expression for a graphene system in relaxation time approximation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14747v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have gone through the detailed microscopic calculation of the shear viscosity of a 2-dimensional graphene system in the relaxation time approximation-based kinetic theory framework. After getting its final expressions, we compared it with the shear viscosity expressions of other possible 2-dimensional as well as 3-dimensional nonrelativistic and ultra-relativistic fluid systems. The aim of the comparison is to reveal how their different one-body dispersion relations affect their many-body fluid properties like shear viscosity and the viscosity to entropy density ratio. It is also aimed to reveal the 3-dimension to the 2-dimension transformation of their mathematical structures. We have numerically explored the differences in their order of magnitude and dependence on thermodynamical parameters-temperature and chemical potential. Marking two thermodynamical domains-Dirac fluid and Fermi liquid-for a 2-dimensional graphene system, we have noticed that shear viscosity, entropy density as well as their ratios decrease toward saturated values when one goes from Fermi liquid to Dirac fluid domain. When one shifts from mili-electron volt scales of temperature and chemical potential in condensed matter physics location to their mega-electron volt scales in high energy physics location, then the same results may be expected for hot quark matter case, where the transition from the neutron star to early universe domains may be considered as Fermi liquid to Dirac fluid transition.</description>

Abstract: The total and differential cross sections of elastic proton-proton and proton-antiproton scattering are studied in a holographic QCD model, considering the Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges in the Regge regime. In our model setup, the Pomeron and Reggeon exchanges are described by the Reggeized spin-2 glueball and vector meson propagators, respectively. How those contributions change with the energy is explicitly shown, focusing on the contribution ratios. The adjustable parameters included in the model are determined with the experimental data, and it is presented that the resulting total and differential cross sections are consistent with the data in a wide kinematic region.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05253v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gauge theories, because of their bosonic degrees of freedom, have an infinite-dimensional local Hilbert space. Encoding these degrees of freedom on qubit-based hardware demands some sort of ``qubitization'' scheme, where one approximates the behavior of a theory while using only finitely many degrees of freedom. We propose a novel qubitization strategy for gauge theories, called ``fuzzy gauge theory,'' building on the success of the fuzzy $\sigma$-model in earlier work. We provide arguments that the fuzzy gauge theory lies in the same universality class as regular gauge theory, in which case its use would obviate the need of any further limit besides the usual spatial continuum limit. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these models are relatively resource-efficient for quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Enhanced contribution of the pairing gap to the QCD equation of state at large isospin chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11443v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I study QCD at large isospin density, which is known to be in the superfluid state with Cooper pairs carrying the same quantum number as pions. I solve the gap equation derived from the perturbation theory up to the next-to-leading order corrections. The pairing gap at large isospin chemical potential is found to be enhanced compared to the color-superconducting gap at large baryon chemical potential due to the $\sqrt{2}$ difference in the exponent arising from the stronger attraction in one-gluon exchange in the singlet channel. Then, using the gap function, I evaluate the contribution of the condensation energy of the superfluid state to the QCD equation of state. At isospin chemical potential of a few GeV, where the lattice QCD and the perturbative QCD can be both applied, the effect of the condensation energy becomes dominant even compared to the next-to-leading order corrections to the pressure in the perturbation theory. It resolves the discrepancy between the recent lattice QCD results and the perturbative QCD result.</description>

Abstract: We calculate the mass spectrum of the S-wave fully heavy tetraquark systems $ QQ\bar Q\bar Q~(Q=c,b) $ with both normal $ (J^{PC}=0^{++},1^{+-},2^{++}) $ and exotic $ (J^{PC}=0^{+-},1^{++},2^{+-}) $ C-parities using three different quark potential models (AL1, AP1, BGS). The exotic C-parity systems refer to the ones that cannot be composed of two S-wave ground heavy quarkonia. We incorporate the molecular dimeson and compact diquark-antidiquark spatial correlations simultaneously, thereby discerning the actual configurations of the states. We employ the Gaussian expansion method to solve the four-body Schr\"odinger equation, and the complex scaling method to identify the resonant states. The mass spectra in three different models qualitatively agree with each other. We obtain several resonant states with $ J^{PC} = 0^{++}, 1^{+-}, 2^{++}, 1^{++} $ in the mass region $(6.92,7.30)\, \mathrm{GeV}$, some of which are good candidates of the experimentally observed $X(6900)$ and $X(7200)$. We also obtain several exotic C-parity zero-width states with $ J^{PC}=0^{+-} $ and $ 2^{+-} $. These zero-width states have no corresponding S-wave diquarkonium threshold and can only decay strongly to final states with P-wave quarkonia. With the notation $T_{4Q,J(C)}(M)$, we deduce from the root mean square radii that the $ X(7200) $ candidates $ T_{4c,0(+)}(7173), T_{4c,2(+)}(7214) $ and the state $ T_{4c,1(-)}(7191) $ look like molecular states although most of the resonant and zero-width states are compact states.</description>
