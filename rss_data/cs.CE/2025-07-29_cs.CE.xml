      <title>IFD: A Large-Scale Benchmark for Insider Filing Violation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Insider trading violations, particularly delayed disclosures of Form 4 filings, remain a persistent challenge for financial market surveillance. Despite regulatory requirements such as the two-business-day rule of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), enforcement is limited by the lack of large-scale, labeled datasets and task-specific benchmarks. In this paper, we introduce Insider Filing Delay (IFD), the first and largest publicly available dataset for insider disclosure behavior, comprising over one million Form 4 transactions spanning two decades (2002-2025), with structured annotations on delay status, insider roles, governance factors, and firm-level financial indicators. IFD enables the first large-scale formulation of strategic disclosure violation detection as a binary classification task grounded in regulatory compliance. To demonstrate the utility of IFD, we propose MaBoost, a hybrid framework combining a Mamba-based state space encoder with XGBoost, achieving high accuracy and interpretability in identifying high-risk behavioral patterns. Experiments across statistical baselines, deep learning models, and large language models confirm that MaBoost outperforms prior approaches, achieving an F1-score of up to 99.47% under constrained regulatory settings. IFD provides a realistic, reproducible, and behavior-rich benchmark for developing AI models in financial compliance, regulatory forensics, and interpretable time-series classification.

      <title>Learning Explainable Stock Predictions with Tweets Using Mixture of Experts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stock price movements are influenced by many factors, and alongside historical price data, tex-tual information is a key source. Public news and social media offer valuable insights into market sentiment and emerging events. These sources are fast-paced, diverse, and significantly impact future stock trends. Recently, LLMs have enhanced financial analysis, but prompt-based methods still have limitations, such as input length restrictions and difficulties in predicting sequences of varying lengths. Additionally, most models rely on dense computational layers, which are resource-intensive. To address these challenges, we propose the FTS- Text-MoE model, which combines numerical data with key summaries from news and tweets using point embeddings, boosting prediction accuracy through the integration of factual textual data. The model uses a Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformer decoder to process both data types. By activating only a subset of model parameters, it reduces computational costs. Furthermore, the model features multi-resolution prediction heads, enabling flexible forecasting of financial time series at different scales. Experimental results show that FTS-Text-MoE outperforms baseline methods in terms of investment returns and Sharpe ratio, demonstrating its superior accuracy and ability to predict future market trends.</description>

      <title>Exascale Implicit Kinetic Plasma Simulations on El~Capitan for Solving the Micro-Macro Coupling in Magnetospheric Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Our fully kinetic, implicit Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of global magnetospheres on up to 32,768 of El Capitan's AMD Instinct MI300A Accelerated Processing Units (APUs) represent an unprecedented computational capability that addresses a fundamental challenge in space physics: resolving the multi-scale coupling between microscopic (electron-scale) and macroscopic (global-scale) dynamics in planetary magnetospheres. The implicit scheme of iPIC3D supports time steps and grid spacing that are up to 10 times larger than those of explicit methods, without sacrificing physical accuracy. This enables the simulation of magnetospheres while preserving fine-scale electron physics, which is critical for key processes such as magnetic reconnection and plasma turbulence. Our algorithmic and technological innovations include GPU-optimized kernels, particle control, and physics-aware data compression using Gaussian Mixture Models. With simulation domains spanning 100-1,000 ion skin depths, we reach the global scale of small-to-medium planetary magnetospheres, such as those of Mercury and Ganymede, which supports fully kinetic treatment of global-scale dynamics in systems previously out of reach for fully kinetic PIC codes.</description>

      <title>Programmable Virtual Humans Toward Human Physiologically-Based Drug Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked immense interest in drug discovery, but most current approaches only digitize existing high-throughput experiments. They remain constrained by conventional pipelines. As a result, they do not address the fundamental challenges of predicting drug effects in humans. Similarly, biomedical digital twins, largely grounded in real-world data and mechanistic models, are tailored for late-phase drug development and lack the resolution to model molecular interactions or their systemic consequences, limiting their impact in early-stage discovery. This disconnect between early discovery and late development is one of the main drivers of high failure rates in drug discovery. The true promise of AI lies not in augmenting current experiments but in enabling virtual experiments that are impossible in the real world: testing novel compounds directly in silico in the human body. Recent advances in AI, high-throughput perturbation assays, and single-cell and spatial omics across species now make it possible to construct programmable virtual humans: dynamic, multiscale models that simulate drug actions from molecular to phenotypic levels. By bridging the translational gap, programmable virtual humans offer a transformative path to optimize therapeutic efficacy and safety earlier than ever before. This perspective introduces the concept of programmable virtual humans, explores their roles in a new paradigm of drug discovery centered on human physiology, and outlines key opportunities, challenges, and roadmaps for their realization.</description>

      <title>Taming Domain Shift in Multi-source CT-Scan Classification via Input-Space Standardization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-source CT-scan classification suffers from domain shifts that impair cross-source generalization. While preprocessing pipelines combining Spatial-Slice Feature Learning (SSFL++) and Kernel-Density-based Slice Sampling (KDS) have shown empirical success, the mechanisms underlying their domain robustness remain underexplored. This study analyzes how this input-space standardization manages the trade-off between local discriminability and cross-source generalization. The SSFL++ and KDS pipeline performs spatial and temporal standardization to reduce inter-source variance, effectively mapping disparate inputs into a consistent target space. This preemptive alignment mitigates domain shift and simplifies the learning task for network optimization. Experimental validation demonstrates consistent improvements across architectures, proving the benefits stem from the preprocessing itself. The approach's effectiveness was validated by securing first place in a competitive challenge, supporting input-space standardization as a robust and practical solution for multi-institutional medical imaging.</description>

      <title>AQUA: A Large Language Model for Aquaculture &amp; Fisheries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aquaculture plays a vital role in global food security and coastal economies by providing sustainable protein sources. As the industry expands to meet rising demand, it faces growing challenges such as disease outbreaks, inefficient feeding practices, rising labor costs, logistical inefficiencies, and critical hatchery issues, including high mortality rates and poor water quality control. Although artificial intelligence has made significant progress, existing machine learning methods fall short of addressing the domain-specific complexities of aquaculture. To bridge this gap, we introduce AQUA, the first large language model (LLM) tailored for aquaculture, designed to support farmers, researchers, and industry practitioners. Central to this effort is AQUADAPT (Data Acquisition, Processing and Tuning), an Agentic Framework for generating and refining high-quality synthetic data using a combination of expert knowledge, largescale language models, and automated evaluation techniques. Our work lays the foundation for LLM-driven innovations in aquaculture research, advisory systems, and decision-making tools.</description>

      <title>PySHRED: A Python package for SHallow REcurrent Decoding for sparse sensing, model reduction and scientific discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SHallow REcurrent Decoders (SHRED) provide a deep learning strategy for modeling high-dimensional dynamical systems and/or spatiotemporal data from dynamical system snapshot observations. PySHRED is a Python package that implements SHRED and several of its major extensions, including for robust sensing, reduced order modeling and physics discovery. In this paper, we introduce the version 1.0 release of PySHRED, which includes data preprocessors and a number of cutting-edge SHRED methods specifically designed to handle real-world data that may be noisy, multi-scale, parameterized, prohibitively high-dimensional, and strongly nonlinear. The package is easy to install, thoroughly-documented, supplemented with extensive code examples, and modularly-structured to support future additions. The entire codebase is released under the MIT license and is available at https://github.com/pyshred-dev/pyshred.</description>

      <title>LKA: Large Kernel Adapter for Enhanced Medical Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19118v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the notable success of current Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods across various domains, their effectiveness on medical datasets falls short of expectations. This limitation arises from two key factors: (1) medical images exhibit extensive anatomical variation and low contrast, necessitating a large receptive field to capture critical features, and (2) existing PEFT methods do not explicitly address the enhancement of receptive fields. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Large Kernel Adapter (LKA), designed to expand the receptive field while maintaining parameter efficiency. The proposed LKA consists of three key components: down-projection, channel-wise large kernel convolution, and up-projection. Through extensive experiments on various datasets and pre-trained models, we demonstrate that the incorporation of a larger kernel size is pivotal in enhancing the adaptation of pre-trained models for medical image analysis. Our proposed LKA outperforms 11 commonly used PEFT methods, surpassing the state-of-the-art by 3.5% in top-1 accuracy across five medical datasets.</description>

      <title>A stabilized Two-Step Formulation of Maxwell's Equations in the time-domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulating electromagnetic fields across broad frequency ranges is challenging due to numerical instabilities at low frequencies. This work extends a stabilized two-step formulation of Maxwell's equations to the time-domain. Using a Galerkin discretization in space, we apply two different time-discretization schemes that are tailored to the first- and second-order in time partial differential equations of the two-step solution procedure used here. To address the low-frequency instability, we incorporate a generalized tree-cotree gauge that removes the singularity of the curl-curl operator, ensuring robustness even in the static limit. Numerical results on academic and application-oriented 3D problems confirm stability, accuracy, and the method's applicability to nonlinear, temperature-dependent materials.</description>
