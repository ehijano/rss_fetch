      <title>On freeness and rank of duals of free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $M, N$ be free modules over a Noetherian commutative ring $R$ and let $F$ be a field whose cardinality does not exceed the continuum. We prove the following:
  1) The Injective Continuum Function Hypothesis, ICF, is equivalent to assertion that [ any two F-vector spaces are isomorphic iff their duals are so.]
  2) If the dual of $M$ is a projective $R$-module and rank$_R(M)$ is infinite then the ring $R$ is Artinian.
  3) If $R$ is Artinian and card$(R)$ does not exceed the continuum then the dual of $M$ is free.
  4) If $M, N$ have isomorphic duals then they are themselves isomorphic (over $R$), when rank$_R(M)$ is not an $\omega$-measurable cardinal and $R$ is a non-Artinian ring that is either Hilbert or countable.
  5) If $R$ is a non-local domain then $R$ is a half-slender ring.
  We also prove that if the powersets of two given sets have equal cardinalities then there is a bijection from the one powerset to the other that preserves the symmetric difference of sets.</description>

      <title>On rings of integer-valued rational functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $D\subseteq B$ be an extension of integral domains and $E$ a subset of the quotient field of $D$. We introduce the ring of \textit{$D$-valued $B$-rational functions on $E$}, denoted by $Int^R_B(E,D)$, which naturally extends the concepts of integer-valued polynomials, defined as $ Int^R_B(E,D) \:=\lbrace f \in B(X);\; f(E)\subseteq D\rbrace.$ The notion of $Int^R_B(E,D)$ boils down to the usual notion of integer-valued rational functions when the subset $E$ is infinite. In this paper, we aim to investigate various properties of these rings, such as prime ideals, localization, and the module structure. Furthermore, we study the transfer of some ring-theoretic properties from $Int^R(E,D)$ to $D$.</description>

      <title>On vanishing of higher direct images of the structure sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show the vanishing of the first direct image of the structure sheaf of a normal excellent scheme $X$ which is mapped properly and birationally over an excellent regular scheme of any dimension. On the other hand, for any dimension greater than two, we show examples of a proper birational morphism from a normal and Cohen-Macaulay scheme to a regular scheme such that the second direct image does not vanish and has an isolated support.</description>

      <title>Matroids with bases as minimal resolving sets of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define an independence system associated with simple graphs. We prove that the independence system is a matroid for certain families of graphs, including trees, with bases as minimal resolving sets. Consequently, the greedy algorithm on the matroid can be used to find the minimum-cost resolving set of weighted graphs, wherein the independent system is a matroid. We also characterize hyperplanes of the matroid for trees and prove that its dual matroid is loop-free.</description>

      <title>Stacked Pseudo-Convergent Sequences and Polynomial Dedekind Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.11740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $p\in\mathbb Z$ be a prime, $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ a fixed algebraic closure of the field of $p$-adic numbers and $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}$ the absolute integral closure of the ring of $p$-adic integers. Given a residually algebraic torsion extension $W$ of $\mathbb Z_{(p)}$ to $\mathbb Q(X)$, by Kaplansky's characterization of immediate extensions of valued fields, there exists a pseudo-convergent sequence of transcendental type $E=\{s_n\}_{n\in\mathbb N}\subset\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ such that $W=\mathbb Z_{(p),E}=\{\phi\in\mathbb Q(X)\mid\phi(s_n)\in\overline{\mathbb Z_p},\text{ for all sufficiently large }n\in\mathbb N\}$. We show here that we may assume that $E$ is stacked, in the sense that, for each $n\in\mathbb N$, the residue field (the value group, respectively) of $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}\cap\mathbb Q_p(s_n)$ is contained in the residue field (the value group, respectively) of $\overline{\mathbb Z_p}\cap\mathbb Q_p(s_{n+1})$; this property of $E$ allows us to describe the residue field and value group of $W$. In particular, if $W$ is a DVR, then there exists $\alpha$ in the completion $\mathbb C_p$ of $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$, $\alpha$ transcendental over $\mathbb Q$, such that $W=\mathbb Z_{(p),\alpha}=\{\phi\in\mathbb Q(X)\mid\phi(\alpha)\in O_p\}$, where $O_p$ is the unique local ring of $\mathbb C_p$; $\alpha$ belongs to $\overline{\mathbb Q_p}$ if and only if the residue field extension $W/M\supseteq\mathbb Z/p\mathbb Z$ is finite.
  As an application, we provide a full characterization of the Dedekind domains between $\mathbb Z[X]$ and $\mathbb Q[X]$.</description>

      <title>Construction of free curves by adding osculating conics to a given cubic curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the present article we construct new families of free and nearly free curves starting from a plane cubic curve $C$ and adding some of its hyperosculating conics. We present results that involve nodal cubic curves and the Fermat cubic. In addition, we provide new insight into the geometry of the $27$ hyperosculating conics of the Fermat cubic curve using well-chosen group actions.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Approach to Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10515v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cylindrical algebraic decomposition is a classical construction in real algebraic geometry. Although there are many algorithms to compute a cylindrical algebraic decomposition, their practical performance is still very limited. In this paper, we revisit this problem from a more geometric perspective, where the construction of cylindrical algebraic decomposition is related to the study of morphisms between real varieties. It is showed that the geometric fiber cardinality (geometric property) decides the existence of semi-algebraic continuous sections (semi-algebraic property). As a result, all equations can be systematically exploited in the projection phase, leading to a new simple algorithm whose efficiency is demonstrated by experimental results.</description>

      <title>Positivity preservers over finite fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00222v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We resolve an algebraic version of Schoenberg's celebrated theorem [Duke Math.J., 1942] characterizing entrywise matrix transforms that preserve positive definiteness. Compared to the classical real and complex settings, we consider matrices with entries in a finite field and obtain a complete characterization of such preservers for matrices of a fixed dimension. When the dimension of the matrices is at least $3$, we prove that, surprisingly, the positivity preservers are precisely the positive multiples of the field's automorphisms. We also obtain characterizations of preservers for matrices of dimension $2$ over a finite field with $q$ elements, unless $q \equiv 1 \pmod 4$ and $q$ is not a square. Our proofs build on several novel connections between positivity preservers and field automorphisms via the works of Weil, Carlitz, and Muzychuk-Kov\'acs, and via the structure of cliques in Paley graphs.</description>
