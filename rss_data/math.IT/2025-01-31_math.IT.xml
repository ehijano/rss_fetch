      <title>Task and Perception-aware Distributed Source Coding for Correlated Speech under Bandwidth-constrained Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emerging wireless AR/VR applications require real-time transmission of correlated high-fidelity speech from multiple resource-constrained devices over unreliable, bandwidth-limited channels. Existing autoencoder-based speech source coding methods fail to address the combination of the following - (1) dynamic bitrate adaptation without retraining the model, (2) leveraging correlations among multiple speech sources, and (3) balancing downstream task loss with realism of reconstructed speech. We propose a neural distributed principal component analysis (NDPCA)-aided distributed source coding algorithm for correlated speech sources transmitting to a central receiver. Our method includes a perception-aware downstream task loss function that balances perceptual realism with task-specific performance. Experiments show significant PSNR improvements under bandwidth constraints over naive autoencoder methods in task-agnostic (19%) and task-aware settings (52%). It also approaches the theoretical upper bound, where all correlated sources are sent to a single encoder, especially in low-bandwidth scenarios. Additionally, we present a rate-distortion-perception trade-off curve, enabling adaptive decisions based on application-specific realism needs.</description>

      <title>Power-Efficient Over-the-Air Aggregation with Receive Beamforming for Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies power-efficient uplink transmission design for federated learning (FL) that employs over-the-air analog aggregation and multi-antenna beamforming at the server. We jointly optimize device transmit weights and receive beamforming at each FL communication round to minimize the total device transmit power while ensuring convergence in FL training. Through our convergence analysis, we establish sufficient conditions on the aggregation error to guarantee FL training convergence. Utilizing these conditions, we reformulate the power minimization problem into a unique bi-convex structure that contains a transmit beamforming optimization subproblem and a receive beamforming feasibility subproblem. Despite this unconventional structure, we propose a novel alternating optimization approach that guarantees monotonic decrease of the objective value, to allow convergence to a partial optimum. We further consider imperfect channel state information (CSI), which requires accounting for the channel estimation errors in the power minimization problem and FL convergence analysis. We propose a CSI-error-aware joint beamforming algorithm, which can substantially outperform one that does not account for channel estimation errors. Simulation with canonical classification datasets demonstrates that our proposed methods achieve significant power reduction compared to existing benchmarks across a wide range of parameter settings, while attaining the same target accuracy under the same convergence rate.</description>

      <title>PAC Codes Meet CRC-Polar Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CRC-Polar codes under SC list decoding are well-regarded for their competitive error performance. This paper examines these codes by focusing on minimum weight codewords and breaking them down into the rows of the polar transform. Inspired by the significant impact of parity check bits and their positions, we apply a shifted rate-profile for polarization-adjusted convolutional (PS-PAC) codes, thereby achieving similar improvements in the weight distribution of polar codes through precoding. The results demonstrate a significant improvement in error performance, achieving up to a 0.5 dB power gain with short PS-PAC codes. Additionally, leveraging convolutional precoding in PAC codes, we adopt a continuous deployment (masking) of parity check bits derived from the remainder of continuous division of the partial message polynomial and the CRC polynomial over frozen positions in the rate-profile. This approach enhances performance for long codes, with an overall improvement of 0.12 dB.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wiretap channel, where the RIS is strategically deployed to provide a spatial separation to the transmitter, and orthogonal combiners are employed at the legitimate receiver to extract the data streams from the direct and RIS-assisted links. Then we derive the achievable secrecy rate under semantic security for the RIS-assisted channel and design an algorithm for the secrecy rate optimization problem. The simulation results show the effects of total transmit power, the location and number of eavesdroppers on the security performance.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Model Fine-Tuning For Extreme MIMO CSI Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient channel state information (CSI) compression is crucial in frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems due to excessive feedback overhead. Recently, deep learning-based compression techniques have demonstrated superior performance across various data types, including CSI. However, these approaches often experience performance degradation when the data distribution changes due to their limited generalization capabilities. To address this challenge, we propose a model fine-tuning approach for CSI feedback in massive MIMO systems. The idea is to fine-tune the encoder/decoder network models in a dynamic fashion using the recent CSI samples. First, we explore encoder-only fine-tuning, where only the encoder parameters are updated, leaving the decoder and latent parameters unchanged. Next, we consider full-model fine-tuning, where the encoder and decoder models are jointly updated. Unlike encoder-only fine-tuning, full-model fine-tuning requires the updated decoder and latent parameters to be transmitted to the decoder side. To efficiently handle this, we propose different prior distributions for model updates, such as uniform and truncated Gaussian to entropy code them together with the compressed CSI and account for additional feedback overhead imposed by conveying the model updates. Moreover, we incorporate quantized model updates during fine-tuning to reflect the impact of quantization in the deployment phase. Our results demonstrate that full-model fine-tuning significantly enhances the rate-distortion (RD) performance of neural CSI compression. Furthermore, we analyze how often the full-model fine-tuning should be applied in a new wireless environment and identify an optimal period interval for achieving the best RD trade-off.</description>

      <title>Zero Estimation Cost Strategy for Witsenhausen Counterexample with Causal Encoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a zero estimation cost (ZEC) scheme for causal-encoding noncausal-decoding vector-valued Witsenhausen counterexample based on the coordination coding result. In contrast to source coding, our goal is to communicate a controlled system state. The introduced ZEC scheme is a joint control-communication approach that transforms the system state into a sequence that can be efficiently communicated using block coding. Numerical results show that our approach significantly reduces the power required for achieving zero-estimation-cost state reconstruction at the decoder. In the second part, we introduce a more general non-zero estimation cost (Non-ZEC) scheme. We observe numerically that the Non-ZEC scheme operates as a time-sharing mechanism between the two-point strategy and the ZEC scheme. Overall, by leveraging block-coding gain, our proposed methods substantially improve the power-estimation trade-off for Witsenhausen counterexample.</description>

      <title>One-Bit Distributed Mean Estimation with Unknown Variance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the problem of distributed mean estimation with $1$-bit communication constraints when the variance is unknown. We focus on the specific case where each user has access to one i.i.d. sample drawn from a distribution that belongs to a scale-location family, and is limited to sending just a single bit of information to a central server whose goal is to estimate the mean. We propose non-adaptive and adaptive estimators that are shown to be asymptotically normal. We derive bounds on the asymptotic (in the number of users) Mean Squared Error (MSE) achieved by these estimators. For a class of symmetric log-concave distributions, we derive matching lower bounds for the MSE achieved by adaptive estimators, proving the optimality of our scheme. We show that non-adaptive estimators can be strictly suboptimal by deriving a lower bound on the MSE achieved by any non-adaptive estimator for Gaussian distributions and demonstrating a positive gap between this and the MSE achieved by our adaptive scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimum Monitoring and Job Assignment with Multiple Markov Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of systems termed Markov Machines (MM) which process job requests with exponential service times. Assuming a Poison job arrival process, these MMs oscillate between two states, free and busy. We consider the problem of sampling the states of these MMs so as to track their states, subject to a total sampling budget, with the goal of allocating external job requests effectively to them. For this purpose, we leverage the $\textit{binary freshness metric}$ to quantify the quality of our ability to track the states of the MMs, and introduce two new metrics termed $\textit{false acceptance ratio}$ (FAR) and $\textit{false rejection ratio}$ (FRR) to evaluate the effectiveness of our job assignment strategy. We provide optimal sampling rate allocation schemes for jointly monitoring a system of $N$ heterogeneous MMs.</description>

      <title>SCDM: Score-Based Channel Denoising Model for Digital Semantic Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models represent a significant variant within the diffusion model family and have seen extensive application in the increasingly popular domain of generative tasks. Recent investigations have explored the denoising potential of diffusion models in semantic communications. However, in previous paradigms, noise distortion in the diffusion process does not match precisely with digital channel noise characteristics. In this work, we introduce the Score-Based Channel Denoising Model (SCDM) for Digital Semantic Communications (DSC). SCDM views the distortion of constellation symbol sequences in digital transmission as a score-based forward diffusion process. We design a tailored forward noise corruption to align digital channel noise properties in the training phase. During the inference stage, the well-trained SCDM can effectively denoise received semantic symbols under various SNR conditions, reducing the difficulty for the semantic decoder in extracting semantic information from the received noisy symbols and thereby enhancing the robustness of the reconstructed semantic information. Experimental results show that SCDM outperforms the baseline model in PSNR, SSIM, and MSE metrics, particularly at low SNR levels. Moreover, SCDM reduces storage requirements by a factor of 7.8. This efficiency in storage, combined with its robust denoising capability, makes SCDM a practical solution for DSC across diverse channel conditions.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for the Multi-User MIMO Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers exhibit great potential in assisting classical wireless communications due to their outstanding advantages in detecting radio frequency signals. To realize this potential, we integrate a Rydberg atomic quantum receiver into a classical multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) scheme to form a multi-user Rydberg atomic quantum MIMO (RAQ-MIMO) system for the uplink. To study this system, we first construct an equivalent baseband signal model, which facilitates convenient system design, signal processing and optimizations. We then study the ergodic achievable rates under both the maximum ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) schemes by deriving their tight lower bounds. We next compare the ergodic achievable rates of the RAQ-MIMO and the conventional massive MIMO schemes by offering a closed-form expression for the difference of their ergodic achievable rates, which allows us to directly compare the two systems. Our results show that RAQ-MIMO allows the average transmit power of users to be $\sim 20$ dBm lower than that of the conventional massive MIMO. Viewed from a different perspective, an extra $\sim 7$ bits/s/Hz/user rate becomes achievable by ZF RAQ-MIMO, when equipping $50 \sim 500$ receive elements for receiving $1 \sim 100$ user signals at an enough transmit power (e.g., $\ge 20$ dBm).</description>

      <title>Quantum-Key Distribution using Decoy Pulses to Combat Photon-Number Splitting by Eavesdropper: An Event-by-Event Impairment Enumeration Approach for Performance Evaluation and Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum-key distribution (QKD) schemes employing quantum communication links are typically based on the transmission of weak optical pulses over optical fibers to setup a secret key between the transmitting and receiving nodes. Alice transmits optically a random bit stream to the receiver (Bob) through the photon polarizations or the quadrature components of the lightwaves associated with the photons, with a secret key remaining implicitly embedded therein. However, during the above transmission, some eavesdropper (Eve) might attempt to tap the passing-by photons from the optical fiber links to extract the key. In one of the popular QKD schemes, along with signal pulses, some additional decoy pulses are transmitted by Alice, while Eve might use photon-number splitting (PNS) for eavesdropping. In a typical PNS scheme, (i) the optical pulses with single photon are blocked by Eve, (ii) from the optical pulses with two photons, one photon is retained by Eve to carry out eavesdropping operation and the other is retransmitted to Bob, and (iii) all other pulses with more than two photons are retransmitted by Eve to Bob without retaining any photon from them. Extensive theoretical research has been carried out on such QKD schemes, by employing information-theoretic approach along with computer simulations and experimental studies. We present a novel event-by-event impairment enumeration approach to evaluate the overall performance of one such QKD scheme analytically with due consideration to the physical layer of the quantum communication links. The proposed approach monitors the impairments of the propagating optical pulses event-by-event at all possible locations along the optical fiber link using statistical approach, and provides estimates of the realizable key generation rate, while assuring an adequate yield ratio between signal and decoy pulses for the detection of possible eavesdropping.</description>

      <title>Optimal generalisation and learning transition in extensive-width shallow neural networks near interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a teacher-student model of supervised learning with a fully-trained 2-layer neural network whose width $k$ and input dimension $d$ are large and proportional. We compute the Bayes-optimal generalisation error of the network for any activation function in the regime where the number of training data $n$ scales quadratically with the input dimension, i.e., around the interpolation threshold where the number of trainable parameters $kd+k$ and of data points $n$ are comparable. Our analysis tackles generic weight distributions. Focusing on binary weights, we uncover a discontinuous phase transition separating a "universal" phase from a "specialisation" phase. In the first, the generalisation error is independent of the weight distribution and decays slowly with the sampling rate $n/d^2$, with the student learning only some non-linear combinations of the teacher weights. In the latter, the error is weight distribution-dependent and decays faster due to the alignment of the student towards the teacher network. We thus unveil the existence of a highly predictive solution near interpolation, which is however potentially hard to find.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Broadcast Channels with Heterogeneous Arrival and Decoding Deadlines: Second-Order Achievability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A standard assumption in the design of ultra-reliable low-latency communication systems is that the duration between message arrivals is larger than the number of channel uses before the decoding deadline. Nevertheless, this assumption fails when messages arrive rapidly and reliability constraints require that the number of channel uses exceed the time between arrivals. In this paper, we consider a broadcast setting in which a transmitter wishes to send two different messages to two receivers over Gaussian channels. Messages have different arrival times and decoding deadlines such that their transmission windows overlap. For this setting, we propose a coding scheme that exploits Marton's coding strategy. We derive rigorous bounds on the achievable rate regions. Those bounds can be easily employed in point-to-point settings with one or multiple parallel channels. In the point-to-point setting with one or multiple parallel channels, the proposed achievability scheme is consistent with the normal approximation. In the broadcast setting, our scheme agrees with Marton's strategy for sufficiently large numbers of channel uses and shows significant performance improvements over standard approaches based on time sharing for transmission of short packets.</description>

      <title>Decentralized MIMO Systems with Imperfect CSI using LMMSE Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12811v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Centralized baseband processing (CBP) is required to achieve the full potential of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, due to the large number of antennas, CBP suffers from two major issues: 1) Tremendous data interconnection between radio frequency (RF) circuitry and processing fabrics; and 2) high-dimensional computation. To this end, decentralized baseband processing (DBP) has been proposed, where the antennas at the BS are partitioned into clusters connected to separate RF circuits and equipped with separate computing units. Unfortunately, due to the decentralized structure, the optimal fusion scheme and performance analysis for DBP with general spatial correlation between clusters and imperfect channel state information (CSI) are not available in the literature. In this paper, we consider a decentralized MIMO system where all clusters adopt linear minimum mean-square error (LMMSE) receivers with imperfect CSI. Specifically, we first establish the optimal linear fusion scheme which has high computational and data input/output (I/O) costs. To reduce the costs, we further propose two sub-optimal fusion schemes with reduced complexity. For all three schemes, we derive the closed-form expressions for the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) by leveraging random matrix theory (RMT) and demonstrate the conditions under which the sub optimal schemes are optimal. Furthermore, we determine the optimal regularization parameter for decentralized LMMSE receivers, identify the best antenna partitioning strategy, and prove that the SINR will decrease as the number of clusters increases. Numerical simulations validate the accuracy of the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Near-field Beam-focusing Pattern under Discrete Phase Shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14685v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology for enabling near-field communications in future wireless systems. However, the huge number of antennas deployed pose demanding challenges on the hardware cost and power consumption, especially when the antennas employ high-resolution phase shifters (PSs). To address this issue, in this paper, we consider low-resolution discrete PSs at the XL-array which are practically more energy efficient, and investigate the impact of PS resolution on the near-field beam-focusing effect. To this end, we propose a new Fourier series expansion method to efficiently tackle the difficulty in characterizing the beam pattern properties under phase quantization. Interestingly, we analytically show, for the first time, that 1) discrete PSs introduce additional grating lobes; 2) the main lobe still exhibits the beam-focusing property with its beam power increasing with PS resolution; and 3) there are two types of grating lobes, featured by the beam-focusing and beam-steering properties, respectively. In addition, we provide intuitive understanding for the appearance of grating lobes under discrete PSs from an array-of-subarrays perspective. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the grating lobes generally degrade communication rate performance. However, a low-resolution of 3-bit PSs can achieve similar beam pattern and rate performance with the continuous PS counterpart, while it attains much higher energy efficiency.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Despeckling of Structured Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Speckle noise is a fundamental challenge in coherent imaging systems, significantly degrading image quality. Over the past decades, numerous despeckling algorithms have been developed for applications such as Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and digital holography. In this paper, we aim to establish a theoretically grounded approach to despeckling. We propose a method applicable to general structured stationary stochastic sources. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on piecewise constant sources. Additionally, we theoretically derive a lower bound on the despeckling performance for such sources. The proposed depseckler applied to the 1-Markov structured sources achieves better reconstruction performance with no strong simplification of the ground truth signal model or speckle noise.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.13887v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the standardization and commercialization completed at an unforeseen pace for 5th generation (5G) wireless networks, researchers, engineers and executives from the academia and industry have turned their attention to new candidate technologies that can support next generation wireless networks enabling more advanced capabilities in emerging scenarios. Explicitly, the 6th generation (6G) terrestrial wireless network aims to providing seamless connectivity not only to users but also to machine type devices for the next decade and beyond. This paper describes the progresses moving towards 6G, which is officially termed as ''international mobile telecommunications (IMT) for 2030 and beyond'' in the International Telecommunication Union Radiocommunication Sector (ITU-R). Specifically, the usage scenarios, their representative capabilities, the supporting technologies and spectrum are discussed, and research opportunities and challenges are highlighted.</description>

      <title>Slaves to the Law of Large Numbers: An Asymptotic Equipartition Property for Perplexity in Generative Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13798v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a new asymptotic equipartition property for the perplexity of long texts generated by a language model and present supporting experimental evidence from open-source models. Specifically we show that the logarithmic perplexity of any large text generated by a language model must asymptotically converge to the average entropy of its token distributions. This defines a "typical set" that all long synthetic texts generated by a language model must belong to. We show that this typical set is a vanishingly small subset of all possible grammatically correct outputs. These results suggest possible applications to important practical problems such as (a) detecting synthetic AI-generated text, and (b) testing whether a text was used to train a language model. We make no simplifying assumptions (such as stationarity) about the statistics of language model outputs, and therefore our results are directly applicable to practical real-world models without any approximations.</description>

      <title>Photonic Simulation of Localization Phenomena Using Boson Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13938v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation in its current state faces experimental overhead in terms of physical space and cooling. We propose boson sampling as an alternative compact synthetic platform performing at room temperature. Identifying the capability of estimating matrix permanents, we explore the applicability of boson sampling for tackling the dynamics of quantum systems without having access to information about the full state vector. By mapping the time-evolution unitary of a Hamiltonian onto an interferometer via continuous-variable gate decompositions, we present proof-of-principle results of localization characteristics of a single particle. We study the dynamics of one-dimensional tight-binding systems in the clean and quasiperiodic-disordered limits to observe Bloch oscillations and dynamical localization, and the delocalization-to-localization phase transition in the Aubry- Andre-Harper model respectively. Our computational results obtained using boson sampling are in complete agreement with the dynamical and static results of non-interacting tight-binding systems obtained using conventional numerical calculations. Additionally, our study highlights the role of number of sampling measurements or shots for simulation accuracy.</description>

      <title>Energy-Efficiency and Spectral-Efficiency Trade-off in Distributed Massive-MIMO Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01271v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the inherent trade-off between energy efficiency (EE) and spectral efficiency (SE) in distributed massive-MIMO (D-mMIMO) systems. Optimizing the EE and SE together is crucial as increasing spectral efficiency often leads to higher energy consumption. Joint power allocation and AP-UE association are pivotal in this trade-off analysis because they directly influence both EE and SE. We address the gap in existing literature where the EE-SE trade-off has been analyzed but not optimized in the context of D-mMIMO systems. The focus of this study is to maximize the EE with constraints on uplink sum SE through judicious power allocation and AP-UE association, essential for enhancing network throughput. Numerical simulations are performed to validate the proposed model, exploring the impacts of AP-UE association and power allocation on the EE-SE trade-off in uplink D-mMIMO scenarios.</description>
