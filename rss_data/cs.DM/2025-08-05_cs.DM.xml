      <title>Temporal Exploration of Random Spanning Tree Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03361v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Temporal Graph Exploration problem (TEXP) takes as input a temporal graph, i.e., a sequence of graphs $(G_i)_{i\in \mathbb{N}}$ on the same vertex set, and asks for a walk of shortest length visiting all vertices, where the $i$-th step uses an edge from $G_i$. If each such $G_i$ is connected, then an exploration of length $n^2$ exists, and this is known to be the best possible up to a constant. More fine-grained lower and upper bounds have been obtained for restricted temporal graph classes, however, for several fundamental classes, a large gap persists between known bounds, and it remains unclear which properties of a temporal graph make it inherently difficult to explore.
  Motivated by this limited understanding and the central role of the Temporal Graph Exploration problem in temporal graph theory, we study the problem in a randomised setting. We introduce the Random Spanning Tree (RST) model, which consists of a set of $n$-vertex trees together with an arbitrary probability distribution $\mu$ over this set. A random temporal graph generated by the RST model is a sequence of independent samples drawn from $\mu$.
  We initiate a systematic study of the Temporal Graph Exploration problem in such random temporal graphs and establish tight general bounds on exploration time. Our first main result proves that any RST model can, with high probability (w.h.p.), be explored in $O(n^{3/2})$ time, and we show that this bound is tight up to a constant factor. This demonstrates a fundamental difference between the adversarial and random settings. Our second main result shows that if all trees of an RST are subgraphs of a fixed graph with $m$ edges then, w.h.p.\ , it can be explored in $O(m)$ time.</description>

      <title>Adjacent vertex distinguishing total coloring of 3-degenerate graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A total coloring of a simple undirected graph $G$ is an assignment of colors to its vertices and edges such that the colors given to the vertices form a proper vertex coloring, the colors given to the edges form a proper edge coloring, and the color of every edge is different from that of its two endpoints. That is, $\phi:V(G)\cup E(G)\rightarrow\mathbb{N}$ is a total coloring of $G$ if $\phi(u)\neq\phi(v)$ and $\phi(uv)\neq\phi(u)$ for all $uv\in E(G)$, and $\phi(uv)\neq\phi(uw)$ for any $u \in V(G)$ and distinct $v,w \in N(u)$ (here, $N(u)$ denotes the set of neighbours of $u$). A total coloring $\phi$ of a graph $G$ is said to be ``Adjacent Vertex Distinguishing'' (or AVD for short) if for all $uv\in E(G)$, we have that $\phi(\{u\}\cup\{uw:w\in N(u)\})\neq\phi(\{v\}\cup\{vw\colon w\in N(v)\})$. The AVD Total Coloring Conjecture of Zhang, Chen, Li, Yao, Lu, and Wang (Science in China Series A: Mathematics, 48(3):289--299, 2005) states that every graph $G$ has an AVD total coloring using at most $\Delta(G)+3$ colors, where $\Delta(G)$ denotes the maximum degree of $G$. For some $s\in\mathbb{N}$, a graph $G$ is said to be $s$-degenerate if every subgraph of $G$ has minimum degree at most $s$. Miao, Shi, Hu, and Luo (Discrete Mathematics, 339(10):2446--2449, 2016) showed that the AVD Total Coloring Conjecture is true for 2-degenerate graphs. We verify the conjecture for 3-degenerate graphs.</description>

      <title>Backbone colouring of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A proper $k$-colouring of a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a function $c: V(G)\to \{1,\ldots,k\}$ such that $c(u)\neq c(v)$ for every edge $uv\in E(G)$. The chromatic number $\chi(G)$ is the minimum $k$ such that there exists a proper $k$-colouring of $G$. Given a spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$, a $q$-backbone $k$-colouring of $(G,H)$ is a proper $k$-colouring $c$ of $G$ such that $\lvert c(u)-c(v)\rvert \ge q$ for every edge $uv\in E(H)$. The $q$-backbone chromatic number ${\rm BBC}_q(G,H)$ is the smallest $k$ for which there exists a $q$-backbone $k$-colouring of $(G,H)$. In their seminal paper, Broersma et al.~\cite{BFGW07} ask whether, for any chordal graph $G$ and any spanning forest $H$ of $G$, we have that ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \chi(G)+O(1)$.
  In this work, we first show that this is true as long as $H$ is bipartite and $G$ is an interval graph in which each vertex belongs to at most two maximal cliques. We then show that this does not extend to bipartite graphs as backbone by exhibiting a family of chordal graphs $G$ with spanning bipartite subgraphs $H$ satisfying ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\geq \frac{5\chi(G)}{3}$. Then, we show that if $G$ is chordal and $H$ has bounded maximum average degree (in particular, if $H$ is a forest), then ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \chi(G)+O(\sqrt{\chi(G)})$. We finally show that ${\rm BBC}_2(G,H)\leq \frac{3}{2}\chi(G)+O(1)$ holds whenever $G$ is chordal and $H$ is $C_4$-free.</description>

      <title>Chromatic discrepancy of locally $s$-colourable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02985v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chromatic discrepancy of a graph $G$, denoted $\phi(G)$, is the least over all proper colourings $\sigma$ of $G$ of the greatest difference between the number of colours $|\sigma(V(H))|$ spanned by an induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ and its chromatic number $\chi(H)$. We prove that the chromatic discrepancy of a triangle-free graph $G$ is at least $\chi(G)-2$. This is best possible and positively answers a question raised by Aravind, Kalyanasundaram, Sandeep, and Sivadasan.
  More generally, we say that a graph $G$ is locally $s$-colourable if the closed neighbourhood of any vertex $v\in V(G)$ is properly $s$-colourable; in particular, a triangle-free graph is locally $2$-colourable. We conjecture that every locally $s$-colourable graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G)-s$, and show that this would be almost best possible. We prove the conjecture when $\chi(G) \le 11s/6$, and as a partial result towards the general case, we prove that every locally $s$-colourable graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - s\ln \chi(G)$.
  If the conjecture holds, it implies in particular, for every integer $\ell\geq 2$, that any graph $G$ without any copy of $C_{\ell+1}$, the cycle of length $\ell+1$, satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - \ell$. When $\ell \ge 3$ and $G\neq K_\ell$, we conjecture that we actually have $\phi(G)\ge \chi(G) - \ell + 1$, and prove it in the special case $\ell = 3$ or $\chi(G) \le 5\ell/3$. In general, we further obtain that every $C_{\ell+1}$-free graph $G$ satisfies $\phi(G) \geq \chi(G) - O_{\ell}(\ln \ln \chi(G))$. We do so by determining an almost tight bound on the chromatic number of balls of radius at most $\ell/2$ in $G$, which could be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>On universal graphs for trees and treewidth $k$ graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $s(n)$ be the minimum number of edges in a graph that contains every $n$-vertex tree as a subgraph. Chung and Graham [J. London Math. Soc. 1983] claim to prove that $s(n)\leqslant O(n\log n)$. We point out a mistake in their proof. The previously best known upper bound is $s(n)\leqslant O(n(\log n)(\log\log n)^{2})$ by Chung, Graham and Pippenger [Proc. Hungarian Coll. on Combinatorics 1976], the proof of which is missing many crucial details. We give a fully self-contained proof of the new and improved upper bound $s(n)\leqslant O(n(\log n)(\log\log n))$. The best known lower bound is $s(n)\geqslant \Omega(n\log n)$.
  We generalise these results for graphs of treewidth $k$. For an integer $k\geqslant 1$, let $s_k(n)$ be the minimum number of edges in a graph that contains every $n$-vertex graph with treewidth $k$ as a subgraph. So $s(n)=s_1(n)$. We show that $\Omega(k n\log n) \leqslant s_k(n) \leqslant O(kn(\log n)(\log\log n))$.</description>

      <title>Fast algorithms for Vizing's theorem on bounded degree graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05408v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vizing's theorem states that every graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ can be properly edge-colored using $\Delta + 1$ colors. The fastest currently known $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring algorithm for general graphs is due to Sinnamon and runs in time $O(m\sqrt{n})$, where $n :=|V(G)|$ and $m :=|E(G)|$. We investigate the case when $\Delta$ is constant, i.e., $\Delta = O(1)$. In this regime, the runtime of Sinnamon's algorithm is $O(n^{3/2})$, which can be improved to $O(n \log n)$, as shown by Gabow, Nishizeki, Kariv, Leven, and Terada. Here we give an algorithm whose running time is only $O(n)$, which is obviously best possible. Prior to this work, no linear-time $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring algorithm was known for any $\Delta \geq 4$. Using some of the same ideas, we also develop new algorithms for $(\Delta+1)$-edge-coloring in the $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ model of distributed computation. Namely, when $\Delta$ is constant, we design a deterministic $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ algorithm with running time $\tilde{O}(\log^5 n)$ and a randomized $\mathsf{LOCAL}$ algorithm with running time $O(\log ^2 n)$. Although our focus is on the constant $\Delta$ regime, our results remain interesting for $\Delta$ up to $\log^{o(1)} n$, since the dependence of their running time on $\Delta$ is polynomial. The key new ingredient in our algorithms is a novel application of the entropy compression method.</description>
