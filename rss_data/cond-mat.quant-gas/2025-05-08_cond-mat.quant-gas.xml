      <title>Dynamic scaling of vorticity in phase-separating superfluid mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it has been experimentally confirmed that non-equilibrium dynamics of phase separation in strongly ferromagnetic Bose-Einstein condensates of 7Li atoms obey the dynamic scaling law belonging to the binary- fluid universality class in the inertial hydrodynamic stage. The current work theoretically and numerically studies the dynamic scaling law of structure factor of vorticity in a phase-separating binary superfluid mixture, equivalent to the 7Li condensates in a strong limit of quadratic Zeeman shift. We found a dynamic scaling law for the structure factor based on our numerical observation that the peak of the energy spectrum from turbulence theory does not vary in time in the stage. Similarly to freely decaying turbulence, a power-law hierarchy exists in the energy spectrum in our system, and we proposed a decay law of the energy based on the dynamic scaling law by introducing the microscopic, high-wavenumber cutoff.</description>

      <title>Consistent Field Theory Across the Mott-Insulator to Superfluid Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ a field-theoretical approach to analyze the Bose-Hubbard model on a lattice, with a focus on the low-energy properties across the Mott insulator (MI) to superfluid (SF) transition. Prior approaches approximated the partition function using cumulant expansions around the MI ground state, which, while accurate in the MI phase, lead to inaccuracies in the SF phase where the MI state is a false ground state. By expanding around the correct mean-field vacuum, we derive the effective field theory (EFT) governing the MI to SF transition. Through this, we reveal the underlying structure of the EFT governing the nucleation of low-energy excitations, particularly the massless and lowest massive modes, offering new insights into their emergence.</description>

      <title>Disordered solid to Bose-glass transition in Bose-Hubbard model with disorder and long-range interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The introduction of disorder in Bose-Hubbard model gives rise to new glassy quantum phases, namely the Bose-glass (BG) and disordered solid (DS) phases. In this work, we present the rich phase diagram of interacting bosons in disordered two-dimensional optical lattice, modelled by the disordered Bose-Hubbard model. We systematically probe the effect of long-range interaction truncated to the nearest neighbors and next-nearest neighbors on the phase diagram. We investigate the zero-temperature ground-state quantum phases using the single-site Gutzwiller mean field (SGMF) theory. We also employ strong-coupling perturbative expansion to identify the nature of ground-state solid phases analytically. At sufficiently high disorder strength, we observe a quantum phase transition between the DS and BG phases. We have investigated this transition in greater detail using cluster Gutzwiller mean field theory to study the effect of inter-site correlations which is absent in the SGMF method. We have also studied this phase transition from the perspective of percolation theory.</description>

      <title>Trap-induced atom-ion complexes: a time-independent approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A trapped ion immersed in a neutral bath shows long-lived atom-ion complexes that significantly alter its chemical properties, and, thus the ion stability. In this work, we present a general study of trapped ion-atom scattering with the ion modeled as a charge distribution defined by the spatial extent of its ground-state wavefunction. After mapping the time-dependent problem onto a time-independent framework, we investigate the role of the trap, the atomic species, atom-ion interaction, and collision energy in shaping the chaotic dynamics of the system. We find that the probability of atom-ion complex formation directly measures its chaoticity. Therefore, our results establish a clear relationship between the emergence of chaotic scattering and the presence of ion-atom complexes.</description>

      <title>Quantum tunneling and anti-tunneling across entropic barriers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a quantum particle in a constricted two-dimensional channel and analyze how the onset of quantum corrections impacts the (semi-)classical high-temperature behaviour, as temperature is lowered. We characterize both equilibrium and non-equilibrium (transport) properties of the system, considering the case of a narrow and disorder-free channel. Counterintuitively, we find that quantum corrections do not monotonically enhance the particle current as the temperature is lowered, as naively expected from the activation of coherent tunnelling, but they rather inhibit transport at intermediate temperatures, increasing the effective free-energy barrier. We illustrate this ``anti-tunnelling'' effect numerically by computing the non-equilibrium steady-state of a quantum master equation describing the system, and confirm it analytically by adopting the Quantum Smoluchowski limit.</description>

      <title>Spin systems as quantum field theories in inflationary universe: A study with Unruh-DeWitt detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a method to probe the thermal properties of quantum field theory (QFT) in an inflationary universe simulated by spin systems. Our previous work (arXiv:2410.07587) has demonstrated that QFT of Majorana fermions in an arbitrary two-dimensional spacetime can be mapped onto a spin system. In this study, we apply this mapping to investigate the thermal properties of an inflationary universe. An interaction between a quantum field and a detector allows one to extract information about the quantum field from the excitation probability of the detector, known as the Unruh-DeWitt detector. In an inflationary universe with Hubble constant $H$, the excitation probability of an Unruh-DeWitt detector follows a thermal distribution with temperature $H/(2\pi)$, indicating that a static observer in the inflationary universe perceives a thermal field. We consider a spin system corresponding to QFT in an inflationary universe and introduce a single spin interacting with this system as an Unruh-DeWitt detector. We demonstrate that the detector response asymptotically approaches the result of QFT with an appropriate power of the number of spin sites. Since the dynamics of spin systems can be implemented on programmable quantum simulation platforms, our study offers a concrete route toward experimentally probing the thermal properties of an inflationary universe in controlled quantum settings. This highlights the potential of quantum technologies to emulate and investigate aspects of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.</description>

      <title>The relevance of "on" and "off" transitions in quantum pair production experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04473v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Analog gravity experiments, such as those realized in Bose-Einstein condensates, often aim at simulating cosmological pair production due to the dynamical expansion of the universe. However, these experiments have a start and an end, which introduces unavoidable transitions out of and into static regimes that alter the intended expansion profile. We show that the resulting particle spectra can be overwhelmingly dominated by these transition periods, which calls for a careful interpretation of experimental outcomes. In prospective Schwinger effect experiments, by contrast, transition effects do not dominate particle production, and such a reinterpretation may not be necessary.</description>

      <title>Floquet realization of prethermal Meissner phase in a two-leg flux ladder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a periodically driven two-leg flux ladder hosting interacting hardcore bosons exhibits a prethermal Meissner phase for large drive amplitudes and at special drive frequencies. Such a prethermal Meissner phase is characterized by a finite time-averaged chiral current. We find an analytic expression of these frequencies using Floquet perturbation theory. Our analysis reveals that the presence of the prethermal Meissner phase is tied to the emergence of strong Hilbert space fragmentation in these driven ladders. We support our analytical results by numerical study of finite-size flux ladders using exact diagonalization and discuss experiments using ultracold dipolar atom platforms that may test our theory.</description>
