      <title>Improving the electromagnetic form factor of the pion at large $Q^2$ using the Feynman-Hellmann theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At large momentum transfer, it becomes increasingly difficult to access the form factor of the pion $F_\pi(Q^2)$ using lattice QCD simulations. Two of the limiting factors include the increased computational cost of adding more statistics to overcome gauge noise, as well as suppressed overlap with the ground state of the boosted pion. Here we apply two noise reduction techniques, all-mode averaging (AMA) and momentum smearing, to the computation of $F_\pi(Q^2)$ at high momentum transfers using the Feynman-Hellmann (FH) theorem. First, we show that all-mode averaging by itself produces good improvement compared to previous results, at an equal computational cost. We also implement a momentum smearing technique to further reduce statistical uncertainties. In contrast to conventional smearing approaches, our Feynman-Hellmann method requires combining back-to-back momentum states, and hence we adapt a version of smearing involving a superposition of back-to-back smearing operations. This method is then implemented to compute $F_\pi(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \;\mathrm{GeV^2}$, demonstrating good improvement over the regular smeared counterpart. Finally both all-mode averaging and momentum smearing are combined to determine $F_\pi(Q^2)$ at $Q^2 = 6.6 \;\mathrm{GeV^2}$ showing an excellent preliminary improvement over previous calculations.</description>

      <title>Physicality oracle for SU(3) Loop-String-Hadron dynamics: a digital quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13035v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the aim of understanding quantum chromodynamics through simulation, an increasingly studied approach is that of quantum computation and simulation. Challenges exist in encoding the minimal and physical degrees of freedom for a non-Abelian gauge theory and maintaining physical or gauge-invariant dynamics in a simulation. In this work, the Loop-String-Hadron (LSH) formulation of the 1+1-dimensional SU(3) lattice gauge theory is used to define an efficient mapping of SU(3) invariant degrees of freedom onto qubits. It is shown that the required number of qubits in the LSH basis is significantly reduced compared to its IRREP basis counterpart. While the non-Abelian Gauss laws of the SU(3) theory are automatically satisfied by the usage of LSH variables, the remnant constraints on the consistency of the flux numbers still exist. During time evolution, the noise can accumulate and take the state out of the sector of the Hilbert space where the constraint is satisfied. With this motivation, an oracle algorithm is constructed to be applied to the qubits for checking the local constraint at a given link. Costs in terms of qubit and gate number, and circuit depth, are found.</description>

      <title>Classifying GNY-like models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a systematic classification of (2+1)d Gross--Neveu--Yukawa-like models built out of one or more 4-component Dirac fermions and $M$ scalar fields, which preserve an O($M$) symmetry rotating the scalars. We then identify the perturbative fixed points of these models in the $4-\epsilon$ expansion. Our classification highlights several targets for the conformal bootstrap and reveals a new fixed point with $M=3$, which we call the "orthogonal Heisenberg" CFT.</description>

      <title>Gluon Gravitational $ D$-Form Factor: The $\sigma$-Meson as a Dilaton Confronted with Lattice Data II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the gluon gravitational form factors of the $\pi$, $N$, $\rho$, and $\Delta$ using lattice QCD data at $m_\pi \approx 450 \text{MeV}$ and $m_\pi \approx 170 \text{MeV}$. We base the analysis on fits to a simple $\sigma/f_0(500)$-meson pole, supplemented by a polynomial background term. The fitted residues agree with predictions from dilaton effective theory, in which the $\sigma$-meson acts as the dilaton, the pseudo Goldstone boson of spontaneously broken scale symmetry. We derive new dilaton-based predictions for the $\rho$- and $\Delta$-gravitational form factors, and comment on the $\eta_{c}$- and $\eta_b$-form factors in the context of the dilaton interpretation. These results reinforce our earlier findings, based on lattice total (quark and gluon) gravitational form factors, and provide further evidence that QCD dynamics may be governed by an infrared fixed point.</description>

      <title>Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06673v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has long been desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, solved by higher category theory. The problem is solved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way.
  The refinement needed is a generalization--through the lens of higher category theory--of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, making the language of categories natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ pion vacua non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory; the structures behind the non-linear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory are related via an implicit Yang-Baxter equation.
  In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.</description>

      <title>The curvature of the pseudo-critical line in the QCD phase diagram from mesonic lattice correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the QCD phase diagram, the dependence of the pseudo-critical temperature, $T_{\rm{pc}}$, on the baryon chemical potential, $\mu_B$, is of fundamental interest. The variation of $T_{\rm{pc}}$ with $\mu_B$ is normally captured by $\kappa$, the coefficient of the leading (quadratic) term of the polynomial expansion of $T_{\rm{pc}}$ with $\mu_B$. In this work, we present the first calculation of $\kappa$ using hadronic quantities. Simulating $N_f=2+1$ flavours of Wilson fermions on {\sc Fastsum} ensembles, we calculate the ${\cal O}(\mu_B^2)$ correction to mesonic correlation functions. By demanding degeneracy in the vector and axial-vector channels we obtain $T_{\rm{pc}}(\mu_B)$ and hence $\kappa$. While lacking a continuum extrapolation and being away from the physical point, our results are consistent with previous works using thermodynamic observables (renormalised chiral condensate, strange quark number susceptibility) from lattice QCD simulations with staggered fermions.</description>

      <title>HoloNet: Toward a Unified Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton Framework of QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.06044v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose HoloNet, a neural-network framework that unifies lattice QCD(LQCD) thermodynamics and holographic Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) theory within a data-to-holography pipeline. Instead of assuming specific functional forms, HoloNet learns the metric profile $A(z)$ and the gauge-dilaton coupling $f(z)$ directly from 2+1-flavor LQCD data at $\mu=0$. These learned functions are embedded into the EMD equations, enabling the model to reproduce the lattice equation of state and baryon number fluctuations with high fidelity. Once trained, HoloNet provides a fully data-driven holographic description of QCD that extends naturally to finite density, allowing us to map the phase diagram and estimate the location of the critical end point (CEP). The reconstructed potential $V(\phi)$ and coupling $f(\phi)$ agree quantitatively with those obtained from holographic renormalization, demonstrating that HoloNet can consistently bridge different holographic models.</description>

      <title>Infinite matrix product states for $(1+1)$-dimensional gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator construction that allows us to represent the lattice Hamiltonians of (abelian or non-abelian) gauge theories in a local and manifestly translation-invariant form. In particular, we use symmetric matrix product states and introduce link-enhanced matrix product operators (LEMPOs) that can act on both the physical and virtual spaces of the matrix product states. This construction allows us to study Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories on infinite lattices. As examples, we show how to implement this method to study the massless and massive one-flavor Schwinger model and adjoint QCD$_2$.</description>

      <title>Nonleptonic $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ weak transitions in QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20937v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nonleptonic two-body weak decays of the single bottom baryon $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ into $\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ final states within the factorization framework. Employing this framework and incorporating the contributions from the current-current operators, we compute the tree-level decay amplitudes and decay widths of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}P(V)$ processes in terms of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ transition form factors. Here, $P$ and $V$ denote pseudoscalar and vector mesons, respectively. Using the form factors obtained in our previous work, we evaluate the numerical values of the decay widths and branching fractions for all relevant weak channels. This study complements our previous analysis of the semileptonic weak transitions $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ reported in Ref. [1], thereby providing a comprehensive investigation of all possible $\Omega_{b}^{*}\rightarrow\Omega_{c}^{*}$ weak decays of the $\Omega_{b}^{*}$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon induced by isovector and isoscalar currents in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.12360v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tensor form factors of the $\Delta^+$ baryon are defined through the matrix element of the tensor current and describe its internal structure and spin distribution. We present the full Lorentz decomposition for the $\Delta^+ \rightarrow \Delta^+$ tensor current matrix element, including all independent structures consistent with Lorentz covariance, the Rarita-Schwinger constraints, and the discrete symmetries of Hermiticity, time-reversal, and parity invariance. By investigating the tensor form factors corresponding to both the isovector and isoscalar tensor currents, we observe differences that reflect the distinct contributions of up and down quark components in the $\Delta^+$ baryon.</description>

      <title>Projected Density Matrix Sampling for Lattice Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19209v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.</description>
