      <title>Graded Injective Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An integral domain $R$ is an $i$-domain if for every overring $S$ of $R$, $\text{Spec}(S) \rightarrow \text{Spec}(R)$ is injective and is a mated integral if for every overring $S$ of $R$ and prime ideal $P$ of $R$ such that $PS \neq S$, there exists exactly one prime ideal $Q$ of $S$ such that $Q \cap R = P$. In this paper, we explore graded notions of $i$-domains and mated domains and their connection with gr-Pr\"{u}fer domains.</description>

      <title>Arf rings, simple singularities and reflexive modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a pandemic era preprint, Dao showed showed two remarkable properties of Arf rings: under some mild conditions, they admit finitely many indecomposable reflexive modules up to isomorphism and every reflexive module is actually isomorphic to its own dual. In fact, the latter property characterises Arf rings. Arf rings are one dimensional rings and it is natural to wonder what happens in higher Krull dimension. In this paper, we investigate the self-dual property for commutative Noetherian local rings.</description>

      <title>Some notes on topological rings and their groups of units</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02634v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $R$ is a topological ring then $R^{\ast}$, the group of units of $R$, with the subspace topology is not necessarily a topological group. This leads us to the following natural definition: By an \emph{absolute topological ring} we mean a topological ring such that its group of units with the subspace topology is a topological group. We prove that every commutative ring with the $I$-adic topology is an absolute topological ring. Next, we prove that if $I$ is an ideal of a ring $R$ then for the $I$-adic topology over $R$ we have $\pi_{0}(R)=R/(\bigcap\limits_{n\geqslant1}I^{n})=t(R)$ where $\pi_{0}(R)$ is the space of connected components of $R$ and $t(R)$ is the space of irreducible closed subsets of $R$. We observed that the main result of Koh \cite{kwangil} as well as its corrected form \cite[Chap II, \S12, Theorem 12.1]{Ursul} are not true, and then we corrected this result in the right way. In the Wikipedia pages, it is claimed that ``the identity component of a topological group is always a characteristic subgroup'', we also provide a counterexample to this claim. Finally, we fix a gap in the proof of the fact that every epimorphism of the category of Hausdorff topological spaces has a dense image.</description>

      <title>Auslander-Reiten annihilators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Auslander-Reiten Conjecture for commutative Noetherian rings predicts that a finitely generated module is projective when certain Ext-modules vanish. But what if those Ext-modules do not vanish? We study the annihilators of these Ext-modules and formulate a generalisation of the Auslander-Reiten Conjecture. We prove this general version for high syzygies of modules over several classes of rings including analytically unramified Arf rings, 2-dimensional local normal domains with rational singularities, Gorenstein isolated singularities of Krull dimension at least 2 and more. We also prove results for the special case of the canonical module of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. These results both generalise and also provide evidence for a version of the Tachikawa Conjecture that was considered by Dao-Kobayashi-Takahashi.</description>

      <title>On deformation of perfectoid purity in Gorenstein domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: If $(R,\mathfrak{m})$ is a complete local ring of mixed characteristic $(0,p)$ and $R/pR$ is an $F$-pure Gorenstein domain, we find a sufficient condition for $R$ to be perfectoid pure. This condition is related to the Cohen-Macaulayness of the absolute integral closures of Gorenstein local domains of mixed characteristic which are not necessarily excellent. Along the way, we show that the problem of lifting $F$-purity of $R/pR$ to perfectoid purity of $R$ is equivalent to a similar deformation problem for the splinter property.</description>

      <title>When are syzygies of the residue field self-dual?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Finitely generated reflexive modules over commutative Noetherian rings form a key component of Auslander and Bridger's stable module theory and are likewise essential in the study of Cohen--Macaulay representations. Recently, H. Dao characterized Arf local rings as exactly those one-dimensional Cohen--Macaulay local rings over which every finitely generated reflexive module is self-dual, and raised the general question of characterizing rings over which every finitely generated reflexive module is self-dual. Motivated by this, in this article, we study the question of self-duality of syzygies of the residue field of a local ring when they are known to be reflexive. We show that for local rings of depth at least 2, the answer is given by hypersurface or regular local rings in most cases.</description>

      <title>Reading Rational Univariate Representations on lexicographic Groebner bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this contribution, we consider a zero-dimensional polynomial system in $n$ variables defined over a field $\mathbb{K}$. In the context of computing a Rational Univariate Representation (RUR) of its solutions, we address the problem of certifying a separating linear form and, once certified, calculating the RUR that comes from it, without any condition on the ideal else than being zero-dimensional. Our key result is that the RUR can be read (closed formula) from lexicographic Groebner bases of bivariate elimination ideals, even in the case where the original ideal that is not in shape position, so that one can use the same core as the well known FGLM method to propose a simple algorithm. Our first experiments, either with a very short code (300 lines) written in Maple or with a Julia code using straightforward implementations performing only classical Gaussian reductions in addition to Groebner bases for the degree reverse lexicographic ordering, show that this new method is already competitive with sophisticated state of the art implementations which do not certify the parameterizations.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and singly-generated torsion classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that each torsion class of abelian groups is generated by a single group within the class (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>

      <title>Ind-cluster algebras and infinite Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A prototypical examples of a cluster algebra is the coordinate ring of a finite Grassmannian: using the Pl\"ucker embedding the cluster algebra structure allows one to move between `maximal sets' of algebraically independent Pl\"ucker coordinates via mutations. Fioresi and Hacon studied a specific colimit of the coordinate rings of finite Grassmannians and its link with the infinite Grassmannian introduced by Sato and independently by Segal and Wilson in connection with the Kadomtsev-Petiashvili (KP) hierarchy, an infinite set of nonlinear partial differential equations which possess soliton solutions. In this article we prove that this ring is a cluster algebra of infinite rank with the structure induced by the colimit construction. More generally, we prove that cluster algebras of infinite rank are precisely the ind-objects of a natural category of cluster algebras.</description>

      <title>Fedder-type criterion for quasi-$F^e$-splitting and quasi-$F$-regularity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09015v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasi-$F^e$-split and quasi-$F$-regular singularities, which generalize Yobuko's quasi-$F$-splitting. We establish Fedder type criteria that characterize these properties for hypersurfaces. These criteria offer explicit tools for computation and verification. As an application, we construct a counterexample to the inversion of adjunction for quasi-$F$-regularity.</description>
