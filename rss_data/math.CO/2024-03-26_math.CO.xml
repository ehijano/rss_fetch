      <title>Extending matroid classes closed under flats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We call a class $\mathcal{M}$ of matroids hereditary if it is closed under flats. We denote by $\mathcal{M}^{ext}$ the class of matroids $M$ that is in $\mathcal{M}$, or has an element $e$ such that $M \backslash e$ is in $\mathcal{M}$. We prove that if $\mathcal{M}$ has finitely many forbidden flats, then so does $\mathcal{M}^{ext} $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have identified some necessary conditions for the existence of rigid sphere designs. In particular, we have successfully resolved the conjecture proposed by [Ban87]; Given fixed positive integers t and d, we show that there exist only finitely many rigid t-designs on Sd, up to orthogonal transformations.</description>

      <title>Exact distance Kneser graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any graph $G = (V,E)$ and positive integer $d$, the exact distance-$d$ graph $G_{=d}$ is the graph with vertex set $V$, where two vertices are adjacent if and only if the distance between them in $G$ is $d$. We study the exact distance-$d$ Kneser graphs. For these graphs, we characterize the adjacency of vertices in terms of the cardinality of the intersection between them. We present formulas describing the distance between any pair of vertices and we compute the diameter of these graphs.</description>

      <title>Highly connected graphs have highly connected spanning bipartite subgraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For integers $k,n$ with $1 \le k \le n/2$, let $f(k,n)$ be the smallest integer $t$ such that every $t$-connected $n$-vertex graph has a spanning bipartite $k$-connected subgraph. A conjecture of Thomassen asserts that $f(k,n)$ is upper bounded by some function of $k$. The best upper bound for $f(k,n)$ is by Delcourt and Ferber who proved that $f(k,n) \le 10^{10}k^3 \log n$. Here it is proved that $f(k,n) \le 22k^2 \log n$. For larger $k$, stronger bounds hold. In the linear regime, it is proved that for any $0 &lt; c &lt; \frac{1}{2}$ and all sufficiently large $n$, if $k=\lfloor cn \rfloor$, then $f(k, n) \le 30\sqrt{c} n \le 30\sqrt{n(k+1)}$. In the polynomial regime, it is proved that for any $\frac{1}{3} \le \alpha &lt; 1$ and all sufficiently large $n$, if $k = \lfloor n^\alpha \rfloor$, then $f(k ,n) \le 9n^{(1+\alpha)/2} \le 9\sqrt{n(k+1)}$.</description>

      <title>Proper Rainbow Saturation Numbers for Cycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We say that an edge-coloring of a graph $G$ is proper if every pair of incident edges receive distinct colors, and is rainbow if no two edges of $G$ receive the same color. Furthermore, given a fixed graph $F$, we say that $G$ is rainbow $F$-saturated if $G$ admits a proper edge-coloring which does not contain any rainbow subgraph isomorphic to $F$, but the addition of any edge to $G$ makes such an edge-coloring impossible. The maximum number of edges in a rainbow $F$-saturated graph is the rainbow Tur\'an number, whose study was initiated in 2007 by Keevash, Mubayi, Sudakov, and Verstra\"ete. Recently, Bushaw, Johnston, and Rombach introduced study of a corresponding saturation problem, asking for the minimum number of edges in a rainbow $F$-saturated graph. We term this minimum the proper rainbow saturation number of $F$, denoted $\mathrm{sat}^*(n,F)$. We asymptotically determine $\mathrm{sat}^*(n,C_4)$, answering a question of Bushaw, Johnston, and Rombach. We also exhibit constructions which establish upper bounds for $\mathrm{sat}^*(n,C_5)$ and $\mathrm{sat}^*(n,C_6)$.</description>

      <title>Mutual-visibility problems in Kneser and Johnson graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15645v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph and $\cal X \subseteq V(G)$. By definition, two vertices $u$ and $v$ are $\cal X$-visible in $G$ if there exists a shortest $u,v$-path with all internal vertices being outside of the set $\cal X$. The largest size of $\cal X$ such that any two vertices of $G$ (resp. any two vertices from $\cal X$) are $\cal X$-visible is the total mutual-visibility number (resp. the mutual-visibility number) of $G$.
  In this paper, we determine the total mutual-visibility number of Kneser graphs, bipartite Kneser graphs, and Johnson graphs. The formulas proved for Kneser, and bipartite Kneser graphs are related to the size of transversal-critical uniform hypergraphs, while the total mutual-visibility number of Johnson graphs is equal to a hypergraph Tur\'an number. Exact values or estimations for the mutual-visibility number over these graph classes are also established.</description>

      <title>Partitions in which every term but the smallest one is consecutive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we introduce the notion of almost consecutive partitions. A partition is almost consecutive if every term is consecutive, with the possible exception of the smallest one. We find formulas relating to the smallest parts of consecutive and almost consecutive partitions. We also find an alternate combinatorial interpretation of the number of almost consecutive partitions of a given integer $n$ and an asymptotic formula for this quantity.</description>

      <title>Ramsey multiplicity of apices of trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is common if its Ramsey multiplicity, i.e., the minimum number of monochromatic copies of $H$ contained in any $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$, is asymptotically the same as the number of monochromatic copies in the random $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$. Erd\H{o}s conjectured that every complete graph is common, which was disproved by Thomason in the 1980s. Till today, a classification of common graphs remains a widely open challenging problem. Grzesik, Lee, Lidick\'y and Volec [Combin. Prob. Comput. 31 (2022), 907--923] conjectured that every $k$-apex of any connected Sidorenko graph is common. We prove for $k\le 5$ that the $k$-apex of any tree is common.</description>

      <title>Counting induced subgraphs with the Kromatic symmetric function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The \emph{chromatic symmetric function} $X_G$ is a sum of monomials corresponding to proper vertex colorings of a graph $G$. Crew, Pechenik, and Spirkl (2023) recently introduced a $K$-theoretic analogue $\overline{X}_G$ called the \emph{Kromatic symmetric function}, where each vertex is instead assigned a nonempty set of colors such that adjacent vertices have nonoverlapping color sets. $X_G$ does not distinguish all graphs, but a longstanding open question is whether it distinguishes all trees. We conjecture that $\overline{X}_G$ does distinguish all graphs. As evidence towards this conjecture, we show that $\overline{X}_G$ determines the number of copies in $G$ of certain induced subgraphs on 4 and 5 vertices as well as the number of induced subgraphs isomorphic to each graph consisting of a star plus some number of isolated vertices.</description>

      <title>Geochromatic Number when Crossings are Independent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A geometric graph, $\overline{G}$, is a graph drawn in the plane, with straight line edges and vertices in general position. A geometric homomorphism between two geometric graphs $\overline{G}$, $\overline{H}$ is a vertex map $f:\overline{G}\to\overline{H}$ that preserves vertex adjacency and edge crossings. The geochromatic number of $\overline{G}$, denoted $X(\overline{G})$, is the smallest integer $n$ so that there is a geometric homomorphism from $\overline{G}$ to some geometric realization of $K_n$. Recall that the chromatic number of an abstract graph $G$, denoted $\chi(G)$, is the smallest integer $n$ for which there is a graph homomorphism from $G$ to $K_n$. It is immediately clear that $\chi(G)\leq X(\overline{G})$. This paper establishes some upper bounds on $X(\overline{G})$ in terms of $\chi(G)$. For instance, if all crossings are at distance at least 1 from each other, then $X(\overline{G})\leq 3\chi(G)$. However, there are more precise results. If all crossing are at distance at least 2, then $X(\overline{G})\leq \chi(G)+2$. If all crossings are at distance at least 1, and there is a graph homomorphism $f: G \to K_n$ that maps no pair of edges that cross in $\overline{G}$ to the same edge in $K_n$, then $X(\overline{G})\leq 2n$. Finally, if $\chi(G)\in \{2,3\}$ and all crossings are at distance at least 1, then $X(\overline{G})\leq 2\chi(G)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a collection of points and the sets of slopes or directions of the lines between pairs of points. It is known that the algebraic matroid on this set of elements is the well studied 2-dimensional rigidity matroid. This article analyzes a construction on top of the set of slopes given by an angle constraint system of incidences and angles. In this setting we provide a matricial rigidity formulation of the problem for colored graphs, an algebro-geometric reformulation, precise necessary conditions and a combinatorial characterization of the generic behaviour for a special case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schubert polynomials give polynomial representatives of Schubert classes in the cohomology of the complete flag variety and have a combinatorial formulation in terms of bumpless pipe dreams. Quantum double Schubert polynomials are polynomial representatives of Schubert classes in the torus-equivariant quantum cohomology of the complete flag variety, but they have no analogous combinatorial formulation. We introduce a generalization of the bumpless pipe dreams called quantum bumpless pipe dreams, giving a novel combinatorial formula for quantum double Schubert polynomials as a sum of binomial weights of quantum bumpless pipe dreams. We give a bijective proof for this formula by showing that the sum of binomial weights satisfies a defining recursion that is a special case of Monk's rule.</description>

      <title>$qt$RSK${}^*$: A probabilistic dual RSK correspondence for Macdonald polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a probabilistic generalization of the dual Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence, called $qt$RSK${}^*$, depending on two parameters $q$ and $t$. This correspondence extends the $q$RS$t$ correspondence, recently introduced by the authors, and allows the first tableaux-theoretic proof of the dual Cauchy identity for Macdonald polynomials. By specializing $q$ and $t$, one recovers the row and column insertion version of the classical dual RSK correspondence as well as of $q$- and $t$-deformations thereof which are connected to $q$-Whittaker and Hall--Littlewood polynomials. When restricting to Jack polynomials and $\{0,1\}$-matrices corresponding to words, we prove that the insertion tableaux obtained by $qt$RSK${}^*$ are invariant under swapping letters in the input word. Our approach is based on Fomin's growth diagrams and the notion of probabilistic bijections.</description>

      <title>Three Examples of Quasisymmetric Compatible $\mathfrak{S}_n$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Schur functions, a basis for the symmetric polynomials (Sym), encode the irreducible representations of the symmetric group, $\mathfrak{S}_n$, via the Frobenius characteristic map. In 1996, Krob and Thibon defined a quasisymmetric Frobenius map on the representations of $\mathcal{H}_n(0)$, mapping them to the quasisymmetric functions (QSym). Despite the obvious inclusion of Sym in QSym and the close relationship between $\mathfrak{S}_n$ and $\mathcal{H}_n(0)$, there is no known direct link between these two Frobenius characteristic maps and the related representations. We explore three specific situations in which a deformation of an $\mathfrak{S}_n$ action results in a valid $\mathcal{H}_n(0)$ action and gives a quasisymmetric Frobenius characteristic that is equal to the symmetric Frobenius characteristic. We introduce the concept of quasisymmetric compatibility, which formalizes a link between the two maps, and we show it applies to all $\mathfrak{S}_n$-modules.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical strong external difference families (SEDFs) are much-studied combinatorial structures motivated by information security applications; it is conjectured that only one classical abelian SEDF exists with more than two sets. Recently, non-disjoint SEDFs were introduced; it was shown that families of these exist with arbitrarily many sets. We present constructions for both classical and non-disjoint SEDFs, which encompass all known non-cyclotomic examples for either type (plus many new examples) using a sequence-based framework. Moreover, we introduce a range of new external difference structures (allowing set-sizes to vary, and sets to be replaced by multisets) in both the classical and non-disjoint case, and show how these may be applied to various communications applications.</description>

      <title>An infinite family of Type 1 fullerene nanodiscs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A total coloring of a graph colors all its elements, vertices and edges, with no adjacency conflicts. The Total Coloring Conjecture (TCC) is a sixty year old challenge, says that every graph admits a total coloring with at most maximum degree plus two colors, and many graph parameters have been studied in connection with its validity. If a graph admits a total coloring with maximum degree plus one colors, then it is Type 1, whereas it is Type 2, in case it does not admit a total coloring with maximum degree plus one colors but it does satisfy the TCC. Cavicchioli, Murgolo and Ruini proposed in 2003 the hunting for a Type 2 snark with girth at least 5. Brinkmann, Preissmann and Sasaki in 2015 conjectured that there is no Type 2 cubic graph with girth at least 5. We investigate the total coloring of fullerene nanodiscs, a class of cubic planar graphs with girth 5 arising in Chemistry. We prove that the central layer of an arbitrary fullerene nanodisc is 4-total colorable, a necessary condition for the nanodisc to be Type 1. We extend the obtained 4-total coloring to a 4-total coloring of the whole nanodisc, when the radius satisfies r = 5 + 3k, providing an infinite family of Type 1 nanodiscs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We observe that several vertex Tur\'an type problems for the hypercube that received a considerable amount of attention in the combinatorial community are equivalent to questions about erasure list-decodable codes. Analyzing a recent construction of Ellis, Ivan and Leader, and determining the Tur\'an density of certain hypergraph augemntations we obtain improved bounds for some of these problems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general formula for the quadratic embedding constant of a graph join $\bar{K}_m+G$, where $\bar{K}_m$ is the empty graph on $m\ge1$ vertices and $G$ is an arbitrary graph. Applying our formula to a fan graph $K_1+P_n$, where $K_1=\bar{K}_1$ is the singleton graph and $P_n$ is the path on $n\ge1$ vertices, we show that $\mathrm{QEC}(K_1+P_n)=-\tilde{\alpha}_n-2$, where $\tilde{\alpha}_n$ is the minimal zero of a new polynomial $\Phi_n(x)$ related to Chebyshev polynomials of the second kind. Moreover, for an even $n$ we have $\tilde{\alpha}_n=\min\mathrm{ev}(A_n)$, where the right-hand side is the An minimal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix $A_n$ of $P_n$. For an odd $n$ we show that $\min\mathrm{ev}(A_{n+1})\le\tilde{\alpha}_n&lt;\min\mathrm{ev}(A_n)$.</description>

      <title>Constructions of local antimagic 3-colorable graphs of fixed odd size | matrix approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An edge labeling of a connected graph $G = (V, E)$ is said to be local antimagic if there is a bijection $f:E \to\{1,\ldots ,|E|\}$ such that for any pair of adjacent vertices $x$ and $y$, $f^+(x)\not= f^+(y)$, where the induced vertex label $f^+(x)= \sum f(e)$, with $e$ ranging over all the edges incident to $x$. The local antimagic chromatic number of $G$, denoted by $\chi_{la}(G)$, is the minimum number of distinct induced vertex labels over all local antimagic labelings of $G$. In this paper, we give three ways to construct a $(3m+2)\times (2k+1)$ matrix that meets certain properties for $m=1,3$ and $k\ge 1$. Consequently, we obtained many (disconnected) graphs of size $(3m+2)(2k+1)$ with local antimagic chromatic number 3.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of the Boolean hypercube $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is a sumset if $S = A+A = \{a + b \ | \ a, b\in A\}$ for some $A \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^n$. We prove that the number of sumsets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is asymptotically $(2^n-1)2^{2^{n-1}}$. Furthermore, we show that the family of sumsets in $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ is almost identical to the family of all subsets of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ that contain a complete linear subspace of co-dimension $1$.</description>

      <title>H-Clique-Width and a Hereditary Analogue of Product Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel generalization of the notion of clique-width which aims to bridge the gap between classical hereditary width measures and the recently introduced graph product structure theory. Bounding the new H-clique-width, in the special case of H being the class of paths, is equivalent to admitting a hereditary (i.e., induced) product structure of a path times a graph of bounded clique-width. Furthermore, every graph admitting the usual (non-induced) product structure of a path times a graph of bounded tree-width, has bounded H-clique-width, i.e., it admits the new product structure in an induced way. We prove further basic properties of H-clique-width in general.</description>

Abstract: A locally-primitive design is a block design $(\mathcal{P},\mathcal{B})$ which admits an automorphism group $G$ with primitive local actions. It is proved that $G$ is primitive on the points $\mathcal{P}$, and either $G$ is an almost simple group, or $G$ acting on $\mathcal{P}$ is an affine group.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic diversity indices from an affine and projective viewpoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phylogenetic diversity indices are commonly used to rank the elements in a collection of species or populations for conservation purposes. The derivation of these indices is typically based on some quantitative description of the evolutionary history of the species in question, which is often given in terms of a phylogenetic tree. Both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees can be employed, and there are close connections between the indices that are derived in these two different ways. In this paper, we introduce more general phylogenetic diversity indices that can be derived from collections of subsets (clusters) and collections of bipartitions (splits) of the given set of species. Such indices could be useful, for example, in case there is some uncertainty in the topology of the tree being used to derive a phylogenetic diversity index. As well as characterizing some of the indices that we introduce in terms of their special properties, we provide a link between cluster-based and split-based phylogenetic diversity indices that uses a discrete analogue of the classical link between affine and projective geometry. This provides a unified framework for many of the various phylogenetic diversity indices used in the literature based on rooted and unrooted phylogenetic trees, generalizations and new proofs for previous results concerning tree-based indices, and a way to define some new phylogenetic diversity indices that naturally arise as affine or projective variants of each other.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Group Spectra for Some Small Relation Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The question of characterizing the (finite) representable relation algebras in a ``nice" way is open. The class $\mathbf{RRA}$ is known to be not finitely axiomatizable in first-order logic. Nevertheless, it is conjectured that ``almost all'' finite relation algebras are representable.
  All finite relation algebras with three or fewer atoms are representable. So one may ask, Over what cardinalities of sets are they representable? This question was answered completely by Andr\'eka and Maddux (``Representations for small relation algebras,'' \emph{Notre Dame J. Form. Log.}, \textbf{35} (1994)); they determine the spectrum of every finite relation algebra with three or fewer atoms.
  In the present paper, we restrict attention to cyclic group representations, and completely determine the cyclic group spectrum for all seven symmetric integral relation algebras on three atoms. We find that in some instances, the spectrum and cyclic spectrum agree; in other instances, the spectra disagree for finitely many $n$; finally, for other instances, the spectra disagree for infinitely many $n$. The proofs employ constructions, SAT solvers, and the probabilistic method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15942v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Curve singularities are classical objects of study in algebraic geometry. The key player in their combinatorial structure is the {\it value semigroup}, or its compactification, the {\it value semiring}. One natural problem is to explicitly determine the value semirings of distinguished infinite classes of singularities, with a view to understanding their asymptotic properties. In this paper, we establish a matroidal framework for resolving this problem for singularities determined by arrangements of toric branches; and we obtain precise quantitative results in the case of line arrangements. Our results have implications for the topology of Severi varieties of unisingular rational curves in projective space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15987v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define term rewriting systems on the vertices and faces of nestohedra, and show that the former are confluent and terminating. While the associated poset on vertices generalizes Barnard--McConville's flip order for graph-associahedra, the preorder on faces likely generalizes the facial weak order for permutahedra. Moreover, we define and study contextual families of nestohedra, whose local confluence diagrams satisfy a certain uniformity condition. Among them are associahedra and operahedra, whose associated proofs of confluence for their rewriting systems reproduce proofs of categorical coherence theorems for monoidal categories and categorified operads.</description>

      <title>A descent basis for the Garsia-Procesi module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assign to each Young diagram $\lambda$ a subset $\mathcal{B}_{\lambda'}$ of the collection of Garsia-Stanton descent monomials, and prove that it determines a basis of the Garsia-Procesi module $R_\lambda$, whose graded character is the Hall-Littlewood polynomial $\tilde{H}_{\lambda}[X;t]$. This basis is a major index analogue of the basis $\mathcal{B}_\lambda \subset R_\lambda$ defined by certain recursions in due to Garsia and Procesi, in the same way that the descent basis is related to the Artin basis of the coinvariant algebra $R_n$, which in fact corresponds to the case when $\lambda=1^n$. By anti-symmetrizing a subset of this basis with respect to the corresponding Young subgroup under the Springer action, we obtain a basis in the parabolic case, as well as a corresponding formula for the expansion of $\tilde{H}_{\lambda}[X;t]$. Despite a similar appearance, it does not appear obvious how to connect these formulas appear to the specialization of the modified Macdonald formula of Haglund, Haiman and Loehr at $q=0$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the path ideals of both paths and cycles have minimal cellular resolutions. Specifically, these minimal free resolutions coincide with the Barile-Macchia resolutions for paths, and their generalized counterparts for cycles. Our result on cycles marks the first instance in the literature where the minimal free resolution of edge ideals of cycles has been established. Furthermore, edge ideals of cycles represent the first class of ideals that lack a minimal Barile-Macchia resolution, yet have a minimal generalized Barile-Macchia resolution.</description>

      <title>Multinomial random combinatorial structures and $r$-versions of Stirling, Eulerian and Lah numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.16448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce multinomial and $r$-variants of several classic objects of combinatorial probability, such as the random recursive and Hoppe trees, random set partitions and compositions, the Chinese restaurant process, Feller's coupling, and some others. Just as various classic combinatorial numbers - like Stirling, Eulerian and Lah numbers - emerge as essential ingredients defining the distributions of the mentioned processes, the so-called $r$-versions of these numbers appear in exact distributional formulas for the multinomial and $r$-counterparts. This approach allows us to offer a concise probabilistic interpretation for various identities involving $r$-versions of these combinatorial numbers, which were either unavailable or meaningful only for specific values of the parameter $r$. We analyze the derived distributions for fixed-size structures and establish distributional limit theorems as the size tends to infinity. Utilizing the aforementioned generalized Stirling numbers of both kinds, we define and analyze $(r,s)$-Lah distributions, which have arisen in the existing literature on combinatorial probability in various contexts.</description>

The examples include families of evaluation modules obtained from analytic continuation and automorphism twists of Verma modules of the quantum affine $\mathfrak{gl}_2$ algebra. The combinatorial bases in the modules are labeled by colored plane partitions with various properties.</description>

Abstract: We upgrade the results of Borot--Bouchard--Chidambaram--Creutzig to show that the Gaiotto vector in $\mathcal{N} = 2$ pure supersymmetric gauge theory admits an analytic continuation with respect to the energy scale (which can therefore be taken to be finite, instead of infinitesimal), and is computed by topological recursion on the (ramified) UV or Gaiotto spectral curve. This has a number of interesting consequences for the Gaiotto vector: relations to intersection theory on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$ in two different ways, Hurwitz numbers and quantum curves. The same method is used to establish analogous results for the more general Whittaker vector constructed in the recent work of Chidambaram--Dolega--Osuga.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10633v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $N_\sigma(\pi)$ denote the number of occurrences of a permutation pattern $\sigma\in S_k$ in a permutation $\pi\in S_n$. Gaetz and Ryba (2021) showed using partition algebras that the $d$-th moment $M_{\sigma,d,n}(\pi)$ of $N_\sigma$ on the conjugacy class of $\pi$ is given by a polynomial in $n,m_1,\dots,m_{dk}$, where $m_i$ denotes the number of $i$-cycles of $\pi$. They also showed that the coefficient $\langle \chi^{\lambda[n]}, M_{\sigma,d,n}\rangle$ agrees with a polynomial $a_{\sigma,d}^\lambda(n)$ in $n$. This work is motivated by the conjecture that when $\sigma=\text{id}_k$ is the identity permutation, all of these coefficients are nonnegative. We directly compute closed forms for the polynomials $a_{\text{id}_k}^{\lambda}(n)$ in the cases $\lambda=(1),(1,1),$ and $(2)$, and use this to verify the positivity conjecture for those cases by showing that the polynomials are real-rooted with all roots less than $k$. We also study the case $a_{\sigma}^{(1)}(n)$, for which we give a formula for the polynomials and their leading coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.12705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kochol (2021) gave a new expansion formula for the Tutte polynomial of a matroid using the notion of \emph{compatible sets}, and asked how this expansion relates to the internal-external activities formula. Here, we provide an answer, which is obtained as a special case of a generalized version of the expansion formula to Las Vergnas's trivariate Tutte polynomials of matroid perspectives. The same generalization to matroid perspectives and bijection with activities have been independently proven by Kochol (2022 and 2023) in parallel with this work, but using different methods. Kochol proves both results recursively using the contraction-deletion relations, whereas we give a more direct proof of the bijection and use that to deduce the compatible sets expansion formula from Las Vergnas's activities expansion.</description>

      <title>Characters of local and regular permutation statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.06567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of this monograph is to study the indicator function for a set of permutations mapping one finite sequence of positive integers to another from a representation theoretic, combinatorial and probabilistic perspective. The degree of a function of permutations is the size of the largest pair of sequences required when expressing it as a linear combination of these indicators. This notion of degree, implicit in work of Diaconis, is critical for many applications of representation theory to extremal combinatorics, machine learning, probability and statistics. We use the term local to indicate bounded degree and initiate the study of low degree class functions, which encode probabilistic data for permutation statistics on each cycle type simultaneously.
  We begin with a self contained treatment of for functions of permutations, developing its theory using language familiar to enumerative and algebraic combinatorialists. This leads naturally to a novel basis for symmetric functions we call the path power sum symmetric functions. The most technically challenging part of our work is the path Murnaghan-Nakayama formula, which expands path power sums into Schur functions. By combining the the path Murnaghan-Nakayam formula with the classical theory of character polynomials, one obtains a structural characterization for moments for permutation statistics conditioning on cycle type. We then analyze asymptotic properties of these moments. In doing so, we introduce the novel family of regular permutation statistics, which include almost all reasonable weighted pattern counting statistics. We show a large family of regular statistics satisfy a law of large numbers on a given cycle type depending only on the proportion of fixed points and a have variances depending only on fixed points and two cycles.</description>

      <title>Affine stresses: the partition of unity and Kalai's reconstruction conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kalai conjectured that if $P$ is a simplicial $d$-polytope that has no missing faces of dimension $d-1$, then the graph of $P$ and the space of affine $2$-stresses of $P$ determine $P$ up to affine equivalence. We propose a higher-dimensional generalization of this conjecture: if $2\leq i\leq d/2$ and $P$ is a simplicial $d$-polytope that has no missing faces of dimension $\geq d-i+1$, then the space of affine $i$-stresses of $P$ determines the space of affine $1$-stresses of $P$. We prove this conjecture for (1) $k$-stacked $d$-polytopes with $2\leq i\leq k\leq d/2-1$, (2) $d$-polytopes that have no missing faces of dimension $\geq d-2i+2$, and (3) flag PL $(d-1)$-spheres with generic embeddings (for all $2\leq i\leq d/2$). We also discuss several related results and conjectures. For instance, we show that if $P$ is a simplicial $d$-polytope that has no missing faces of dimension $\geq d-2i+2$, then the $(i-1)$-skeleton of $P$ and the set of sign vectors of affine $i$-stresses of $P$ determine the combinatorial type of $P$. Along the way, we establish the partition of unity of affine stresses: for any $1\leq i\leq (d-1)/2$, the space of affine $i$-stresses of a simplicial $d$-polytope as well as the space of affine $i$-stresses of a simplicial $(d-1)$-sphere (with a generic embedding) can be expressed as the sum of affine $i$-stress spaces of vertex stars. This is analogous to Adiprasito's partition of unity of linear stresses for Cohen--Macaulay complexes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical softassign and adaptive parameter tuning for graph matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.08233v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a unified framework for graph matching problems called the constrained gradient method. Popular algorithms within this framework include graduated assignment (GA), integer projected fixed-point method (IPFP), and doubly stochastic projected fixed-point method (DSPFP). These algorithms differ from the step size parameter and constrained operator. Our contributed adaptive step size parameter can guarantee the underlying algorithms' convergence and enhance their efficiency and accuracy. A preliminary analysis suggests that the optimal step size parameter has a high probability of being 1 in fully connected graph matching. Secondly, we propose a dynamic strategy for softassign, a popular constrained operator, to address its sensitivity concerning nodes' cardinality and risk of overflow. Combining the adaptive step size parameter and the dynamical softassign, we propose a novel graph matching algorithm: the softassign constrained gradient method. Various experiments demonstrate that it is significantly faster than other state-of-the-art algorithms based on the constrained gradient method with improved accuracy.</description>

      <title>Enumerative and Distributional Results for $d$-combining Tree-Child Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.03850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.03850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tree-child networks are one of the most prominent network classes for modeling evolutionary processes which contain reticulation events. Several recent studies have addressed counting questions for bicombining tree-child networks in which every reticulation node has exactly two parents. We extend these studies to $d$-combining tree-child networks where every reticulation node has now $d\geq 2$ parents, and we study one-component as well as general tree-child networks. For the number of one-component networks, we derive an exact formula from which asymptotic results follow that contain a stretched exponential for $d=2$, yet not for $d \geq 3$. For general networks, we find a novel encoding by words which leads to a recurrence for their numbers. From this recurrence, we derive asymptotic results which show the appearance of a stretched exponential for all $d \geq 2$. Moreover, we also give results on the distribution of shape parameters (e.g., number of reticulation nodes, Sackin index) of a network which is drawn uniformly at random from the set of all tree-child networks with the same number of leaves. We show phase transitions depending on $d$, leading to normal, Bessel, Poisson, and degenerate distributions. Some of our results are new even in the bicombining case.</description>

      <title>Tur\'an Problems for Mixed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.12888v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate natural Tur\'an problems for mixed graphs, generalizations of graphs where edges can be either directed or undirected. We study a natural \textit{Tur\'an density coefficient} that measures how large a fraction of directed edges an $F$-free mixed graph can have; we establish an analogue of the Erd\H{o}s-Stone-Simonovits theorem and give a variational characterization of the Tur\'an density coefficient of any mixed graph (along with an associated extremal $F$-free family). This characterization enables us to highlight an important divergence between classical extremal numbers and the Tur\'an density coefficient. We show that Tur\'an density coefficients can be irrational, but are always algebraic; for every positive integer $k$, we construct a family of mixed graphs whose Tur\'an density coefficient has algebraic degree $k$.</description>

      <title>Flip-width: Cops and Robber on dense graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.00352v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define new graph parameters, called flip-width, that generalize treewidth, degeneracy, and generalized coloring numbers for sparse graphs, and clique-width and twin-width for dense graphs. The flip-width parameters are defined using variants of the Cops and Robber game, in which the robber has speed bounded by a fixed constant $r\in\mathbb N\cup\{\infty\}$, and the cops perform flips (or perturbations) of the considered graph. We then propose a new notion of tameness of a graph class, called bounded flip-width, which is a dense counterpart of classes of bounded expansion of Ne\v{s}etril and Ossona de Mendez, and includes classes of bounded twin-width of Bonnet, Kim, Thomass{\'e}, and Watrigant. This unifies Sparsity Theory and Twin-width Theory, providing a common language for studying the central notions of the two theories, such as weak coloring numbers and twin-width -- corresponding to winning strategies of one player -- or dense shallow minors, rich divisions, or well-linked sets, corresponding to winning strategies of the other player. We prove that boundedness of flip-width is preserved by first-order interpretations, or transductions, generalizing previous results concerning classes of bounded expansion and bounded twin-width. We provide an algorithm approximating the flip-width of a given graph, which runs in slicewise polynomial time (XP) in the size of the graph. Finally, we propose a more general notion of tameness, called almost bounded flip-width, which is a dense counterpart of nowhere dense classes. We conjecture, and provide evidence, that classes with almost bounded flip-width coincide with monadically dependent (or monadically NIP) classes, introduced by Shelah in model theory. We also provide evidence that classes of almost bounded flip-width characterise the hereditary graph classes for which the model-checking problem is fixed-parameter tractable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.11642v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cominuscule flag varieties generalize Grassmannians to other Lie types. Schubert varieties in cominuscule flag varieties are indexed by posets of roots labeled long/short. These labeled posets generalize Young diagrams. We prove that Schubert varieties in potentially different cominuscule flag varieties are isomorphic as varieties if and only if their corresponding labeled posets are isomorphic, generalizing the classification of Grassmannian Schubert varieties using Young diagrams by the last two authors. Our proof is type-independent.</description>

Abstract: We study the permutation group $\mathcal{BK}_P$ generated by Bender-Knuth moves on linear extensions of a poset $P$, an analog of the Berenstein-Kirillov group on column-strict tableaux. We explore the group relations, with an emphasis on identifying posets $P$ for which the cactus relations hold in $\mathcal{BK}_P$. We also examine $\mathcal{BK}_P$ as a subgroup of the symmetric group $\mathfrak{S}_{\mathcal{L}(P)}$ on the set of linear extensions of $P$ with the focus on analyzing posets $P$ for which $\mathcal{BK}_P = \mathfrak{S}_{\mathcal{L}(P)}$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study pattern avoidance in weak ascent sequences, giving some results for patterns of length 3. This is an analogous study to one given by Duncan and Steingr\'imsson for ascent sequences \cite{DS}. More precisely, we provide systematically the generating functions for the number of weak ascent sequences avoiding the patterns $001, 011, 012, 021$, and $102$. Additionally, we establish bijective connections between pattern-avoiding weak ascent sequences and other combinatorial objects, such as compositions, upper triangular 01-matrices, and plane trees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08370v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G, H$ be two non-empty graphs and $k$ be a positive integer. The Gallai-Ramsey number $\operatorname{gr}_k(G:H)$ is defined as the minimum positive integer $N$ such that for all $n\geq N$, every $k$-edge-coloring of $K_n$ contains either a rainbow subgraph $G$ or a monochromatic subgraph $H$. The Gallai-Ramsey multiplicity $\operatorname{GM}_k(G:H)$ is defined as the minimum total number of rainbow subgraphs $G$ and monochromatic subgraphs $H$ for all $k$-edge-colored $K_{\operatorname{gr}_k(G:H)}$. In this paper, we get some exact values of the Gallai-Ramsey multiplicity for rainbow small trees versus general monochromatic graphs under a sufficiently large number of colors. We also study the bipartite Gallai-Ramsey multiplicity.</description>

Abstract: Given a matroid and a group of its matroid automorphisms, we study the induced group action on the Chow ring of the matroid. This turns out to always be a permutation action. Work of Adiprasito, Huh and Katz showed that the Chow ring satisfies Poincar\'e duality and the Hard Lefschetz theorem. We lift these to statements about this permutation action, and suggest further conjectures in this vein.</description>

Abstract: Chv\'{a}tal conjectured that a star is amongst the largest intersecting subfamiles of a finite subset-closed family of sets. Kleitman later strengthened Chv\'{a}tal's conjecture, suggesting that maximal intersecting subfamilies of $2^{[n]}$ when naturally embedded into $\mathbb{R}^{2^{[n]}}$ take on a particular form. We provide a construction which succeeds in expressing certain families as required by Kleitman's conjecture. We then provide a partial characterization of these families, showing central and certain near-central families in particular to be amongst them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10246v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the following game between a random player R and a deterministic player D. There is a pile of n elements at the beginning. The rules for playing are as follows: In each turn of R, if the pile contains exactly m elements, R removes k elements from the pile, where k is independently identically distributed from {1, . . . , m}. In each turn of D, D removes only one element. The winner is the player that, at the end of its round, has no elements remaining. R starts first to play. This short paper shows that Dn, which is defined as the probability of D winning the game (when is initialized with n elements), approaches 1/e when n increases; and more specifically, Dn = dn/n!, where dn is the n-th derangement number.</description>

      <title>Explicit expressions for the gamma vector leading to connections to upper/lower bounds and structural properties</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find an explicit formula for the gamma vector in terms of the input polynomial in a way that extends it to arbitrary polynomials. More specifically, we find explicit linear combination in terms of coefficients of the input polynomial (using Catalan numbers and binomial coefficients) and an expression involving the derivative of the input polynomial. The first expression suggests connections to common Coxeter group/noncrossing partition structures in existing gamma positivity examples. In the case where the input is the $h$-polynomial of a simplicial complex, this gives an interpretation of the gamma vector as a measure of differences in local and global contributions. We also apply them to connect signs/inequalities of (shifts of) the gamma vector to upper/lower bound conditions on coefficients of the input polynomial. Finally, we make use of the shape of the sums used to make these estimates and connections with intersection numbers to relate these properties of the gamma vector to algebraic structures (e.g. characteristic classes involved in existing log concavity and Schur positivity properties).</description>

Abstract: We show that the Schur polynomials in all primitive $n$th roots of unity are $1$, $0$, or $-1$, if $n$ has at most two distinct odd prime factors. This result can be regarded as a generalization of properties of the coefficients of the cyclotomic polynomial and its multiplicative inverse. The key to the proof is the notion of a unimodular system of vectors. Namely, this result is reduced in turn to four propositions on the unimodularity of vector systems, and the last proposition is proved by using graph theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paintability of a graph is a coloring parameter defined in terms of an online list coloring game. In this paper we ask, what is the paintability of a graph $G$ of maximum degree $\Delta$ and chromatic number $r$? By considering the Alon-Tarsi number of $G$, we prove that the paintability of $G$ is at most $\left(1 - \frac{1}{4r+1} \right ) \Delta + 2$. We also consider the DP-paintability of $G$, which is defined in terms of an online DP-coloring game. By considering the strict type $3$ degeneracy parameter recently introduced by Zhou, Zhu, and Zhu, we show that when $r$ is fixed and $\Delta$ is sufficiently large, the DP-paintability of $G$ is at most $\Delta - \Omega( \sqrt{\Delta \log \Delta})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:math/0209005v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Earlier researchers have studied the set of orientations of a connected finite graph $G$, and have shown that any two such orientations having the same flow-difference around all closed loops can be obtained from one another by a succession of local moves of a simple type. Here I show that the set of orientations of $G$ having the same flow-differences around all closed loops can be given the structure of a distributive lattice. The construction generalizes partial orderings that arise in the study of alternating sign matrices. It also gives rise to lattices for the set of degree-constrained factors of a bipartite planar graph; as special cases, one obtains lattices that arise in the study of plane partitions and domino tilings. Lastly, the theory gives a lattice structure to the set of spanning trees of a planar graph.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1711.09428v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a structure theorem for Boolean functions on the $p$-biased hypercube which are $\epsilon$-close to degree~$d$ in $L_2$, showing that they are close to \emph{sparse juntas}. Our structure theorem implies that such functions are $O(\epsilon^{C_d} + p)$-close to constant functions. We pinpoint the exact value of the constant $C_d$.
  We also give an analogous result for monotone Boolean functions on the biased hypercube which are $\epsilon$-close to degree~$d$ in $L_2$, showing that they are close to \emph{sparse DNFs}.
  Our structure theorems are optimal in the following sense: for every $d,\epsilon,p$, we identify a class $\mathcal{F}_{d,\epsilon,p}$ of degree~$d$ sparse juntas which are $O(\epsilon)$-close to Boolean (in the monotone case, width~$d$ sparse DNFs) such that a Boolean function on the $p$-biased hypercube is $O(\epsilon)$-close to degree~$d$ in $L_2$ iff it is $O(\epsilon)$-close to a function in $\mathcal{F}_{d,\epsilon,p}$.</description>

      <title>Connected greedy colourings of perfect graphs and other classes: the good, the bad and the ugly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.14003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.14003v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Grundy number of a graph is the maximum number of colours used by the "First-Fit" greedy colouring algorithm over all vertex orderings. Given a vertex ordering $\sigma= v_1,\dots,v_n$, the "First-Fit" greedy colouring algorithm colours the vertices in the order of $\sigma$ by assigning to each vertex the smallest colour unused in its neighbourhood.
  By restricting this procedure to vertex orderings that are connected, we obtain {\em connected greedy colourings}. For some graphs, all connected greedy colourings use exactly $\chi(G)$ colours; they are called {\em good graphs}. On the opposite, some graphs do not admit any connected greedy colouring using only $\chi(G)$ colours; they are called {\em ugly graphs}.
  We show that no perfect graph is ugly. We also give simple proofs of this fact for subclasses of perfect graphs (block graphs, comparability graphs), and show that no $K_4$-minor free graph is ugly.
  Moreover, our proofs are constructive, and imply the existence of polynomial-time algorithms to compute good connected orderings for these graph classes.</description>

      <title>Quantum K-theory of Incidence Varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Buch and Mihalcea in the case of the incidence variety X=Fl(1,n-1;n) and determine the structure of its (T-equivariant) quantum K-theory ring. Our results are an interplay between geometry and combinatorics. The geometric side concerns Gromov-Witten varieties of 3-pointed genus 0 stable maps to X with markings sent to Schubert varieties, while on the combinatorial side are formulas for the (equivariant) quantum K-theory ring of X. We prove that the Gromov-Witten variety is rationally connected when one of the defining Schubert varieties is a divisor and another is a point. This implies that the (equivariant) K-theoretic Gromov-Witten invariants defined by two Schubert classes and a Schubert divisor class can be computed in the ordinary (equivariant) K-theory ring of X. We derive a positive Chevalley formula for the equivariant quantum K-theory ring of X and a positive Littlewood-Richardson rule for the non-equivariant quantum K-theory ring of X. The Littlewood-Richardson rule in turn implies that non-empty Gromov-Witten varieties given by Schubert varieties in general position have arithmetic genus 0.</description>

      <title>Counting Kernels in Directed Graphs with Arbitrary Orientations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.04476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.04476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A kernel of a directed graph is a subset of vertices that is both independent and absorbing (every vertex not in the kernel has an out-neighbour in the kernel). Not all directed graphs contain kernels, and computing a kernel or deciding that none exist is NP-complete even on low-degree planar digraphs. The existing polynomial-time algorithms for this problem all restrict both the undirected structure and the edge orientations of the input: for example, to chordal graphs without bidirectional edges (Pass-Lanneau, Igarashi and Meunier, Discrete Appl Math 2020) or to permutation graphs where each clique has a sink (Abbas and Saoula, 4OR 2005). By contrast, we count the kernels of a fuzzy circular interval graph in polynomial time, regardless of its edge orientations, and return a kernel when one exists. (Fuzzy circular graphs were introduced by Chudnovsky and Seymour in their structure theorem for claw-free graphs.) We also consider kernels on cographs, where we establish NP-hardness in general but linear running times on the subclass of threshold graphs.</description>

      <title>Tilted biorthogonal ensembles, Grothendieck random partitions, and determinantal tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17747v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study probability measures on partitions based on symmetric Grothendieck polynomials. These deformations of Schur polynomials introduced in the K-theory of Grassmannians share many common properties. Our Grothendieck measures are analogs of the Schur measures on partitions introduced by Okounkov (arXiv:math/9907127 [math.RT]). Despite the similarity of determinantal formulas for the probability weights of Schur and Grothendieck measures, we demonstrate that Grothendieck measures are \emph{not} determinantal point processes. This question is related to the principal minor assignment problem in algebraic geometry, and we employ a determinantal test first obtained by Nanson in 1897 for the $4\times4$ problem. We also propose a procedure for getting Nanson-like determinantal tests for matrices of any size $n\ge4$ which appear new for $n\ge 5$.
  By placing the Grothendieck measures into a new framework of tilted biorthogonal ensembles generalizing a rich class of determinantal processes introduced by Borodin (arXiv:math/9804027 [math.CA]), we identify Grothendieck random partitions as a cross-section of a Schur process, a determinantal process in two dimensions. This identification expresses the correlation functions of Grothendieck measures through sums of Fredholm determinants, which are not immediately suitable for asymptotic analysis. A more direct approach allows us to obtain a limit shape result for the Grothendieck random partitions. The limit shape curve is not particularly explicit as it arises as a cross-section of the limit shape surface for the Schur process. The gradient of this surface is expressed through the argument of a complex root of a cubic equation.</description>

      <title>The landscape of compressibility measures for two-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02629v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we extend to two-dimensional data two recently introduced one-dimensional compressibility measures: the $\gamma$ measure defined in terms of the smallest string attractor, and the $\delta$ measure defined in terms of the number of distinct substrings of the input string. Concretely, we introduce the two-dimensional measures $\gamma_{2D}$ and $\delta_{2D}$ as natural generalizations of $\gamma$ and $\delta$ and study some of their properties. Among other things, we prove that $\delta_{2D}$ is monotone and can be computed in linear time, and we show that, although it is still true that $\delta_{2D} \leq \gamma_{2D}$, the gap between the two measures can be $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ for families of $n\times n$ matrices and therefore asymptotically larger than the gap in one-dimension. To complete the scenario of two-dimensional compressibility measures, we introduce also the measure $b_{2D}$ which generalizes to two dimensions the notion of optimal parsing. We prove that, somewhat surprisingly, the relationship between $b_{2D}$ and $\gamma_{2D}$ is significantly different than in the one-dimensional case. As an application of the measures $\gamma_{2D}$ and $\delta_{2D}$ we provide the first analysis of the space usage of the two-dimensional block tree introduced in [Brisaboa et al., Two-dimensional block trees, The computer Journal, 2023]. Finally, we present a linear time algorithm for constructing the two-dimensional block tree for arbitrary matrices, that is asymptotically faster than the (probabilistic) known solution which can only be used for binary matrices.</description>

      <title>Four universal growth regimes in degree-dependent first passage percolation on spatial random graphs I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11840v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dependent first passage percolation is a spreading process on a graph where the transmission time through each edge depends on the direct surroundings of the edge. In particular, the classical iid transmission time $L_{xy}$ is multiplied by $(W_xW_y)^\mu$, a polynomial of the expected degrees $W_x, W_y$ of the endpoints of the edge $xy$, which we call the penalty function. Beyond the Markov case, we also allow any distribution for $L_{xy}$ with regularly varying distribution near $0$. We then run this process on three spatial scale-free random graph models: finite and infinite Geometric Inhomogeneous Random Graphs, and Scale-Free Percolation. In these spatial models, the connection probability between two vertices depends on their spatial distance and on their expected degrees.
  We show that as the penalty-function, i.e., $\mu$ increases, the transmission time between two far away vertices sweeps through four universal phases: explosive (with tight transmission times), polylogarithmic, polynomial but strictly sublinear, and linear in the Euclidean distance. The strictly polynomial growth phase here is a new phenomenon that so far was extremely rare in spatial graph models. The four growth phases are highly robust in the model parameters and are not restricted to phase boundaries. Further, the transition points between the phases depend non-trivially on the main model parameters: the tail of the degree distribution, a long-range parameter governing the presence of long edges, and the behaviour of the distribution $L$ near $0$. In this paper we develop new methods to prove the upper bounds in all sub-explosive phases. Our companion paper complements these results by providing matching lower bounds in the polynomial and linear regimes.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Softassign via Hadamard-Equipped Sinkhorn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Softassign is a pivotal method in graph matching and other learning tasks. Many softassign-based algorithms exhibit performance sensitivity to a parameter in the softassign. However, tuning the parameter is challenging and almost done empirically. This paper proposes an adaptive softassign method for graph matching by analyzing the relationship between the objective score and the parameter. This method can automatically tune the parameter based on a given error bound to guarantee accuracy. The Hadamard-Equipped Sinkhorn formulas introduced in this study significantly enhance the efficiency and stability of the adaptive softassign. Moreover, these formulas can also be used in optimal transport problems. The resulting adaptive softassign graph matching algorithm enjoys significantly higher accuracy than previous state-of-the-art large graph matching algorithms while maintaining comparable efficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.13034v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$ can be obtained from the random geometric graph $G(n,r)$ by keeping every edge in $G(n,r)$ with probability $p$. This random graph is a particular case of the soft random graph model introduced by Penrose, in which the probability between 2 vertices is a function that depends on the distance between them. In this article, we define models for random simplicial complexes built over the soft random graph $G(n,r,p)$, which also present randomness in all other dimensions. Furthermore, we study the homology of those random simplicial complexes in different regimes of $n,r$, and $p$ by giving asymptotic formulas for the expectation of the Betti numbers in the sparser regimes, and bounds in the denser regimes.</description>

      <title>Zero fibers of quaternionic quotient singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00158v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of Haiman's conjecture on the diagonal coinvariant rings of real reflection groups to the context of irreducible quaternionic reflection groups (also known as symplectic reflection groups). For a reflection group $W$ acting on a quaternionic vector space $V$, by regarding $V$ as a complex vector space we consider the scheme-theoretic fiber over zero of the quotient map $\pi:V \to V/W$. For $W$ an irreducible reflection group of (quaternionic) rank at least $6$, we show that the ring of functions on this fiber admits a $(g+1)^n$-dimensional quotient arising from an irreducible representation of a symplectic reflection algebra, where $g=2N/n$ with $N$ the number of reflections in $W$ and $n=\mathrm{dim}_\mathbf{H}(V)$, and we conjecture that this holds in general. We observe that in fact the degree of the zero fiber is precisely $g+1$ for the rank one groups (corresponding to the Kleinian singularities).</description>

      <title>Beatty Sequences for a Quadratic Irrational: Decidability and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08331v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\alpha$ and $\beta$ belong to the same quadratic field. We show that the inhomogeneous Beatty sequence $(\lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor)_{n \geq 1}$ is synchronized, in the sense that there is a finite automaton that takes as input the Ostrowski representations of $n$ and $y$ in parallel, and accepts if and only if $y = \lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor$. Since it is already known that the addition relation is computable for Ostrowski representations based on a quadratic number, a consequence is a new and rather simple proof that the first-order logical theory of these sequences with addition is decidable. The decision procedure is easily implemented in the free software Walnut.
  As an application, we show that for each $r \geq 1$ it is decidable whether the set $\{ \lfloor n \alpha + \beta \rfloor \, : \, n \geq 1 \}$ forms an additive basis (or asymptotic additive basis) of order $r$. Using our techniques, we also solve some open problems of Reble and Kimberling, and give an explicit characterization of a sequence of Hildebrand et al.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08435v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The $\text{v}$-function of a graded filtration $\mathcal{I}=\{I_{[k]}\}_{k\ge0}$ is introduced. Under the assumption that $\mathcal{I}$ is Noetherian, we prove that the $\text{v}$-function $\text{v}(I_{[k]})$ is an eventually quasi-linear function. This result applies to several situations, including ordinary powers, and integral closures of ordinary powers, among others. As another application, we investigate the asymptotic behaviour of certain integer programming problems. Finally, we present the Macaulay2 package $\texttt{VNumber}$.</description>

      <title>Performance-Guaranteed Solutions for Multi-Agent Optimal Coverage Problems using Submodularity, Curvature, and Greedy Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14028v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of multi-agent optimal coverage problems in which the goal is to determine the optimal placement of a group of agents in a given mission space so that they maximize a coverage objective that represents a blend of individual and collaborative event detection capabilities. This class of problems is extremely challenging due to the non-convex nature of the mission space and of the coverage objective. With this motivation, greedy algorithms are often used as means of getting feasible coverage solutions efficiently. Even though such greedy solutions are suboptimal, the submodularity (diminishing returns) property of the coverage objective can be exploited to provide performance bound guarantees. Moreover, we show that improved performance bound guarantees (beyond the standard (1-1/e) performance bound) can be established using various curvature measures of the coverage problem. In particular, we provide a brief review of all existing popular applicable curvature measures, including a recent curvature measure that we proposed, and discuss their effectiveness and computational complexity, in the context of optimal coverage problems. We also propose novel computationally efficient techniques to estimate some curvature measures. Finally, we provide several numerical results to support our findings and propose several potential future research directions.</description>
