      <title>Effects of Environment on the Size Evolution of Quiescent Galaxies: Comparing Galaxies in Clusters and in the Field at Two Rest-frame Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of environment on quiescent galaxy (QG) size evolution using the CLAUDS+HSC imaging covering 18.6~deg$^2$ in five broad filters ($Ugriz$) and the effective radius of a single-S\'{e}rsic fit as a proxy for galaxy size. We estimate sizes in two rest-frame wavelengths -- 3000\r{A} (UV) and 5000\r{A} (optical) -- for $\sim86,000$ massive ($M_*&gt;10^{9.5}$M$_\odot$) field QGs and for $1,000$ of their similarly massive counterparts from 47 clusters at $0.1&lt;z&lt;0.85$. We fit the size-mass relation (SMR) for field and cluster QGs in five $\Delta z=0.15$ redshift bins and use the characteristic size of $M_*=5\times10^{10}$M$_\odot$ QGs (SMR's zero point) to trace the change in galaxy size over cosmic time and in two types of environment. Sizes of QGs are larger in the rest-frame UV than in the rest-frame optical in both clusters and the field, and this difference is more prominent in the field sample. However, QGs in clusters are systematically smaller than the field QGs, and this difference is significantly more pronounced if measured in the rest-frame UV light. Modeling of the redshift evolution in the characteristic QG size as $R_e\varpropto(1+z)^{\beta}$ shows that the cluster QGs ($\beta=-1.02$ in UV and $\beta= -1.00$ in optical) grow in size as fast as the field QGs ($\beta=-0.95$ in UV and $-1.22$ in optical). This fast growth of cluster QGs is consistent with size increase driven by the accretion of two subpopulations onto clusters: a) field QGs that are larger than their quiescent counterparts in clusters, and b) environmentally quenched galaxies (newcomers) that are larger than the rest of the quiescent population.</description>

      <title>Probing plasma scattering screens towards the quasar 2005+403 with long-term RATAN-600 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue investigating the observed properties of the quasar 2005$+$403 seen through the highly turbulent plasma in the Cygnus region. Our earlier study Koryukova+2023 revealed a great influence of propagation effects on the observed data, e.g. numerous episodes of multiple imaging formation, angular broadening of the source size, and the detection of an extreme scattering event (ESE) in 2019, making it a good probe for thermal plasma in the interstellar medium (ISM). We report the first detection of multi-frequency and multi-epoch ESEs revealed with the RATAN-600 daily light curves of the quasar 2005$+$403. The most prominent ESE flux density modulations are found in 2011, 2015, and 2020 and each lasted about $4-5$ months. We fitted the detected ESEs jointly at 4.7/4.8, 7.7/8.2, and 11.2~GHz using the models, which allowed us to constrain the angular and linear size of the scattering lens averaged over the three ESEs $0.3\pm0.1$ mas and $0.6\pm0.1$ au, proper motion $8.3\pm0.7$ mas yr$^{-1}$ and transverse velocity $70.1\pm5.7$ km s$^{-1}$ assuming that the lens distance is 1.8 kpc, maximum free-electron density on the line of sight $1183\pm124$ cm$^{-3}$ and lens mass $(0.8\pm0.4)\times10^{-15}\,\rm M_\odot$. Using the fitting results, we reconstructed the intrinsic unscattered angular size of the quasar at the ESE epochs. We also report on the first detection of up to six ESEs in a row that occurred in the period of $2015-2016$, apparently created by multiple lenses successively crossing the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Dual Directional Expansion of Classical Cepheids in the Small Magellanic Cloud Revealed by Gaia DR3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the three-dimensional kinematics of classical Cepheids (CCs) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) using Gaia DR3 data. By cross-matching the CCs obtained from the fourth phase of the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment with Gaia DR3, we obtain distances and proper motions (PMs) for 4,236 CCs. Among them, 91 stars with available radial velocities (RVs) enable the construction of accurate relationship between distance and RV. Furthermore, we calculate the internal PMs of the CCs, providing the internal dynamics of the SMC while removing the distance projection effects. The CCs exhibit a northeast-southwest distance gradient, with internal PMs pointing northeast for nearer stars and southwest for more distant stars, indicating a northeast-southwest elongation. The RVs of the CCs show a northwest-southeast gradient, consistent with RVs of other stellar populations and suggesting that the SMC's northwest-southeast elongation results from interactions with the Large Magellanic Cloud. The distances and RVs of the CCs are nearly uncorrelated, implying that the two elongations arise from distinct causes.</description>

      <title>Identification of a dwarf galaxy stream in Gaia, and its possible association with the VPOS structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low surface density streams are important tracers to study the formation and evolution of the Milky Way. Using the accurate astrometric measurements from Gaia mission, we discover a low surface density stream in the north hemisphere, with length of $\sim110$ degree and width of $1.23$ kpc. The vertical velocity dispersion perpendicular to the stream is around $22.4$ km s$^{-1}$. The spectral data of member candidate stars from LAMOST and DESI shows a large metallicity range from $-1.8$ to $-0.7$. Based on those properties we claim that the stream is originated from a dwarf galaxy. The median metallicity of $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}=-1.3$ indicates a massive dwarf galaxy origination with stellar mass around $2.0\times10^7M_\odot$, which is comparable with the Fornax dwarf galaxy and smaller than LMC/SMC and Sagittarius. We also find the globular cluster Pyxis is highly associated with the stream in the phase space $E-L_Z$ and metallicity. The massive progenitor also suggests that many dwarf galaxies, including massive ones, have been disrupted during their evolution orbiting the Milky Way and left with very low surface density structures. This is important to understand the {\it missing satellites} problem. The orbit information of the stream shows tight association between its progenitor and the Vast POlar Structure (VPOS), which indicates that the satellites fell into the Milky Way in groups, which brought many globular clusters into the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Conformational isomerism of methyl formate: new detections of the higher-energy trans conformer and theoretical insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent astrochemical studies it has become crucial to study all the complete conformational panorama of the molecule, some of which are potentially detectable in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this context, the isomeric ratio can be used as a powerful tool to distinguish between different formation routes of molecules with increasing levels of complexity. While the most stable cis conformer of methyl formate (CH3OCHO, MF) is ubiquitous in the ISM, there is just one tentative detection of the higher-energy trans form toward the envelope of the star-forming region Sgr B2(N). Here, we present the detections of trans-methyl formate toward the Galactic Center molecular cloud G+0.693-0.027 and the protostellar shock L1157-B1, providing definite observational evidence of its presence in the ISM. Numerous unblended or slightly blended $a$-type $K_a$ = 0, 1 transitions belonging to the $A$-substate of trans-MF have been identified in both sources. We derive a molecular column density for trans-methyl formate of N = (8.2 $\pm$ 0.4) $\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ and N = (1.6 $\pm$ 0.3) $\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, respectively, yielding a molecular abundance with respect to H$_2$ of $\sim$6 $\times$ 10$^{-11}$ and $\sim$8 $\times$ 10$^{-10}$. Therefore, we obtain cis/trans isomeric ratios of $\sim$72 and $\sim$34 toward G+0.693 and L1157-B1, which are $\sim$7 and 3 times larger than that found in the Sgr B2(N) region. These results are compared with new grain-surface theoretical computations, which suggest that a stereoespecific formation of trans-MF via the CH3O + HCO route on grain surfaces can qualitatively explain the observed cis/trans abundance ratio. Nevertheless, we show that additional stereoespecific gas-phase routes could also play a crucial role in maintaining the intricate balance between formation and destruction of trans-MF, ultimately leading to its detection.</description>

      <title>Stellar parameters, extinction, and distances for stars in SMSS DR2 by SPar method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The availability of large datasets containing stellar parameters, distances, and extinctions for stars in the Milky Way, particularly within the Galactic disk, is essential for advancing our understanding of the Galaxy's stellar populations, structure, kinematics, and chemical evolution. In this study, we present a catalog of stellar parameters, including effective temperature (\teff), metallicity (\feh), absolute magnitudes ($M_{G}$), distances ($d$), and reddening values (\ebr), for a sample of 141 million stars from the SkyMapper Southern Survey (SMSS). These parameters are derived using the SPar algorithm, which employs a fitting procedure to match multi-band photometric observations and estimate the stellar properties (\teff, \feh, $M_G$, $d$, and \ebr) on an individual star basis, following the methodology outlined in our previous work. This study successfully determines stellar parameters and extinction values simultaneously for stars located in high and low Galactic latitudes. The resulting stellar parameters and extinction values are in good agreement with results from other studies, demonstrating the robustness of our method. We derive a temperature dispersion of 195\,K and a metallicity dispersion of 0.31\,dex when comparing our results with spectroscopic data. The catalog produced in this work provides a valuable resource for future research on the Galactic metallicity distribution function, the structure of the Galaxy, three-dimensional extinction mapping, and other related astrophysical topics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Compact Symmetric Objects with Complex Morphologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact symmetric objects (CSOs) are a unique class of jetted active galactic nuclei (AGN) defined by sub-kpc radio emission, showing radio structure on both sides of the central engine. CSOs tend to exhibit little to no relativistic beaming, thereby allowing us to determine their physical characteristics, such as the magnetic field strength and particle energy density. Selected with a literature search, we describe VLBI observations, imaging, and analyses of 167 CSO candidates. We identified 65 new bona fide CSOs, thus almost doubling the number of known bona fide CSOs to 144. With our greater breadth of sources, we confirm that edge-dimmed CSOs (CSO-1s) may represent a more diverse population than originally expected. We highlight a number of CSOs with complex morphologies, including candidates for supermassive binary black holes (SBBHs) and CSOs that appear to have morphologies akin to wide-angle tail (WAT) galaxies, which could perhaps indicate that some CSOs are experiencing a galactic merger.</description>

      <title>ADF22+: a declining faint end in the far-infrared luminosity function in the SSA22 protocluster at z=3.09</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protoclusters represent the densest regions of cosmic large-scale structure in the early universe and are the environment where present-day massive elliptical galaxies are assembled. Millimeter continuum emission offers a powerful probe of obscured star formation at high redshifts across various environments. In this paper, we present deep ALMA 1.17 mm mosaic of the central 8 arcmin$^2$ ($\approx30$ comoving Mpc$^{2}$) region in the SSA22 protocluster at $z=3.09$ to study the faint dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) population. The continuum map achieves an RMS noise level of $\approx25$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at $\approx1^{\prime\prime}$ spatial resolution, $\approx2\times$ the depth of previous observation of this field. We detected 53 sources with a signal-to-noise ratio above 4.2, doubling the number of detections. Utilizing optical to mid-infrared ancillary data, we search for spectroscopic redshift and identify 18 of 53 as cluster members. For sources with more than two photometric data points in the near-infrared, stellar mass ($M_\star$) and star formation rate (SFR) from spectral energy distribution fitting are presented. The 1.17 mm number count shows $&gt;2\times$ excess at flux density $\gtrsim1$ mJy but are consistent with blank field in fainter flux bins. The monochromatic far-infrared luminosity function of the SSA22 protocluster core region suggests a lack of faint DSFGs. All SSA22 protocluster member galaxies detected at 1.17 mm have SFR within the $M_\star$-SFR relation of general star-forming galaxies. Our results suggest that an early overdense environment like SSA22 protocluster predominantly enhances the formation of massive early-type galaxies in present-day galaxy clusters, but that the star formation in individual member galaxies is likely driven by gas supply along the cosmic web and occurs in a secular way.</description>

      <title>Hercules stream and the outer elliptical ring R1R2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of the Hercules stream in the model Galactic disk which includes the outer resonance ring R1R2 located near the Outer Lindblad Resonance (OLR) of the bar. The Hercules region and the anti-Hercules region introduced for calibration were restricted in space by the solar neighborhood, r&lt;0.5 kpc, and on the (VR, VT) plane by ellipses centered at VR=25 and VT=200 km s-1 (Hercules), and at VR=-25 and VT=200 km s-1 (anti-Hercules). The number of stars in the Hercules region reaches a maximum at the time period of 2--3 Gyr from the start of simulation and the number of stars in the anti-Hercules region oscillates with a period of 1.8 +/-0.1 Gyr. The majority of stars in the model disk located in the Hercules and anti-Hercules regions have orbits elongated perpendicular and parallel to the bar, respectively. There are two types of orbits in the Hercules region. Orbits of the first type always lie inside a figure bounded by two ellipses elongated perpendicular to the bar. Orbits of the second type are elongated at the angles of -60 or 60 degrees to the major axis of the bar most of the time. The distribution of stars in the Hercules region along the period of slow oscillations in the angular momentum has two maxima: P=0.7 and 2.6 Gyr corresponding to orbits of the first and second type. In the anti-Hercules region, most orbits are captured by libration relative to the major axis of the bar with a period of 1.9 Gyr. In general, orbits in the Hercules and anti-Hercules regions support the outer rings R1 and R2 elongated perpendicular and parallel to the bar, respectively. Stars from the Gaia DR3 catalog located in the Hercules region appear to be, on average, brighter, bluer and more luminous than stars in the anti-Hercules region which is probably caused by selection effects due to different distributions of these stellar samples over the Galactic latitude b.</description>

      <title>Stellar Populations and Molecular Gas Composition in the Low-Metallicity Environment of WLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stellar populations and molecular gas properties of a star-forming region within the dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxy WLM. Low-metallicity dIrrs like WLM offer a valuable window into star formation in environments that are unlike those of larger, metal-rich galaxies such as the Milky Way. In these conditions, carbon monoxide (CO), typically used to trace molecular clouds, is more easily photodissociated by ultraviolet (UV) radiation, leading to a larger fraction of CO-dark molecular gas, where H$_2$ exists without detectable CO emission, or CO-dark gas in the form of cold HI. Understanding the molecular gas content and the stellar populations in these star-forming regions provides important information about the role of CO-bright and CO-dark gas in forming stars.</description>

      <title>Magnetic fields in the multiphase interstellar medium of the Milky Way: turbulent kinetic and magnetic energy density relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are an important component of the interstellar medium (ISM) of galaxies. The thermal gas in the ISM has a multiphase structure, broadly divided into ionised, atomic, and molecular phases. The connection between the multiphase ISM gas and magnetic field is not known and this makes it difficult to account for their impact on star formation and galaxy evolution. Usually, in star formation studies, a relationship between the gas density, $n$ and magnetic field strength, $B$, is assumed to study magnetic fields' impact. However, this requires the knowledge of the geometry of star-forming regions and ambient magnetic field orientation. Here, we use the Zeeman magnetic field measurements from the literature for the atomic and molecular ISM and supplement the magnetic field estimates in the ionised ISM using pulsar observations to find a relation between the turbulent kinetic, $E_{\rm kin}$, and magnetic, $E_{\rm mag}$, energy densities. Across all three phases and over a large range of densities ($10^{-3}\,{\rm cm}^{-3} \lesssim n \lesssim 10^{7}\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$), we find $E_{\rm mag} \propto E_{\rm kin}$. Furthermore, we use phase-wise probability density functions of density, magnetic fields, and turbulent velocities to show that the magnetic field fluctuations are controlled by both density and turbulent velocity fluctuations. This work demonstrates that a combination of both the density and turbulent velocity determines magnetic fields in the ISM.</description>

Abstract: The Milky Way's Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) is measured to form stars 10 times less efficiently than in the Galactic disk, based on emission from high-mass stars. However, the CMZ's low-mass protostellar population, which accounts for most of the initial stellar mass budget and star formation rate (SFR), is poorly constrained observationally due to limited sensitivity and resolution. We present the Dual-band Unified Exploration of Three CMZ Clouds (DUET) survey, targeting the 20 km/s Cloud, Sgr C, and Dust Ridge cloud e using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3 and 3 mm. The mosaicked observations achieve a comparable resolution of 0.2-0.3" (~1600-2500 au) and a sky coverage of 8.3-10.4 square arcmin, respectively. We report 563 continuum sources at 1.3 mm and 330 at 3 mm, respectively, and a dual-band catalog with 450 continuum sources. These sources are marginally resolved at the 2,000 au resolution. We find a cloud-wide deviation (&gt;70%) from commonly-used dust modified blackbody (MBB) models, characterized by either low spectral indices or low brightness temperatures. Three possible explanations for the deviation are discussed. (1) Optically thick Class 0/I Young stellar objects (YSOs) with very small beam filling factors can lead to lower brightness temperatures than what MBB models predict. (2) Large (mm/cm-sized) dust grains have more significant self-scattering, and therefore frequency-dependent albedo could cause lower spectral indices. (3) Free-free emission over 30 uJy can severely contaminate dust emission and cause low spectral indices for mJy sources in our sample, although the needed number of massive protostars (embedded UCHII regions) is infeasibly high for the normal stellar initial mass function. A reliable measurement of the SFR at low protostellar masses will require future work to distinguish between these possible explanations.</description>

      <title>Formation of the Little Red Dots from the Core-collapse of Self-interacting Dark Matter Halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical study on the formation and growth of black holes (BHs) seeded by gravothermal core-collapse of self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) halos at high redshifts, using a semi-analytical framework based on Monte-Carlo merger trees. We demonstrate that BH formation via gravothermal collapse naturally occurs in high-concentration halos at a characteristic mass scale determined by the SIDM cross section, and only during the early Universe. This mechanism is particularly promising for explaining the abundance of little red dots (LRDs) -- a population of early, apparently galaxy-less active galactic nuclei hosting supermassive BHs. By incorporating this seeding process with simplified models of BH growth and mergers, we successfully reproduce the observed LRD mass function for moderately large cross sections of $\sigma_{0m} \sim 30 \mathrm{cm^2\,g^{-1}}$ and $\omega \sim 80\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}}$, intriguingly consistent with independent local constraints derived from galaxy rotation curves. Our results highlight the potential of high-redshift BH statistics as a complementary probe for constraining SIDM models.</description>

      <title>Kiloparsec-Scale Alignment of a Radio Jet with Cool Gas and Dust in a z~6 Quasar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-angular resolution (0.068", ~400pc) ALMA imaging of the [CII] line and dust continuum emission of PSO J352.4034-15.3373, a radio-loud quasar at z=5.83. The observations reveal a remarkably close match between the orientation of the [CII] and thermal dust emission mapped by ALMA, and radio synchrotron emission of a radio jet previously mapped by the VLBA. This narrow alignment extends over ~4kpc, reminiscent of the well-studied 'alignment effect' in lower-redshift radio galaxies. The [CII] kinematics show a linear increase in velocity with galactocentric radii up to ~200 km/s at r=2kpc, consistent with bulk motions within the galaxy potential, and not relativistic jet motions. The kinematics and respective morphologies are consistent with a picture in which the relativistic jet injects energy into the interstellar medium (potentially leading to subsequent star formation), giving rise to the observed alignment and significant (&gt; 100 km/s) [CII] velocity dispersion within the host galaxy on kiloparsec scales. Indeed, the astonishingly close alignment and narrow linearity of the radio jet with the [CII] and dust emission are hard to conceive without some fundamental relationship between the two.</description>

      <title>A search for the three isomers of cyano-1,3-butadiene in TMC-1: Implications for bottom-up routes involving 1,3-butadiene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecule 1,3-butadiene (CH2CHCHCH2) could play a key role in the synthesis of the cyclic molecules cyclopentadiene and benzene in cold dense clouds. Since 1,3-butadiene is non-polar, we searched for its cyano derivative, which exists in the form of three different polar isomers, in the cold dense cloud TMC-1. We used the most recent data obtained with the Yebes 40m telescope in the Q band (31.0-50.3 GHz) in the frame of the QUIJOTE project. We do not detect any of the two isomers of 1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, and derive 3sigma upper limits to their column densities of 1.2e10 cm-2 and 2.0e10 cm-2 for E- and Z-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene, respectively. Our results are not consistent with those from Cooke et al. (2023), who determine a column density of 3.8e10 cm-2 for E-1-cyano-1,3-butadiene in TMC-1 using GBT data and a line stack technique. At the current level of sensitivity of our data, there is tentative evidence for the presence of the third cyano derivative isomer, 2-cyano-1,3-butadiene, although a firm detection must await more sensitive data. We derive an upper limit to its column density of 3.1e10 cm-2. This isomer cannot be formed in the reaction between CN and 1,3-butadiene, according to experimental and theoretical studies, and thus we speculate whether it could arise from neutral-neutral reactions like C2H3 + CH2CHCN and CH2CCN + C2H4. From the upper limit on the abundance of 1-cyano-1,3-butadiene derived here, we estimate that the abundance of 1,3-butadiene in TMC-1 is below 1e-11 - 1e-10 relative to H2. The low abundance inferred for 1,3-butadiene makes it unlikely that it plays an important role in bottom-up routes to cyclopentadiene and benzene.</description>

      <title>A Swift analysis of the Eras tour set list and implications for astrophysics research (Taylor's version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Popular culture plays a significant role in shaping public interest in science, and Taylor Swift's discography frequently incorporates astrophysics terminology. This study examines the occurrence of astrophysics-related words in her lyrics and their representation in the Eras tour set list. By analyzing the frequency of words in Swift's total discography, we identify that astrophysics is promoted the most within her most recent album, The Tortured Poets Department, whereas songs from Midnights promoted astrophysics the most throughout the Eras tour. We catagorize words into various disciplines of astrophysics and find that multimessenger astronomy is promoted the most, both in Swift's total discography and throughout the Eras tour. We perform Taylor expansion and predict $12 \pm 5$ astrophysical terms in Swift's next album. This analysis offers a unique perspective on the intersection of music and science, revealing how Swift's artistry may unintentionally promote interest in different fields of astrophysics.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Massive Black Hole Mergers in ASTRID: Predictions for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the ASTRID cosmological simulation to forecast massive black hole (MBH) binary mergers detectable by LISA. A key result is a significant increase in the predicted detection rate when MBH orbital eccentricity is included, rising from 5.6 for circular orbits to 10.5 events per year. This boost is largely due to inspiral sources that will merge after LISA's mission period, which make up 46% of detections in the eccentric case. This highlights LISA's sensitivity to early inspiral phases, especially for eccentric binaries that emit across a wider frequency band. Most LISA detections arise from $M_{\mathrm{BH}} \sim 10^{5-6}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, low-redshift ($z&lt;2$), low mass-ratio ($q\sim 0.01$--$0.1$) mergers, complementing instruments like Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs). Eccentricity also expands the detectable MBH mass range to $10^9~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ (from $10^8~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$), and shifts the redshift peak from $z = 1.9$ (circular) to $z = 0.8$ (eccentric). We find LISA will detect MBH mergers in diverse host galaxies, including lower-mass and satellite galaxies. These hosts are $\sim 50$ times more star-forming than typical galaxies of the same mass, forming a tight power-law in SFR--$M_{\rm gal}$ space: ${\rm SFR} = 10^{-8} M_{\rm gal}^{0.9}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$, independent of redshift. This contrasts with expectations for PTA sources, which tend to reside in massive central galaxies, suggesting LISA will probe distinct galactic environments. Only $\sim 10\%$ of the remnant MBHs are bright AGNs, mostly from mergers with $M_{\mathrm{BH}} &gt; 10^{6.5}~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>ALMA Band 3 Selection of Ultra-high Redshift Dropouts: The final challenge to {\Lambda}CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lyman-break technique has been used to successfully identify high-redshift candidates in broad-band photometric data in the rest-frame optical and NIR using the dropout technique. We pioneer the application of this technique to new wavelength regimes, and search for dropouts in combined ALMA and JWST data. We find a candidate that is undetected in NIRCam imaging including and blueward of the F444W filter, but clearly identified in ALMA band 3. Assuming this is a Lyman-break candidate, we measure a redshift in the range $40 &lt; z &lt; 21\,380$. This is the highest redshift galaxy candidate discovered to date, and is in significant tension with current and future predictions from cosmological simulations, with implications for galaxy evolution in the (very) early Universe.</description>

      <title>Structure and Fragmentation Scale of a Massive Star-Forming Filament in NGC6334: High-Resolution Mid-Infrared Absorption Imaging with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dense filaments are believed to be representative of the initial conditions of star formation in molecular clouds. We have used the MIRI instrument on JWST to image the massive filament NGC6334M at d~1.3 kpc with unprecedented resolution and dynamic range at 7.7 and 25.5 microns. Our observations reveal the fine structure of the filament in absorption against mid-infrared background emission. From the absorption data, we derive high-resolution column density maps and perform a detailed analysis of the filament structure. We find a median filament width of 0.12+/-0.02 pc at both wavelengths, resolved by almost two orders of magnitude by MIRI, and consistent with the typical half-power width of Herschel filaments in nearby (d&lt;0.5 kpc) clouds. The JWST data also reveal the presence of a quasi-periodic series of side filaments with a similar projected spacing of 0.125+/-0.015 pc. Combining our JWST results with Spitzer and APEX/Herschel data, we perform a study of cloud structure over four orders of magnitude in linear scale. A convergence test shows that our width estimates for NGC6334M are robust and reflect the presence of a true characteristic scale. While there is evidence of a Kolmogorov-like spectrum of small-scale fluctuations down the 1.6x10^-3 pc resolution of the JWST observations, we identify a break in the power spectrum of column density fluctuations at a scale ~0.1-0.4 pc comparable to the width of NGC6334M and its side filaments. This characteristic scale ~0.1pc has important implications for the origin of the star formation efficiency in dense gas and the IMF.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Fast Acceleration of AGN-Driven Winds at Kiloparsec Scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes at the centre of galaxies gain mass through accretion disks. Models predict that quasi-spherical winds, expelled by the black hole during active accretion phases, have a key role in shaping galaxy evolution by regulating star formation, the distribution of metals over kiloparsec scales, and by sweeping ambient gas to the outskirts and beyond of galaxies. Nonetheless, the mechanism driving these outflows and the amount of energy exchanged between the wind and the galaxy's interstellar medium remain unclear. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the kinematical properties of winds in a sample of nearby active galaxies using the novel kinematic tool MOKA3D, which takes into account the clumpy nature of the ISM. We find remarkable similarities among the properties of the outflows in all the galaxies examined. In particular, we provide the first evidence that outflows exhibit a regular trend in radial velocity, initially constant or slightly decreasing, followed by rapid acceleration starting at approximately 1 kpc from the nucleus, despite the seemingly complex kinematics observed. The observed behavior aligns with our current theoretical understanding of Active Galactic Nuclei outflows, where a momentum-driven phase transitions to an energy-conserving phase just beyond approximately 1 kpc. The constant velocity of the momentum-driven wind is then rapidly accelerated following the inefficient Compton cooling of post-shock material and the transition to energy conservation. The measured radial terminal velocities of the outflows are always larger than the escape velocities from the host galaxies, confirming the key role of outflows in shaping the galaxy properties and evolution, as a manifestation of AGN feedback. Our results, only made possible by our novel kinematic analysis tool, are crucial to understand the origin and the powering mechanism of these winds.</description>

      <title>Supermassive Black Holes in X-rays: From Standard Accretion to Extreme Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-rays are a critical wavelength for understanding supermassive black holes (SMBHs). X-rays probe the inner accretion flow, closest to the event horizon, where gas inspirals, releasing energy and driving black hole growth. This region also governs the launching of outflows and jets that regulate galaxy evolution and link SMBH growth to their host galaxies.
  This review focuses on X-ray observations of SMBHs, through "standard accretion" in persistent Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and in extreme transient events, such as Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), Changing-Look AGN (CLAGN), and Quasi-Periodic Eruptions (QPEs). We describe the X-ray spectral and variability properties of AGN, and the observational techniques that probe the inner accretion flow. Through understanding the phenomenology and accretion physics in standard, individual AGN, we can better search for more exotic phenomenon, including binary SMBH mergers, or Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs).
  In this review, the reader will discover:
  (1) X-ray variability on timescales from minutes to hours traces accretion near the event horizon.
  (2) X-rays can measure the black hole mass, spin and accretion flow geometry and dynamics.
  (3) In transients like TDEs, X-rays probe the newly formed accretion disk that feeds the black hole.
  (4) QPEs are posited to be EMRIs orbiting accreting SMBHs that would emit low-frequency gravitational waves.
  (5) Future X-ray, time-domain and multi-messenger surveys will revolutionize our understanding of SMBH growth.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores an unexpected yet compelling parallel between the evolution of the universe, as described by cosmological eras, and the artistic evolution of Taylor Swift, delineated by her distinct album eras. By mapping key characteristics and transitions in the universe's history to corresponding themes and milestones in Swift's career, I offer a novel perspective on both. I culminate with predictions for Swift's future work and dare to ask a question of cosmic importance: Could Taylor Swift's thirteenth album hold the secret to the universe's ultimate destiny?</description>

Abstract: Understanding our place in the universe is an eternal quest. Through the analysis of the 3D structures of 66 nearby open clusters using Gaia DR3 data, we discovered an intriguing pattern: most clusters show their elongation directions pointing at the Sun, suggesting that the Solar System might just be the universe's favorite spot, a cosmic feng shui hotspot! This surprising result hints at a subtle blend of geometry and geomancy.</description>

      <title>The Population Synthesis Toolkit (PST) Python library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar population synthesis is a crucial methodology in astrophysics, enabling the interpretation of the integrated light of galaxies and stellar clusters. By combining empirical and/or theoretical libraries of the spectral energy distribution emitted by simple stellar populations (SSPs) with models of the star formation history (SFH) and chemical evolution, population synthesis facilitates the estimation of essential galaxy properties, such as total stellar mass, star formation rate, mass-weighted age and metallicity, etc. The Population Synthesis Toolkit (PST) is a Python library that offers a comprehensive and flexible framework for stellar population synthesis. Its main goal is to compute composite spectra using different galaxy evolution models and SSP libraries with ease and efficiency. It incorporates additional effects, such as cosmic redshift and dust extinction, and it computes several observable quantities derived from the spectra, including broadband photometric fluxes and equivalent widths.</description>

      <title>The Universe is Odd</title>

Abstract: The cosmological principle posits that the universe does not exhibit any specific preference for position or direction. However, it remains unclear whether the universe has a distinct preference for parity: whether certain properties are more likely to be classified as even or odd. In this study, we analyze the largest available galaxy group catalogs to explore this hypothesis: specifically, whether the number of galaxies within a galaxy group or cluster is more likely to be odd or even. Our findings convincingly indicate that the universe indeed favors odd numbers, with results achieving a significance level well above the $4.1-\sigma$ threshold.</description>

      <title>The Gaia AVU-GSR solver: a CPU + GPU parallel code toward Exascale systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22863v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solver module of the Astrometric Verification Unit - Global Sphere Reconstruction (AVU-GSR) pipeline aims to find the astrometric parameters of $\sim$$10^8$ stars in the Milky Way, besides the attitude and instrumental settings of the Gaia satellite and the parametrized post Newtonian parameter $\gamma$ with a resolution of 10-100 micro-arcseconds. To perform this task, the code solves a system of linear equations with the iterative Least Squares (LSQR) algorithm, where the coefficient matrix is large (10-50 TB) and sparse and the iterations stop when convergence is reached in the least squares sense. The two matrix-by-vector products performed at each LSQR step were GPU-ported, firstly with OpenACC and then with CUDA, resulting in a $\sim$$1.5$x and $\sim$$14$x speedup, respectively, over an original code version entirely parallelized on the CPU with MPI + OpenMP. The CUDA code was further optimized and then ported with programming frameworks portable across different GPU architectures, obtaining a further $\sim$$2$x acceleration factor. One critical section of the code consists in the computation of covariances, whose total number is $N_{\rm unk} \times (N_{\rm unk} - 1)/2$ and occupy $\sim$1 EB, being $N_{\rm unk}$$\sim$$5 \times 10^8$ the total number of unknowns. This "Big Data" issue cannot be faced with standard approaches: we defined an I/O-based pipeline made of two concurrently launched jobs, where one job, i.e., the LSQR, writes the files and the second job reads them, iteratively computes the covariances and deletes them. The pipeline does not present significant bottlenecks until a number of covariances elements equal to $\sim$$8 \times 10^6$. The code currently runs in production on Leonardo CINECA infrastructure.</description>

      <title>All about Cookies: The perfect compromise between softness and crispiness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cookies are enjoyed best when they are both crispy and soft. I investigate in which proportion the cookies are crispy and soft, and disentangle whether it makes them biscuits, cakes, or none of the above. I baked cookies for colleagues at KTH, Stockholm, and University of Geneva, Switzerland, adopting my mum's mum's mum's etc. recipe. I created a dedicated survey for my colleagues with three well-selected questions to answer while eating one cookie. The weighted-average mean of the crispiness and softness, weighted by the respective enjoyment of the cookie, over the whole population amount to 7.0 +/- 1.1 and 5.3 +/- 1.4, respectively. The enjoyment of the cookies amounts to 9.1 +/- 2.3. People like (my) cookies, and cookies are neither cakes, nor biscuits, they are just... cookies!</description>

      <title>Using Wavelet Decomposition to Determine the Dimension of Structures from Projected Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mesoscale structures can often be described as fractional dimensional across a wide range of scales. We consider a $\gamma$ dimensional measure embedded in an $N$ dimensional space and discuss how to determine its dimension, both in $N$ dimensions and projected into $D$ dimensions.
  It is a highly non-trivial problem to decode the original geometry from lower dimensional projection of a high-dimensional measure. The projections are space-feeling, the popular box-counting techniques do not apply, and the Fourier methods are contaminated by aliasing effects. In the present paper we demonstrate that under the "Copernican hypothesis'' that we are not observing objects from a special direction, projection in a wavelet basis is remarkably simple: the wavelet power spectrum of a projected $\gamma$ dimensional measure is $P_j \propto 2^{-j\gamma}$. This holds regardless of the embedded dimension, $N$, and the projected dimension, $D$. This approach could have potentially broad applications in data sciences where a typically sparse matrix encodes lower dimensional information embedded in an extremely high dimensional field and often measured in projection to a low dimensional space.
  Here, we apply this method to JWST and Chandra observations of the nearby supernova Cas A. We find that the emissions can be represented by projections of mesoscale substructures with fractal dimensions varying from $\gamma = 1.7$ for the warm CO layer observed by JWST, up to $\gamma = 2.5$ for the hot X-ray emitting gas layer in the supernova remnant. The resulting power law indicates that the emission is coming from a fractal dimensional mesoscale structure likely produced by magneto-hydrodynamical instabilities in the expanding supernova shell.</description>

      <title>Exploring Young Stellar Variability with Gaia DR3 light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Photometric variability is a defining characteristic of young stellar objects (YSO), which can be traced back to a range of physical processes taking place at different stages of young stars' formation and early evolution. Gaia's third Data Release (GDR3) has provided an unprecedented dataset of photometric time series, including 79375 light curves for YSO candidates. With its all-sky coverage, Gaia provides a unique opportunity for large-scale studies of YSO variability. Aims: Our goal was to characterise the GDR3 sample of YSO variables further and verify the recurrence of YSO variability modes due to accretion, extinction, rotation modulation, etc. By adapting the Q&amp;M methodology for Gaia's sparse and long-term light curves, we seek to bridge the gap between low and high-cadence surveys' insights on YSO variability. Methods: We piloted the application of the asymmetry (M) and periodicity (Q) variability metrics to characterise YSO variability with Gaia light curves. Through refined sample selection, we identified sources with appropriate sampling for the Q&amp;M methodology. We used the Generalised Lomb Scargle periodogram and structure functions to infer variability timescales. Results: We successfully derived Q&amp;M indices for ~23000 sources in the GDR3 YSO sample. These variables were then classified into eight variability morphological classes. We linked morphological classes with physical mechanisms by using H$\alpha$ as a proxy of accretion and $\alpha_\mathrm{IR}$-indices to gauge circumstellar material's presence. Conclusions: We demonstrate that the Q&amp;M metrics can be successfully applied to Gaia's sparse time-series. We applied them to distinguish between the several variability modes. While our results are generally consistent with previous high-cadence, short-term studies, we find that GDR3's long timespan yields an enhanced variety of variability mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The $i$-processes nucleosynthesis during the formation of He-rich hot-subdwarf stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23541v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been shown that proton ingestion episodes can happen in the formation of hot-subdwarf stars, and that neutron-capture processes are possible in those cases. Moreover, some helium-rich hot subdwarfs display extraordinarily high abundances of heavy elements such as Zr, Yr and Pb on their surfaces. We explore under which conditions neutron-capture processes can occur in late helium core flashes, i.e. those occurring in the cores of stripped red-giant stars.
  We compute evolutionary models through the helium core flash and the subsequent hydrogen ingestion episode in stripped red giant stars. Stellar structure models are then used in post-processing to compute the detailed evolution of neutron-capture elements. We find that for metallicities of $10^{-3}$ and below, neutron densities can be as high as $10^{15}\,$cm$^{-3}$ and intermediate neutron capture processes occur in some of our models. The results depend very strongly on the H-envelope mass that survives after the stripping. Interestingly, we find that computed abundances in some of our models closely match the element abundances up to tin observed for EC 22536-5304, the only well-studied star for which the hot-flasher scenario assumed in our models is the most likely evolutionary path.
  Intermediate neutron capture processes can occur in the He-core flash experienced by the cores of some stripped red giants, and might be connected to the abundances of heavy elements observed in some helium-rich hot-subdwarf stars. The agreement between the observed abundances in EC 22536-5304 and those of our models offers support to our nucleosynthesis calculations. Moreover, if confirmed, the idea that heavy element abundances retain signatures of the different evolutionary channels opens the possibility that heavy element abundances in iHe-sdOB stars can be used to infer their evolutionary origin.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Catsteroseismology, or asterocatsmology, is an unexplored area of observational and theoretical research that proposes to use purr-mode oscillations to study the much-beloved but poorly-understood species Felis catus. In this work, we conduct a survey to measure fundamental purrameters of cats and relate them to their purr-modes. Relations between these fundamental cat purrameters, which include physical (eg. size, cuddliness) and personality (eg. aggression, intelligence) traits, and purr-modes can help probe their inner lives and emotions. We find that while purr characteristics tentatively trend with several physical and personality traits, more data is required to better constrain these relationships and infer the direct predictive power of personality on purr-modes, or vice versa.</description>

      <title>The Accretion Properties and Jet Mechanisms for the Low-Excitation Radio Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio galaxies (RGs) are a subclass of active galactic nuclei, which are suggested to be the parent populations of blazars. According to the accretion-ejection paragram, RGs can be classified into low-excitation or high-excitation radio galaxies (LERGs or HERGs). In this paper, we compiled a distance-limited ($z&lt;0.15$) sample of 431 LERGs (Fanaroff-Riley, or FR, type 0, I, and II RGs) to discuss their jet formation mechanism with the ADAF (advection-dominated accretion flow) scenario, and compare their accretion properties with Fermi BL Lacertae objects. We explored different jet mechanisms (Blandford-Znajek [BZ] model and a mixture of the BZ and Blandford-Payne, hybrid, model) within the framework of ADAF-type disc around a Kerr black hole for both LERGs and Fermi BL Lacs. Based on standard assumptions on the accretion-ejection coupling in RGs, the maximum kinetic jet and accretion power for FR 0s, FR Is, FR IIs can be, explained by an ADAF with the pure BZ mechanism or hybrid jet mechanism. In addition, for one third of the FR IIs, to account for their higher kinetic jet power than what is simply expected by the hybrid jet mechanism, the magnetic field could play an important role as in the form of magnetization-driven outflows or stronger magnetic structures, as observed in some BL Lacs with high jet powers. Similarities between BL Lacs and LERGs (e.g., accretion-ejection and clustering properties) suggest that high synchrotron peaked BL Lacs could be the beamed counterparts of FR 0s, and a potential general unification between LERGs and BL Lacs populations is discussed. However, a complete sample of BL Lacs is needed to robustly compare the jet and accretion properties with those of LERGs in the future.</description>

      <title>SPHERE/ZIMPOL insights into discs around evolved stars: arcs, asymmetries and porous dust aggregates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Second-generation circumbinary discs around evolved binary stars, such as post-Asymptotic Giant Branch (post-AGB) stars, provide insights into poorly understood mechanisms of dust processing and disc evolution across diverse stellar environments. We present a multi-wavelength polarimetric survey of five evolved binary systems - AR Pup, HR 4049, HR 4226, U Mon, and V709 Car - using the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument. Post-AGB discs show significant polarimetric brightness at optical and near-IR wavelengths, often exceeding 1% of the system's total intensity. We also measured a maximum fractional polarization of the scattered light for AR Pup of ~0.7 in the V-band and ~0.55 in the I-band. To investigate wavelength-dependent polarization, we combine the SPHERE/ZIMPOL dataset with results from previous SPHERE/IRDIS studies. This analysis reveals that post-AGB discs exhibit a grey to blue polarimetric colour in the optical and near-IR. Along with high fractional polarization and polarized intensity distribution, these findings indicate that porous dust aggregates dominate the surface dust composition. We also find evidence of diverse disc geometries within the post-AGB sample, including arcs, asymmetries and variations in disc size across optical and near-IR wavelengths for some systems. Combining our findings with existing multi-technique studies, we question the classification of two systems in our sample, HR 4226 and V709 Car, which were originally identified as post-AGB binaries based on their near-IR excess. On comparing post-AGB discs to circumstellar environments around AGB stars and YSOs, we found that post-AGB systems exhibit a higher degree of polarization than single AGB stars and are comparable to the brightest protoplanetary discs around YSOs. Overall, our results reinforce the importance of polarimetric observations in probing dust properties and complex circumbinary structures.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Forecasting of High-Dimensional Transient and Stationary Processes via Space-Time Projection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23686v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Space-Time Projection (STP) is introduced as a data-driven forecasting approach for high-dimensional and time-resolved data. The method computes extended space-time proper orthogonal modes from training data spanning a prediction horizon comprising both hindcast and forecast intervals. Forecasts are then generated by projecting the hindcast portion of these modes onto new data, simultaneously leveraging their orthogonality and optimal correlation with the forecast extension. Rooted in Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) theory, dimensionality reduction and time-delay embedding are intrinsic to the approach. For a given ensemble and fixed prediction horizon, the only tunable parameter is the truncation rank--no additional hyperparameters are required. The hindcast accuracy serves as a reliable indicator for short-term forecast accuracy and establishes a lower bound on forecast errors. The efficacy of the method is demonstrated using two datasets: transient, highly anisotropic simulations of supernova explosions in a turbulent interstellar medium, and experimental velocity fields of a turbulent high-subsonic engineering flow. In a comparative study with standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks--acknowledging that alternative architectures or training strategies may yield different outcomes--the method consistently provided more accurate forecasts. Considering its simplicity and robust performance, STP offers an interpretable and competitive benchmark for forecasting high-dimensional transient and chaotic processes, relying purely on spatiotemporal correlation information.</description>

      <title>A new independent look at the galactic black hole low-mass X-ray binary distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Investigations of the Galactic black hole low-mass X-ray binaries (BH-LMXBs) offer valuable insights into the elusive black hole population in the Milky Way. Motivated by recent tensions in the natal kick velocity distribution and BH mass distribution of BH-LMXBs, we revisit the spatial distribution of the Galactic BH-LMXBs using a new set of distance measurements obtained from an X-ray spectral modelling framework that we introduced in earlier work. We perform a multiparameter simulation study to mitigate part of the bias present in our prior estimates and gain insights into possible observational selection effects that affect the observed population. We derive a bias correction factor, well described by a Pareto probability density function that closely follows an inverse-square law dependence on distance. We then construct a bias-corrected, literature-independent, Galactic spatial distribution that clearly traces spiral arm structures and shows a deficit of sources very close to the Galactic centre, which might be explained due to high extinction or a true paucity of these sources at that region. Further analysis of the simulation results provides hints for a hidden population of BH-LMXBs at low Galactic heights. Lastly, we estimate the root-mean-squared Galactic height and find that it is most compatible with a hybrid scenario of BH formation, with some BHs receiving high natal kicks and thus propelled further from the thin disc plane while others receiving low natal kicks and remaining close to their birth place.</description>

      <title>Populations of evolved massive binary stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud I: Predictions from detailed evolution models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The majority of massive stars are born with a close binary companion. How this affects their evolution and fate is still largely uncertain, especially at low metallicity. Aims. We derive synthetic populations of massive post-interaction binary products and compare them with corresponding observed populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. We analyse 53298 detailed binary evolutionary models computed with MESA. Our models include the physics of rotation, mass and angular momentum transfer, magnetic internal angular momentum transport, and tidal spin-orbit coupling. They cover initial primary masses of 5-100Msun, initial mass ratios of 0.3-0.95, and all initial periods for which interaction is expected. They are evolved through the first mass transfer and the donor star death, a possible ensuing Be/X-ray binary phase, and they end when the mass gainer leaves the main sequence. Results.In our fiducial synthetic population, 8% of the OB stars in the SMC are post-mass transfer systems, and 7% are merger products. In many of our models, the mass gainers are spun up and form Oe/Be stars. While our model underpredicts the number of Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, it reproduces the main features of their orbital period distribution and the observed number of SMC binary WR stars. We expect $\sim$50 OB+BH binaries below and $\sim$170 above 20d orbital period. The latter might produce merging double BHs. However, their progenitors, the predicted long-period WR+OB binaries, are not observed. Conclusions. While the comparison with the observed SMC stars supports many physics assumptions in our high-mass binary models, a better match of the large number of observed OBe stars and Be/X-ray binaries likely requires a lower merger rate and/or a higher mass transfer efficiency during the first mass transfer. The fate of the initially wide O star binaries remains uncertain.</description>

Abstract: Massive star evolution plays a crucial role in astrophysics but bares large uncertainties. This problem becomes more severe by the majority of massive stars being born in close binary systems, whose evolution is affected by the interaction of their components. We want to constrain major uncertainties in massive binary star evolution, in particular the efficiency and the stability of the first mass transfer phase. We use the rapid population synthesis code ComBinE to generate synthetic populations of post-interaction binaries, assuming constant mass-transfer efficiency. We employ a new merger criterion that adjusts self-consistently to any prescribed mass-transfer efficiency. We tailor our synthetic populations to be comparable to the expected binary populations in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). We find that the observed populations of evolved massive binaries can not be reproduced with a single mass-transfer efficiency. Instead, a rather high efficiency (&gt;50%) is needed to reproduce the number of Be stars and Be/X-ray binaries in the SMC, while a low efficiency (~10%) leads to a better agreement with the observed number of Wolf-Rayet stars. We construct a corresponding mass-dependent mass-transfer efficiency recipe to produce our fiducial synthetic SMC post-interaction binary population. It reproduces the observed number and properties of the Be/X-ray and WR-binaries rather well, and is not in stark disagreement with the observed OBe star population. It further predicts two large, yet unobserved populations of OB+BH binaries, that is ~100 OB+BH systems with rather small orbital periods (&lt;20 days) and ~40 longer period OBe+BH systems.</description>

      <title>The wind properties of O-type stars at sub-SMC metallicity</title>

Abstract: Radiation-driven winds heavily influence the evolution and fate of massive stars. Feedback processes from these winds impact the properties of the interstellar medium of their host galaxies. The dependence of mass loss on stellar properties is poorly understood, particularly at low metallicity ($Z$). We aim to characterise stellar and wind properties of massive stars in Local Group dwarf galaxies with $Z$ below that of the Small Magellanic Cloud and confront our findings to theories of radiation-driven winds. We perform quantitative optical and UV spectroscopy on a sample of 11 O-type stars in nearby dwarf galaxies with $Z &lt; 0.2\,Z_\odot$. The stellar atmosphere code Fastwind and the genetic algorithm Kiwi-GA are used to determine stellar and wind parameters. Inhomogeneities in the wind are assumed to be optically thin. The winds of the sample stars are weak, with mass loss rates $\sim 10^{-9}-10^{-7}\,M_\odot\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. Such feeble winds can only be constrained if UV spectra are available. The modified wind momentum as a function of luminosity ($L$) for stars in this $Z$ regime is in agreement with extrapolations to lower $Z$ of a recently established empirical relation for this quantity as a function of both $L$ and $Z$. However, theoretical prescriptions do not match our results or those of other recent analyses at low luminosity ($L \lesssim 10^{5.2}\,L_{\odot}$) and low $Z$; in this regime, they predict winds that are stronger by an order of magnitude or more. For our sample stars at $Z \sim 0.14\,Z_\odot$, with masses $\sim 30 - 50\,M_{\odot}$, stellar winds strip little mass during main-sequence evolution. However, if the steep dependence of mass loss on luminosity found here also holds for more massive stars at these metallicities, these may suffer as severely from main-sequence mass stripping as very massive stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud and Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Written in the Stars: How your (pens and) papers decide the fate of the arXiverse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We all love the ecstasy that comes with submitting papers to journals or arXiv. Some have described it as yeeting their back-breaking products of labor into the void, wishing they could never deal with them ever again. The very act of yeeting papers onto arXiv contributes to the expansion of the arXiverse; however, we have yet to quantify our contribution to the cause. In this work, I investigate the expansion of the arXiverse using the arXiv astro-ph submission data from 1992 to date. I coin the term "the arXiverse constant", $a_0$, to quantify the rate of expansion of the arXiverse. I find that astro-ph as a whole has a positive $a_0$, but this does not always hold true for the six subcategories of astro-ph. I then investigate the temporal changes in $a_0$ for the astro-ph subcategories and astro-ph as a whole, from which I infer the fate of the arXiverse.</description>

      <title>TOPz: photometric redshifts using template fitting applied to GAMA survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Accurate photometric redshift (photo-z) estimation is crucial for cosmological and galaxy evolution studies, especially with the advent of large-scale photometric surveys.
  Aims. We develop a photo-z estimation code called TOPz (Tartu Observatory Photo-z) and apply it to the GAMA photometric catalogue.
  Methods. TOPz employs a Bayesian template-fitting approach to estimate photo-z from marginalised redshift posteriors. Using nine-band photometric data from the GAMA project, we assess the accuracy of TOPz by comparing its photo-z estimates to available spectroscopic redshifts. We generate synthetic galaxy spectra using the CIGALE software and run template set optimisation. We improve the photometry by applying flux and flux uncertainty corrections. An analytical prior is then imposed on the resulting posteriors to refine the redshift estimates.
  Results. The photo-z estimates produced by TOPz show good agreement with the spectroscopic redshifts. We demonstrate the redshift accuracy across various magnitude bins and test how the flux corrections and posteriors reflect the actual uncertainty of the estimates. We show that the TOPz results are consistent with those obtained from other photo-z codes applied to the same data set. Additionally, TOPz estimates stellar masses as a by-product, comparable to those calculated by other methods. We made the GAMA photo-z catalogue and all the codes and scripts used for the analysis and figures publicly available.
  Conclusions. TOPz is an advanced photo-z estimation code that integrates flux corrections, physical priors, and template set optimisation to provide state-of-the-art photo-z among competing template-based redshift estimators. Future work will focus on incorporating additional photometric data and applying the TOPz algorithm to J-PAS narrow-band survey, further validating and enhancing its capabilities.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects in stellar mass gravitational wave sources I: Expected fraction of signals with significant dephasing in the dynamical and AGN channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first overview of the expected quantity of signals which will showcase significant gravitational wave phase shifts caused by astrophysical environments, considering the upcoming A+ and A\# LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA, Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope detectors. We construct and analyse two general families of dephasing prescriptions with extensions to eccentric sources, as well as collect five specific prescriptions for the fundamental smoking gun physical mechanisms at play in the dynamical and AGN formation channel for stellar mass binary black holes: Roemer delays, tidal forces and hydrodynamical interactions. We compute the expected fraction of signals containing astrophysical dephasing, as a function of environmental properties and based on observed distributions of binary parameters. We find that next generation detectors can expect to find environmental effects in hundreds of detected signals.</description>

      <title>The mass accretion history of dark matter haloes down to Earth mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.15894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.15894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We take advantage of the unprecedented dynamical range provided by the "Cosmic-Zoom" project to study the mass accretion history (MAH) of present-day dark matter haloes over the entire mass range present in the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm when the dark matter is made of weakly interacting massive particles of mass $100\ \mathrm{GeV}$. In particular, we complement previous studies by exploring the MAHs of haloes with mass from $10^8\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ down to Earth mass, $10^{-6}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. The formation redshift of low-mass haloes anti-correlates weakly with mass, peaking at $z=3$ for haloes of mass $10^{-4}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$. Even lower masses are affected by the free-streaming cutoff in the primordial spectrum of density fluctuations and form at lower redshift. We compare MAHs in our simulations with predictions from two analytical models based on the extended Press-Schechter theory (EPS), and three empirical models derived by fitting and extrapolating either results from cosmological $N$-body simulations or Monte Carlo realizations of halo growth. All models fit our simulations reasonably well over the mass range for which they were calibrated. While the empirical models match better for more massive haloes, $M&gt;10^{10}\ h^{-1}\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, the analytical models do better when extrapolated down to Earth mass. At the higher masses, we explore the correlation between local environment density and MAH, finding that biases are relatively weak, with typical MAHs for haloes in extremely low-density and in typical regions differing by less than $20$ percent at high redshift. We conclude that EPS theory predicts the hierarchical build-up of dark matter haloes quite well over the entire mass range.</description>

      <title>Accelerated by Dark Matter: a High-redshift Pathway to Efficient Galaxy-scale Star Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the local Universe, star formation is typically inefficient both globally and when considered as the fraction of gas converted into stars per local free-fall time. An important exception to this inefficiency is regions of high gravitational accelerations $g$, or equivalently surface densities $\Sigma = g/(\pi\,G)$, where stellar feedback is insufficient to overcome the self-gravity of dense gas clouds. In this paper, I explore whether dark matter can play an analogous role in providing the requisite accelerations on the scale of entire galaxies in the early cosmos. The key insight is that characteristic accelerations in dark matter halos scale as $(1+z)^2$ at fixed halo mass. I show this is sufficient to make dark matter the source of intense accelerations that might induce efficient star formation on galactic scales at cosmic dawn in sufficiently massive halos. The mass characterizing this regime scales as $(1+z)^{-6}$ and corresponds to a relatively constant comoving number density of $n(&gt;\!M_{\rm vir}) \approx 10^{-4}\,{\rm Mpc}^{-3}$ at $z \gtrsim 8$. For somewhat rarer halos, this model predicts stellar masses of $M_{\star} \sim 10^{9}\,M_{\odot}$ can form in regions that end up with sizes $\mathcal{O}(100\,{\rm pc})$ over $40\,{\rm Myr}$ time-scales at $z\approx 12-14$; these numbers compare well to measurements for some of the brightest galaxies at that epoch from James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations. Dark matter and standard cosmological evolution may therefore be crucial for explaining the surprisingly high levels of star formation in the early Universe revealed by JWST.</description>

      <title>Measuring Mass of Gas in Central Galaxies using weak lensing and satellite kinematics in MOND</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13329v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Milgrom's modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND) framework, the dynamical mass of a galaxy is fully determined by its baryonic matter distribution. We fit the distribution of cold and hot gas halos, focusing on hot gas, around SDSS central galaxies using weak lensing signals from the DECaLS survey in MOND. The central galaxies are classified into two samples, the total galaxies and star-forming galaxies. We find that hot gas halo densities nearly follow Plummer's profile for both samples across all mass bins. The rotation curves of the galaxy samples are also demonstrated. The efficiency of converting gas into stars, $M_*/(M_* + M_{\rm g})$, is between 0.3 and 0.8 in all mass bins of the star-forming sample, which is higher than in the total sample. We also calculate gas mass using the satellite kinematics method in MOND. A constant, mildly radial anisotropy or isotropy in satellite motion leads to good agreement between the satellite kinematics and weak lensing methods. Combining both methods, we observe a baryonic mass to line-of-sight velocity dispersion of satellites ($M_{\rm b}$-$\sigma_{\rm s}$) relation. In addition, we examine more sophisticated models in MOND, including external field effects and Osipkov-Merritt anisotropy profiles, and find them unnecessary. A simple, mildly radial constant anisotropic model or an isotropic model, even when isolated, already aligns with observations. The strong concordance between the two methods suggests that weak lensing signals reliably measure the dynamical mass of central galaxies and can constrain the distribution of missing baryons in galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Formation of giant radio sources in galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04467v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The number of observed giant radio sources (GRSs) has increased significantly in recent years, yet their formation mechanisms remain elusive. The discovery of giant radio galaxies within galaxy clusters has further intensified the ongoing debates. We utilize magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. To avoid confounding the effects of power and total energy injection, we hold the energy of jet outbursts fixed and study the effect of power by varying the active duration of the jets. Furthermore, we examine the roles of magnetic, thermal, and kinetic energy components by adjusting their fractions in the jets. Additionally, we calculate radio emission for comparison with observations in the radio power-linear size diagram (P-D diagram). Finally, we also study the energy transport processes of different jets. We find the "lower power-larger bubble" effect: lower-power jets tend to produce larger radio sources with fixed total jet energy. Regarding different energy components, jets dominated by toroidal magnetic field energy generate larger radio sources than kinetic and thermal energy-dominated jets. Conversely, strong poloidal magnetic fields hinder radio lobe growth. When injecting $2.06 \times 10^{59}$ erg into a $10^{14}$ solar mass halo, only jets with powers of approximately $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$ Eddington luminosity efficiently traverse the observational region in the P-D diagram. Our findings suggest that energetic, long-lasting (low-power), continuous jets endowed with significant toroidal magnetic fields facilitate the formation of GRSs in cluster environments. However, although the jets with significantly lower power can generate substantially larger radio sources, their faintness may render them unobservable.</description>

      <title>Amoeba: An AGN Model of Optical Emissions Beyond steady-state Accretion discs</title>

Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are objects located in the heart of galaxies which emit powerful and complex radiation across the electromagnetic spectrum. Understanding AGN has become a topic of interest due to their importance in galactic evolution and their ability to act as a probe to the distant Universe. Within the next few years, wide-field surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Rubin Vera Observatory are expected to increase the number of known AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{7})$ and the number of strongly lensed AGN to $\mathcal{O} (10^{4})$. In this paper we introduce \texttt{Amoeba}: an AGN Model of Optical Emission Beyond steady-state Accretion discs. The goal of \texttt{Amoeba} is to provide a modular and flexible modelling environment for AGN, in which all components can interact with each other. Through this work we describe the framework for major AGN components to vary self-consistently and keep flux distributions to connect these components to spatial dependent processes. We model properties beyond traditional single-component models, such as the reverberation of the corona's bending power law power spectrum through the accretion disc and broad line region (BLR). We simulate obscuration by the dusty torus and differential magnification of the disc and BLR due to microlensing. These features are joined together to create some of the most realistic light curve simulations to date. \texttt{Amoeba} takes a step forward in AGN modelling by joining the accretion disc, BLR, torus, intrinsic signal, and microlensing into a coherent model.</description>

      <title>Constraining bursty star formation histories with galaxy UV and H$\alpha$ luminosity functions and clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21409v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observed prevalence of galaxies exhibiting bursty star formation histories (SFHs) at $z\gtrsim6$ has created new challenges and opportunities for understanding their formation pathways. The degenerate effects of the efficiency and burstiness of star formation on the observed UV luminosity function are separable by galaxy clustering. However, quantifying the timescales of burstiness requires more than just the continuum UV measurements. Here we develop a flexible semi-analytic framework for modeling both the amplitude of star formation rate (SFR) variations and their temporal correlation, from which the luminosity function and clustering can be derived for SFR indicators tracing different characteristic timescales (e.g., UV continuum and H$\alpha$ luminosities). Based on this framework, we study the prospect of using galaxy summary statistics to distinguish models where SFR fluctuations are prescribed by different power spectral density (PSD) forms. Using the Fisher matrix approach, we forecast the constraints on parameters in our PSD-based model that can be extracted from mock JWST observations of the UV and H$\alpha$ luminosity functions and clustering bias factors at $z\sim6$. These constraints demonstrate the feasibility of constraining the burstiness of high-$z$ galaxies solely from their one-point and two-point statistics and underscore the importance of combining tracers of both long-term and short-term SFR variations. Our flexible framework can be readily extended to characterize the SFH of high-redshift galaxies with a wider range of observational diagnostics.</description>

      <title>IllustrisTNG Insights: Factors Affecting the Presence of Bars in Disk Galaxies</title>

Abstract: Bars are important in the secular evolution of galaxies. This study is aimed at exploring the reasons why some galaxies have bars at redshift $z=0$ while others do not. We use ellipse fitting to measure the properties and evolution of bars in the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulation. By using the K-S two-sample test and tracing their evolutionary changes, we analyze the parameter differences between barred and unbarred galaxies. The properties of galaxies with short bars are also studied. When tracing all disk galaxies at $z=0$ back to $z=1$, all of them show similar bar features at $z=1$. The fraction of bars increases in barred and short-bar galaxies but decreases in unbarred galaxies during $z=1-0$. In the case of disk galaxies with stellar mass log$(M_*/M_\odot)&gt; 10.8$, nurture (mainly mergers) plays the most important role in suppressing or destroying bars. Bars are more likely to endure in galaxies that experience fewer mergers, which can be quantified by smaller stellar halos and ex-situ mass fractions. Approximately 60\% of the unbarred galaxies in the local Universe once had a bar. In contrast, the lack of responsiveness to bar instabilities (a larger Toomre-Q parameter) due to a less compact nature plays an important role in generating unbarred disk galaxies with stellar mass log$(M_*/M_\odot)&lt;10.8$. Moreover, short bars generally form at a similar time to normal bars, during which they either grow mildly or contract significantly. The fact that IllustrisTNG simulations produce too many galaxies with short bars indicates that the dynamical properties of the central regions in IllustrisTNG galaxies are less affected by external factors, such as mergers and gas inflows.</description>

      <title>A grand-design spiral galaxy with an ordered magnetic field at redshift 2.6 as resolved with ALMA and gravitational lensing</title>

Abstract: Magnetic fields play an important role in the evolution of galaxies and in shaping the dynamics of their inter-stellar medium. However, the formation history of magnetic fields from initial seed-fields to well-ordered systems is not clear. Favoured scenarios include a turbulent dynamo that amplifies the field, and a mean-field dynamo that organizes it. Such a model can be tested through observing the magnetic-field structure of galaxies in the early Universe given the relative formation time-scales involved. Here, we combine the high angular resolution of the Atacama Large Milli-metre Array (ALMA) and gravitational lensing to resolve the magnetic field structure of a 4-kpc in extent grand-design spiral when the Universe was just 2.6 Gyr old. We find that the spiral arm structure, as traced by the heated dust emission, is coincident with the linearly polarized emission, which is consistent with a highly ordered magnetic field. The time-scale needed to produce such an ordered field is likely within at least several rotations of the disk. Our study highlights the importance of combining the long baselines of ALMA and gravitational lensing to resolve the structure of galaxies at cosmologically interesting epochs.</description>

      <title>Modelling variability power spectra of active galaxies from irregular time series</title>

Abstract: A common feature of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is their random variations in brightness across the whole emission spectrum, from radio to $\gamma$-rays. Studying the nature and origin of these fluctuations is critical to characterising the underlying variability process of the accretion flow that powers AGN. Random timing fluctuations are often studied with the power spectrum; this quantifies how the amplitude of variations is distributed over temporal frequencies. Red noise variability -- when the power spectrum increases smoothly towards low frequencies -- is ubiquitous in AGN. The commonly used Fourier analysis methods, have significant challenges when applied to arbitrarily sampled light curves of red noise variability. Several time-domain methods exist to infer the power spectral shape in the case of irregular sampling but they suffer from biases which can be difficult to mitigate, or are computationally expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate a method infer the shape of broad-band power spectra for irregular time series, using a Gaussian process regression method scalable to large datasets. The power spectrum is modelled as a power-law model with one or two bends with flexible slopes. The method is fully Bayesian and we demonstrate its utility using simulated light curves. Finally, Ark 564, a well-known variable Seyfert 1 galaxy, is used as a test case and we find consistent results with the literature using independent X-ray data from XMM-Newton and Swift. We provide publicly available, documented and tested implementations in Python and Julia.</description>

      <title>Euclid preparation. LXVIII. Extracting physical parameters from galaxies with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14408v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Euclid mission is generating a vast amount of imaging data in four broadband filters at high angular resolution. This will allow the detailed study of mass, metallicity, and stellar populations across galaxies, which will constrain their formation and evolutionary pathways. Transforming the Euclid imaging for large samples of galaxies into maps of physical parameters in an efficient and reliable manner is an outstanding challenge. We investigate the power and reliability of machine learning techniques to extract the distribution of physical parameters within well-resolved galaxies. We focus on estimating stellar mass surface density, mass-averaged stellar metallicity and age. We generate noise-free, synthetic high-resolution imaging data in the Euclid photometric bands for a set of 1154 galaxies from the TNG50 cosmological simulation. The images are generated with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, taking into account the complex 3D distribution of stellar populations and interstellar dust attenuation. We use a machine learning framework to map the idealised mock observational data to the physical parameters on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We find that stellar mass surface density can be accurately recovered with a $\leq 0.130 {\rm \,dex}$ scatter. Conversely, stellar metallicity and age estimates are, as expected, less robust, but still contain significant information which originates from underlying correlations at a sub-kpc scale between stellar mass surface density and stellar population properties.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption of "snow clouds" by unassociated stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17419v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It has been suggested that star-forming galaxies may host a substantial, dark reservoir of gas in the form of planetary-mass molecular clouds that are so cold that $\text{H}_{2}$ can condense. Here we investigate the process of tidal disruption of such "snow clouds" by close passage of field stars. We construct a suite of simulations using the hydrodynamic formalism introduced by Carter and Luminet, and use it to explore the properties of the resulting tidal debris. The debris streams are tiny structures that are highly over-pressured relative to the ambient interstellar medium (ISM). They are also unusual in their composition--initially consisting of cold, gaseous He together with $\text{H}_{2}$ "snowballs" that may be as much as a metre in size. Each stream expands and cools and is subsequently shocked as it plows through the ISM; the snowballs are gradually eroded by the shocked gas. Snowballs streaming through the shocked ISM create microstructured plasma that is somewhat reminiscent of the "scattering screens" revealed by radio-wave scintillation studies. However, the tidal disruption rate is too low to account for the observed number of scattering screens if, as we assume here, the stars and clouds have no prior physical association so that disruptions occur as a result of chance encounters between stars and clouds.</description>

      <title>Stars as cosmic scales: measuring stellar mass with microlensed supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a unique probe of the stellar content in strong lens galaxies. Flux ratio anomalies from gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe), just like lensed quasars, can be used to constrain the stellar mass fractions at the image positions. Type Ia supernovae are of particular interest as knowledge of the intrinsic source brightness helps constrain the amount of (de)magnification from the macromodel predictions that might be due to microlensing. In addition, the presence or absence of caustic crossings in the light curves of glSNe can be used to constrain the mass of the microlenses. We find that a sample of 50 well-modeled glSNe Ia systems with single epoch observations at peak intrinsic supernova luminosity should be able to constrain an average stellar mass-to-light ratio to within $\sim 15\%$. A set of systems with light curve level information providing the location (or absence) of caustic crossing events can also constrain the mass of the microlenses to within $\sim 50\%$. Much work is needed to make such a measurement in practice, but our results demonstrate the feasibility of microlensing to place constraints on astrophysical parameters related to the initial mass function of lensing galaxies without any prior assumptions on the stellar mass.</description>

      <title>X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster: a direct comparison to observations</title>

Abstract: The TNG-Cluster magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations, produce a diverse population of X-ray cavities in the intracluster medium (ICM) of simulated galaxy clusters. These arise from episodic, high velocity, kinetic energy injections from the central active supermassive black hole (AGN, SMBH). Here, we present the first comprehensive comparative analysis of X-ray cavities in TNG-Cluster with observational data. First, we select a volume-limited sample of 35 real clusters ($z \leq 0.071$, M$_\text{500c}$ = 10$^{14-14.8}$ M$_\odot$) observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory, identify 3 analogs for each in TNG-Cluster (total of 105) and generate mock Chandra images using same exposure times as their observed counterparts. We identify X-ray cavities and measure their properties in both datasets using identical techniques, ensuring a direct, apples-to-apples comparison. Our analysis reveals that both samples have a similar fraction of X-ray cavities (35-43 per cent). They exhibit comparable sizes and morphologies, although the sizes of simulated X-ray cavities still attached to the SMBH are somewhat larger in TNG-Cluster -- a scarcity at $&lt; 10$ kpc. The area of TNG X-ray cavities increases as they rise in the ICM, consistent with the trend seen in the observational sample. The cavity powers, estimated using observational techniques, show good agreement between the two samples (10$^{42-45}$ erg.s$^{-1}$), suggesting that X-ray cavities in the simulation are an important heating mechanism in cluster cores. Overall, the rather simple AGN feedback model of TNG, with no model choices made to reproduce X-ray morphological features, and without cosmic rays, creates a quantitatively realistic population of X-ray cavities at cluster scales.</description>

      <title>The CatSouth Quasar Candidate Catalog for the Southern Sky and a Unified All-Sky Catalog Based on Gaia DR3</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gaia DR3 has provided a large sample of more than 6.6 million quasar candidates with high completeness but low purity. Previous work on the CatNorth quasar candidate catalog has shown that including external multiband data and applying machine-learning methods can efficiently purify the original Gaia DR3 quasar candidate catalog and improve the redshift estimates. In this paper, we extend the Gaia DR3 quasar candidate selection to the southern hemisphere using data from SkyMappper, CatWISE, and VISTA surveys. We train an XGBoost classifier on a unified set of high-confidence stars and spectroscopically confirmed quasars and galaxies. For sources with available Gaia BP/RP spectra, spectroscopic redshifts are derived using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (RegNet). We also train an ensemble photometric redshift estimation model based on XGBoost, TabNet, and FT-Transformer, achieving an RMSE of 0.2256 and a normalized median absolute deviation of 0.0187 on the validation set. By merging CatSouth with the previously published CatNorth catalog, we construct the unified all-sky CatGlobe catalog with nearly 1.9 million sources at $G&lt;21$, providing a comprehensive and high-purity quasar candidate sample for future spectroscopic and cosmological investigations.</description>

      <title>High frequency breaks in optical active galactic nuclei power spectral density</title>

Abstract: Context. Variability is a ubiquitous feature of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and the characterisation of the variability is crucial to constrain its physical mechanism and proper applications in AGN studies. The advent of all-sky and high-cadence optical surveys allows more accurate measurements of AGNs variability down to short timescales and direct comparisons with X-ray variability from the same sample of sources. Aims. We aim to analyse the optical power spectral density (PSDs) of AGNs with measured X-ray PSDs. Methods. We use light curves from the All-Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) and use the Lomb-Scargle periodogram to obtain PSDs. The joint optical PSD is measured over up to six orders of magnitude in frequency space from timescales of minutes to a decade. We fit either a damped random walk (DRW) or a broken power law (BPL) model to constrain the PSD model and break frequency. Results. We find a set of break frequencies ($\lesssim10^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$) from DRW and BPL fits that generally confirm previously reported correlations between break frequencies and the black hole mass. In addition, we find a second set of break frequencies at higher frequencies ($&gt;10^{-2}$ day$^{-1}$). We observe a potential weak correlation between the high-frequency breaks with the X-ray break frequencies and black hole mass. We further explore the dependence of the correlations on other AGN parameters, finding that adding either X-ray, optical, or bolometric luminosity as the third correlation parameter can substantially improve the correlation significances. The newly identified high-frequency optical breaks can constrain different aspects of the physics of active galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Mixed Warm Dark Matter Constraints using Milky Way Satellite Galaxy Counts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18917v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Warm dark matter has been strongly constrained in recent years as the sole component of dark matter. However, a less-explored alternative is that dark matter consists of a mixture of warm and cold dark matter (MWDM). In this work, we use observations of Milky Way satellite galaxies to constrain MWDM scenarios where the formation of small-scale structure is suppressed either by generic thermal relic warm dark matter or a sterile neutrino produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism. To achieve this, we model satellite galaxies by combining numerical simulations with semi-analytical models for the subhalo population, and use a galaxy--halo connection model to match galaxies onto dark matter subhalos. By comparing the number of satellites predicted by MWDM models to the observed satellite population from the Dark Energy Survey and Pan-STARRS1, we constrain the fraction of warm dark matter, $f_{\rm WDM}$, as a function of its mass, $m_{\rm WDM}$. We exclude dark matter being composed entirely of thermal relic warm dark matter with $m_{\rm WDM} \leq 6.6 $ keV at a posterior ratio of 10:1, consistent with previous works. However, we find that warm dark matter with smaller mass is allowed when mixed with cold dark matter, and that the $f_{\rm WDM}$ constraints strengthen with decreasing $m_{\rm WDM}$ until they plateau at $f_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 0.45 $ for $m_{\rm WDM} \lesssim 1.5$ keV. Likewise, in the case of a sterile neutrino with mass of 7 keV produced through the Shi-Fuller mechanism, we exclude a fraction of $f_{\nu_s} \lesssim 0.45$, independent of mixing angle. Our results extend constraints on MWDM to a region of parameter space that has been relatively unconstrained with previous analysis.</description>

      <title>Revealing EMRI/IMRI candidates with quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.12090v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The first detection of the quasiperiodic ultrafast outflow in the ASASSN-20qc system was reported by Pasham et al. (2024). The outflow is revealed in the soft X-ray spectra as an absorption feature, which is periodically enhanced every ~8.3 days. The periodic nature of the ultrafast outflow is best explained by an orbiting massive perturber, most likely an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH), that is inclined with respect to the accretion flow around the primary supermassive black hole (SMBH). In this way, the orbiting body pushes the disc gas into the outflow funnel, where it is accelerated by the ordered magnetic field (Sukova et al. 2021). Quasiperiodic ultrafast outflows (QPOuts) are thus a novel phenomenon that can help reveal new extreme-/intemediate-mass ratio inspiral (EMRI/IMRI) candidates that otherwise do not exhibit significant periodic patterns in the continuum flux density.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05265v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiative-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright ultraviolet (UV) flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>

      <title>The Nature of Gravitational Wave Events with Host Environment Escape Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11489v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method to probe the parameters and origin channels of gravitational wave events using the escape velocities of their host environments. This method could lead to more convergent posterior distributions offering additional insights into the physical properties, formation, and evolution of the sources. The method provides more accurate parameter estimation for events that represent previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario and is valuable for the search for such mergers with third-generation ground-based detectors. To demonstrate this approach, we take six recently identified events in LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, considered as potential previous mergers in hierarchical triple mergers, as examples. The use of escape velocities results in posterior spin distributions that are concentrated near zero, aligning with the expected birth spins of first-generation black holes formed from the collapse of stars. The uncertainty in the posterior primary mass distribution is significantly reduced comparing with the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA distributions, especially for events modeled under the assumption of a globular cluster origin scenario. We rule out the possibility that GW190512, GW170729, and GW190708 originates from globular clusters as previous mergers in the hierarchical triple merger scenario.</description>

Abstract: Relativistic jets originating at the center of AGN are embedded in extreme environments with strong magnetic fields and high particle densities, which makes them a fundamental tool for studying the physics of magnetized plasmas. We aim to investigate the magnetic field structure and the pc/sub-pc properties of the relativistic jet in the radio galaxy 3C111. Rotation Measure (RM) studies of nearby radio galaxies, such as this one, provide a valuable tool to investigate transversal magnetic field properties of the synchrotron emission. We model the brightness distribution of the source with multiple 2D Gaussian components to characterize individual emission features. After determining the core shift, we compute the spectral index maps for all the frequency pairs and find different distributions for the core region and the jet with an unusual optically thick/flat feature at 1-2 pc from the core. Using modelfit, we find a total of 56 components at different frequencies. By putting constraints on the size and position, we identify 22 components at different frequencies for which we compute the equipartition magnetic field. We compute the RM at two different triplets of frequencies. At 15.2-21.9-43.8 GHz, we discover high values of RM in the same region where the optically thick/flat feature was found. This can be associated with high electron density at 1-2 pc from the core that we interpreted as originating in a cloud of the clumpy torus. At 5-8.4-15.2 GHz, we find a distribution of the EVPAs and significant RM transverse gradient that provide strong evidence of a helical configuration of the magnetic field, as found in simulations.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): Enhanced multiplicity of early B-type dwarfs and giants at $Z=0.2\,{\rm Z}_\odot$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Early B-type stars ($M_i=8-15$ M$_\odot$) are frequently in multiple systems, as evidenced by spectroscopic campaigns in the Milky Way (MW) and the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Previous studies have shown no strong metallicity dependence in the close-binary (a&gt;10 au) fraction or orbital-period distributions between the MW's solar metallicity (Z$_\odot$) and that of the LMC (Z=0.5 Z$_\odot$). However, similar analyses in more metal-poor environments are still scarce. We focus on 309 early B-type stars (luminosity classes III-V) from the Binarity at LOw Metallicity campaign in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC, Z=0.2 Z$_\odot$) using VLT/FLAMES multi-epoch spectroscopy. By applying binary detection criteria consistent with previous works, we identify 153 stars (91 SB1, 59 SB2, 3 SB3) exhibiting significant radial-velocity (RV) variations, resulting in an observed multiplicity fraction of $f^{obs}_{mult}=50\pm3\%$. Using Monte Carlo simulations to account for observational biases, we infer an intrinsic close-binary fraction of $f_{mult}=80\pm8\%$. A Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis of the peak-to-peak RV distribution ($\Delta{\rm RV}_{\rm max}$) confirms a high multiplicity fraction of $f_{mult}=78\pm5\%$. These findings suggest a possible anti-correlation between metallicity and the fraction of close B-type binaries, with the SMC multiplicity fraction significantly exceeding previous measurements in the LMC and MW. The enhanced fraction of close binaries at SMC's low metallicity may have broad implications for massive-star evolution in the early Universe. More frequent mass transfer and envelope stripping could boost the production of exotic transients, stripped supernovae, gravitational-wave progenitors, and sustained UV ionising flux, potentially affecting cosmic reionisation. Theoretical predictions of binary evolution under metal-poor conditions will provide a key test of our results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.22566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Galactic evolution of copper remains poorly understood, partly due to the strong departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) affecting Cu I lines. A key source of uncertainty in non-LTE modelling is the treatment of inelastic Cu+H collisions. We present new rate coefficients based on a combined asymptotic LCAO and free electron model approach, which show significant differences from previous calculations. Applying these updated rates to non-LTE stellar modelling, we find reduced line-to-line scatter and improved consistency between metal-poor dwarfs and giants. Our non-LTE analysis reveals a strong upturn in the [Cu/Fe] trend towards lower [Fe/H] &lt; -1.7. We show that this may reflect the interplay between external enrichment of Cu-rich material of the Milky Way halo at low metallicities, and metallicity-dependent Cu yields from rapidly rotating massive stars. This highlights the unique diagnostic potential of accurate Cu abundances for understanding both stellar and Galactic evolution.</description>
