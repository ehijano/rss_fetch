      <title>Learning Bilateral Team Formation in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Team formation and the dynamics of team-based learning have drawn significant interest in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). However, existing studies primarily focus on unilateral groupings, predefined teams, or fixed-population settings, leaving the effects of algorithmic bilateral grouping choices in dynamic populations underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce a framework for learning two-sided team formation in dynamic multi-agent systems. Through this study, we gain insight into what algorithmic properties in bilateral team formation influence policy performance and generalization. We validate our approach using widely adopted multi-agent scenarios, demonstrating competitive performance and improved generalization in most scenarios.</description>

      <title>A Visualization Framework for Exploring Multi-Agent-Based Simulations Case Study of an Electric Vehicle Home Charging Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-agent-based simulations (MABS) of electric vehicle (EV) home charging ecosystems generate large, complex, and stochastic time-series datasets that capture interactions between households, grid infrastructure, and energy markets. These interactions can lead to unexpected system-level events, such as transformer overloads or consumer dissatisfaction, that are difficult to detect and explain through static post-processing. This paper presents a modular, Python-based dashboard framework, built using Dash by Plotly, that enables efficient, multi-level exploration and root-cause analysis of emergent behavior in MABS outputs. The system features three coordinated views (System Overview, System Analysis, and Consumer Analysis), each offering high-resolution visualizations such as time-series plots, spatial heatmaps, and agent-specific drill-down tools. A case study simulating full EV adoption with smart charging in a Danish residential network demonstrates how the dashboard supports rapid identification and contextual explanation of anomalies, including clustered transformer overloads and time-dependent charging failures. The framework facilitates actionable insight generation for researchers and distribution system operators, and its architecture is adaptable to other distributed energy resources and complex energy systems.</description>

      <title>On the $h$-majority dynamics with many opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20218v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first upper bound on the convergence time to consensus of the well-known $h$-majority dynamics with $k$ opinions, in the synchronous setting, for $h$ and $k$ that are both non-constant values.
  We suppose that, at the beginning of the process, there is some initial additive bias towards some plurality opinion, that is, there is an opinion that is supported by $x$ nodes while any other opinion is supported by strictly fewer nodes.
  We prove that, with high probability, if the bias is $\omega(\sqrt{x})$ and the initial plurality opinion is supported by at least $x = \omega(\log n)$ nodes, then the process converges to plurality consensus in $O(\log n)$ rounds whenever $h = \omega(n \log n / x)$.
  A main corollary is the following: if $k = o(n / \log n)$ and the process starts from an almost-balanced configuration with an initial bias of magnitude $\omega(\sqrt{n/k})$ towards the initial plurality opinion, then any function $h = \omega(k \log n)$ suffices to guarantee convergence to consensus in $O(\log n)$ rounds, with high probability.
  Our upper bound shows that the lower bound of $\Omega(k / h^2)$ rounds to reach consensus given by Becchetti et al.\ (2017) cannot be pushed further than $\widetilde{\Omega}(k / h)$.
  Moreover, the bias we require is asymptotically smaller than the $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ bias that guarantees plurality consensus in the $3$-majority dynamics: in our case, the required bias is at most any (arbitrarily small) function in $\omega(\sqrt{x})$ for any value of $k \ge 2$.</description>

      <title>Language Modeling by Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model (LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation), generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach; new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective autonomous discovery systems.</description>

      <title>Argumentative Ensembling for Robust Recourse under Model Multiplicity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In machine learning, it is common to obtain multiple equally performing models for the same prediction task, e.g., when training neural networks with different random seeds. Model multiplicity (MM) is the situation which arises when these competing models differ in their predictions for the same input, for which ensembling is often employed to determine an aggregation of the outputs. Providing recourse recommendations via counterfactual explanations (CEs) under MM thus becomes complex, since the CE may not be valid across all models, i.e., the CEs are not robust under MM. In this work, we formalise the problem of providing recourse under MM, which we name recourse-aware ensembling (RAE). We propose the idea that under MM, CEs for each individual model should be considered alongside their predictions so that the aggregated prediction and recourse are decided in tandem. Centred around this intuition, we introduce six desirable properties for solutions to this problem. For solving RAE, we propose a novel argumentative ensembling method which guarantees the robustness of CEs under MM. Specifically, our method leverages computational argumentation to explicitly represent the conflicts between models and counterfactuals regarding prediction results and CE validity. It then uses argumentation semantics to resolve the conflicts and obtain the final solution, in a manner which is parametric to the chosen semantics. Our method also allows for the specification of preferences over the models under MM, allowing further customisation of the ensemble. In a comprehensive theoretical analysis, we characterise the behaviour of argumentative ensembling with four different argumentation semantics. We then empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in satisfying desirable properties with eight instantiations of our method. (Abstract is shortened for arXiv.)</description>

      <title>SV-LLM: An Agentic Approach for SoC Security Verification using Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20415v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that showcase its applicability and efficacy.</description>

      <title>An Agentic System for Rare Disease Diagnosis with Traceable Reasoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare diseases collectively affect over 300 million individuals worldwide, yet timely and accurate diagnosis remains a pervasive challenge. This is largely due to their clinical heterogeneity, low individual prevalence, and the limited familiarity most clinicians have with rare conditions. Here, we introduce DeepRare, the first rare disease diagnosis agentic system powered by a large language model (LLM), capable of processing heterogeneous clinical inputs. The system generates ranked diagnostic hypotheses for rare diseases, each accompanied by a transparent chain of reasoning that links intermediate analytic steps to verifiable medical evidence.
  DeepRare comprises three key components: a central host with a long-term memory module; specialized agent servers responsible for domain-specific analytical tasks integrating over 40 specialized tools and web-scale, up-to-date medical knowledge sources, ensuring access to the most current clinical information. This modular and scalable design enables complex diagnostic reasoning while maintaining traceability and adaptability. We evaluate DeepRare on eight datasets. The system demonstrates exceptional diagnostic performance among 2,919 diseases, achieving 100% accuracy for 1013 diseases. In HPO-based evaluations, DeepRare significantly outperforms other 15 methods, like traditional bioinformatics diagnostic tools, LLMs, and other agentic systems, achieving an average Recall@1 score of 57.18% and surpassing the second-best method (Reasoning LLM) by a substantial margin of 23.79 percentage points. For multi-modal input scenarios, DeepRare achieves 70.60% at Recall@1 compared to Exomiser's 53.20% in 109 cases. Manual verification of reasoning chains by clinical experts achieves 95.40% agreements. Furthermore, the DeepRare system has been implemented as a user-friendly web application http://raredx.cn/doctor.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Highly Oscillating Opinions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Opinion Dynamics (OD) models are a particular case of Agent-Based Models in which the evolution of opinions within a population is studied. In most OD models, opinions evolve as a consequence of interactions between agents, and the opinion fusion rule defines how those opinions are updated. In consequence, despite being simplistic, OD models provide an explainable and interpretable mechanism for understanding the underlying dynamics of opinion evolution. Unfortunately, existing OD models mainly focus on explaining the evolution of (usually synthetic) opinions towards consensus, fragmentation, or polarization, but they usually fail to analyze scenarios of (real-world) highly oscillating opinions. This work overcomes this limitation by studying the ability of several OD models to reproduce highly oscillating dynamics. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem which is further solved using Evolutionary Algorithms, providing both quantitative results on the performance of the optimization and qualitative interpretations on the obtained results. Our experiments on a real-world opinion dataset about immigration from the monthly barometer of the Spanish Sociological Research Center show that the ATBCR, based on both rational and emotional mechanisms of opinion update, is the most accurate OD model for capturing highly oscillating opinions.</description>

      <title>Task Allocation of UAVs for Monitoring Missions via Hardware-in-the-Loop Simulation and Experimental Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study addresses the optimisation of task allocation for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) within industrial monitoring missions. The proposed methodology integrates a Genetic Algorithms (GA) with a 2-Opt local search technique to obtain a high-quality solution. Our approach was experimentally validated in an industrial zone to demonstrate its efficacy in real-world scenarios. Also, a Hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulator for the UAVs team is introduced. Moreover, insights about the correlation between the theoretical cost function and the actual battery consumption and time of flight are deeply analysed. Results show that the considered costs for the optimisation part of the problem closely correlate with real-world data, confirming the practicality of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>The Decrypto Benchmark for Multi-Agent Reasoning and Theory of Mind</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) gain agentic abilities, they will have to navigate complex multi-agent scenarios, interacting with human users and other agents in cooperative and competitive settings. This will require new reasoning skills, chief amongst them being theory of mind (ToM), or the ability to reason about the "mental" states of other agents. However, ToM and other multi-agent abilities in LLMs are poorly understood, since existing benchmarks suffer from narrow scope, data leakage, saturation, and lack of interactivity. We thus propose Decrypto, a game-based benchmark for multi-agent reasoning and ToM drawing inspiration from cognitive science, computational pragmatics and multi-agent reinforcement learning. It is designed to be as easy as possible in all other dimensions, eliminating confounding factors commonly found in other benchmarks. To our knowledge, it is also the first platform for designing interactive ToM experiments.
  We validate the benchmark design through comprehensive empirical evaluations of frontier LLMs, robustness studies, and human-AI cross-play experiments. We find that LLM game-playing abilities lag behind humans and simple word-embedding baselines. We then create variants of two classic cognitive science experiments within Decrypto to evaluate three key ToM abilities. Surprisingly, we find that state-of-the-art reasoning models are significantly worse at those tasks than their older counterparts. This demonstrates that Decrypto addresses a crucial gap in current reasoning and ToM evaluations, and paves the path towards better artificial agents.</description>
