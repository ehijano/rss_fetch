      <title>Logarithmic uncertainty principle for Clifford-wavelet transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle constitutes one of the famous physical concepts which continues to attract researchers from different related fields since its discovery due to its utility in many applications. Among the classical (Fourier-based) forms, modified variants such as wavelet-based and logarithmic versions have been investigated by researchers. In the present work we are concerned with the development of a new logarithmic uncertainty principle combining both wavelets and logarithmic variants in the Clifford wavelet transform framework.</description>

      <title>Structures associated with the Borromean rings complement in the Poincar\'e ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Guided by physical needs, we deal with the rotationally isotropic Poincar\'e ball, when considering the complement of Borromean rings embedded in it. We consistently describe the geometry of the complement and realize the fundamental group as isometry subgroup in three dimensions. Applying this realization, we reveal normal stochastization and multifractal behavior within the examined model of directed random walks on the rooted Cayley tree, whose graphs are associated with dendritic polymers. According to Penner, we construct the Teichm\"uller space of the decorated ideal octahedral surface related to the quotient space of the fundamental group action. Using the conformality of decoration, we define six moduli and the mapping class group generated by cyclic permutations of the ideal vertices. Intending to quantize the geometric area, we state the connection between the induced geometry and the sine-Gordon model. Due to such a correspondence we obtain the differential two-form in the cotangent bundle.</description>

      <title>Computing some Principal Value integrals without Residues and Applications on Hilbert Transform and Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article proposes a new approach in the treatment of the Hilbert transform and some cases of the Fourier transform whose improper integrals are principal values. This approach may be useful for teaching these issues to undergraduate engineering students. Traditional literature of Complex Analysis deals with these transformation integrals with the Cauchy-Goursat theorem and the residues calculation technique. In this new approach, instead of residues, we use an intuitive result about complex line integrals of continuous complex functions that resembles the delta of Dirac.</description>

      <title>Quantum Flux and Quantum Ergodicity for Cross Sections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For sequences of quantum ergodic eigenfunctions, we define the quantum flux norm associated to a codimension $1$ submanifold $\Sigma$ of a non-degenerate energy surface. We prove restrictions of eigenfunctions to $\Sigma$, realized using the quantum flux norm, are quantum ergodic. We compare this result to known results from \cite{CTZ} in the case of Euclidean domains and hyperfurfaces. As a further application, we consider complexified analytic eigenfunctions and prove a second microlocal analogue of \cite{CTZ} in that context.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Limiting Minimizers for a Family of Interaction Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two parameter family of energy minimization problems for interaction energies $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ with attractive-repulsive potential $W_{\alpha,\beta}$. We develop a concavity principle, which allows us to provide a lower bound on $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ if there exist $\beta_0&lt;\beta&lt;\beta_1$ with minimizers of $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta_0}$ and $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta_1}$ known. In addition to this, we also derive new conclusions about the limiting behaviour of $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ for $\beta\approx 2.$ Finally, we describe a method to show that, for certain values of $(\alpha,\beta),$ $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ cannot be minimized by the uniform distribution over a top-dimensional regular unit simplex. Our results are made possible by two key factors -- recent progress in identifying minimizers of $\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ for a range of $\alpha$ and $\beta$, and an analysis of $\inf\mathcal{E}_{\alpha,\beta}$ as a function on parameter space.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic formulation of vacuum energy density in flat spacetime and potential implications for the cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a thermodynamical definition of the vacuum energy density $\rho_{\rm vac}$, defined as $\langle 0| T_{\mu\nu} |0\rangle = - \rho_{\rm vac} \, g_{\mu\nu}$, in quantum field theory in flat Minkowski space in $D$ spacetime dimensions, which can be computed in the limit of high temperature, namely in the limit $\beta = 1/T \to 0$. It takes the form $\rho_{\rm vac} = {\rm const} \cdot m^D$ where $m$ is a fundamental mass scale and ${\rm "const"}$ is a computable constant which can be positive or negative. Due to modular invariance $\rho_{\rm vac}$ can also be computed in a different non-thermodynamic channel where one spatial dimension is compactifed on a circle of circumference $\beta$ and we confirm this modularity for free massive theories for both bosons and fermions for $D=2,3,4$. We list various properties of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ that are generally required, for instance $\rho_{\rm vac}=0$ for conformal field theories, and others, such as the constraint that $\rho_{\rm vac}$ has opposite signs for free bosons verses fermions of the same mass, which is related to constraints from supersymmetry. Using the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz we compute $\rho_{\rm vac}$ exactly for 2 classes of integrable QFT's in $2D$ and interpreting some previously known results. We apply our definition of $\rho_{\rm vac}$ to Lattice QCD data with two light quarks (up and down) and one additional massive flavor (the strange quark), and find it is negative, $\rho_{\rm vac} \approx - ( 200 \, {\rm MeV} )^4$. Finally we make some remarks on the Cosmological Constant Problem since $\rho_{\rm vac}$ is central to any discussion of it.</description>

      <title>Generalized Grothendieck's simultaneous resolution and associated varieties of simple affine vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The closure of a Diximier sheet is the image of a generalized Grothendieck's simultaneous resolution. We show that the associated variety of simple affine vertex algebras is contained in the closure of the Diximier sheet when a chiralization of generalized Grothendieck's simultaneous resolution exists. This generalizes in a conceptual manner the results obtained by the first named author and Anne Moreau and, in particular, allows to extend them to the types A_2, C_n, E_6, E_7.</description>

      <title>Balian-Bloch Wave Invariants for Nearly Degenerate Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is part I of a series in which we aim to show that the singular support of the wave trace and the length spectrum of a smooth, strictly convex, and bounded planar billiard table are generally distinct objects. We derive an asymptotic trace formula for the regularized resolvent which is dual to the wave trace and contains the same information. To do this, we consider a class of periodic orbits which have nearly degenerate Poincar\'e maps and study their leading order behavior as the deformation parameter goes to zero, generating large coefficients in the wave trace. We also keep careful track of the Maslov indices, which will allow us to match contributions of opposite signs in our subsequent paper. Each cancellation of coefficients in the resolvent trace corresponds to making the wave trace one degree smoother. The resolvent based approach is due to Balian and Bloch and was significantly expanded upon by Zelditch in a foundational series of papers [Zel09], [Zel04a], [Zel04c] and [Zel00].</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Cloaking Electric and Hydrodynamic Fields via Electro-osmosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a general mathematical framework for the electro-osmosis problem to design simultaneous microscale electric and hydrodynamic cloaking in a Hele-Shaw configuration. A novel approach to achieving simultaneously cloaking both the electric and flow fields through a combination of scattering-cancellation technology and an electro-osmosis effect is proposed. In the design, the electric field is manipulated with scattering-cancellation technology while the pressure with electro-osmosis effect. As proof of this concept, the perfect electric and hydrodynamic cloaking conditions are derived for the cloaks with the cross-sectional shape being annulus or confocal ellipses using the layer potential techniques. Furthermore, we also propose an optimization scheme for the design of approximate cloaks within general geometries and prove the well-posedness of the optimization problem. In particular, the conditions that can ensure the simultaneous occurrence of approximate cloaks for general geometries are also established. Our theoretical findings are validated by a variety of numerical results and guide efficiently designing electric-related multiphysics cloaking.</description>

      <title>Legendre Transformation under Micro Canonical Ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Legendre transformation is a crucial tool in theoretical physics, known for its symmetry, especially when applied to multivariate functions. In statistical mechanics, ensembles represent the central focus. Leveraging the dimensionless aspect of Legendre transformation, this paper explores the transformation process from the entropy characteristic function of microcanonical ensembles to the analogous definition of partition function transformation. Additionally, it derives characteristic functions, partition functions, and establishes their interrelations, along with deriving corresponding thermodynamic formulas for various ensembles. This streamlined approach sheds light on the fundamental principles of statistical mechanics and underscores the symmetry inherent in Legendre transformation.</description>

      <title>Branching Brownian motion versus Random Energy Model in the supercritical phase: overlap distribution and temperature susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In comparison with Derrida's REM, we investigate the influence of the so-called decoration processes arising in the limiting extremal processes of numerous log-correlated Gaussian fields. In particular, we focus on the branching Brownian motion and two specific quantities from statistical physics in the vicinity of the critical temperature. The first one is the two-temperature overlap, whose behavior at criticality is smoothened by the decoration process - unlike the one-temperature overlap which is identical - and the second one is the temperature susceptibility, as introduced by Sales and Bouchaud, which is strictly larger in the presence of decorations and diverges, close to the critical temperature, at the same speed as for the REM but with a different multiplicative constant. We also study some general decorated cases in order to highlight the fact that the BBM has a critical behavior in some sense to be made precise.</description>

      <title>Real moments of the logarithmic derivative of characteristic polynomials in random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.02153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.02153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove asymptotics for real moments of the logarithmic derivative of characteristic polynomials evaluated at $1-\frac{a}{N}$ in unitary, even orthogonal, and symplectic ensembles, where $a&gt;0$ and $a=o(1)$ as the size $N$ of the matrix goes to infinity. Previously, such asymptotics were known only for integer moments (in the unitary ensemble by the work of Bailey, Bettin, Blower, Conrey, Prokhorov, Rubinstein and Snaith, and in orthogonal and symplectic ensembles by the work of Alvarez and Snaith), except that in the odd orthogonal ensemble real moments asymptotics were obtained by Alvarez, Bousseyroux and Snaith. Our proof is new and does not make use of the aforementioned integer moments results, and is different from the method in the work of Alvarez et al for the odd orthogonal ensemble.</description>

      <title>The Bayes Principle and Segal Axioms for $P(\phi)_2$, with application to Periodic Covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The goal of the present paper is to reconcile the so-called $P(\phi)_2$ model from classical constructive quantum field theory (CQFT) with (metric version of) geometric and categorical axioms proposed by G. Segal (see refs in Kontsevich and Segal arXiv:2105.10161) in the 90's, in showing that the $P(\phi)_2$ model satisfies these axioms, appropriately adjusted. The approach is based on previous works of Dimock arXiv:math-ph/0305017 and Pickrell arXiv:math-ph/0702077, while we give a new proof to a key step using what we call ``the Bayes principle'' of conditional probabilities in the infinite dimensional setting. We also give a precise statement and full proof of the locality of the $P(\phi)_2$ interaction. After that, we note that the so-called ``transfer operator'' associated to a cobordism has strictly positive kernel, this implies the operator has a spectral gap and allows to define a $P(\phi)_2$ Gibbs state on non-compact periodic curved surfaces (namely, with discrete ``time translations'') by analogy with 1-dimensional spin chains. This also implies asymptotic properties of the $P(\phi)_2$ partition function on periodic covers of large degrees.</description>

      <title>Anyon exclusions statistics on surfaces with gapped boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:1809.02604v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An anyon exclusion statistics, which generalizes the Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics of bosons and fermions, was proposed by Haldane[1]. The relevant past studies had considered only anyon systems without any physical boundary but boundaries often appear in real-life materials. When fusion of anyons is involved, certain `pseudo-species' anyons appear in the exotic statistical weights of non-Abelian anyon systems; however, the meaning and significance of pseudo-species remains an open problem. In this paper, we propose an extended anyon exclusion statistics on surfaces with gapped boundaries, introducing mutual exclusion statistics between anyons as well as the boundary components. Motivated by Refs. [2, 3], we present a formula for the statistical weight of many-anyon states obeying the proposed statistics. We develop a systematic basis construction for non-Abelian anyons on any Riemann surfaces with gapped boundaries. From the basis construction, we have a standard way to read off a canonical set of statistics parameters and hence write down the extended statistical weight of the anyon system being studied. The basis construction reveals the meaning of pseudo-species. A pseudo-species has different `excitation' modes, each corresponding to an anyon species. The `excitation' modes of pseudo-species corresponds to good quantum numbers of subsystems of a non-Abelian anyon system. This is important because often (e.g., in topological quantum computing) we may be concerned about only the entanglement between such subsystems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.16655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop new techniques to compute the weighted $L^2$-cohomology of quasi-fibered boundary metrics (QFB-metrics). Combined with the decay of $L^2$-harmonic forms obtained in a companion paper, this allows us to compute the reduced $L^2$-cohomology for various classes of QFB-metrics. Our results applies in particular to the Nakajima metric on the Hilbert scheme of $n$ points on $\mathbb{C}^2$, for which we can show that the Vafa-Witten conjecture holds. Using the compactification of the monopole moduli space announced by Fritzsch, the first author and Singer, we can also give a proof of the Sen conjecture for the monopole moduli space of magnetic charge 3.</description>

      <title>The Dirac equation across the horizons of the 5D Myers-Perry geometry : Separation of variables, radial asymptotic behaviour and Hamiltonian formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.09181v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analytically extend the 5D Myers-Perry metric through the event and Cauchy horizons by defining Eddington-Finkelstein-type coordinates. Then, we use the orthonormal frame formalism to formulate and perform separation of variables on the massive Dirac equation, and analyse the asymptotic behaviour at the horizons and at infinity of the solutions to the radial ordinary differential equation (ODE) thus obtained. Using the essential self-adjointness result of Finster and R\"oken and Stone's formula, we obtain an integral spectral representation of the Dirac propagator for spinors with low masses and suitably bounded frequency spectra in terms of resolvents of the Dirac Hamiltonian, which can in turn be expressed in terms of Green's functions of the radial ODE.</description>

      <title>Global Hyperbolicity through the Eyes of the Null Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.15610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.15610v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: No Hopf-Rinow Theorem is possible in Lorentzian Geometry. Nonetheless, we prove that a spacetime is globally hyperbolic if and only if it is metrically complete with respect to the null distance of a time function. Our approach is based on the observation that null distances behave particularly well for weak temporal functions in terms of regularity and causality. Specifically, we also show that the null distances of Cauchy temporal functions and regular cosmological time functions encode causality globally.</description>

      <title>Existence of a tricritical point for the Blume-Capel model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.13394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.13394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the existence of a tricritical point for the Blume-Capel model on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ for every $d\geq 2$. The proof in $d\geq 3$ relies on a novel combinatorial mapping to an Ising model on a larger graph, the techniques of Aizenman, Duminil-Copin, and Sidoravicious (Comm. Math. Phys, 2015), and the celebrated infrared bound. In $d=2$, the proof relies on a quantitative analysis of crossing probabilities of the dilute random cluster representation of the Blume-Capel. In particular, we develop a quadrichotomy result in the spirit of Duminil-Copin and Tassion (Moscow Math. J., 2020), which allows us to obtain a fine picture of the phase diagram in $d=2$, including asymptotic behaviour of correlations in all regions. Finally, we show that the techniques used to establish subcritical sharpness for the dilute random cluster model extend to any $d\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>From logarithmic delocalization of the six-vertex height function under sloped boundary conditions to weakened crossing probability estimates for the Ashkin-Teller, generalized random-cluster, and $(q_{\sigma},q_{\tau})$-cubic models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.14934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.14934v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To obtain Russo-Seymour-Welsh estimates for the height function of the six-vertex model under sloped boundary conditions, which can be leveraged to demonstrate that the height function logarithmically delocalizes under a broader class of boundary conditions, we formulate crossing probability estimates in strips of the square lattice and the cylinder, for parameters satisfying $a\equiv b$, $c \in [1,2]$, and $\mathrm{max} \{ a , b \} \leq c$, in which each of the first two conditions respectively relate to invariance under vertical and diagonal reflections enforced through the symmetry $\sigma \xi \geq -\xi$ for domains in strips of the square lattice, and satisfaction of FKG, for the height function and for its absolute value. To determine whether arguments for estimating crossing probabilities of the height function for flat boundary conditions from a recent work due to Duminil-Copin, Karila, Manolescu, and Oulamara remain applicable for sloped boundary conditions, from the set of possible slopes given by the interior of the set of rational points from $[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$, we analyze sloped Gibbs states, which do not have infinitely many disjointly oriented circuits. In comparison to Russo-Seymour-Welsh arguments for flat boundary conditions, arguments for sloped boundary conditions present additional complications for both planar and cylindrical settings, in which crossing events that are considered in the strip, and then extended to the annulus and cylinder, must be maintained across rectangles of large aspect ratio, in spite of the fact that some proportion of faces within the strip freeze with positive probability.</description>

      <title>Spin-$s$ Rational $Q$-system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07640v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bethe ansatz equations for spin-$s$ Heisenberg spin chain with $s\ge1$ are significantly more difficult to analyze than the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ case, due to the presence of repeated roots. As a result, it is challenging to derive extra conditions for the Bethe roots to be physical and study the related completeness problem. In this paper, we propose the rational $Q$-system for the XXX$_s$ spin chain. Solutions of the proposed $Q$-system give all and only physical solutions of the Bethe ansatz equations required by completeness. This is checked numerically and proved rigorously. The rational $Q$-system is equivalent to the requirement that the solution and the corresponding dual solution of the $TQ$-relation are both polynomials, which we prove rigorously. Based on this analysis, we propose the extra conditions for solutions of the XXX$_s$ Bethe ansatz equations to be physical.</description>

      <title>Weyl asymptotics for functional difference operators with power to quadratic exponential potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.06281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We continue the program first initiated in [Geom. Funct. Anal. 26, 288-305 (2016)] and develop a modification of the technique introduced in that paper to study the spectral asymptotics, namely the Riesz means and eigenvalue counting functions, of functional difference operators $\smash{H_0 = \mathcal F^{-1} M_{\cosh(\xi)} \mathcal F}$ with potentials of the form $\smash{W(x) = \lvert{x\rvert}^pe^{\lvert{x\rvert}^\beta}}$ for either $\beta = 0$ and $p &gt; 0$ or $\beta \in (0, 2]$ and $p \geq 0$. We provide a new method for studying general potentials which includes the potentials studied in [Geom. Funct. Anal. 26, 288-305 (2016)] and [J. Math. Phys. 60, 103505 (2019)]. The proof involves dilating the variance of the gaussian defining the coherent state transform in a controlled manner preserving the expected asymptotics.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathcal E$ be a complex elliptic curve and $S$ be a non-empty finite subset of $\mathcal E$. We show that the functions $\tilde\Gamma$ introduced in arXiv:1712.07089 out of string theory motivations give rise to a basis of the minimal algebra $A_{\mathcal E\smallsetminus S}$ of holomorphic multivalued functions on $\mathcal E\smallsetminus S$ which is stable under integration, introduced in arXiv:2212.03119; this basis is alternative to the basis of $A_{\mathcal E\smallsetminus S}$ constructed in loc. cit. using elliptic analogues of the hyperlogarithm functions.</description>

      <title>Poincar\'{e} symmetries and representations in pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16805v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores quantum field theories with pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians, where PT-symmetric Hamiltonians serve as a special case. In specific regimes, these pseudo-Hermitian Hamiltonians have real eigenspectra, orthogonal eigenstates, and unitary time evolution. So far, most pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories have been constructed using analytic continuation or by adding non-Hermitian terms to otherwise Hermitian Hamiltonians. However, in this paper, we take a different approach. We construct pseudo-Hermitian scalar and fermionic quantum field theories from first principles by extending the Poincar\'e algebra to include non-Hermitian generators. This allows us to develop consistent pseudo-Hermitian quantum field theories, with Lagrangian densities that transform appropriately under the proper Poincar\'e group. By doing so, we establish a more solid theoretical foundation for the emerging field of non-Hermitian quantum field theory.</description>

      <title>On the superadditive pressure for 1-typical, one-step, matrix-cocycle potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.16694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.16694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(\Sigma_T,\sigma)$ be a subshift of finite type with primitive adjacency matrix $T$, $\psi:\Sigma_T \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ a H\"older continuous potential, and $\mathcal{A}:\Sigma_T \rightarrow \mathrm{GL}_d(\mathbb{R})$ a 1-typical, one-step cocycle. For $t \in \mathbb{R}$ consider the sequences of potentials $\Phi_t=(\varphi_{t,n})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ defined by $$\varphi_{t,n}(x):=S_n \psi(x) + t\log \|\mathcal{A}^n(x)\|, \: \forall n \in \mathbb{N}.$$ Using the family of transfer operators defined in this setting by Park and Piraino, for all $t&lt;0$ sufficiently close to 0 we prove the existence of Gibbs-type measures for the superadditive sequences of potentials $\Phi_t$. This extends the results of the well-understood subadditive case where $t \geq 0$. Prior to this, Gibbs-type measures were only known to exist for $t&lt;0$ in the conformal, the reducible, the positive, or the dominated, planar settings, in which case they are Gibbs measures in the classical sense. We further prove that the topological pressure function $t \mapsto P_{\mathrm{top}}(\Phi_t,\sigma)$ is analytic in an open neighbourhood of 0 and has derivative given by the Lyapunov exponents of these Gibbs-type measures.</description>

      <title>The analysis of vertex feedback stabilisability of a star-shaped network of fluid-conveying pipes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.09722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is an outstanding problem whether a pipe-flow system on a star-shaped network is stabilisable by a feedback control on the common vertex. In the present paper we deal with this problem. In particular, we study the equation governing the small vibrations of a stretched elastic pipe conveying fluid in a star-shaped network and examine the question of vertex feedback stabilisability of such a system via control moments. Finding an answer to the question is not straightforward, for the system operator associated with the corresponding closed-loop system is unbounded and nonselfadjoint. An approach to the study of the stabilisation problem for the closed-loop system is presented based on the spectral approach previously introduced by the authors for star graphs of stretched elastic beams. When the tension in the pipes is greater than the square of the fluid-flow velocity, we establish a positive result that in fact gives the strong property of uniform exponential stability of the closed-loop system.</description>

      <title>$\mathcal{O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly in Brans-Dicke gravity with trace-carrying matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact static spherisymmetric solution for the Brans-Dicke action sourced by a self-gravitating massless Klein-Gordon helicity-0 field. In contrast to the Maxwell electromagnetic field, a Klein-Gordon field possesses an energy-momentum tensor with $\textit{non-vanishing trace}$. Upon a Weyl mapping into the Einstein frame, the transformed Brans-Dicke scalar field takes on the role of a "dilaton" coupled with the Klein-Gordon field. Despite this dilatonic coupling, the field equations of the resulting Einstein-Klein-Gordon-dilaton action are fully soluble when employing the harmonic radial coordinate. The exact solution derived herein can serve as a prototype for future Brans-Dicke gravity studies involving trace-carrying matter fields. Notably, in the limit of infinite $\omega$, the Brans-Dicke scalar field exhibits an anomalous behavior of ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ as opposed to ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$. As a consequence, the solution converges to a spacetime configuration of General Relativity sourced by the original Klein-Gordon field and a free scalar field, the latter of which is the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ "remnant" of the Brans-Dicke scalar field. Furthermore, we provide a formal mathematical proof substantiating these two conclusions. Although the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly has been previously discovered for Brans-Dicke vacuum and Brans-Dicke-Maxwell electrovacuum, our findings establish its prevalence in Brans-Dicke gravity $\textit{regardless}$ of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor of the source. Taken together, the ${\cal O}\,(1/\sqrt\omega)$ anomaly challenges the conventional belief in the ${\cal O}\,(1/\omega)$ signature commonly associated with Brans-Dicke gravity. In particular, it may have implications in improving the relativistic corrections to Newtonian gravity beyond the weak-field parametrized post-Newtonian formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We work toward the arithmetic quantum unique ergodicity (AQUE) conjecture for sequences of Hecke--Maass forms on hyperbolic $4$-manifolds. We show that limits of such forms can only scar on totally geodesic $3$-submanifolds, and in fact that all ergodic components of the microlocal lift other than the uniform measure arise from the uniform measures on these submanifolds.</description>

      <title>Braiding Fibonacci anyons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fibonacci anyons provide the simplest possible model of non-Abelian fusion rules: [1] x [1] = [0] + [1]. We propose a conformal field theory construction of topological quantum registers based on Fibonacci anyons realized as quasiparticle excitations in the Z_3 parafermion fractional quantum Hall state. To this end, the results of Ardonne and Schoutens for the correlation function of n = 4 Fibonacci fields are extended to the case of arbitrary n (and 3 r electrons). Special attention is paid to the braiding properties of the obtained correlators. We explain in details the construction of a monodromy representation of the Artin braid group acting on n-point conformal blocks of Fibonacci anyons. For low n (up to n = 8), the matrices of braid group generators are displayed explicitly. A simple recursion formula makes it possible to extend without efforts the construction to any n. Finally, we construct N qubit computational spaces in terms of conformal blocks of 2N + 2 Fibonacci anyons.</description>
