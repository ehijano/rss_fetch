      <title>A novel application of Shapley values for large multidimensional time-series data: Applying explainable AI to a DNA profile classification neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of Shapley values to high-dimensional, time-series-like data is computationally challenging - and sometimes impossible. For $N$ inputs the problem is $2^N$ hard. In image processing, clusters of pixels, referred to as superpixels, are used to streamline computations. This research presents an efficient solution for time-seres-like data that adapts the idea of superpixels for Shapley value computation. Motivated by a forensic DNA classification example, the method is applied to multivariate time-series-like data whose features have been classified by a convolutional neural network (CNN). In DNA processing, it is important to identify alleles from the background noise created by DNA extraction and processing. A single DNA profile has $31,200$ scan points to classify, and the classification decisions must be defensible in a court of law. This means that classification is routinely performed by human readers - a monumental and time consuming process. The application of a CNN with fast computation of meaningful Shapley values provides a potential alternative to the classification. This research demonstrates the realistic, accurate and fast computation of Shapley values for this massive task</description>

      <title>TemporalPaD: a reinforcement-learning framework for temporal feature representation and dimension reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in feature representation and dimension reduction have highlighted their crucial role in enhancing the efficacy of predictive modeling. This work introduces TemporalPaD, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework designed for temporal pattern datasets. TemporalPaD integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with neural networks to achieve concurrent feature representation and feature reduction. The framework consists of three cooperative modules: a Policy Module, a Representation Module, and a Classification Module, structured based on the Actor-Critic (AC) framework. The Policy Module, responsible for dimensionality reduction through RL, functions as the actor, while the Representation Module for feature extraction and the Classification Module collectively serve as the critic. We comprehensively evaluate TemporalPaD using 29 UCI datasets, a well-known benchmark for validating feature reduction algorithms, through 10 independent tests and 10-fold cross-validation. Additionally, given that TemporalPaD is specifically designed for time series data, we apply it to a real-world DNA classification problem involving enhancer category and enhancer strength. The results demonstrate that TemporalPaD is an efficient and effective framework for achieving feature reduction, applicable to both structured data and sequence datasets. The source code of the proposed TemporalPaD is freely available as supplementary material to this article and at http://www.healthinformaticslab.org/supp/.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Rearrangement is Fixed-Parameter Tractable in the Single Cut-and-Join Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01942v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Genome rearrangement is a common model for molecular evolution. In this paper, we consider the Pairwise Rearrangement problem, which takes as input two genomes and asks for the number of minimum-length sequences of permissible operations transforming the first genome into the second. In the Single Cut-and-Join model (Bergeron, Medvedev, &amp; Stoye, J. Comput. Biol. 2010), Pairwise Rearrangement is $\#\textsf{P}$-complete (Bailey, et. al., COCOON 2023), which implies that exact sampling is intractable. In order to cope with this intractability, we investigate the parameterized complexity of this problem. We exhibit a fixed-parameter tractable algorithm with respect to the number of components in the adjacency graph that are not cycles of length $2$ or paths of length $1$. As a consequence, we obtain that Pairwise Rearrangement in the Single Cut-and-Join model is fixed-parameter tractable by distance. Our results suggest that the number of nontrivial components in the adjacency graph serves as the key obstacle for efficient sampling.</description>
