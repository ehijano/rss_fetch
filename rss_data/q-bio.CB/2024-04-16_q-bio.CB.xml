      <title>Modelling adhesion in stochastic and mean-field models of cell migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adhesion between cells plays an important role in many biological processes such as tissue morphogenesis and homeostasis, wound healing and cancer cell metastasis. From a mathematical perspective, adhesion between multiple cell types has been previously analysed using discrete and continuum models including the Cellular Potts models and partial differential equations (PDEs). While these models can represent certain biological situations well, Cellular Potts models can be computationally expensive and continuum models only capture the macroscopic behaviour of a population of cells, ignoring stochasticity and the discrete nature of cell dynamics. Cellular automaton models allow us to address these problems and can be used for a wide variety of biological systems. In this paper, we consider a cellular automaton approach and develop an on-lattice agent-based model (ABM) for cell migration and adhesion in a population composed of two cell types. By deriving and comparing the corresponding PDEs to the ABM, we demonstrate that cell aggregation and cell sorting are not possible in the PDE model. Therefore, we propose a set of stochastic mean equations (SMEs) which better capture the behaviour of the ABM in one and two dimensions.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the kinetic chemotaxis kernel using macroscopic data: well-posedness and ill-posedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.05004v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bacterial motion is guided by external stimuli (chemotaxis), and the motion described on the mesoscopic scale is uniquely determined by a parameter $K$ that models velocity change response from the bacteria. This parameter is termed chemotaxis kernel. In a practical setting, experimental data was collected to infer this kernel. In this article, a PDE-constrained optimization framework is deployed to perform this reconstruction using velocity-averaged, localized data taken in the interior of the domain. The problem can be well-posed or ill-posed depending on the data preparation and the experimental setup. In particular, we propose one specific design that guarantees numerical reconstructability and local convergence. This design is adapted to the discretization of $K$ in space and decouples the reconstruction of local values of $K$ into smaller cell problems, opening up parallelization opportunities. Numerical evidences support the theoretical findings.</description>
