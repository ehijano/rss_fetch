      <title>Unified model of the Hall effect from insulator to overdoped compounds in cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04955v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the Hall coefficient in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, ranging from the undoped ($x = p = 0$) Mott insulator to overdoped compounds, exhibit a temperature dependence that offers insights into their electronic structure. We interpret these results using a model based on the theory of phase-separation (PS) dynamics, which begins at half-filled ($n = 1$) and at a temperature $T_{\rm PS}(p)$, near the pseudogap temperature $T^*(p)$. The $n = 1$ holes have low mobility and provide the modulations of the charge density waves (CDW). As doping increases from $p = 0$, these modulations guide the additional p holes to occupy alternating CDW domains. This charge inhomogeneity may facilitate the formation of localized superconducting amplitudes below the critical onset temperature $T_{\rm c}^{\rm max}(p)$. Using thermal activation expressions, along with quantum tunnelling between the charge domains, we successfully reproduce all Hall coefficient measurements $R_{\rm H}(p,T)$ and highlight the relevant energies of cuprates. The calculations confirm three significant electronic features: the phase-separating role of the pseudogap temperature, the superconducting state achieved through phase coherence,
  and the two types of charge carriers whose energies and mobilities become comparable at $p \approx 0.19$, where
  $T^*(p) \approx T_{\rm c}^{\rm max}(p)$. This results in a crossover from $n = p$ to $n = 1 + p$. These findings, along with the
  $R_{\rm H}(p,T)$ calculations from insulating to overdoped compounds, underscore the critical role of the electronic
  phase separation in the properties of cuprates.</description>

      <title>Electronic Structure, Magnetic and Pairing Tendencies of Alternating Single-layer Bilayer Stacking Nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ Under Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickelates have continued to surprise since their unconventional superconductivity was discovered. Recently, the layered nickelate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ with hybrid single-layer and bilayer stacking showed superconductivity under high pressure. This compound combines features of La$_2$NiO$_4$ and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, but its pairing mechanism remains to be understood. Motivated by this finding, here we report a comprehensive theoretical study of this system. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the undistorted P4/mmm phase without pressure is unstable due to three distortion modes. Increasing pressure suppresses these modes and causes ``charge transfer'' between the single-layer and bilayer sublattices, leading to hole-doping in the single-layer blocks. Our random-phase approximation calculations indicate a leading $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave pairing state that arises from spin-fluctuation scattering between Fermi surface states mainly originating from the single-layer blocks and additional weaker contributions from the bilayer blocks. These spin-fluctuations could be detected by inelastic neutron scattering as a strong peak at ${\bf q}=(\pi, \pi)$. Our findings distinguish La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ from other nickelate superconductors discovered so far and the high-$T_c$ cuprates. We also discuss both similarities and differences between La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$ and other hybrid stacking nickelates.</description>

      <title>Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry analysis of the formation of superconducting V\(_3\)Si thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vanadium silicide, V\(_3\)Si, is a promising superconductor for silicon-based superconducting (SC) devices due to its compatibility with silicon substrates and its potential for integration into existing semiconductor technologies. However, to date there have been only a limited number of studies of the formation of SC V\(_3\)Si thin films and the associated structural and superconducting properties. This work aims to explore the structural characteristics and SC properties of V\(_3\)Si films, paving the way for the development of functional SC devices for quantum technology applications. We have investigated the formation of V\(_3\)Si films by directly depositing vanadium (V) onto thermally grown SiO\(_2\) on Si, followed by high-vacuum annealing to induce the phase transformation into V\(_3\)Si. Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry(RBS) was employed throughout the sample growth process to analyze the material composition as a function of depth using a 4He+ ion beam. Analysis of the RBS data confirmed that the V layer fully reacted with the SiO\(_2\) substrate to form V\(_3\)Si at the interface, in addition to a vanadium oxide (VO\(_x\)) layer forming atop the V\(_3\)Si film. The thickness of the V\(_3\)Si layer ranges from 63 to 130 nm, with annealing temperatures between 750\(^{\circ}\)C and 800\(^{\circ}\)C. A sharp SC transition was observed at T\(_c\) = 13 K in the sample annealed at 750{\deg}C, with a narrow transition width (\(\Delta T_c\)) of 0.6 K. Initial reactive ion etching (RIE) studies yielded promising results for local removal of the VO\(_x\) to facilitate electrical contact formation to the SC layer.</description>

      <title>Collapse of density wave and emergence of superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ evidenced by ultrafast spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates realize a rare category of superconductors. However, the use of high-pressure diamond anvil cell has significantly limited spectroscopic characterization of the density waves and superconducting gaps. Here, we systematically studied the pressure evolution of the density waves and their interplay with superconductivity in La$_{4}$Ni$_{3}$O$_{10}$ using ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy. We found that both the transition temperature and energy gap of density waves are initially suppressed with increasing pressure and disappear suddenly near 17 GPa. After the density wave collapse, a newly small charge gap associated to superconductivity opens at low temperatures. The extracted gap-to-T$_c$ ratio, $2\Delta_{SC}/ k_{B} T_{c} $, is found to be approximately 3, consistent with the weak coupling regime. These results suggest that superconductivity in pressurized-La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ competes strongly with density waves, offering new insights into the interplay between these two phenomena.</description>

      <title>Possible superconductivity in very thin magnesium films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that noble metals such as gold, silver and copper are not supercon- 1 ductors, so as magnesium. This is due to the weakness of the electron-phonon interaction 2 which makes them excellent conductors but not superconductors. As it has recently been 3 shown for gold, silver and copper, even for magnesium it is possible that in very particular 4 situations superconductivity may occur. Quantum confinement in thin films has been 5 consistently shown to induce a significant enhancement of the superconducting critical 6 temperature in several superconductors. It is therefore an important fundamental question 7 whether ultra-thin film confinement may induce observable superconductivity in non- 8 superconducting metals such as magnesium. We study this problem using a generalization, 9 in the Eliashberg framework, of a BCS theory of superconductivity in good metals under 10 thin-film confinement. By numerically solving these new Eliashberg-type equations, we 11 find the dependence of the superconducting critical temperature on the film thickness, L. 12 This parameter-free theory predicts superconductivity in very thin magnesium films. We 13 demonstrate that this is a fine-tuning problem where the thickness must assume a very 14 precise value, close to half a nanometer.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Spin Density Wave Order in Layered Nickelates $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and $\mathrm{La_2PrNi_2O_7}$ via Neutron Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of pressure-induced superconductivity in two- and three-layer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates has generated significant interest in these materials as a platform for unconventional superconductivity. While their ground state exhibits magnetism, a direct determination of their magnetic structure remains elusive. Understanding this aspect is crucial, as magnetism may play a role in the pairing mechanism of superconductivity in these compounds. We resolve the magnetic structures of the bilayer (2222) polymorphs of La3Ni2O7 and La2PrNi2O7 using neutron powder diffraction (NPD) and muon-spin rotation/relaxation (muSR). Magnetic neutron scattering appears below approximately 150 K in both compounds and is observed at the (qx, 1/2, 0) position, with qx = 0 and 1/2 for La3Ni2O7 and qx = 0 for La2PrNi2O7. Within a single layer, alternating low (0.05 - 0.075 muB) and high (0.66 muB) magnetic moment stripes form. These layers stack antiferromagnetically along the c-direction to form bilayers. The presence of two propagation vectors (qx = 0 and 1/2) in undoped La3Ni2O7 suggests the coexistence of two magnetic stacking polymorphs within a single crystallographic phase. The muSR spectra further confirm these magnetic structures. Our findings provide a detailed understanding of the magnetic ground state in bilayer nickelates, offering insights into possible precursor states that may influence the emergence of superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in superconductors including Coulomb repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically study the collective excitations present in isotropic superconductors including a screened Coulomb interaction. By varying the screening strength, we analyze its impact on the system. We use a formulation of the effective phonon-mediated interaction between electrons that depends on the energy transfer between particles, rather than being a constant in a small energy shell around the Fermi edge. This justifies considering also rather large attractive interactions. We compute the system's Green's functions using the iterated equations of motion (iEoM) approach, which ultimately enables a quantitative analysis of collective excitations. For weak couplings, we identify the well-known amplitude (Higgs) mode at the two-particle continuum's lower edge and the phase (Anderson-Bogoliubov) mode at $\omega = 0$ for a neutral system, which shifts to higher energies as the Coulomb interaction is switched on. As the phononic coupling is increased, the Higgs mode separates from the continuum, and additional phase and amplitude modes appear, persisting even in the presence Coulomb interactions.</description>

      <title>How pairing mechanism dictates topology in valley-polarized superconductors with Berry curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the pairing mechanism influences topological superconductivity in valley-polarized systems with Berry curvature. We demonstrate that short-range attractive interactions, such as those mediated by phonons, favor superconducting states where the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Chern number has the same sign as the Berry curvature. In contrast, overscreened repulsive interactions, as in the Kohn-Luttinger mechanism, favor superconducting states where the BdG Chern number has the opposite sign as the Berry curvature. We establish these trends in a fully controlled limit and apply them to a recently reported chiral superconductor in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Our theory provides a concrete experimental criterion for distinguishing between different pairing mechanisms in valley-polarized topological superconductors.</description>

      <title>Beyond-mean-field phases of rotating dipolar condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotating dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of long-range interactions and rotation, leading to unconventional vortex structures and strongly correlated phases. While most studies rely on mean-field approaches, these fail to capture quantum correlations that become significant at high rotation speeds and strong interactions. In this study, we go beyond the mean-field description by employing a numerically exact multiconfigurational approach to study finite-sized dipolar condensates. We reveal novel vortex structures, rotating cluster states, and strong fragmentation effects, demonstrating that beyond-mean-field correlations remain prominent even in larger systems. By quantifying deviations from mean-field theory, we provide a predictive framework for analyzing experiments and exploring emergent quantum phases, with implications for both the fundamental theory of ultracold gases and the quantum simulation of correlated superfluid systems like in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The route of shear to Ising superconductivity in bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05624v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moir\'e supercell. In this regime, the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. The strong signal of symmetry breaking favors the onset of a pairing instability in which the electrons with opposite spin projection in the Cooper pairs live in different valleys. The Fermi lines become distorted due to the repulsive Coulomb interaction, which makes the screening highly anisotropic, leading easily to attraction in some of the interaction channels. We also show that the sheared graphene bilayers offer the possibility to realize the combined breakdown of parity and valley symmetry, making them very suitable to study the interplay between correlations and topology in a two-dimensional electron system.</description>

      <title>Spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance intertwined with superconducting gap in kagome metal CsV3-xCrxSb5</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20735v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The newly-discovered chromium-based kagome metal CsCr3Sb5 has garnered significant interest due to its strong electron correlations, intertwined orders and potential for unconventional superconductivity under high pressure. However, the nature of superconducting and magnetic interactions during the transition from the parent compound CsV3Sb5 to CsCr3Sb5 remains elusive. Here, we report the discovery of spatially anisotropic Kondo resonance which intertwines with the superconducting gap, facilitated by the introduction of magnetic Cr impurities into the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5. In addition to the gradual suppression of long-ranged charge-density-wave orders, dilute Cr dopants induce local magnetic moments, giving rise to the emergence of Kondo resonances. In addition, the Kondo resonance forms spatially anisotropic ripple-like structures around the Cr dopants, breaking all local mirror symmetries. This anisotropy arises from the antiferromagnetic coupling between itinerant electrons and the Cr-induced spin-up electrons. Remarkably, as the Kondo screening develops, the coherence peak and depth of superconducting gap with finite zero-energy conductance significantly enhances. It indicates that non-superconducting pairs at the Fermi surface in the parent compound participate in the Kondo effect, effectively screening the magnetic moments of Cr dopants while simultaneously enhancing the superfluid density. Our findings pave a unique pathway for exploring the interplay between superconductivity and local magnetic moments in kagome systems.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Dynamic Majorana Hybridization for Universal Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02481v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Qubits built out of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) have long been theorized as a potential pathway toward fault-tolerant topological quantum computation. Almost unavoidable in these processes is Majorana wavefunction overlap, known as hybridization, which arise throughout the process when Majorana modes get close to each other. This breaks the ground state degeneracy, leading to qubit errors in the braiding process. This work presents a simple but precise method to predict qubit errors for dynamic hybridization which varies in space and time. This includes hybridization between four or more MZMs through topological or trivial regions, or both of them. As an illustration, we characterize qubit-errors for an X-gate. We demonstrate how to utilize the hybridization to implement not only arbitrary one-qubit rotations but also a two-qubit controlled variable phase gate, providing a demonstration of universal quantum computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07653v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the pairing state in a doped band insulator under a periodic driving field. We employ a correlated fermionic model on a honeycomb lattice, in which pairing glue is obtainable via repulsive interactions, and derive an effective model under circularly polarized light. We demonstrate that the effective pairing interaction for doped fermions obtained with the second-order perturbation theory is tunable by the frequency and amplitude of the driving field. We find the optimal frequency range to enhance the pairing interaction and show that the modified effective system can strengthen the two-body bound state. Our study suggests that external driving light can reinforce superconducting pair states in strongly correlated electron systems.</description>

Abstract: Significant progress towards a theory of high-temperature superconductivity in cuprates has been achieved via the study of effective one- and three-band Hubbard models. Nevertheless, material-specific predictions, while essential for constructing a comprehensive theory, remain challenging due to the complex relationship between real materials and the parameters of the effective models. By combining cluster dynamical mean-field theory and density functional theory in a charge-self-consistent manner, here we show that the goal of material-specific predictions for high-temperature superconductors from first principles is within reach. We take on the challenge of explaining the remarkable physics of multilayer cuprates by focusing on the two representative Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$ and HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ families. We shed light on the microscopic origin of many salient features of multilayer cuprates, in particular the $n$-dependence of their superconducting properties. The maximum of $T_c$ for the tri-layer compounds is explained by an intertwined analysis of the charge-transfer gap, superexchange $J$, and inhomogeneous doping between the CuO$_{2}$ planes. We highlight the existence of a minimal doping (4\%) required for superconductivity to emerge. We capture material-specific properties such as the larger propensity of HgBa$_2$Ca$_{(n-1)}$Cu$_n$O$_{(2n+2)}$ to superconduct compared with Ca$_{(1+n)}$Cu$_{n}$O$_{2n}$Cl$_2$. We also find the coexistence of arcs and pockets observed with photoemission, the charge redistribution between copper and oxygen, and the link to the pseudogap. Our work establishes a framework for comprehensive studies of cuprates, enables detailed comparisons with experiment, and, through its \emph{ab initio} settings, unlocks opportunities for theoretical material design of high-temperature superconductors.</description>

      <title>A superconducting on-chip microwave cavity for tunable hybrid systems with optically trapped Rydberg atoms</title>

Abstract: Hybrid quantum systems are highly promising platforms for addressing important challenges of quantum information science and quantum sensing. Their implementation, however, is technologically non-trivial, since each component typically has unique experimental requirements. Here, we work towards a hybrid system consisting of a superconducting on-chip microwave circuit in a dilution refrigerator and optically trapped ultra-cold atoms. Specifically, we focus on the design optimization of a suitable superconducting chip and on the corresponding challenges and limitations. We unfold detailed microwave-cavity engineering strategies for maximized and tunable coupling rates to atomic Rydberg-Rydberg transitions in $\mathrm{^{87}Rb}$ atoms while respecting the boundary conditions due to the presence of a laser beam near the surface of the chip. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of the superconducting microwave chip and discuss the cavity characteristics as a function of temperature and applied dc voltage. Our results illuminate the required consideration aspects for a flexible, tunable superconductor-atom hybrid system, and lay the groundwork for realizing this exciting platform in a dilution refrigerator with vacuum Rabi frequencies approaching the strong-coupling regime.</description>
