      <title>Machine learning meets mass spectrometry: a focused perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass spectrometry is a widely used method to study molecules and processes in medicine, life sciences, chemistry, catalysis, and industrial product quality control, among many other applications. One of the main features of some mass spectrometry techniques is the extensive level of characterization (especially when coupled with chromatography and ion mobility methods, or a part of tandem mass spectrometry experiment) and a large amount of generated data per measurement. Terabyte scales can be easily reached with mass spectrometry studies. Consequently, mass spectrometry has faced the challenge of a high level of data disappearance. Researchers often neglect and then altogether lose access to the rich information mass spectrometry experiments could provide. With the development of machine learning methods, the opportunity arises to unlock the potential of these data, enabling previously inaccessible discoveries. The present perspective highlights reevaluation of mass spectrometry data analysis in the new generation of methods and describes significant challenges in the field, particularly related to problems involving the use of electrospray ionization. We argue that further applications of machine learning raise new requirements for instrumentation (increasing throughput and information density, decreasing pricing, and making more automation-friendly software), and once met, the field may experience significant transformation.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Morphological and Chemical Changes During the Oxidation of Model Inorganic Ligand-Capped Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Functionalization and volatilization are competing reactions during the oxidation of carbonaceous materials and are important processes in many different areas of science and technology. Here we present a combined ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (APXPS) and grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXS) investigation of the oxidation of oleic acid ligands surrounding NaYF4 nanoparticles (NPs) deposited onto SiOx/Si substrates. While APXPS monitors the evolution of the oxidation products, GIXS provides insight into the morphology of the ligands and particles before and after the oxidation. Our investigation shows that the oxidation of the oleic acid ligands proceeds at O2 partial pressures of below 1 mbar in the presence of X-rays, with the oxidation eventually reaching a steady state in which mainly CHx and -COOH functional groups are observed. The scattering data reveal that the oxidation and volatilization reaction proceeds preferentially on the side of the particle facing the gas phase, leading to the formation of a chemically and morphologically asymmetric ligand layer. This comprehensive picture of the oxidation process could only be obtained by combining the X-ray scattering and APXPS data. The investigation presented here lays the foundation for further studies of the stability of NP layers in the presence of reactive trace gasses and ionizing radiation, and for other nanoscale systems where chemical and morphological changes happen simultaneously and cannot be understood in isolation.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition in spin-free Dirac-Coulomb coupled-cluster calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation for the use of Cholesky decomposition (CD) of two-electron integrals within the spin-free Dirac-Coulomb (SFDC) scheme that enables to perform high-accuracy coupled-cluster (CC) calculations at costs almost comparable to those of their non-relativistic counterparts. While for non-relativistic CC calculations atomic-orbital (AO) based algorithms, due to their significantly reduced disk-space requirements, are the key to efficient large-scale computations, such algorithms are less advantageous in the SFDC case due to their increased computational cost on that case. Here, molecular-orbital (MO) based algorithms exploiting the CD of the two-electron integrals allow to reduce disk-space requirements, and lead to computational cost in the CC step that are more or less the same as in the non-relativistic case. The only remaining overhead in a CD-SFDC-CC calculation are due to the need to compute additional two-electron integrals, the somewhat higher cost of the Hartree-Fock calculation in the SFDC case, and additional cost in the transformation of the Cholesky vectors from the AO to the MO representation. However, these additional costs typically amount to less than 5-15 % of the total wall time and are thus acceptable. We illustrate the efficiency of our CD scheme for SFDC-CC calculations on a series of illustrative calculations for the X(CO)$_4$ molecules with X = Ni, Pd, Pt.</description>

      <title>Deep learning quantum Monte Carlo for solids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning has deeply changed the paradigms of many research fields. At the heart of chemical and physical sciences is the accurate ab initio calculation of many-body wavefunction, which has become one of the most notable examples to demonstrate the power of deep learning in science. In particular, the introduction of deep learning into quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has significantly advanced the frontier of ab initio calculation, offering a universal tool to solve the electronic structure of materials and molecules. Deep learning QMC architectures were initial designed and tested on small molecules, focusing on comparisons with other state-of-the-art ab initio methods. Methodological developments, including extensions to real solids and periodic models, have been rapidly progressing and reported applications are fast expanding. This review covers the theoretical foundation of deep learning QMC for solids, the neural network wavefunction ansatz, and various of other methodological developments. Applications on computing energy, electron density, electric polarization, force and stress of real solids are also reviewed. The methods have also been extended to other periodic systems and finite temperature calculations. The review highlights the potentials and existing challenges of deep learning QMC in materials chemistry and condensed matter physics.</description>

      <title>Diagrams and symmetry in polaritonic coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a diagrammatic notation to derive the quantum-electrodynamic coupled cluster (QED-CC) equations needed for the description for polaritonic ground and excited states. Our presented notation is a generalization of the existing diagrammatic notation of standard electronic coupled-cluster theory. Further, we discuss point-group symmetry inside a cavity and its exploitation within a QED-CC code for efficiency and the targeted treatment of excited states.</description>

      <title>Direct Measurement of the Critical Cooling Rate for the Vitrification of Water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vitrification of aqueous solutions through rapid cooling is a remarkable achievement that launched the field of cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) and has enabled the cryopreservation of biological specimens. For judging the feasibility of a vitrification experiment, the critical cooling rate of pure water is a frequently cited reference quantity. However, an accurate determination has remained elusive, with estimates varying by several orders of magnitude. Here, we employ in situ and time-resolved electron microscopy to obtain a precise measurement. We use shaped microsecond laser pulses to briefly melt an amorphous ice sample before flash freezing it with a variable, well-defined cooling rate. This allows us to directly measure the critical cooling rate of pure water, which we determine to be $6.4\cdot10^{6}$ K/s. Our experimental approach also expands the toolkit of microsecond time-resolved cryo-EM, an emerging technique, in which a cryo sample is similarly flash melted and revitrified with a laser pulse.</description>

      <title>Millimeter-millimeter-wave double-modulation double-resonance spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new millimeter- to millimeter-wave double-modulation double-resonance (MMW-MMW DM-DR) scheme has been applied to record spectra of two astronomically relevant complex organic molecules (COMs), propanal (C2H5CHO) and ethyl cyanide (C2H5CN), to demonstrate advantages of the DM-DR experimental technique. The DR technique helps to identify target transitions in a forest of lines and the implementation of a DM procedure (modulation of the pump and probe source) allows for confusion- and baseline-free spectra containing only the line(s) of interest. In particular the unambiguous assignment of weak and blended transitions in very dense MMW spectra is highlighted. Details of the observed Autler-Townes line splitting and possible future applications, such as automated analyses and adaptions of DM-DR methods to other experimental setups, are discussed.</description>

      <title>Extending non-adiabatic rate theory to strong electronic couplings in the Marcus inverted regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron transfer reactions play an essential role in many chemical and biological processes. Fermi's Golden rule, which assumes that the coupling between electronic states is small, has formed the foundation of electron transfer rate theory, however in short range electron/energy transfer reactions this coupling can become very large, and therefore Fermi's Golden Rule fails to make even qualitatively accurate rate predictions. In this paper I present a simple modified Golden Rule theory to describe electron transfer in the Marcus inverted regime at arbitrarily large electronic coupling strengths. The theory is based on an optimal global rotation of the diabatic states, which makes it compatible with existing methods for calculating Golden Rule rates that can account for nuclear quantum effects with anharmonic potentials. Furthermore the Optimal Golden Rule (OGR) theory can also combined with analytic theories for non-adiabatic rates, such as Marcus theory and Marcus-Levich-Jortner theory, offering clear physical insight into strong electronic coupling effects in non-adiabatic processes. OGR theory is also tested on a large set of spin-boson models and an anharmonic model against exact quantum dynamics calculations, where it performs well, correctly predicting rate turnover at large coupling strengths. Finally, an example application to a BODIPY-Anthracene photosensitizer reveals that strong coupling effects inhibit excited state charge recombination in this system, reducing the rate of this process by a factor of four. Overall OGR theory offers a new approach to calculating electron transfer rates at strong couplings, offering new physical insight into a range of non-adiabatic processes.</description>

      <title>The role of electronic excited states in the spin-lattice relaxation of spin-1/2 molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic resonance is a prime method for the study of chemical and biological structures and their dynamical processes. The interpretation of these experiments relies on considering the spin of electrons as the sole relevant degree of freedom. By applying ab inito open quantum systems theory to the full electronic wavefunction, here we show that contrary to this widespread framework the thermalization of the unpaired electron spin of two Cr(V) coordination compounds is driven by virtual transitions to excited states with energy higher than 20,000 1/cm instead of solely involving low-energy spin interactions such as Zeeman and hyperfine ones. Moreover, we found that a window of low-energy THz phonons contributes to thermalization, rather than a small number of high-energy vibrations. This work provides a drastic reinterpretation of relaxation in spin-1/2 systems and its chemical control strategies, and ultimately exemplifies the urgency of further advancing an ab initio approach to relaxometry.</description>

      <title>Polaritonic Chemistry using the Density Matrix Renormalization Group Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01381v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of polaritonic chemistry explores the behavior of molecules under strong coupling with cavity modes. Despite recent developments in ab initio polaritonic methods for simulating polaritonic chemistry under electronic strong coupling, their capabilities are limited, especially in cases where the molecule also features strong electronic correlation. To bridge this gap, we have developed a novel method for cavity QED calculations utilizing the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm in conjunction with the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian. Our approach is applied to investigate the effect of the cavity on the S0 -S1 transition of n-oligoacenes, with n ranging from 2 to 5, encompassing 22 fully correlated {\pi} orbitals in the largest pentacene molecule. Our findings indicate that the influence of the cavity intensifies with larger acenes. Additionally, we demonstrate that, unlike the full determinantal representation, DMRG efficiently optimizes and eliminates excess photonic degrees of freedom, resulting in an asymptotically constant computational cost as the photonic basis increases.</description>

      <title>Understanding Discrepancies of Wavefunction Theories for Large Molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanical many-electron calculations can predict properties of atoms, molecules and even complex materials. The employed computational methods play a quintessential role in many scientifically and technologically relevant research fields. However, a question of paramount importance is whether approximations aimed at reducing the computational complexity for solving the many-electron Schr\"odinger equation, are accurate enough. Here, we investigate recently reported discrepancies of noncovalent interaction energies for large molecules predicted by two of the most widely-trusted many-electron theories: diffusion quantum Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster theory. We are able to unequivocally pin down the source of the puzzling discrepancies and present modifications to widely-used coupled-cluster methods needed for more accurate noncovalent interaction energies of large molecules on the hundred-atom scale. This enhances the reliability of predictions from quantum mechanical many-electron theories across a wide range of critical applications, including drug design, catalysis, and the innovation of new functional materials, such as those for renewable energy technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work shows that feed-forward neural networks can predict the final ro-vibrational state distributions of inelastic and reactive processes of the reaction of Ca $+$ H2 $\rightarrow$ CaH $+$ H in the hyperthermal regime, relevant for buffer gas chemistry. Furthermore, these models can be extended to the isotopologues of the reaction involving deuterium and tritium. In addition, we develop a neural network model that can learn across the chemical space based on the isotopologues of hydrogen. The model can predict the outcome of a reaction whose reactants have never been seen. This is done by training on the Ca $+$ H2 and Ca $+$ T2 reactions and subsequently predicting the Ca $+$ D2 reaction.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00443v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic structure of high-quality van der Waals multiferroic CuCrP$_2$S6 crystals was investigated applying photoelectron spectroscopy methods in combination with DFT analysis. Using X-ray photoelectron and near-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the Cu L2,3 and Cr L2,3 absorption edges we determine the charge states of ions in the studied compound. Analyzing the systematic NEXAFS and resonant photoelectron spectroscopy data at the Cu/Cr L2,3 absorption edges allowed us to assign the CuCrP$_2$S6 material to a Mott-Hubbard type insulator and identify different Auger-decay channels (participator vs. spectator) during absorption and autoionization processes. Spectroscopic and theoretical data obtained for CuCrP$_2$S6 are very important for the detailed understanding of the electronic structure and electron-correlations phenomena in different layered materials, that will drive their further applications in different areas, like electronics, spintronics, sensing, and catalysis.</description>

      <title>Core-level signature of long-range charge-density-wave order and short-range excitonic correlations probed by attosecond broadband spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly-correlated quantum materials are characterized by a multitude of time- and energy-scales that govern quasiparticle interactions and excitations, and a precise understanding of their ground state properties necessitate an access to experimental observables that are both sensitive to the establishment of long-range order and short-range correlations. Advances in attosecond core-level spectroscopes have successfully unlocked the fastest process involving carrier dynamics in these systems, yet they are not traditionally regarded as an appropriate probe for long-range order due to their local charge sensitivity or for the low-energy physics that governs the ground-state properties of strongly-correlated materials. Here, employing a unique cryogenic attosecond broadband extreme-ultraviolet beamline, we identified clear core-level signatures of long-range charge-density-wave (CDW) formation in an excitonic insulator candidate, titanium diselenide in its 1T phase, although equilibrium measurements of the same core levels in either photoemission or absorption spectroscopy showed no observable signals about the phase transition. Leveraging intrinsic sensitivity to short-range charge excitations in core-level absorption spectra, we observed direct time-domain evidence for incoherent excitonic correlations in the normal-state of the material, whose presence has been subjected to a long-standing debate in equilibrium experiments due to the existence of CDW phonon fluctuations in a similar part of the phase space. Our results demonstrated the importance of simultaneous accesses to long- and short-range ordering with underlying dynamical processes spanning decades of time- and energy-scales, making attosecond broadband spectroscopy an indispensable tool for both understanding the equilibrium phase diagram and for discovering novel, nonequilibrium states in correlated materials.</description>

      <title>Wannier function localisation using Bloch intrinsic atomic orbitals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the Intrinsic Atomic Orbital (IAO) method for localisation of molecular orbitals to calculate well-localised generalised Wannier functions in crystals using the Pipek--Mezey locality metric. We furthermore present a one-shot diabatic Wannierisation procedure that aligns the phases of the Bloch functions, providing immediate Wannier localisation, which serves as an excellent initial guess for optimisation. We test our Wannier localisation implementation on a number of solid state systems, highlighting the effectiveness of the diabatic preparation, especially for localising core bands. Partial charges of Wannier functions generated using Bloch IAOs align well with chemical intuition, which we demonstrate through the example of adsorption of CO on a MgO surface.</description>

      <title>Enantiospecificity in NMR Enabled by Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin polarization in chiral molecules is a magnetic molecular response associated with electron transport and enantioselective bond polarization that occurs even in the absence of an external magnetic field. An unexpected finding by Santos and co-workers reported enantiospecific NMR responses in solid-state cross-polarization (CP) experiments, suggesting a possible additional contribution to the indirect nuclear spin-spin coupling in chiral molecules induced by bond polarization in the presence of spin-orbit coupling. Herein we provide a theoretical treatment for this phenomenon, presenting an effective spin-Hamiltonian for helical molecules like DNA and density functional theory (DFT) results on amino acids that confirm the dependence of J-couplings on the choice of enantiomer. The connection between nuclear spin dynamics and chirality could offer insights for molecular sensing and quantum information sciences. These results establish NMR as a potential tool for chiral discrimination without external agents.</description>

      <title>High-sensitivity multichannel zero-to-ultralow field NMR with atomic magnetometer arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite its versatility and high chemical specificity, conventional NMR spectroscopy is limited in measurement throughput due to the need for high-homogeneity magnetic fields, necessitating sequential sample analysis, and bulky devices. Here, we propose a multichannel NMR device that overcomes these limitations that leverages the zero-to-ultralow field (ZULF) regime, where simultaneous detection of multiple samples is carried out via an array of compact optically pumped magnetometers (OPMs). A magnetic field is used only for pre-polarization, permitting the use of large-bore, high-field, inhomogeneous magnets that can accommodate many samples concurrently. Through systematic advances, we demonstrate high-sensitivity, high resolution ZULF NMR spectroscopy with sensitivity comparable to benchtop NMR systems. The spectroscopy remains robust without the need for field shimming for periods on the order of weeks. We show the detection of ZULF NMR signals from organic molecules without isotopic enrichment, and demonstrate the parallelized detection of three distinct samples simultaneously as a proof-of-concept, with the potential to scale further to over 100 channels at a cost comparable to high-resolution liquid state NMR systems. This work sets the stage for using multichannel "NMR camera" devices for inline reaction monitoring, robotic chemistry, quality control, and high-throughput assays.</description>

      <title>Direct free energy calculation from ab initio path integral Monte Carlo simulations of warm dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carry out highly accurate \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations to directly estimate the free energy of various warm dense matter systems including the uniform electron gas and hydrogen without any nodal restrictions or other approximations. Since our approach is based on an effective ensemble in a bosonic configuration space, it does not increase the computational complexity beyond the usual fermion sign problem. Its application to inhomogeneous cases such as an electronic system in a fixed external ion potential is straightforward and opens up the enticing possibility to benchmark density functional theory and other existing methods. Finally, it is not limited to warm dense matter, and can be applied to a gamut of other systems such ultracold atoms and electrons in quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Adaptive energy reference for machine-learning models of the electronic density of states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic density of states (DOS) provides information regarding the distribution of electronic states in a material, and can be used to approximate its optical and electronic properties and therefore guide computational material design. Given its usefulness and relative simplicity, it has been one of the first electronic properties used as target for machine-learning approaches going beyond interatomic potentials. A subtle but important point, well-appreciated in the condensed matter community but usually overlooked in the construction of data-driven models, is that for bulk configurations the absolute energy reference of single-particle energy levels is ill-defined. Only energy differences matter, and quantities derived from the DOS are typically independent on the absolute alignment. We introduce an adaptive scheme that optimizes the energy reference of each structure as part of training, and show that it consistently improves the quality of ML models compared to traditional choices of energy reference, for different classes of materials and different model architectures. On a practical level, we trace the improved performance to the ability of this self-aligning scheme to match the most prominent features in the DOS. More broadly, we believe that this work highlights the importance of incorporating insights into the nature of the physical target into the definition of the architecture and of the appropriate figures of merit for machine-learning models, that translate in better transferability and overall performance.</description>

      <title>Investigation of the rotational spectrum of CH$_3$$^{17}$OH and its tentative detection toward Sagittarius B2(N)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01139v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methanol is an abundant molecule in space. The column density of CH$_3^{18}$OH is in some star-forming regions so high that the search for CH$_3^{17}$OH is promising. But only very few transition frequencies of CH$_3^{17}$OH with a microwave accuracy have been published thus far. We recorded the rotational spectrum of CH$_3^{17}$OH between 38 and 1095 GHz employing a methanol sample enriched in $^{17}$O to 20\%. A torsion-rotation Hamiltonian model based on the rho-axis method was employed to fit the data, as in our previous studies. We searched for rotational transitions of CH$_3^{17}$OH in the imaging spectral line survey ReMoCA obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) toward the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(N). The observed spectra were modeled under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The assignments cover $0 \le J \le 45$, $K_a \le 16$, and mainly the $v_ t = 0$ and 1 torsional states. The Hamiltonian model describes our data well. The model was applied to derive a line list for radio-astronomical observations. We report a tentative detection of CH$_3^{17}$OH along with secure detections of the more abundant isotopologs of methanol toward Sgr B2(N2b). The derived column densities yield isotopic ratios $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = 25, $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O = 240, and $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O = 3.3, which are consistent with values found earlier for other molecules in Sgr B2. The agreement between the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O isotopic ratio that we obtained for methanol and the $^{18}$O/$^{17}$O ratios reported in the past for other molecules in Sgr B2(N) strongly supports our tentative interstellar identification of CH$_3^{17}$OH. The accuracy of the derived line list is sufficient for further radio astronomical searches for this methanol isotopolog toward other star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Tuning and predicting the onset of desiccation cracks in air-dried aqueous clay suspensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hypothesis- Stacks of clay platelets in aqueous suspension swell and break up gradually, with the exfoliated clay particles eventually self-assembling to form transient, fragile, gel-like networks. As a consequence of this physical aging phenomenon, clay suspensions transform spontaneously from viscoelastic liquids to viscoelastic solid-like phases. When subjected to desiccation, these colloidal systems accumulate drying-induced stresses and are prone to cracking. For a fixed evaporation rate and sample-boundary adhesion, it should be possible to control the formation of cracks by tuning the sample aging dynamics.
  Experiments- Clay suspensions layers were dried in controlled environments. The location and time of crack onset were recorded in imaging experiments. The elasticity of each partially dried sample was extracted by performing microindentation experiments in an atomic force microscope.
  Findings- Clay aging dynamics and desiccation crack onset were controlled by tuning clay and salt concentrations in the aqueous medium. Our experiments reveal that the crack onset time, $t_c$, varies with sample elasticity, $E$, according to $t_c \propto 1/\sqrt E$. We explain this correlation by proposing a simple scaling argument that incorporates the Griffith's fracture criterion in a poroelastic model. Fits to our model reveal the high ductility of aging clay suspensions. Besides allowing us to control the cracking process by tuning sample elasticity, our results are potentially useful in formulating crack-resistant coatings and paints.</description>

      <title>New Radiative and Collisional Atomic Data for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} with application to Kilonova modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spectra of singly ionised Strontium and Yttrium (Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}) have been proposed as identifications of certain spectral features in the AT2017gfo spectrum. With the growing demand for NLTE simulations of Kilonovae, there is a increasing need for atomic data for these and other $r$-process elements. Our goal is to expand upon the current set of atomic data for $r$-process elements, by presenting transition probabilities and Maxwellian-averaged effective collision strengths for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii}. The Breit-Pauli and DARC $R$-matrix codes are employed to calculate the appropriate collision strengths, which are thermally averaged according to a Maxwellian distribution to calculate excitation and de-excitation rates. The {\sc tardis} and {\sc ColRadPy} packages are subsequently used to perform LTE and NLTE modelling respectively. A complete set of transition probabilities and effective collision strengths involving levels for Sr {\sc ii} and Y {\sc ii} have been calculated for temperature ranges compatible with kilonova plasma conditions. Forbidden transitions were found to disagree heavily with the Axelrod approximation, an approximation which is currently employed by other models within the literature. Theoretically important spectral lines are identified with both LTE and NLTE modelling codes. LTE simulations in {\sc tardis} reveal no new significant changes to the full synthetic spectra. NLTE simulations in {\sc ColRadPy} provide indications of which features are expected to be strong for a range of regimes, and we include luminosity estimates. Synthetic emission spectra over KNe densities and temperatures reveal potentially interesting spectral lines in the NIR.</description>

Abstract: The unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz is a promising tool for achieving high-precision results using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) algorithm in the NISQ era. However, results on quantum hardware are thus far very limited and simulations have only accessed small system sizes. We advance the state of the art of UCC simulations by utilizing an efficient sparse wavefunction circuit solver and studying systems up to 64 qubits. Here we report results obtained using this solver that demonstrate the power of the UCC ansatz and address pressing questions about optimal initial parameterizations and circuit construction, among others. Our approach enables meaningful benchmarking of the UCC ansatz, a crucial step in assessing the utility of VQE for achieving quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty Quantification for Molecular Property Predictions with Graph Neural Architecture Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10438v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a prominent class of data-driven methods for molecular property prediction. However, a key limitation of typical GNN models is their inability to quantify uncertainties in the predictions. This capability is crucial for ensuring the trustworthy use and deployment of models in downstream tasks. To that end, we introduce AutoGNNUQ, an automated uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach for molecular property prediction. AutoGNNUQ leverages architecture search to generate an ensemble of high-performing GNNs, enabling the estimation of predictive uncertainties. Our approach employs variance decomposition to separate data (aleatoric) and model (epistemic) uncertainties, providing valuable insights for reducing them. In our computational experiments, we demonstrate that AutoGNNUQ outperforms existing UQ methods in terms of both prediction accuracy and UQ performance on multiple benchmark datasets. Additionally, we utilize t-SNE visualization to explore correlations between molecular features and uncertainty, offering insight for dataset improvement. AutoGNNUQ has broad applicability in domains such as drug discovery and materials science, where accurate uncertainty quantification is crucial for decision-making.</description>

      <title>From molecules to scaffolds to functional groups: building context-dependent molecular representation via multi-channel learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable molecular property prediction is essential for various scientific endeavors and industrial applications, such as drug discovery. However, the data scarcity, combined with the highly non-linear causal relationships between physicochemical and biological properties and conventional molecular featurization schemes, complicates the development of robust molecular machine learning models. Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a popular solution, utilizing large-scale, unannotated molecular data to learn a foundational representation of chemical space that might be advantageous for downstream tasks. Yet, existing molecular SSL methods largely overlook chemical knowledge, including molecular structure similarity, scaffold composition, and the context-dependent aspects of molecular properties when operating over the chemical space. They also struggle to learn the subtle variations in structure-activity relationship. This paper introduces a novel pre-training framework that learns robust and generalizable chemical knowledge. It leverages the structural hierarchy within the molecule, embeds them through distinct pre-training tasks across channels, and aggregates channel information in a task-specific manner during fine-tuning. Our approach demonstrates competitive performance across various molecular property benchmarks and offers strong advantages in particularly challenging yet ubiquitous scenarios like activity cliffs.</description>

      <title>Transport property predictions for laser resonance chromatography on Rf$^+$ (Z = 104)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a theoretically designed laser resonance chromatography (LRC) experiment on Rf$^+$ (Z = 104) drifting in He buffer gas. To this end, we first developed a four-level rate equation model that simulates the optical pumping of Rf$^+$ from its ground state, $^2$D$_{3/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), to the metastable $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^2$) state via laser resonant excitation of the intermediate $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^1$7p$^1$) state prior to electronic state chromatography. This model predicts a 93% pumping efficiency that suffices to enable efficient laser resonance chromatography of this ion. We then performed accurate relativistic Multi-Reference Configuration-Interaction (MRCI) calculations to model the interaction of Rf$^+$ with He in the ground $^2$D$_{3/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), low-lying $^2$D$_{5/2}$ (7s$^2$6d$^1$), and metastable $^4$F$_{3/2}$ (7s$^1$6d$^2$) states. These ion-atom interaction potentials were used to calculate the state-specific ion mobilities. For gas temperatures above 100 K and small applied electric fields, the reduced ion mobilities of the ground and metastable states differ significantly. In particular, at room temperature the difference between the reduced ion mobilities of these states is larger than 11%, and as such sufficiently large to ensure LRC of this ion.</description>

      <title>Non-equilibrium Green's function approach to low-energy fission dynamics: fluctuations in fission reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04255v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a microscopic modeling for a decay of a heavy compound nucleus, starting from a nucleonic degree of freedom. To this end, we develop an approach based on a non-equilibrium Green's function, which is combined with a configuration interaction (CI) approach based on a constrained density-functional theory (DFT). We apply this approach to a barrier-top fission of $^{236}$U, restricting the model space to seniority zero configurations of neutrons and protons. We particularly focus on the distribution of the fission probability. We find that it approximately follows the chi-squared distribution with the number of degrees of freedom $\nu$ of the order of 1, which is consistent with the experimental finding. We also show that $\nu$ corresponds to the number of eigenstates of the many-body Hamiltonian whose energy is close to the excitation energy of the system and at the same time which have significant components on both sides of a fission barrier.</description>
