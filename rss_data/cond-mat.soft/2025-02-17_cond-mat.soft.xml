      <title>Direct experimental measurement of many-body hydrodynamic interactions with optical tweezers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body hydrodynamic interactions (HIs) play an important role in the dynamics of fluid suspensions. While many-body HIs have been studied extensively using particle simulations, there is a dearth of experimental frameworks with which to quantify fluid-mediated multi-body interactions. To address this, we design an experimental method that utilizes optical laser tweezers for quantifying fluid-mediated colloidal interactions with exquisite precision and control. By inducing translation-rotation hydrodynamic coupling between trapped fluorescently-labeled colloids, we obtain a direct reporter of few- to many-body HIs experimentally. We leverage the torque-free nature of laser tweezers to enable sensitive measurements of signals between trapped colloids. First, we measure the pair HI between a stationary tracer probe and a translating particle as a function of their separation distance. We discover that our technique can precisely quantify distant fluid disturbances that are generated by ~2 pN of hydrodynamic force at 12 particle radii of separation. To study the effect of many-body HIs, we measure the rotational mobility of a probe in a three-particle setup and in a model material, a two-dimensional hexagonally-close-packed lattice, that undergoes oscillatory strain. Respectively, we discover that the probe's rotation can reverse in certain three-body configurations, and we find that rotational mobility in the crystalline array is strongly attenuated by particle rigidity. Experimental measurements are corroborated by microhydrodynamic theory and Stokesian Dynamics simulations with excellent agreement, highlighting our ability to measure accurately many-body HIs. Lastly, we extend our theoretical framework to manipulate colloidal-scale fluid flows. With experimental validation, we compute the required trajectory of a moving particle to induce a desired angular velocity of a probe.</description>

      <title>Transverse vortices induced by modulated granular shear flows of elongated particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have performed DEM simulations of elongated grains in a shear cell for various particle aspect ratios and contact frictions, with an additional heterogeneous force perturbation in the flow direction. For a perturbation in the form of a single Fourier mode, we show that the response of the system consists of transverse secondary flows that average onto a pattern of four vortices. We have also theoretically studied this phenomenon by generalizing the granular rheology $\mu(I)$ to the case of elongated grains and computing the linear response to such a perturbation. Even if the agreement between theory and simulations remains qualitative only, we can reproduce and understand the inversion of the vortex pattern when the cell aspect ratio is increased from a vertically to a horizontally elongated cell shape, emphasizing the key role of the second normal stress difference as well as the cell geometry.</description>

      <title>Balloon regime: Drop elasticity leads to complete rebound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When a viscoelastic shear-thinning drop of high elasticity hits a superhydrophobic surface, a growing tail-like filament vertically emerges from the impact spot as the contact line recedes. Notably, the ligament transitions into a balloon-like shape before detaching (Balloon regime) completely from the surface. Here, we attribute the ligament formation to the liquid impalement upon impact into the surface protrusion spacing. Our findings reveal that ligament formation can be controlled by tuning the roughness and surface wettability. We show that ligament stretching mainly depends on inertia and gravity, whereas the high elasticity prevents the ligament break up, enabling complete rebounds.</description>

      <title>Stretching theory of Hookean metashells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite being governed by the familiar laws of Hookean mechanics, elastic shells patterned with an internal structure (i.e. metashells) exhibit a wealth of unusual mechanical properties with no counterparts in unstructured materials. Here I show that much of this behavior can be captured by a real-valued analog of the inhomogeneous Schr\"odinger equation, with the lateral pressure experienced by the internal structure in the role of the wave function. In the fine structure limit $-$ i.e. when the length scale associated with the internal structure is much smaller than the local radius of curvature $-$ this approach reveals the existence of localized states, in which elastic deformations are prevented to diffuse away from their origin, thereby allowing the internal structure to smoothly adapt to the intrinsic geometry of the metashell. Leveraging on an analogy with scattering states in nearly free electrons, I further show that periodic metashells, obtained from the repetition of the same structural unit periodically in space, support elastic Bloch waves, corresponding to stationary periodic configurations of the internal structure and characterized by a geometry-dependent band structure. When applied to crystalline monolayers, this approach provides a generalization of the elastic theory of interacting topological defect to compressible systems.</description>

      <title>A tutorial for mesoscale computer simulations of lipid membranes: tether pulling, tubulation and fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09798v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lipid membranes and membrane deformations are a long-standing area of research in soft matter and biophysics. Computer simulations have complemented analytical and experimental approaches as one of the pillars in the field. However, setting up and using membrane simulations can come with barriers due to the multidisciplinary effort involved and the vast choice of existing simulations models. In this review, we introduce the non-expert reader to coarse-grained membrane simulations (CGMS) at the mesoscale. Firstly, we give a concise overview of the modelling approaches to study fluid membranes, together with guidance to more specialized references. Secondly, we provide a conceptual guide on how to develop CGMS. Lastly, we construct a hands-on tutorial on how to apply CGMS, by providing a pedagogical examination of tether pulling, tubulation and fluctuations with three different membrane models, and discussing them in terms of their scope and how resource-intensive they are. To ease the reader's venture into the field, we provide a repository with ready-to-run tutorials.</description>

      <title>The N-link model for slender rods in a viscous fluid: well-posedness and convergence to classical elastohydrodynamics equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09988v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flexible fibers at the microscopic scale, such as flagella and cilia, play essential roles in biological and synthetic systems. The dynamics of these slender filaments in viscous flows involve intricate interactions between their mechanical properties and hydrodynamic drag. In this paper, considering a 1D, planar, inextensible Euler-Bernoulli rod in a viscous fluid modeled by Resistive Force Theory, we establish the existence and uniqueness of solutions for the $N$-link model, a mechanical model, designed to approximate the continuous filament with rigid segments. Then, we prove the convergence of the $N$-link model's solutions towards the solutions to classical elastohydrodynamics equations of a flexible slender rod. This provides an existence result for the limit model, comparable to those by Mori and Ohm [Nonlinearity, 2023], in a different functional context and with different methods. Due to its mechanical foundation, the discrete system satisfies an energy dissipation law, which serves as one of the main ingredients in our proofs. Our results provide mathematical validation for the discretization strategy that consists in approximating a continuous filament by the mechanical $N$-link model, which does not correspond to a classical approximation of the underlying PDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantifying and characterizing fluctuations far away from equilibrium is a challenging task. We introduce and experimentally confirm an identity for a driven classical system, relating the different non-equilibrium cumulants of the observable conjugate to the driving protocol. The identity is valid from micro- to macroscopic length scales, and it encompasses the fluctuation dissipation theorem. We apply it in experiments of a Brownian probe particle confined and driven by an optical potential and suspended in a nonlinear and non-Markovian fluid.</description>

      <title>Multicomponent mixtures exhibit a vast nucleation-and-growth regime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixtures of many interacting components can exhibit numerous coexisting droplet types. An exciting example is the cytosol of biological cells, where diverse droplets called condensates are indispensable for cellular function, but it is currently unclear how much their formation is restricted by thermodynamics. Interestingly, linear stability analysis predicts that homogeneous mixtures become more stable with increasing component count. In contrast, we show via numerical simulations and analytical scaling laws that equilibrium states typically contain many coexisting droplets. Combining both results suggests that generic multicomponent mixtures can sustain many stable states with various droplet counts, generalizing the nucleation-and-growth regime of binary mixtures. Our theory also indicates why cells exhibit much fewer condensates than components and how multistability could be leveraged to form condensates independently.</description>

      <title>Analytical solution for the polydisperse random close packing problem in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical theory for the random close packing density, $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$, of polydisperse hard disks is provided using an equilibrium model of crowding [A. Zaccone, Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 028002 (2022)] which has been justified on the basis of extensive numerical analysis of the maximally random jammed (MRJ) line in the phase diagram of hard spheres [Anzivino et al., J. Chem. Phys. 158, 044901 (2023)]. The solution relies on the equations of state for the hard disk fluid and provides predictions for $\phi_\textrm{RCP}$ as a function of the ratio, $s$, of the standard deviation of the distribution of disk diameters to its mean. For a power-law size distribution with $s=0.246$, the theory yields $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.892$, which compares well with the most recent numerical estimate $\phi_\textrm{RCP} =0.905$ based on the Monte-Carlo swap algorithms [Ghimenti, Berthier, van Wijland, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 028202 (2024)].</description>

      <title>Dynamic Control of Third-order Nonlinear Optical Properties of Gold Nanoparticle/Liquid Crystal Composites under External Electric Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05736v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic control of third-order nonlinear optical absorption properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) dispersed in nematic liquid crystals (LC). By leveraging the reconfigurable nature of liquid crystals under external electric fields, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate AuNP alignment, dimer formation, and subsequently the plasmon coupling effects. Planar oriented and degenerate LC cells were prepared, and their optical responses under varying electric fields were characterized using polarization microscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and Z-scan techniques. In planar cells, the applied electric field reorients LC molecules and AuNPs, influencing plasmon coupling and the nonlinear absorption. Conversely, degenerate cells exhibit more complex behaviors due to multiple LC alignment directions. These findings illustrate the potential of AuNP/nematic LC systems for creating tunable photonic devices responsive to external stimuli.</description>

      <title>The allosteric lever: towards a principle of specific allosteric response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12025v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allostery, the phenomenon by which the perturbation of a molecule at one site alters its behavior at a remote functional site, enables control over biomolecular function. Allosteric modulation is a promising avenue for drug discovery and is employed in the design of mechanical metamaterials. However, a general principle of allostery, i.e. a set of quantitative and transferable "ground rules", remains elusive. It is neither a set of structural motifs nor intrinsic motions. Focusing on elastic network models, we here show that an allosteric lever -- a mode-coupling pattern induced by the perturbation -- governs the directional, source-to-target, allosteric communication: a structural perturbation of an allosteric site couples the excitation of localized hard elastic modes with concerted long range soft-mode relaxation. Perturbations of non-allosteric sites instead couple hard and soft modes uniformly. The allosteric response is shown to be generally non-linear and non-reciprocal, and allows for minimal structural distortions to be efficiently transmitted to specific changes at distant sites. Allosteric levers exist in proteins and "pseudoproteins" -- networks designed to display an allosteric response. Interestingly, protein sequences that constitute allosteric transmission channels are shown to be evolutionarily conserved. To illustrate how the results may be applied in drug design, we use them to successfully predict known allosteric sites in proteins.</description>

      <title>Direct observation of thermal hysteresis in the molecular dynamics of barocaloric neopentyl glycol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17869v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Barocalorics (BCs) are emerging as promising alternatives to vapour-phase refrigerants, which are problematic as they exacerbate climate change when they inevitably leak into the atmosphere. However, the commercialisation of BC refrigerants is significantly hindered by hysteresis in the solid-solid phase transition that would be exploited in a refrigeration cycle. Here, we provide new insight into the hysteresis that is a critical step towards the rational design of viable BCs. By studying the benchmark BC plastic crystal, neopentyl glycol (NPG), we observe directly the liberation of the hydroxyl rotational modes that unlock the hydrogen bond network, distinguishing for the first time the molecular reorientation and hydroxymethyl rotational modes. We showcase the use high-resolution inelastic fixed-window scans in combination with quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) measurements to build a comprehensive microscopic understanding of the NPG phase transition, directly tracking the molecular dynamics of the phase transition. Hysteresis previously observed in calorimetric studies of NPG is now observed directly as hysteresis in molecular rotational modes, and hence in the formation and disruption of hydrogen bonding. Furthermore, by tracking the thermal activation of three main reorientation modes, we suggest that their fractional excitations may resolve an outstanding discrepancy between measured and calculated entropy change. These results allow for direct study of the molecular dynamics that govern the thermal hysteresis of small molecule energy materials. They will be broadly applicable, as many promising BC material families possess first-order transitions involving molecular reorientations.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</description>
