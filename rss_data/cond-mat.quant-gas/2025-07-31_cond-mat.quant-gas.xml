      <title>Spatially-periodic states in a strongly dipolar $^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy mixture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22154v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of a novel eigenstate in a strongly dipolar binary $^{164}$Dy-$^{162}$Dy mixture, where the inter- and intraspecies dipolar lengths are larger than the corresponding scattering lengths. When this mixture is confined by a quasi-two-dimensional harmonic trap, the total density exhibits the formation of droplets on a spatially-symmetric triangular or square lattice, where each droplet is formed of a single species of atoms; two types of atoms never exist on the same lattice site. The density of any of the species shows a partially-filled incomplete lattice, only the total density exhibits a completely full lattice structure. In this theoretical investigation we employ the numerical solution of an improved mean-field model including a Lee-Huang-Yang-type interaction in the intraspecies components alone, meant to stop a collapse of the atoms at high atom density.</description>

      <title>Proposal for realizing Heisenberg-type quantum-spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetic-field dependence of the interaction between two Rydberg atoms, $|nS_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$ and $|(n+1)S_{1/2}, m_J\rangle$. In this setting, the effective spin-1/2 Hamiltonian takes the form of an {\it XXZ} model. We show that the anisotropy parameter of the {\it XXZ} model can be tuned by applying a magnetic field, and in particular, that it changes drastically near the F\"orster resonance points. Based on this result, we propose experimental realizations of spin-1/2 and spin-1 Heisenberg-type quantum spin models in Rydberg atom quantum simulators, without relying on Floquet engineering. Our results provide guidance for future experiments of Rydberg atom quantum simulators and offer insight into quantum many-body phenomena emerging in the Heisenberg model.</description>

      <title>Dipolar optimal control of quantum states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state control is a fundamental tool for quantum technologies. In this work, we propose and analyze the use of quantum optimal control that exploits the dipolar interaction of ultracold atoms on a lattice ring, focusing on the generation of selected states with entangled circulation. This scheme requires time-dependent control over the orientation of the magnetic field, a technique that is feasible in ultracold atom laboratories. The system's evolution is driven by just two independent control functions. We describe the symmetry constraints and other requirements of this approach, and numerically test them using the extended Bose-Hubbard model. We find that the proposed control can engineer entangled current states with perfect fidelity across a wide range of systems, and that in the remaining cases, the theoretical upper bounds for fidelity are reached.</description>

      <title>Non-periodic Boundary Conditions for Euler Class and Dynamical Signatures of Obstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the landscape of free-fermion phases has drastically been expanded in the last decades, recently novel multi-gap topological phases were proposed where groups of bands can acquire new invariants such as Euler class. As in conventional single-gap topologies, obstruction plays an inherent role that so far has only been incidentally addressed. We here systematically investigate the nuances of the relation between the non-Bravais lattice configurations and the Brillouin zone boundary conditions (BZBCs) for any number of dimensions. Clarifying the nomenclature, we provide a general periodictization recipe to obtain a gauge with an almost Brillouin-zone-periodic Bloch Hamiltonian both generally and upon imposing a reality condition on Hamiltonians for Euler class. Focusing on three-band $\mathcal{C}_2$ symmetric Euler systems in two dimensions as a guiding example, we present a procedure to enumerate the possible lattice configurations, and thus the unique BZBCs possibilities. We establish a comprehensive classification for the identified BZBC patterns according to the parity constraints they impose on the Euler invariant, highlighting how it extends to more bands and higher dimensions. Moreover, by building upon previous work utilizing Hopf maps, we illustrate physical consequences of non-trivial BZBCs in the quench dynamics of non-Bravais lattice Euler systems, reflecting the parity of the Euler invariant. We numerically confirm our results and corresponding observable signatures, and discuss possible experimental implementations. Our work presents a general framework to study the role of non-trivial boundary conditions and obstructions on multi-gap topology that can be employed for arbitrary number bands or in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Protected quantum gates using qubit doublons in dynamical optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a central challenge in modern science. Neutral atoms in optical lattices have emerged as a leading computing platform, with collisional gates offering a stable mechanism for quantum logic. However, previous experiments have treated ultracold collisions as a dynamically fine-tuned process, which obscures the underlying quantum- geometry and statistics crucial for realising intrinsically robust operations. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate by transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a dynamical optical lattice. The presence of these doublon states, together with fermionic exchange anti-symmetry, enables a two-particle quantum holonomy -- a geometric evolution where dynamical phases are absent. This yields a gate mechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and inhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is further reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian. We experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a loss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\%$ measured across the entire system consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs. When combined with recently developed topological pumping methods for atom transport, our results pave the way for large-scale, highly connected quantum processors. This work introduces a new paradigm for quantum logic, transforming fundamental symmetries and quantum statistics into a powerful resource for fault-tolerant computation.</description>

      <title>Floquet Theory of lattice electrons coupled to an off-resonant cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Floquet theory and the High-Frequency expansion to derive an effective Hamiltonian for electrons coupled to an off resonant cavity mode, either in its vacuum or driven by classical light. For vacuum fields, we show that long-range hopping and cavity-mediated interactions arise as a direct consequence of quantum fluctuations. As an application, this method is applied to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. At high light-matter coupling, our results reveal significant deviations from mean-field predictions, with our framework capturing light-matter entanglement through the Floquet micromotion. Furthermore, the cavity-mediated interactions appearing at first order are shown to be crucial to the description of the system at sufficiently strong light-matter coupling for a fixed cavity frequency. Finally, a drive resonant with the cavity is added with the SSH chain displaying dynamical behavior dependent on the cavity parameters.</description>

      <title>Miscibility-Immiscibility transition of strongly interacting bosonic mixtures in optical lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interaction plays key role in the mixing properties of a multi-component system. The miscibility-immiscibility transition (MIT) in a weakly interacting mixture of Bose gases is predominantly determined by the strengths of the intra and inter-component two-body contact interactions. On the other hand, in the strongly interacting regime interaction induced processes become relevant. Despite previous studies on bosonic mixtures in optical lattices, the effects of the interaction induced processes on the MIT remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the MIT in the strongly interacting phases of two-component bosonic mixture trapped in a homogeneous two-dimensional square optical lattice. Particularly we examine the MIT condition when both the components are in superfluid (SF), one-body staggered superfluid (OSSF), or supersolid (SS) phases. Our study uncovers that MIT condition is significantly shaped by the interplay of competing non-local intra- and inter-component density-induced tunneling effects, as well as off-site interactions. Notably, we demonstrate that the MIT condition for the staggered superfluid phase exhibits an inequality that is inverted compared to the conventional MIT condition associated with superfluid or supersolid phases driven by local contact interactions. In addition, we present the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard Model incorporating non-local processes, derived using a site-decoupling mean-field approach with the Gutzwiller ansatz. Our study contributes to the better understanding of miscibility properties of multi-component systems in the strongly interacting regime.</description>

      <title>Vortices in the Many-Body Excited States of Interacting Bosons in Two Dimension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07570v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum vortices play an important role in the physics of two-dimensional quantum many-body systems, though they usually are understood in the single-particle framework like the mean-field approach. Inspired by the study on the relations between solitons and yrast states, we investigate here the emergence of vortices from the eigenstates of a N -body Hamiltonian of interacting particles trapped in a disk. We analyse states that appear by consecutively measuring the positions of particles. These states have densities, phases, and energies closely resembling mean-field vortices. We discuss similarities, but also point out purely many-body features, such as vortex smearing due to the quantum fluctuation of their center. The ab initio analysis of the many-body system, and mean-field approaches are supported by the analysis within the Bogoliubov approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03477v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides remarkable insights into the real space properties of many-body systems, but does not directly reveal the nature of their fundamental excitation spectrum. Here, we demonstrate that radio-frequency spectroscopy can reveal the quasi-particle nature of doped quantum many-body systems, crucial for our understanding of, e.g., high-temperature superconductors. In particular, we showcase how the existence and energy of magnetic polaron quasi-particles in doped Fermi-Hubbard systems may be probed, revealed by hallmark peaks in the spectroscopic spectrum. In combination with fundamental dualities of the Fermi-Hubbard model, we describe how these findings may be tested using several experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Bubbles in a box: Eliminating edge nucleation in cold-atom simulators of vacuum decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02829v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay of metastable 'false vacuum' states via bubble nucleation plays a crucial role in many cosmological scenarios. Cold-atom analog experiments will soon provide the first empirical probes of this process, with potentially far-reaching implications for early-Universe cosmology and high-energy physics. However, an inevitable difference between these analog systems and the early Universe is that the former have a boundary. We show, using a combination of Euclidean calculations and real-time lattice simulations, that these boundaries generically cause rapid bubble nucleation on the edge of the experiment, obscuring the bulk nucleation that is relevant for cosmology. We demonstrate that implementing a high-density 'trench' region at the boundary completely eliminates this problem, and recovers the desired cosmological behavior. Our findings are relevant for ongoing efforts to probe vacuum decay in the laboratory, providing a practical solution to a key experimental obstacle.</description>

      <title>Beyond Fragmented Dopant Dynamics in Quantum Spin Lattices: Robust Localization and Sub-diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of dopants in magnetic spin lattices has received tremendous attention for at least four decades due to its connection to high-temperature superconductivity. Despite these efforts, we lack a complete understanding of their behavior, especially out-of-equilibrium and at nonzero temperatures. In this Article, we take a significant step towards a much deeper understanding based on state-of-the-art matrix-product-state calculations. In particular, we investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics of a dopant in two-leg $t$-$J$ ladders with antiferromagnetic XXZ spin interactions. In the Ising limit, we find that the dopant is localized for all investigated nonzero temperatures due to an emergent disordered potential, with a localization length controlled by the underlying correlation length of the spin lattice, whereby it only delocalizes asymptotically in the zero temperature limit. This greatly generalizes the localization effect discovered recently in Hilbert space fragmented models. In the presence of spin-exchange processes, the dopant delocalizes according to a power-law behavior, which is strongly sub-diffusive for weak spin-exchange but which eventually becomes diffusive for strong enough exchange. Moreover, we show that the underlying spin dynamics at infinite temperature behaves qualitatively the same, albeit with important quantitative differences. We substantiate these findings by showing that the dynamics shows self-similar scaling behavior, which strongly deviates from the Gaussian behavior of regular diffusion. Finally, we show that the diffusion coefficient follows an Arrhenius relation at high temperatures, whereby it exponentially decreases for decreasing temperatures.</description>

      <title>Joint Estimation of a Two-Phase Spin Rotation beyond Classical Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum metrology employs entanglement to enhance measurement precision. The focus and progress so far have primarily centered on estimating a single parameter. In diverse application scenarios, the estimation of more than one single parameter is often required. Joint estimation of multiple parameters can benefit from additional advantages for further enhanced precision. Here we report quantum-enhanced measurement of simultaneous spin rotations around two orthogonal axes, making use of spin-nematic squeezing in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate. Aided by the $F=2$ atomic ground hyperfine manifold coupled to the nematic-squeezed $F=1$ states as an auxiliary field through a sequence of microwave (MW) pulses, simultaneous measurement of multiple spin-1 observables is demonstrated, reaching an enhancement of 3.3 to 6.3 decibels (dB) beyond the classical limit over a wide range of rotation angles. Our work realizes the first enhanced multi-parameter estimation using entangled massive particles as a probe. The techniques developed and the protocols implemented also highlight the application of two-mode squeezed vacuum states in quantum-enhanced sensing of noncommuting spin rotations simultaneously.</description>
