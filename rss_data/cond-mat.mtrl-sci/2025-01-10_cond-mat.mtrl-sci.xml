      <title>Resonant X-ray spectroscopies on Chromium 3\textit{d} orbitals in CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04751v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the Cr electronic structure and excitations in CrSBr, a layered magnetic semiconductor, using a combination of resonant x-ray spectroscopic techniques. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra collected at the Cr $L_{2,3}$ edges reveal significant linear dichroism, which arises from the distorted octahedral environment surrounding the Cr$^{3+}$ ions. The origin of the bright excitons observed in this compound is examined through a comparison of the d-d excitations identified in the RIXS spectra, the x-ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL) spectra, and previously reported optical spectroscopic and theoretical studies. To further understand these phenomena, we develop a multiplet model based on a crystal electric field (CEF) approach that accounts for the local environment of Cr ions. This model successfully reproduces several experimental features, while also suggesting strong hybridization effects between Cr 3\textit{d} orbitals and ligands that are not fully captured by the present framework. These findings advance our understanding of the electronic structure and excitonic behavior in CrSBr and provide a foundation for future $\textit{in-situ}$ and $\textit{operando}$ studies of CrSBr-based devices for spintronic and optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Direct Air Capture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new metrics to evaluate solid sorbent materials for Direct Air Capture (DAC). These new metrics provide a theoretical upper bound on CO2 captured per energy as well as a theoretical upper limit on the purity of the captured CO2. These new metrics are based entirely on intrinsic material properties and are therefore agnostic to the design of the DAC system. These metrics apply to any adsorption-refresh cycle design. In this work we demonstrate the use of these metrics with the example of temperature-pressure swing refresh cycles. The main requirement for applying these metrics is to describe the equilibrium uptake (along with a few other materials properties) of each species in terms of the thermodynamic variables (e.g. temperature, pressure). We derive these metrics from thermodynamic energy balances. To apply these metrics on a set of examples, we first generated approximations of the necessary materials properties for 11 660 metal-organic framework materials (MOFs). We find that the performance of the sorbents is highly dependent on the path through thermodynamic parameter space. These metrics allow for: 1) finding the optimum materials given a particular refresh cycle, and 2) finding the optimum refresh cycles given a particular sorbent. Applying these metrics to the database of MOFs lead to the following insights: 1) start cold - the equilibrium uptake of CO2 diverges from that of N2 at lower temperatures, and 2) selectivity of CO2 vs other gases at any one point in the cycle does not matter - what matters is the relative change in uptake along the cycle.</description>

      <title>Direct measurement of the longitudinal exciton dispersion in hBN by resonant inelastic x-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements on the prototypical hexagonal boron nitride hBN layered compound. The RIXS results at the B and N K edges have been combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) experiments and ab initio calculations within the framework of the Bethe-Salpeter equation of many-body perturbation theory. By means of this tight interplay of different spectroscopies, the lowest longitudinal exciton of hBN has been identified. Moreover, its qualitatively different dispersions along the $\Gamma$K and the $\Gamma$M directions of the Brillouin zone have been determined. Our study advocates soft X-ray RIXS and EELS to be a promising combination to investigate electronic excitations in materials.</description>

      <title>Quantifying and Visualizing the Microscopic Degrees of Freedom of Grain Boundaries in the Wigner-Seitz Cell of the Displacement-Shift-Complete Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a grain boundary (GB) translation vector, $\textbf{t}^{WS}$, to describe and quantify the domain of the microscopic degrees of freedom of GBs. It has long been recognized that for fixed macroscopic degrees of freedom of a GB there exists a large multiplicity of states characterized by different relative grain translations. More recently another degree of freedom, $[n]$, the number of GB atoms, has emerged and is now recognized as an equally important component of GB structural multiplicity. In this work, we show that all GB microstates can be uniquely characterized by their value of $\textbf{t}^{WS}$, which is located within the Wigner-Seitz (WS) cell of the Displacement-Shift-Complete lattice (DSCL) of the GB. The GB translation vector captures information about both the translation state and the number of GB atoms. We show that the density of GB microstates inside the cell of the DSCL is not uniform and can form clusters that correspond to different GB phases. The vectors connecting the centers of the clusters correspond to the Burgers vectors of GB phase junctions, which can be predicted without building the junctions. Using $\textbf{t}^{WS}$, we quantify GB excess shear and argue that it is defined up to a DSCL vector, which has implications for thermodynamic equilibrium conditions. Additionally, this work generalizes the definition of the number of GB atoms $[n]$ to asymmetric boundaries.</description>

      <title>Energy filtering-induced ultrahigh thermoelectric power factors in Ni$_3$Ge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional thermoelectric materials rely on low thermal conductivity to enhance their efficiency but suffer from inherently limited power factors. Novel pathways to optimize electronic transport are thus crucial. Here, we achieve ultrahigh power factors in Ni$_3$Ge through a new materials design principle. When overlapping flat and dispersive bands are engineered to the Fermi level, charge carriers can undergo intense interband scattering, yielding an energy filtering effect similar to what has long been predicted in certain nanostructured materials. Via a multi-step DFT-based screening method developed herein, we discover a new family of L1$_2$-ordered binary compounds with ultrahigh power factors up to 11 mW m$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ near room temperature, which are driven by an intrinsic phonon-mediated energy filtering mechanism. Our comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of these new intriguing materials paves the way for understanding and designing high-performance scattering-tuned metallic thermoelectrics.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic Pumping of Orbital Magnetization by Spin Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04938v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose adiabatic pumping of orbital magnetization driven by coherent spin precession, facilitating the rectification of this precession. The orbital magnetization originates from the adiabatic evolution of valence electrons with a topological bulk contribution expressed as a Chern-Simons form. When the precession cone angle of spin $\bm{S}$ is small, the resulting magnetization is proportional to $\bm{S}\times \dot{\bm{S}}$, contributing to the magnon Zeeman effect. With a large cone angle, the magnetization can reach its natural unit, $e/T$, in an antiferromagnetic topological insulator with $e$ as the elementary charge and $T$ as the precession period. This significant magnetization is related to the global properties of the electronic geometric phases in the parameter space spanned by $\bm{S}$ and momentum $\bm{k}$. When the pumped magnetization is inhomogeneous, induced by spin textures or electronic topological phase domains, a dissipationless charge current is also pumped. At last, we discuss the boundary contributions from the spin-driving edge states, which are intricately linked to the gauge-dependent quantum uncertainty of the Chern-Simons form.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of magnetoferroelectricity in monolayer NiBr$_{2}$ and NiI$_{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the magnetoelectric properties of the monolayer NiX$_{2}$ (X = Br, I) through first-principles calculations. Our calculations predict that the NiBr$_{2}$ monolayer exhibits a cycloidal magnetic ground state. For the NiI$_{2}$ monolayer, a proper-screw helical magnetic ground state with modulation vector \(\boldsymbol{Q} = (q, 0, 0)\) is adopted, approximated based on experimental observations. The electric polarization in NiBr$_{2}$ shows a linear dependence on the spin-orbit coupling strength \(\lambda_{\text{SOC}}\), which can be adequately described by the generalized Katsura-Nagaosa-Balatsky (gKNB) model, considering contributions from up to the third nearest-neighbor spin pairs. In contrast, the electric polarization in NiI$_{2}$ exhibits a distinct dependence on \(q\) and \(\lambda_{\text{SOC}}\), which cannot be fully explained by the gKNB mechanism alone. To address this, the \(p\)-\(d\) hybridization mechanism is extended to NiI$_{2}$ to explain the observed behavior. The respective contributions from the \(p\)-\(d\) hybridization and the gKNB mechanism in NiI$_{2}$ are then quantitatively evaluated. Overall, our work elucidates the microscopic mechanisms underlying multiferroicity in NiBr$_{2}$ and NiI$_{2}$ monolayers, with the conclusions readily applicable to their bulk forms.</description>

      <title>Magnetization reversal of finite-length Co and Fe atomic chains on Pt(332) surface: numerical calculations and a new theoretical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different mechanisms of magnetization reversal in finite-length Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface have been investigated, taking into account the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It has been found that the magnetization reversal in short atomic chains occurs through the simultaneous reversal of all magnetic moments. In contrast, the magnetization reversal in long atomic chains is facilitated by the formation of domain walls, which exhibit distinct structures for Co and Fe atomic chains. Using the geodesic nudged elastic band method, we have determined the energy barriers for magnetization reversal in chains consisting of 5 to 100 atoms. Additionally, the frequency prefactors have been calculated within the framework of the harmonic approximation of transition state theory. Notably, the dependencies of these prefactors on chain length and external magnetic field are significant and non-monotonic. We propose a theoretical approach that qualitatively describes the numerical dependencies for both the energy barriers and the frequency prefactors. The magnetization curves derived from our theoretical estimates show qualitative agreement with the results of numerical calculations. This analytical approach enables the estimation of the coercive force of atomic chains across a wide range of lengths, temperatures, sweeping rates, and model parameters. The proposed theoretical framework is applicable not only to the Co and Fe chains on the Pt(332) surface but also to a broad class of one-dimensional magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Electron-phonon coupling in lattice engineering of lithium niobate single crystal thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05060v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lithium niobate (LN) single crystal thin films are a high-performance photonic platform with applications in electro-optic modulators, nonlinear optical devices, optical frequency combs, and acousto-optic modulators. LN's significance in photonics parallels silicon's in electronics, addressing challenges like high power consumption and slow communication speeds, and offering potential for broad applications in optical communications, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Despite progress in developing LN-based photonic structures, achieving low-loss, reconfigurable, and large-scale devices requires improved processing techniques. This work introduces a quantum design methodology based on LN's crystal structure, utilizing electron-phonon coupling through external field perturbations. Multiscale structural analysis is performed with techniques such as time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry, aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, and X-ray absorption spectra to identify and control defect structures. Angle-resolved Raman spectroscopy, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, and Density Functional Theory further reveal the mechanisms of electron-phonon coupling. These findings establish a framework for designing LN-based quantum devices with enhanced performance and diverse functionalities.</description>

      <title>Migration of phthalate plasticisers in heritage objects made of poly(vinyl chloride): mechanical and environmental aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To clean or not to clean? The solution to this dilemma is related to understanding the plasticiser migration which has a few practical implications for the state of museum artefacts made of plasticised poly(vinyl chloride) - PVC and objects stored in their vicinity. The consequences of this process encompass aesthetic changes due to the presence of exudates and dust deposition, an increase in air pollution and the development of mechanical stresses. Therefore, this paper discusses the plasticiser migration in PVC to provide evidence and support the development of recommendations and guidelines for conservators, collection managers and heritage scientists. Particularly, the investigation is focused on the migration of the ortho-phthalates representing the group of the most abundant plasticisers in PVC collections. The predominance of inner diffusion or surface emission (evaporation) determining the rate-limiting step of the overall migration process is considered a fundament for understanding the potential environmental and mechanical risk. According to this concept, general correlations for various ortho-phthalates are proposed depending on their molar mass with the support of molecular dynamics simulations and NMR diffusometry. The study reveals that for the majority of the PVC objects in collections, the risk of accelerated migration upon mild removal of surface plasticiser exudate is low. Thus, surface cleaning would allow for diminishing dust deposition and air pollution by phthalate-emitting objects in a museum environment. Bearing in mind simplicity and the need for fast decision-supporting solutions, the step-by-step protocol for non-destructive identification and quantification of plasticisers in objects made of or containing plasticised PVC, determination of the physical state of investigated artefacts and rate-limiting process of plasticiser migration is proposed.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of a compressible lattice gas crystal: Generalized Gibbs-Duhem equation and adsorption</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressible lattice gas models are used in material science to understand the coupling between composition and strain in alloys. The seminal work in this field is the 1973 Larch\'{e}-Cahn paper (Acta Metall. {\bf 21} 1051-1063). Single-phase crystals in Larch\'{e}-Cahn theory are stable under open constant pressure, constant temperature conditions. The Gibbs free energy does not have to match the product $\mu N$ of the number of particles $N$ and their chemical potential $\mu$. Discrepancies already arise under hydrostatic stress. The reason is that volume strain is defined with respect to a fixed reference state. The elastic energy is not proportional to volume and the Gibbs-Duhem relation valid for liquids is violated. Extensivity can be recovered by treating the number of lattice sites $M$ as an additional thermodynamic variable. This assigns a formal chemical potential $\nu$ to the immobile lattice sites. The difference $ G-\mu N $ can be identified with $\nu M$. We have worked this out for a one-component compressible lattice gas crystal. Shear stress is omitted. The reinstated Gibbs-Duhem equation can be cast in the form of an adsorption equation and applied to quantify the tendency to vacancy creation. The derivative of population with respect to chemical potential at constant pressure and temperature is compared to the corresponding susceptibility in a fixed volume open system. We find that the difference is proportional to the elastic constant of the bare lattice, confirming that this quantity is the crucial macroscopic property distinguishing a solid under hydrostatic stress from a liquid.</description>

      <title>Rashba effect modulation in two-dimensional A2B2Te6 (A = Sb, Bi; B = Si, Ge) materials via charge transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing two-dimensional (2D) Rashba semiconductors, exploring the underlying mechanism of Rashba effect, and further proposing efficient and controllable approaches are crucial for the development of spintronics. On the basis of first-principles calculations, we here theoretically design all possible types (common, inverse, and composite) of Janus structures and successfully achieve numerous ideal 2D Rashba semiconductors from a series of five atomic-layer A2B2Te6 (A = Sb, Bi; B = Si, Ge) materials. Considering the different Rashba constant {\alpha}R and its modulation trend under external electric field, we comprehensively analyze the intrinsic electric field Ein in terms of work function, electrostatic potential, dipole moment, and inner charge transfer. Inspired by the quantitative relationship between charge transfer and the strength of Ein and even the {\alpha}R, we propose a straightforward strategy of introducing a single adatom onto the surface of 2D monolayer to introduce and modulate the Rashba effect. Lastly, we also examine the growth feasibility and electronic structures of the Janus Sb2Ge2Se3Te3 system and Janus-adsorbed systems on a 2D BN substrate. Our work not only conducts a detailed analysis of A2B2Te6-based Rashba systems, but also proposes a new strategy for efficiently and controllably modulating the {\alpha}R through the reconfiguration of charge transfer.</description>

      <title>Application of pretrained universal machine-learning interatomic potential for physicochemical simulation of liquid electrolytes in Li-ion battery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving higher operational voltages, faster charging, and broader temperature ranges for Li-ion batteries necessitates advancements in electrolyte engineering. However, the complexity of optimizing combinations of solvents, salts, and additives has limited the effectiveness of both experimental and computational screening methods for liquid electrolytes. Recently, pretrained universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have emerged as promising tools for computational exploration of complex chemical spaces with high accuracy and efficiency. In this study, we evaluated the performance of the state-of-the-art equivariant pretrained MLIP, SevenNet-0, in predicting key properties of liquid electrolytes, including solvation behavior, density, and ion transport. To assess its suitability for extensive material screening, we considered a dataset comprising 20 solvents. Although SevenNet-0 was predominantly trained on inorganic compounds, its predictions for the properties of liquid electrolytes showed good agreement with experimental and $\textit{ab initio}$ data. However, systematic errors were identified, particularly in the predicted density of liquid electrolytes. To address this limitation, we fine-tuned SevenNet-0, achieving improved accuracy at a significantly reduced computational cost compared to developing bespoke models. Analysis of the training set suggested that the model achieved its accuracy by generalizing across the chemical space rather than memorizing specific configurations. This work highlights the potential of SevenNet-0 as a powerful tool for future engineering of liquid electrolyte systems.</description>

      <title>A Thermodynamic Theory of Proximity Ferroelectricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity has recently been reported as a new design paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material becomes a ferroelectric by interfacing with a thin ferroelectric layer. Strongly polar materials, such as AlN and ZnO, which were previously unswitchable with an external field below their dielectric breakdown fields, can now be switched with practical coercive fields when they are in intimate proximity to a switchable ferroelectric. Here, we develop a general Landau-Ginzburg theory of proximity ferroelectricity in multilayers of non-ferroelectrics and ferroelectrics to analyze their switchability and coercive fields. The theory predicts regimes of both "proximity switching" where the multilayers collectively switch, as well as "proximity suppression" where they collectively do not switch. The mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity is an internal electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness in a self-consistent manner that renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier. Further reduction in the coercive field emerges from charged defects in the bulk that act as nucleation centers. The application of the theory to proximity ferroelectricity in Alx-1ScxN/AlN and Zn1-xMgxO/ZnO bilayers is demonstrated. The theory further predicts that multilayers of dielectric/ferroelectric and paraelectric/ferroelectric layers can potentially result in induced ferroelectricity in the dielectric or paraelectric layers, resulting in the entire stack being switched, an exciting avenue for new discoveries. This thawing of "frozen ferroelectrics", paraelectrics and potentially dielectrics, promises a large class of new ferroelectrics with exciting prospects for previously unrealizable domain-patterned optoelectronic and memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Galvanic molecular intercalation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intercalation of molecular species between the layers of van der Waals (vdW) materials has recently emerged as a powerful approach to combine the remarkable electronic and magnetic properties of vdW materials with the chemical flexibility of organic molecules. However, the full transformative potential of molecular intercalation remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of simple, broadly applicable methods that preserve high crystalline quality down to the few-layer limit. Here, we introduce a simple galvanic approach to intercalate different molecules into various vdW materials under ambient conditions, leveraging the low reduction potential of selected metals to enable a spontaneous molecular insertion. We employ our method, which is particularly well-suited for the in-situ intercalation of few-layer-thick crystals, to intercalate nine vdW materials, including magnets and superconductors, with molecules ranging from conventional alkylammonium ions to metallorganic and bio-inspired chiral cations. Notably, intercalation leads to a molecule-dependent enhancement of the superconducting transition in 2H-TaS2, reaching a critical temperature of 4.7 K, higher than TaS2 monolayers. Additionally, RuCl3 exhibits an unprecedented transition from antiferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic ordering upon intercalation with cobaltocenium. These results establish our approach as a versatile technique for engineering atomically thin quantum materials and heterostructures, unlocking the transformative effects of molecular intercalation.</description>

      <title>MoSi2N4-like crystals -- the new family of two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently-synthesised MoSi2N4 is the first septuple layer two-dimensional material, which doesn't naturally occurs as a layered crystal, and has been obtained with CVD growth. It can be considered as MoN2 crystal (with a crystal structure of MoS2) intercalating Si2N2 two-dimensional layer (with the structure similar to InSe). Such classification gave rise to the understanding of the electronic properties of the material, but also to the prediction of other members of the family (many dozens of them) as well as to the way to classify those. Whereas the originally-synthesised MoSi2N4 is a semiconductor, some of the members of the family are also metallic and some even demonstrate magnetic properties. Interestingly, the room-temperature mobility predicted for such crystals can be as high few thousands cm^2/V*s (hole mobility typically higher than electron) with some record cases as high as 5*10^4 cm^22/V*s, making these materials strong contenders for future electronic applications. The major interest towards these materials is coming from the septuple layer structure, which allows multiple crystal phases, but also complex compositions, in particular those with broken mirror-reflection symmetry against the layer of metal atoms.</description>

      <title>First-Principles and Machine Learning Insights into the Design of DOTT-Carbon and its Lithium-Ion Storage Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon-based materials are promising candidates for developing more efficient green energy conversion and storage technologies. This study presents a new 2D carbon allotrope, DOTT-Carbon, characterized by its distinctive and multi-ring structure featuring 12-, 8-, 4-, and 3-membered rings of carbon atoms. We explore its structural, mechanical, and lithium-ion storage properties by employing density functional theory and machine learning simulations. Phonon calculations confirm its structural stability and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate its thermal resilience at elevated temperatures. The material exhibits anisotropic mechanical properties, with Young's modulus values varying between 280-330 GPa. DOTT-Carbon displays a lithium-ion storage capacity of 446.28 mAh/g, complemented by a low diffusion barrier (0.2-0.9 eV) and a high diffusion coefficient ($ &gt; 1.0 \times 10^{-6}$ cm$^{2}$/s), possibly facilitating efficient lithium-ion transport. The stable open circuit voltage of 0.28 V also indicates its suitability as an anode material.</description>

      <title>Unveiling structure-property correlations in ferroelectric $Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2$ films using variational autoencoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While $Hf_{0.5}Zr_{0.5}O_2$ (HZO) thin films hold significant promise for modern nanoelectronic devices, a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between their polycrystalline structure and electrical properties remains elusive. Here, we present a novel framework combining phase-field (PF) modeling with Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to uncover structure-property correlations in polycrystalline HZO. Leveraging PF simulations, we constructed a high-fidelity dataset of $P-V$ loops by systematically varying critical material parameters, including grain size, polar grain fraction, and crystalline orientation. The VAEs effectively encoded hysteresis loops into a low-dimensional latent space, capturing electrical properties while disentangling complex material parameters interdependencies. We further demonstrate a VAE-based inverse design approach to optimize $P-V$ loop features, enabling the tailored design of device-specific key performance indicators (KPIs), including coercive field, remanent polarization, and loop area. The proposed approach offers a pathway to systematically explore and optimize the material design space for ferroelectric nanoelectronics.</description>

      <title>Novel Electrical Characterization Method for Antiferroelectrics using a Positive Up Negative Down Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of AFE-PUND, a revisited Positive Up Negative Down (PUND) protocol for characterizing antiferroelectric (AFE) materials, in analyzing $ZrO_2$ films across different thicknesses, revealing key trends. The proposed AFE-PUND method enables the isolation of switching currents from non-switching contributions, allowing precise extraction of remanent polarization and coercive field from hysteresis loops. The remanent polarization increases with film thickness, reflecting enhanced domain stability, while endurance cycles highlight the wake-up effect and its eventual degradation due to fatigue in thicker films. Similarly, coercive fields decrease with thickness, indicating reduced switching barriers and a clearer transition between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases. The method provides valuable insights into micro-structural influences, such as defect accumulation, grain size, and domain wall pinning, which critically affect device performance. AFE-PUND thus establishes itself as an essential tool for advancing the understanding and optimization of antiferroelectric materials.</description>

      <title>How quantum selection rules influence the magneto-optical effects of driven, ultrafast magnetization dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast magnetization dynamics driven by ultrashort pump lasers is typically explained by changes in electronic populations and scattering pathways of excited conduction electrons. This conventional approach overlooks the fundamental role of quantum mechanical selection rules, governing transitions from core states to the conduction band, that forms the key method of the probing step in these experiments. By employing fully \textit{ab initio} time-dependent density functional theory, we reveal that these selection rules profoundly influence the interpretation of ultrafast spin dynamics at specific probe energies. Our analysis for hcp Co and fcc Ni at the M edge demonstrates that the transient dynamics, as revealed in pump-probe experiments, arise from a complex interplay of optical excitations of the M shell. Taking into account the selection rules and conduction electron spin flips, this leads to highly energy-dependent dynamics. These findings address longstanding discrepancies in experimental TMOKE measurements and show that only through meticulous consideration of matrix elements at the probe stage, can one ensure that magnetization dynamics is revealed in its true nature, instead of being muddled by artifacts arising from the choice of probe energy.</description>

      <title>Photon State Evolution in Arbitrary Time-Varying Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04836v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the instantaneous eigenstate method to study the evolution of quantum states in media with arbitrary time-varying permittivity and permeability. This method leverages the Heisenberg equation to bypass the Schr\"odinger equation, which leads to a complicated infinite set of coupled differential equations. Instead, the method allows the computation of the state evolution by solving only two coupled differential equations. Using this approach, we draw general conclusions about photon statistics in time-varying media. Our findings reveal that the maximum probability of generating a single photon pair from vacuum in such media is $25\%$, while Bell states can be created with a maximum probability of $84\%$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the spectral profile of emitted photons can be precisely controlled through the temporal profiles of permittivity and permeability. These results provide deeper insights into photon state manipulation in time-varying media. Furthermore, the instantaneous eigenstate method opens new opportunities to study state evolution in other systems where the Heisenberg equation offers a more tractable solution than the Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Modelling complex proton transport phenomena -- Exploring the limits of fine-tuning and transferability of foundational machine-learned force fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The solid acids CsH$_2$PO$_4$ and Cs$_7$(H$_4$PO$_4$)(H$_2$PO$_4$)$_8$ pose significant challenges for the simulation of proton transport phenomena. In this work, we use the recently developed machine-learned force field (MLFF) MACE to model the proton dynamics on nanosecond time scales for these systems and compare its performance with long-term ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. The MACE-MP-0 foundation model shows remarkable performance for all observables derived from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, but minor quantitative discrepancies remain compared to the AIMD reference data. However, we show that minimal fine-tuning -- fitting to as little as 1 ps of AIMD data -- leads to full quantitative agreement between the radial distribution functions of MACE force field and AIMD simulations. In addition, we show that traditional long-term AIMD simulations fail to capture the correct qualitative trends in diffusion coefficients and activation energies for these solid acids due to the limited accessible time scale. In contrast, accurate and convergent diffusion coefficients can be reliably obtained through multi-nanosecond long MD simulations using machine-learned force fields. The obtained qualitative and quantitative behavior of the converged diffusion coefficients and activation energies now matches the experimental trends for both solid acids, in contrast to previous AIMD simulations that yielded a qualitatively wrong picture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum materials hold immense promises for future applications due to their intriguing electronic, magnetic, thermal, and mechanical properties that are often traced to a complex interplay among different microscopic degrees of freedom. Important insights of such interactions come from studying the collective excitations of electrons, spins, orbitals, and lattice, whose cooperative motions play a crucial role in determining the novel behavior of these systems and offer us a key tuning knob to modify material properties on-demand through external perturbations. In this regard, ultrafast light-matter interaction has shown great potential in controlling the couplings of collective excitations, and rapid progress in a plethora of time-resolved techniques down to the attosecond regime has significantly advanced our understanding of the coupling mechanism and guided us in manipulating the dynamical property of quantum materials. This review aims to highlight recent experiments on visualizing collective excitations in the time domain, focusing on the coupling mechanism between different collective modes such as phonon-phonon, phonon-magnon, phonon-exciton, magnon-magnon, magnon-exciton, and various polaritons. We introduce how these collective modes are excited by an ultrashort laser pulse and probed by different ultrafast techniques, and we explain how the coupling between collective excitations governs the ensuing nonequilibrium dynamics. We also provide some perspectives on future studies that can lead to further discoveries regarding the emergent properties of quantum materials both in and out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Improving signal-to-noise ratios in pump-probe spectroscopy on light-sensitive samples by adapting pulse repetition rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05121v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast optical pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study dynamics in solid materials on femto- and picosecond timescales. In such experiments, a pump pulse induces dynamics inside a sample by impulsive light-matter interaction, resulting in dynamics that can be detected using a time-delayed probe pulse. In addition to the desired dynamics, the initial interaction may also lead to unwanted effects that may result in irreversible changes and even damage. Therefore, the achievable signal strength is often limited by the pumping conditions that a sample can sustain. Here we investigate the optimization of ultrafast photoacoustics in various solid thin films. We perform systematic experiments aimed at maximizing the achievable signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio in a given measurement time while limiting sample damage. By varying pump and probe pulse energies, average pump fluence, and repetition rate, we identify different paths towards optimal SNR depending on material properties. Our results provide a strategy for the design of pump-probe experiments, to optimize achievable SNR for samples in which different damage mechanisms may dominate.</description>

      <title>Polymorphism and Magnetism in a Kitaev Honeycomb Cobaltate KCoAsO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the synthesis, crystal structure, and magnetic properties of a new Kitaev honeycomb cobaltate, KCoAsO$_4$, which crystallizes in two distinct forms: $P2/c$ and $R\bar{3}$ space groups. Magnetic measurements reveal ordering temperatures of $\sim$14 K for the $P2/c$ structure and $\sim$10.5 K for the $R\bar{3}$ structure. The $P2/c$-type KCoAsO$_4$ sample exhibits a complex temperature-field phase diagram, including a field-induced phase, while the $R\bar{3}$-type KCoAsO$_4$ shows a simpler phase diagram with a single magnetically ordered phase. The observed differences in magnetic properties are attributed to subtle structural variations, strongly suggesting that local structural changes play a crucial role in determining the magnetism of cobaltate-based Kitaev materials.</description>

      <title>Correlation between Complex Spin Textures and the Magnetocaloric and Hall Effects in Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ ($x$ = 0.9, 1)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the electronic phase diagram of a quantum material as a function of temperature (T) and applied magnetic field (H) forms the basis for understanding the microscopic origin of transport properties, such as the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and topological Hall effect (THE). For many magnetic quantum materials, including EuAl$_4$, a THE arises from a topologically protected magnetic skyrmion lattice with a non-zero scalar spin chirality. We identified a square skyrmion lattice (sSkL) peak in Eu(Ga$_{1-x}$Al$_x$)$_4$ ($x$ = 0.9) identical to the peak previously observed in EuAl$_4$ by performing neutron scattering measurements throughout the phase diagram. Comparing these neutron results with transport measurements, we found that in both compounds the maximal THE does not correspond to the sSkL area. Instead of the maximal THE, the maximal magnetocaloric effect (MCE) boundaries better identify the sSkL lattice phase observed by neutron scattering measurements. The maximal THE therefore arises from interactions of itinerant electrons with frustrated spin fluctuations in a topologically trivial magnetic state.</description>

      <title>Tomographic identification of all molecular orbitals in a wide binding energy range</title>

Abstract: In the past decade, photoemission orbital tomography (POT) has evolved into a powerful tool to investigate the electronic structure of organic molecules adsorbed on surfaces. Here we show that POT allows for the comprehensive experimental identification of all molecular orbitals in a substantial binding energy range, in the present case more than 10 eV. Making use of the angular distribution of photoelectrons as a function of binding energy, we exemplify this by extracting orbital-resolved partial densities of states (pDOS) for 15 $\pi$ and 23 $\sigma$ orbitals from the experimental photoemission intensities of the prototypical organic molecule bisanthene (C$_{28}$H$_{14}$) on a Cu(110) surface. In their entirety, these experimentally measured orbital-resolved pDOS for an essentially complete set of orbitals serve as a stringent benchmark for electronic structure methods, which we illustrate by performing density functional theory (DFT) calculations employing four frequently-used exchange-correlation functionals. By computing the respective molecular-orbital-projected densities of states of the bisanthene/Cu(110) interface, a one-to-one comparison with experimental data for an unprecedented number of 38 orbital energies becomes possible. The quantitative analysis of our data reveals that the range-separated hybrid functional HSE performs best for the investigated organic/metal interface. At a more fundamental level, the remarkable agreement between the experimental and the Kohn-Sham orbital energies over a binding energy range larger than 10\,eV suggests that -- perhaps unexpectedly -- Kohn-Sham orbitals approximate Dyson orbitals, which would rigorously account for the electron extraction process in photoemission spectroscopy but are notoriously difficult to compute, in a much better way than previously thought.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Spin-Crossover Candidates with Equivariant Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Swift discovery of spin-crossover materials for their potential application in quantum information devices requires techniques which enable efficient identification of suitably bistable candidates. To this end, we screened the Cambridge Structural Database to develop a specialized database of 1,439 materials and computed spin-switching energies from density functional theory for each material. The database was used to train an equivariant graph convolutional neural network to predict the magnitude of the spin-conversion energy. A test mean absolute error was 360 meV. For candidate identification, we equipped the system with a relevance-based classifier. This approach leads to a nearly four-fold improvement in identifying potential spin-crossover systems of interest as compared to conventional high-throughput screening.</description>

      <title>Stacking-engineered ferroelectricity and multiferroic order in van der Waals magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20069v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit spontaneous magnetization, polarization or strain (referred to as ferroics) have the potential to revolutionize nanotechnology by enhancing the multifunctionality of nanoscale devices. However, multiferroic order is difficult to achieve, requiring complicated coupling between electron and spin degrees of freedom. We propose a universal method to engineer multiferroics from van der Waals magnets by taking advantage of the fact that changing the stacking between 2D layers can break inversion symmetry, resulting in ferroelectricity and possibly magnetoelectric coupling. We illustrate this concept using first-principles calculations in bilayer NiI$_2$, which can be made ferroelectric upon rotating two adjacent layers by $180^{\circ}$ with respect to the bulk stacking. Furthermore, we discover a novel multiferroic order induced by interlayer charge transfer which couples the interlayer spin order and electronic polarization. Our approach is not only general but also systematic, and can enable the discovery of a wide variety of 2D multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic phase transition into a mixed-CDW state in 1$T$-TaS$_2$ via a thermal quench</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast light-matter interaction has emerged as a new mechanism to exert control over the macroscopic properties of quantum materials toward novel functionality. To date, technological applications of these non-thermal phases are limited by their ultrashort lifetimes and low-ordering temperatures. Among the most studied photoinduced metastable phases for their technological promise is the hidden metallic charge density wave (H-CDW) in the model correlated CDW compound 1$T$-TaS$_2$. Despite active study and engineering, the nature of the photoinduced H-CDW remains the subject of debate and is only accessible at cryogenic temperatures. Here, we stabilize the H-CDW phase at thermal equilibrium up to near-room temperature by accessing an intermediate mixed CDW order regime via thermal quenching. Using x-ray high dynamic range reciprocal space mapping (HDRM) and scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS), we reveal the coexistence of commensurate (C) CDW and H-CDW domains below 180 K during cooling and below 210 K during warming. Our findings show that each order parameter breaks basal plane mirror symmetry with different chiral orientations and induces out-of-plane unit cell tripling in the H-CDW phase. Despite metallic domain walls and a finite density of states at zero bias observed via STS, bulk resistance remains insulating due to CDW stacking disorder. This study establishes the H-CDW as a thermally stable phase and introduces a new mechanism for switchable metallic behavior in thin flakes of 1$T$-TaS$_2$ and similar materials with competing order phases.</description>

      <title>Deconvoluting Thermomechanical Effects in X-ray Diffraction Data using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09447v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: X-ray diffraction is ideal for probing sub-surface state during complex or rapid thermomechanical loading of crystalline materials. However, challenges arise as the size of diffraction volumes increases due to spatial broadening and inability to deconvolute the effects of different lattice deformation mechanisms. Here, we present a novel approach to use combinations of physics-based modeling and machine learning to deconvolve thermal and mechanical elastic strains for diffraction data analysis. The method builds on a previous effort to extract thermal strain distribution information from diffraction data. The new approach is applied to extract the evolution of thermomechanical state during laser melting of an Inconel 625 wall specimen which produces significant residual stress upon cooling. A combination of heat transfer and fluid flow, elasto-plasticity, and X-ray diffraction simulations are used to generate training data for machine-learning (Gaussian Process Regression, GPR) models that map diffracted intensity distributions to underlying thermomechanical strain fields. First-principles density functional theory is used to determine accurate temperature-dependent thermal expansion and elastic stiffness used for elasto-plasticity modeling. The trained GPR models are found to be capable of deconvoluting the effects of thermal and mechanical strains, in addition to providing information about underlying strain distributions, even from complex diffraction patterns with irregularly shaped peaks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conductor materials with good mechanical performance as well as high electrical- and thermal-conductivities are particularly important to break through the current bottle-neck limit ($\sim 100$ T) of pulsed magnets. Here we perform systematic studies on the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires, a promising candidate material for the new-generation pulsed magnets, by employing two independent ultrasonic techniques - resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and ultrasound pulse-echo experiments. Our RUS measurements manifest that the elastic properties of the Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wires can be improved by an electroplastic drawing procedure as compared with the conventional cold drawing. We also take this chance to test the availability of our newly-built ultrasound pulse-echo facility at Wuhan National High Magnetic Field Center (WHMFC, China), and the results suggest that the elastic performance of the electroplastically-drawn Cu-6wt\%Ag alloy wire remains excellent without anomalous softening under extreme conditions, e.g., ultra-high magnetic field up to 50 T, nitrogen / helium cryogenic liquids.</description>

      <title>Theory of the spin Seebeck effect influenced by crystal-field excitations in Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spin Seebeck effect (SSE) is a phenomenon of thermoelectric generation that occurs within a device consisting of a bilayer of a metal and a ferromagnet. When Tb$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$ (TbIG) is substituted for the ferromagnet, the effect goes to zero at low temperatures, yet it increases to positive values with the application of a magnetic field. This is opposite to the expectation that the SSE should be suppressed by a magnetic field due to the increase in the magnon gap. In this paper, the crystal-field excitations (CFE) in TbIG are calculated within a mean field theory exploiting the parameters of Terbium Gallium Garnet Tb$_3$Ga$_5$O$_{12}$ (TGG) from the neutron-scattering experimental literature. Like TGG, the primitive cell of TbIG hosts twelve Tb sites with six inequivalent magnetic sublattices, but due to the net $[111]$-molecular field from the tetrahedral and octahedral Fe ions, these can be classified into two distinct groups, the $\mathbf{C}$ and the $\mathbf{C'}$ sites, which account for the `double umbrella' magnetic structure. We show that when an external magnetic field is applied along the [111] direction of the crystal, the lowest CFE of the $\mathbf{C}$ sublattices decreases. As a consequence of the magnetic field dependence of the lowest CFE, we find that at low temperatures the SSE in TbIG can result enhanced by an applied magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Electron transverse transport enhancement by composite formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04433v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Anomalous transverse transport of electrons such as the anomalous Hall effect and the anomalous Nernst effect provide opportunities to realize advanced spintronic and thermoelectric devices. To materialize these opportunities, it is crucial to strengthen the transverse transport. There have been considerable efforts to find new materials that fulfill this goal. Topological materials received a surge of recent attention in this regard. Here we report a different approach to enhance the transverse transport. Instead of searching for new materials, we propose mixing known materials to form composites. We show theoretically that randomly mixed arrays of two materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse transport than the constituent materials. This enhancement is experimentally demonstrated for mixtures of crystallized and amorphous ferromagnetic metals. We identify the requirement of this enhancement, which can be satisfied by a wide class of materials. Thus, this scheme provides a universal method to strengthen transverse transport, together with rooms to accommodate various engineering requirements for device applications.</description>

      <title>Short-Range Order Based Ultra Fast Large-Scale Modeling of High-Entropy Alloys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18906v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-Entropy Alloys (HEAs) exhibit complex atomic interactions, with short-range order (SRO) playing a critical role in determining their properties. Traditional methods, such as Monte Carlo generator of Special Quasirandom Structures within the Alloy Theoretic Automated Toolkit (ATAT-mcsqs), Super-cell Random Approximates (SCRAPs), and hybrid Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics (MC-MD) are often hindered by limited system sizes and high computational costs. In response, we introduce PyHEA, a Python-based toolkit with a high-performance C++ core that leverages global and local search algorithms, incremental SRO computations, and GPU acceleration for unprecedented efficiency. When constructing random HEAs, PyHEA achieves speedups exceeding 133,000x and 13,900x over ATAT-mcsqs and SCRAPs, respectively, while maintaining high accuracy. PyHEA also offers a flexible workflow that allows users to incorporate target SRO values from external simulations (e.g., LAMMPS or density functional theory (DFT)), thereby enabling more realistic and customizable HEA models. As a proof of concept, PyHEA successfully replicated literature results for a 256,000-atom Fe-Cr-Co system within minutes-an order-of-magnitude improvement over hybrid MC-MD approaches. This dramatic acceleration opens new possibilities for bridging theoretical insights and practical applications, paving the way for the efficient design of next-generation HEAs.</description>

Abstract: This study systematically investigates the electronic structure and bonding properties of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides MX$_2$ (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) using density functional theory calculations. Through the analysis of band gaps, deformation bond energies, and non-Hermitian bonding characteristics of various MX$_2$ compounds, the electronic properties and chemical bonding features are comprehensively examined. The findings demonstrate that charge transfer plays a critical role in electron mass fluctuation, with the incorporation of topological geometric analysis confirming the influence of mass changes on atomic bonding and electronic states. Furthermore, Heterojunctions between distinct atomic layers are shown to effectively modulate the band gap of two-dimensional bilayer transition metal chalcogenides. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for advancing the application of these materials.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the interatomic bonding and electronic properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials is crucial for preparing high-performance 2D semiconductor materials. We have calculated the band structure, electronic properties, and bonding characteristics of SnO in 2D materials by using density functional theory (DFT) and combining bond energy and bond charge models. Atomic bonding analysis enables us to deeply and meticulously analyze the interatomic bonding and charge transfer in the layered structure of SnO. This study greatly enhances our understanding of the local bonding state on the surface of 2D structural materials. In addition, we use the renormalization method to operate energy to determine the wave function at different quantum resolutions. This is of great significance for describing the size and phase transition of nanomaterials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12753v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding how the vibrational and thermal properties of solids are influenced by atomistic structural disorder is of fundamental scientific interest, and paramount to designing materials for next-generation energy technologies. While several studies indicate that structural disorder strongly influences the thermal conductivity, the fundamental physics governing the disorder-conductivity relation remains elusive. Here we show that order-of-magnitude, disorder-induced variations of conductivity in network solids can be predicted from a bond-network entropy, an atomistic structural descriptor that quantifies heterogeneity in the topology of the atomic-bond network. We employ the Wigner formulation of thermal transport to demonstrate the existence of a relation between the bond-network entropy, and observables such as smoothness of the vibrational density of states (VDOS) and macroscopic conductivity. We also show that the smoothing of the VDOS encodes information about the thermal resistance induced by disorder, and can be directly related to phenomenological models for phonon-disorder scattering based on the semiclassical Peierls-Boltzmann equation. Our findings rationalize the conductivity variations of disordered carbon polymorphs ranging from nanoporous electrodes to defective graphite used as a moderator in nuclear reactors.</description>

Abstract: This paper analyzes a peculiar phenomenon of non-reciprocal domain wall pairs and illustrate the implications in ab-initio-based atomistic computational experiments with (112)-oriented planar R180 domain walls within the canonical multiferroic ferroelectric crystal of BiFeO3. Results show that parallel walls on the opposite sides of a given domain within a simply twinned lamellar domain structure can have considerably different polarization and oxygen octahedra tilt profiles, different thickness and energy densities. The spontaneous formation of zigzag walls and triangular domains suggests that these domain walls are actually the lowest energy planar R180 walls in pure insulating BiFeO3 crystals and films.</description>

Abstract: Composites of ferroelectric and paraelectric perovskites have attracted a lot of attention due to their application potential in energy storage as well as novel computing and memory devices. So far the main focus of research has been on superlattices and ferroelectric particles in a paraelectric matrix, while the impact of paraelectric inclusions on the ferroelectric matrix is surprisingly underrepresented. To close this gap in knowledge we perform molecular dynamics simulations using an $ab\ initio$ derived effective Hamiltonian for BaTiO$_3$--SrTiO$_3$ and reveal the dependency of phase stability and phase transitions on the size and distances of paraelectric inclusions. We discuss how the combination of compressive strain and depolarization fields at the SrTiO$_3$ interfaces induces large local polarization, complex domain structures and coexisting phases as well as diffuse phase transitions and reduced coercive fields.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting spintronics explores the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism, sparking significant interest in nonunitary superconductors as a platform for novel magneto-superconducting phenomena. However, identifying nonunitary superconductors remains challenging. We demonstrate that spin current driven by thermal gradients sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. Spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space induces the superconducting spin Seebeck effect, where a spin current is generated along thermal gradients without a thermoelectric charge current. Notably, the nonvanishing superconducting spin Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity because it reflects the spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. At the same time, the spin-chirality of the condensate induces the spin-Nernst effect, where a spin current is generated perpendicular to thermal gradients in nonunitary superconductors. These spin caloritronics phenomena offer a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of cathodoluminescence from photon statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12824v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cathodoluminescence (CL), the emission of light induced by accelerated free electrons, has been extensively utilized in various applications, such as displays, streak cameras, and high-spatial-resolution analysis of optical material, surpassing the diffraction limit of light. Despite its long history, the photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing unexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon bunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the photon emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each excitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we experimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a single electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple excitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for particle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade reactions.</description>

      <title>Complete mathematical theory of the jamming transition: A perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21439v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The jamming transition of frictionless athermal particles is a paradigm to understand the mechanics of amorphous materials at the atomic scale. Concepts related to the jamming transition and the mechanical response of jammed packings have cross-fertilized into other areas such as atomistic descriptions of the elasticity and plasticity of glasses. In this perspective article, the microscopic mathematical theory of the jamming transition is reviewed from first-principles. The starting point of the derivation is a microscopically-reversible particle-bath Hamiltonian from which the governing equation of motion for the grains under an external deformation is derived. From this equation of motion, microscopic expressions are obtained for both the shear modulus and the viscosity as a function of the distance from the jamming transition (respectively, above and below the transition). Regarding the vanishing of the shear modulus at the unjamming transition, this theory, as originally demonstrated in [Zaccone &amp; Scossa-Romano, Phys. Rev. B 83, 184205 (2011)], is currently the only quantitative microscopic theory in parameter-free agreement with numerical simulations of [O'Hern et al. Phys. Rev. E 68, 011306 (2003)] for jammed packings. The divergence of the viscosity upon approaching the jamming transition from below is derived here, for the first time, from the same microscopic Hamiltonian. The quantitative microscopic prediction of the diverging viscosity is shown to be in fair agreement with numerical results of sheared 2D soft disks from [Olsson &amp; Teitel, Phys. Rev. Lett. 99, 178001 (2007)].</description>

      <title>Persistent Homology for Structural Characterization in Disordered Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14390v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a unified framework based on persistent homology (PH) to characterize both local and global structures in disordered systems. It can simultaneously generate local and global descriptors using the same algorithm and data structure, and has shown to be highly effective and interpretable in predicting particle rearrangements and classifying global phases. We also demonstrated that using a single variable enables a linear SVM to achieve nearly perfect three-phase classification. Inspired by this discovery, we define a non-parametric metric, the Separation Index (SI), which not only achieves this classification without sacrificing significant performance but also establishes a connection between particle environments and the global phase structure. Our methods provide an effective framework for understanding and analyzing the properties of disordered materials, with broad potential applications in materials science and even wider studies of complex systems.</description>

      <title>High-temperature field-free superconducting diode effect in high-Tc cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02425v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE) is defined by the difference in the magnitude of critical currents applied in opposite directions. It has been observed in various superconducting systems and attracted high research interests. However, the operating temperature of the SDE is typically low and/or the sample structure is rather complex. For the potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, efficient superconducting diodes working in zero magnetic field with high operating temperatures and a simple configuration are highly desired. Here, we report the observation of a SDE under zero magnetic field with operating temperatures up to 72 K and efficiency as high as 22% at 53 K in high-transition-temperature (high-Tc) cuprate superconductor Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta} (BSCCO) flake devices. The rectification effect persists beyond two hundred sweeping cycles, confirming the stability of the superconducting diode. Our results offer promising developments for potential applications in non-dissipative electronics, and provide insights into the mechanism of field-free SDE and symmetry breakings in high-Tc superconductors.</description>

      <title>Broadband electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ at mK temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ single crystals at sub-Kelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR-spectra between 0 mT and 50 mT. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.</description>
