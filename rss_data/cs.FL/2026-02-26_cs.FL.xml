      <title>Regular Expression Denial of Service Induced by Backreferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first systematic study of denial-of-service vulnerabilities in Regular Expressions with Backreferences (REwB). We introduce the Two-Phase Memory Automaton (2PMFA), an automaton model that precisely captures REwB semantics. Using this model, we derive necessary conditions under which backreferences induce super-linear backtracking runtime, even when sink ambiguity is linear -- a regime where existing detectors report no vulnerability. Based on these conditions, we identify three vulnerability patterns, develop detection and attack-construction algorithms, and validate them in practice. Using the Snort intrusion detection ruleset, our evaluation identifies 45 previously unknown REwB vulnerabilities with quadratic or worse runtime. We further demonstrate practical exploits against Snort, including slowing rule evaluation by 0.6-1.2 seconds and bypassing alerts by triggering PCRE's matching limit.</description>

      <title>Symbols frequencies in the Thue--Morse word in base $3/2$ and related conjectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a binary Thue--Morse-type sequence arising from the base-$3/2$ expansion of integers, an archetypal automatic sequence in a rational base numeration system. Because the sequence is generated by a periodic iteration of morphisms rather than a single primitive substitution, classical Perron--Frobenius methods do not directly apply to determine symbol frequencies. We prove that both symbols ${\tt 0},{\tt 1}$ occur with frequency $1/2$ and we show uniform recurrence and symmetry properties of its set of factors. The proof reveals a structural bridge between combinatorics on words and harmonic analysis: the first difference sequence is shown to be Toeplitz, providing dynamical rigidity, while filtered frequencies naturally encode a dyadic structure that lifts to the compact group of $2$-adic integers. In this $2$-adic setting, desubstitution becomes a linear operator on Fourier coefficients, and a spectral contraction argument enforces uniqueness of limiting densities. Our results answer several conjectures of Dekking (on a sibling sequence) and illustrate how harmonic analysis on compact groups can be fruitfully combined with substitution dynamics.</description>

      <title>Enumeration for MSO-Queries on Compressed Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03067v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of enumerating the answers to a query formulated in monadic second order logic (MSO) over an unranked forest F that is compressed by a straight-line program (SLP) D. Our main result states that this can be done after O(|D|) preprocessing and with output-linear delay (in data complexity). This is a substantial improvement over the previously known algorithms for MSO-evaluation over trees, since the compressed size |D| might be much smaller than (or even logarithmic in) the actual data size |F|, and there are linear time SLP-compressors that yield very good compressions on practical inputs. In particular, this also constitutes a meta-theorem in the field of algorithmics on SLP-compressed inputs: all enumeration problems on trees or strings that can be formulated in MSO-logic can be solved with linear preprocessing and output-linear delay, even if the inputs are compressed by SLPs. We also show that our approach can support vertex relabelling updates in time that is logarithmic in the uncompressed data. Our result extends previous work on the enumeration of MSO-queries over uncompressed trees and on the enumeration of document spanners over compressed text documents.</description>

      <title>Neuro-Symbolic Generation of Explanations for Robot Policies with Weighted Signal Temporal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21841v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural network-based policies have demonstrated success in many robotic applications, but often lack human-explanability, which poses challenges in safety-critical deployments. To address this, we propose a neuro-symbolic explanation framework that generates a weighted signal temporal logic (wSTL) specification to describe a robot policy in a interpretable form. Existing methods typically produce explanations that are verbose and inconsistent, which hinders explainability, and loose, which do not give meaningful insights into the underlying policy. We address these issues by introducing a simplification process consisting of predicate filtering, regularization, and iterative pruning. We also introduce three novel explainability evaluation metrics -- conciseness, consistency, and strictness -- to assess explanation quality beyond conventional classification metrics. Our method is validated in three simulated robotic environments, where it outperforms baselines in generating concise, consistent, and strict wSTL explanations without sacrificing classification accuracy. This work bridges policy learning with formal methods, contributing to safer and more transparent decision-making in robotics.</description>
