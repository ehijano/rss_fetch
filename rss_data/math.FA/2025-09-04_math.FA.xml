      <title>The Berger-Wang formula for order-preserving homogeneous maps on cones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the joint spectral radius and generalized spectral radius are equal for any bounded, equicontinuous family of order-preserving, homogeneous maps on a polyhedral cone. We also consider conditions which guarantee that the semigroup generated by a family of order-preserving, homogeneous maps is bounded when its generalized spectral radius $r(\mathcal{A}) = 1$. Finally, we extend the notions of joint and generalized spectral subradii to the setting of homogeneous maps on wedges.</description>

      <title>Integrated Semigroups for abstract differential-algebraic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integrated semigroups for infinite-dimensional differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) admitting a resolvent index. Building on the notion of integrated semigroups for the abstract Cauchy problem $\frac{d}{d t}x=Ax$, we extend this concept to the DAE setting. The resulting framework is used to analyze inhomogeneous DAEs and plays a central role in characterizing their solutions.</description>

      <title>Fractional integral on Hardy spaces on product domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using the vector-valued theory of singular integrals, we prove a Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality on product Hardy spaces $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$, which is a parallel result of the classical Hardy--Littlewood--Sobolev inequality. The same technique shows the $H^p_{\rm{prod}}$-boundedness of the iterated Hilbert transform. As a byproduct, new proofs of several recently discovered Hardy type inequalities on product Hardy spaces are obtained, which avoid complicated Calder\'on--Zygmund theory on product domain, rendering them considerably simpler than the original proofs.</description>

      <title>Finite dimensional approximations for Hilbert space operators and applications in Quantum Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a unified framework for quasidiagonal and F\o lner-type approximations of linear operators on Hilbert spaces. These approximations (originally formulated for bounded operators and operator algebras) involve sequences of non-zero finite rank orthogonal projections that asymptotically commute with the operator -- either in norm (quasidiagonal) or in mean (F\o lner). Such structures guarantee spectral approximation results in terms of their finite sections. We extend this theory to unbounded, densely defined closable operators, establishing a generalization of Halmos' classical result: every closable quasidiagonal operator is a compact perturbation of a closable block-diagonal operator on the same domain. Likewise, we introduce sparse F\o lner sequences and establish an interplay between quasidiagonal approximations and the existence of sparse F\o lner sequences. The theoretical developments are illustrated with explicit examples using different types of weighted shifts and applied to quantum mechanical models, including a detailed treatment of the Weyl algebra and its Schr\"odinger representation.</description>

      <title>On Markushevich bases $\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ for their closed span in weighted $L^2 (A)$ spaces over sets $A\subset [0,\infty)$ of positive Lebesgue measure, hereditary completeness, and moment problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the work of Borwein and Erdelyi \cite{BE1997JAMS} on generalizations of M\"{u}ntz's theorem, we investigate the properties of the system $\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in weighted $L^p (A)$ spaces, for $p\ge 1$, denoted by $L^p_w (A)$, where
  (I) $A$ is a measurable subset of the real half-line $[0,\infty)$ having positive Lebesgue measure,
  (II) $w$ is a non-negative integrable function defined on $A$, and
  (III) $\{\lambda_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a strictly increasing sequence of positive real numbers such that
  $\inf\{\lambda_{n+1}-\lambda_n \}&gt;0$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\lambda_n^{-1}&lt;\infty$.
  We prove that a function $f$ in $\overline{\text{span}}\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in the Hilbert space $L^2_w (A)$, admits the $\bf{Fourier-type}$ series representation $f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \langle f, r_n\rangle_{w,A} x^{\lambda_n}$ a.e on $A$, where $\{r_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is the unique biorthogonal family of $\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $\overline{\text{span}}\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $L^2_w (A)$. As a result, we show that the system $\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is a $\bf{Markushevich\,\, basis}$ for $\overline{\text{span}}\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in $L^2_w (A)$. Furthermore, we consider a $\bf{moment\,\, problem}$. Finally, if $m\le w(x)\le M$ on $A$ for some positive numbers $m$ and $M$ and the set $A$ contains an interval $[a, r_A]$, where $a\ge 0$ and $r_A$ is the essential supremum of $A$, we prove that the system $\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ is $\bf{hereditarily\,\, complete}$ in $\overline{\text{span}}\{x^{\lambda_n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ in the space $L^2_w(A)$. As a result, a general class of compact operators on the closure is constructed that admit spectral synthesis.</description>

      <title>Exponential ergodicity of mean-field Langevin dynamics by synchronous coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.03124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As an example of the nonlinear Fokker-Planck equation, the mean field Langevin dynamics recently attracts attention due to its connection to (noisy) gradient descent on infinitely wide neural networks in the mean field regime, and hence the convergence property of the dynamics is of great theoretical interest. In this paper, In the continuity of [1, 2], we are interested by the long-time behavior and uniform in time propagation of chaos by synchronous coupling for mean-field Langevin dynamics (over- and under-damped).</description>

      <title>The Mackey-Gleason-Bunce-Wright problem for vector-valued measures on projections in a JBW$^*$-algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{P} (\mathfrak{J})$ denote the lattice of projections of a JBW$^*$-algebra $\mathfrak{J}$, and let $X$ be a Banach space. A bounded finitely additive $X$-valued measure on $\mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{J})$ is a mapping $\mu: \mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{J}) \rightarrow X$ satisfying:
  $(a)$ $\mu(p +q) = \mu(p) + \mu(q)$, whenever $p \circ q = 0$ in $\mathcal{P} (\mathfrak{J})$,
  $(b)$ $\sup \{ \| \mu(p)\| \, : \, p \in \mathcal{P} (\mathfrak{J})\} &lt; \infty$.
  In this paper we establish a Mackey-Gleason-Bunce-Wright theorem by showing that if $\mathfrak{J}$ contains no type $I_2$ direct summand, every bounded finitely additive measure $\mu: \mathcal{P}(\mathfrak{J}) \rightarrow X$ admits an extension to a bounded linear operator from $\mathfrak{J}$ to $X$. This solves a long-standing open conjecture.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable Schr\"odinger operators related to the hypergeometric equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators defined as closed operators that are exactly solvable in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function. We allow the potentials to be complex.
  These operators fall into three groups. The first group can be reduced to the Gegenbauer equation, up to an affine transformation, a special case of the hypergeometric equation. The two other groups, which we call {\em hypergeometric of the first}, resp. {\em second kind}, can be reduced to the general Gauss hypergeometric equation. Each of the group is subdivided in three families, acting to on the Hilbert space $L^2]-1,1[,$ $L^2(\rr_+)$ resp. $L^2(\rr)$. Motivated by geometric applications of these families, we call them {\em spherical}, {\em hyperbolic}, resp. {\em deSitterian}. All these families are known from applications in Quantum Mechanics: e.g. spherical hypergeometric Schr\"odinger operators of the first kind are often called {\em trigonometric P\"oschl-Teller Hamiltonians}.
  For operators belonging to each family we compute their spectrum and determine their Green function (the integral kernel of their resolvent). We also describe transmutation identities that relate these Green functions. These identities interchange spectral parameters with coupling constants across different operator families. Finally, we describe how these operators arise from separation of variables of (pseudo-)Laplacians on symmetric manifolds.
  Our paper can be viewed as a sequel to \cite{DL}, where closed realizations of one-dimensional Schr\"odinger operators solvable in terms Kummer's confluent equation were studied.</description>

      <title>Singular Sets of Riemannian Exponential Maps in Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the singular sets for the Lagrangian solution maps of the two-dimensional inviscid Euler and generalized surface quasi-geostrophic equations are Gaussian null sets. To achieve this we carry out a spectral analysis of an operator related to the coadjoint representation of the algebra of divergence-free vector fields on the fluid domain. In particular, we establish sharp results on the Schatten-von Neumann class to which this operator belongs. Furthermore, its failure to be compact is directly connected to the absence of Fredholm properties of the corresponding Lagrangian solution maps. We show that, for the three-dimensional Euler equations and the standard surface quasi-geostrophic equation, this failure is in fact essential.</description>

      <title>Local boundary conditions in nonlocal hyperelasticity via heterogeneous horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a class of variational problems with integral functionals involving nonlocal gradients. These models have been recently proposed as refinements of classical hyperelasticity, aiming for an effective framework to capture also discontinuous and singular material effects. Specific to our set-up is a space-dependent interaction range that vanishes at the boundary of the reference domain. This ensures that the nonlocal operator depends only on values within the domain and localizes to the classical gradient at the boundary, which allows for a seamless integration of nonlocal modeling with local boundary values. The main contribution of this work is a comprehensive theory for the newly introduced associated Sobolev spaces, including the rigorous treatment of a trace operator and Poincar\'e inequalities. A central aspect of our technical approach lies in exploiting connections with pseudo-differential operator theory. As an application, we establish the existence of minimizers for functionals with quasiconvex or polyconvex integrands depending on heterogeneous nonlocal gradients, subject to local Dirichlet, Neumann or mixed-type boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>A Brenier Theorem on $(\mathcal{P}_2 (\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d )), W_2 )$ and Applications to Adapted Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brenier's fundamental theorem characterizes optimal transport plans for measures $\mu, \nu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$ and quadratic distance costs in terms of gradients of convex functions. In particular it guarantees the existence of optimal transport maps for measures which are absolutely continuous wrt Lebesgue measure.
  Our goal is to provide a version of this result for measures $P,Q$ on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ and costs given by the squared Wasserstein distance $W_2^2(\mu, \nu)$. We characterize optimizers in terms of convexity of the Lions lift. This is based on an observation which seems to be of independent interest: the $c$-transform of a functional $\phi$, where $c(\mu, \nu)$ denotes maximal covariance of $\mu, \nu$ corresponds precisely to the Legendre transform of the Lions lift of $\phi$. Moreover we show that for typical $P \in\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ the optimizer is unique and given by a transport map. In the absence of a canonical reference measure on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ we use a topological notion to make `typical' precise. Specifically we show that the transport regular measures are of second Baire category.
  A particular motivation for our article stems from the theory of adapted transport where the adapted Wasserstein distance provides an adequate distance between stochastic processes. In contrast to other metrics, the adapted Wasserstein distance yields continuity of Doob-decomposition, optimal stopping and stochastic control problems. Based on our results for measures on $\mathcal{P}_2(\mathbb{R}^d)$ we obtain a first Brenier-type theorem for the adapted Wasserstein distance.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we characterize completely alternating functions on an abelian semigroup $S$ in terms of completely monotone functions on the product semigroup $S\times \mathbb Z_+$. We also discuss completely alternating sequences induced by a class of rational functions and obtain a set of sufficient conditions (in terms of it's zeros and poles) to determine them. As an application, we show a complete characterization of several classes of completely monotone functions on $\mathbb Z_+^2$ induced by rational functions in two variables. We also derive a set of necessary conditions for the complete monotonicity of the sequence $\{\prod_{i=1}^{k}\frac{(n+a_i)}{(n+b_i)}\}_{n \in \mathbb Z_+}, a_i, b_i \in (0,\infty)$</description>

      <title>On similarity to contraction semigroups and tensor products, I</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of finite tensor products of Hilbert spaces, we prove that similarity of a tensor product of operator semigroups to a contraction semigroup is equivalent to the corresponding similarity for each factor, after an appropriate rescaling. A similar result holds with contractivity replaced by quasi-contractivity. This splitting phenomenon allows us to construct new and, in a sense, the strongest possible examples of $C_0$-semigroups not similar to contractions, thus completing an important chapter of the theory. We also address the discrete setting and relate it to our results.</description>

      <title>Similarity to contraction semigroups: structural properties, criteria, and applications to control theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reveal new aspects of the structure of Hilbert space $C_0$-semigroups $\mathcal T = (T(t))_{t\ge 0}$ similar to semigroups of contractions. In particular, we prove that $\mathcal T$ is similar to a semigroup of contractions if and only if $\mathcal T$ is similar to a quasi-contraction $C_0$-semigroup and $T(t)$ is similar to a contraction for a single $t&gt;0.$ Moreover, our methods allow us to estimate the corresponding similarity constants and clarify their role in the study of similarity to contractions. Along the way, we obtain similarity conditions involving unbounded operators and imposing minimal assumptions on regularity of $\mathcal T$. Such a general setting allows us to find significant applications to control theory, including characterizations of exactly observable and exactly controllable systems. Finally we establish several criteria of the same flavor for similarity to isometric semigroups, and illustrate the developed theory by a number of pertinent examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.00867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-dimensional linear Schr\"odinger equations with multiple moving potentials, known as transfer charge models. Focusing on the non-self-adjoint setting that arises in the study of solitons, we systematically develop the scattering theory and establish dispersive estimates under the assumption that the potentials move at significantly different velocities, even in the presence of unstable modes. In particular, we prove the existence of wave operators, asymptotic completeness, and pointwise decay of solutions, without requiring the absence of threshold resonances. Our analysis set up the fundamental work for studying the nonlinear dynamics of multi-solitons, including asymptotic stability and collisions.</description>

      <title>Bicomplex Hardy Classes of Solutions to Higher-Order Vekua Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend representation formulas for functions in Hardy classes of solutions to higher-order iterated Vekua equations to Hardy classes of bicomplex-valued functions that solve a bicomplex version of the Vekua equation or its higher-order generalizations. Using these representations, we show that functions in these bicomplex-valued Hardy classes have nontangential boundary values and boundary values in the sense of distributions.</description>

      <title>Non-Asymptotic Stability and Consistency Guarantees for Physics-Informed Neural Networks via Coercive Operator Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13554v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified theoretical framework for analyzing the stability and consistency of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), grounded in operator coercivity, variational formulations, and non-asymptotic perturbation theory. PINNs approximate solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs) by minimizing residual losses over sampled collocation and boundary points. We formalize both operator-level and variational notions of consistency, proving that residual minimization in Sobolev norms leads to convergence in energy and uniform norms under mild regularity. Deterministic stability bounds quantify how bounded perturbations to the network outputs propagate through the full composite loss, while probabilistic concentration results via McDiarmid's inequality yield sample complexity guarantees for residual-based generalization. A unified generalization bound links residual consistency, projection error, and perturbation sensitivity. Empirical results on elliptic, parabolic, and nonlinear PDEs confirm the predictive accuracy of our theoretical bounds across regimes. The framework identifies key structural principles, such as operator coercivity, activation smoothness, and sampling admissibility, that underlie robust and generalizable PINN training, offering principled guidance for the design and analysis of PDE-informed learning systems.</description>

      <title>Doubly Commuting Semigroups of Isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.00409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss the structure of doubly commuting semigroups of isometries. We record a new proof of Cooper's theorem in the Hilbert module setting. We discuss the Fell topology on the set of equivalence classes of irreducible, doubly commuting isometric representations of $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{d}$. We show that if $d$ is finite, the topology is $T_0$. We indicate the pathologies that occur when $d=\infty$. In particular, we show that Wold decomposition fails for isometric representations of $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{\infty}$ and prove that the Fell topology on the set of equivalence classes of irreducible, doubly commuting isometric representations of $\mathbb{R}_{+}^{\infty}$ is not $T_0$</description>
