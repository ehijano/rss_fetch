      <title>A note on $\mathscr{B}$-free sets and the existence of natural density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given $\mathscr{B}\subseteq \mathbb{N}$, let $\mathcal{M}_\mathscr{B}=\bigcup_{b\in\mathscr{B}}b\mathbb{Z}$ be the correspoding set of multiples. We say that $\mathscr{B}$ is taut if the logarithmic density of $\mathcal{M}_\mathscr{B}$ decreases after removing any element from $\mathscr{B}$. We say that $\mathscr{B}$ is minimal if it is primitive (i.e.\ $b| b'$ for $b,b'\in\mathscr{B}$ implies $b=b'$) and the characteristic function $\eta$ of $\mathcal{M}_\mathscr{B}$ is a Toeplitz sequence (i.e.\ for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$ there exists $s_n$ such that $\eta$ is constant along $n+s_n\mathbb{Z}$). With every $\mathscr{B}$ one associates the corresponding taut set $\mathscr{B}'$ (determined uniquely among all taut sets by the condition that the associated Mirsky measures agree) and the minimal set $\mathscr{B}^*$ (determined uniquely among all minimal sets by the condition that every configuration appearing on $\mathcal{M}_{\mathscr{B}^*}$ appears on $\mathcal{M}_\mathscr{B}$: for every $n\in \mathbb{N}$, there exists $k\in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $\mathcal{M}_{\mathscr{B}^*}\cap [0,n]=\mathcal{M}_\mathscr{B} \cap[k,k+n]-k$). Besicovitch [2] gave an example of $\mathscr{B}$ whose set of multiples does not have the natural density. It was proved in [7, Lemma 4.18] that if $\mathcal{M}_{\mathscr{B}'}$ posses the natural density then so does $\mathcal{M}_\mathscr{B}$. In this paper we show that this is the only obstruction: every configuration $ijk\in \{0,1\}^3$ (with $ij\neq 01$), encoding the information on the existence of the natural density for the triple $\mathcal{M}_\mathscr{B},\mathcal{M}_{\mathscr{B'}},\mathcal{M}_{\mathscr{B}^*}$, can occur. Furthermore, we show that $\mathcal{M}_\mathscr{B}$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\mathscr{B}'}$ can differ along a set of positive upper density.</description>

      <title>A panoramic view of exponential attractors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We state necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of $T$-discrete exponential attractors for semigroups in complete metric spaces. These conditions are formulated in terms of a covering condition for iterates of the absorbing set under the time evolution of the semigroup and imply the existence and finite-dimensionality of the global attractor. We then review, generalize and compare existing construction methods for exponential attractors and show that they all imply the covering condition. Furthermore, we relate the results and concept of $T$-discrete exponential attractors to the classical notion of exponential attractors.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity and transitivity for the induced maps on symmetric product suspensions of a topological space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a nondegenerate compact perfect and Hausdorff topological space $X$,$n\in \mathbb{N}$ and a function $f:X\rightarrow X$, we consider the $n$-fold symmetric product of $X$, $F_n(X)$ and the induced function $F_n(f):F_n(X)\rightarrow F_n(X)$. If $n\geq2$, we consider the $n$-fold symmetric product suspension of $X$, $SF_n(X)$ and the induced function$SF_n(f):SF_n(X)\rightarrow SF_n(X)$. In this paper, we study the relationships between the following statements: (1) $f\in \mathcal{M}$,(2) $F_n(f)\in \mathcal{M}$, and (3)$SF_n(f)\in \mathcal{M}$, where $\mathcal{M}$ is one of the following classes of map: sensitive, cofinitely sensitive, multi-sensitive, Z-transitive, quasi-periodic, accessible, indecomposable, multi-transitive, $\bigtriangleup$-transitive, $\bigtriangleup$-mixing, Martelli's chaos, Transitive, $F$-system, $TT_{++}$, Touhey, two-sided transitive, fully exact, strongly transitive. These results improve and extend some existing ones.</description>

      <title>Evaluating interventions for Plasmodium vivax forest malaria using a three-scale mathematical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rising proportion of Plasmodium vivax cases concentrated in forest-fringe areas across the Greater Mekong Subregion highlights the importance of pharmaceutical and mosquito control techniques specifically targeted towards forest-going populations. To mathematically assess best-possible antimalarial interventions in the context of hypnozoite reactivation and seasonal forest migration, we extend a previously developed three-scale integro-differential equations model of P. vivax transmission. In particular, we fit the model to data gathered over a four-year period in Vietnam to gain insight into local P. vivax dynamics and validate the model's ability to capture epidemiological trends. The calibrated model is then used to generate optimal schedules for mass-drug administration (MDA) in forest-goers and gauge the efficacy of vector control techniques (such as long-lasting insecticide nets and indoor residual spraying) in forest-adjacent areas. Our results highlight the dependence of optimal MDA timing on the demographics of the human population, the importance of interventions targeting the mosquito bite rate, and the need for efficacy in hypnozoite-targeting antimalarial drugs.</description>

      <title>Data-driven balanced truncation for second-order systems with generalized proportional damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured reduced-order modeling is a central component in the computer-aided design of control systems in which cheap-to-evaluate low-dimensional models with physically meaningful internal structures are computed. In this work, we develop a new approach for the structured data-driven surrogate modeling of linear dynamical systems described by second-order time derivatives via balanced truncation model-order reduction. The proposed method is a data-driven reformulation of position-velocity balanced truncation for second-order systems and generalizes the quadrature-based balanced truncation for unstructured first-order systems to the second-order case. The computed surrogates encode a generalized proportional damping structure, and the damping coefficients are inferred solely from data by minimizing a least-squares error over the coefficients. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates exponential mixing of the invariant measure for randomly forced nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation, with damping and random noise localized in space. Our study emphasizes the crucial role of exponential asymptotic compactness and control properties in establishing the ergodic properties of random dynamical systems. This work extends the series [15, 45] on the statistical behavior of randomly forced dispersive equations.</description>

      <title>Minimality and computability of languages of G-shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the notion of strong computable type for sets in computable analysis, we define the notion of strong computable type for $G$-shifts, where $G$ is a finitely generated group with decidable word problem. A $G$-shift has strong computable type if one can compute its language from the complement of its language. We obtain a characterization of $G$-shifts with strong computable type in terms of a notion of minimality with respect to properties with a bounded computational complexity. We provide a self-contained direct proof, and also explain how this characterization can be obtained from an existing similar characterization for sets by Amir and Hoyrup, and discuss its connexions with results by Jeandel on closure spaces. We apply this characterization to several classes of shifts that are minimal with respect to specific properties. This provides a unifying approach that not only generalizes many existing results but also has the potential to yield new findings effortlessly. In contrast to the case of sets, we prove that strong computable type for G-shifts is preserved under products. We conclude by discussing some generalizations and future directions.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of Optimal Control Solutions and Quantities of Interest with Respect to Component Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10804v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work establishes sensitivities of the solution of an optimal control problem (OCP) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state/control-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs and the objective function. This extends existing OCP sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the OCP solution with respect to state/control-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carath\'eodory-type assumptions, the Implicit Function Theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fr\'echet differentiability of the OCP solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the QoI when the component function is perturbed. Applicability of the theoretical results is demonstrated on a trajectory optimization problem for a hypersonic vehicle.</description>

      <title>Coherence and Transients in Nonlocally Coupled Dissipative Kicked Rotors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of nonlocally coupled dissipative kicked rotors is rich and complex. In this study, we consider a network of rotors where each interacts equally with a certain range of its neighbors. We focus on the influence of the coupling strength and the coupling range, and show both analytically and numerically the critical transitions in the phase diagram, which include bifurcations of simple spatiotemporal patterns and changes in basin sizes of coherent states with different wavenumbers. We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold.</description>

      <title>Exponential dichotomy for dynamically defined matrix-valued Jacobi operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.10900v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present in this work a proof of the exponential dichotomy for dynamically defined matrix-valued Jacobi operators in $(\mathbb{C}^{l})^{\mathbb{Z}}$, given for each $\omega \in \Omega$ by the law $[H_{\omega} \textbf{u}]_{n} := D(T^{n - 1}\omega) \textbf{u}_{n - 1} + D(T^{n}\omega) \textbf{u}_{n + 1} + V(T^{n}\omega) \textbf{u}_{n}$, where $\Omega$ is a compact metric space, $T: \Omega \rightarrow \Omega$ is a minimal homeomorphism and $D, V: \Omega \rightarrow M(l, \mathbb{R})$ are continuous maps with $D(\omega)$ invertible for each $\omega\in\Omega$. Namely, we show that for each $\omega\in\Omega$,
  \[\rho(H_{\omega})=\{z \in \mathbb{C}\mid (T, A_z)\;\mathrm{is\; uniformly\; hyperbolic}\}, \] where $\rho(H_{\omega})$ is the resolvent set of $H_\omega$ and $(T, A_z)$ is the $SL(2l,\mathbb{C})$-cocycle induced by the eigenvalue equation $[H_\omega u]_n=zu_n$ at $z\in\mathbb{C}$.</description>

      <title>A convex variational principle for the necessary conditions of classical optimal control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A scheme for generating a family of convex variational principles is developed, the Euler- Lagrange equations of each member of the family formally corresponding to the necessary conditions of optimal control of a given system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) in a well-defined sense. The scheme is applied to the Quadratic-Quadratic Regulator problem for which an explicit form of the functional is derived, and existence of minimizers of the variational principle is rigorously shown. It is shown that the Linear-Quadratic Regulator problem with time-dependent forcing can be solved within the formalism without requiring any nonlinear considerations, in contrast to the use of a Riccati system in the classical methodology.
  Our work demonstrates a pathway for solving nonlinear control problems via convex optimization.</description>

      <title>Improved error bounds for Koopman operator and reconstructed trajectories approximations with kernel-based methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a new error bound for Koopman operator approximation using Kernel Extended Dynamic Mode Decomposition. The new estimate is $O(N^{-1/2})$, with a constant related to the probability of success of the bound, given by Hoeffding's inequality, similar to other methodologies, such as Philipp et al. Furthermore, we propose a \textit{lifting back} operator to obtain trajectories generated by embedding the initial state and iterating a linear system in a higher dimension. This naturally yields an $O(N^{-1/2})$ error bound for mean trajectories. Finally, we show numerical results including an example of nonlinear system, exhibiting successful approximation with exponential decay faster than $-1/2$, as suggested by the theoretical results.</description>
