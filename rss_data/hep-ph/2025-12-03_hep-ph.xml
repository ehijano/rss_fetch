      <title>Emergent Grand Unified Structure in a 4 x 4 Nilpotent Matrix Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that nilpotent matrices that yield the Schrodinger equation from its first order form encode the fingerprints of grand unified theories. We perform a rigorous search for all such nilpotent matrices and find that the resulting matrices naturally organize into suggestive group theoretic structures without any other a priori assumptions. The antisymmetric sector consists of three groups of sixteen matrices, each of which further splits as 16 = 12 + 4 and exhibits unique characteristics in the step potential scattering problem. The symmetric zero-diagonal sector also forms three families, mirroring the quark-lepton decomposition of the Pati-Salam model. These results may help answer why there are three families of fermions and also demonstrate that the 4 x 4 matrix algebra is a compact, nontrivial shadow of the SO(10) embedding, with fermion-like and gauge-like subspaces.</description>

      <title>Modified Entanglement Patterns in Two-Flavor Neutrinos from Quantum-Gravity Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of quantum gravity induced corrections on the entanglement entropy associated with two flavor neutrino oscillations in vacuum. Using the Von Neumann entropy as a measure of quantum correlations, we analyze how Planck scale suppressed modification implemented through quantum gravity motivated changes in the neutrino dispersion relation affect the evolution of entanglement during successive oscillation cycles. By performing a statistical study over a range of oscillation lengths and neutrino energies, we identify characteristic deviations in the entropy profile arising from quantum gravity effects. Our results suggest that entanglement entropy provides a sensitive probe of small quantum gravity induced departures from standard neutrino oscillation dynamics, highlighting its potential role in testing Planck scale physics within neutrino phenomenology.</description>

      <title>QCD in Language Models: What do they really know about QCD?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents an analysis of modern open-source large language models (LLMs) -- including Llama, Qwen, and Gemma -- to evaluate their encoded knowledge of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Through reverse engineering of these models' representations, we uncover the naturally idiosyncratic patterns in how foundational QCD concepts are embedded within their parameter spaces. Our methodology combines targeted probing techniques and knowledge extraction protocols to assess the models' understanding of critical QCD principles like color confinement, asymptotic freedom, and the running coupling constant. This work provides a tool for utilizing LLMs as an assistant in physics research, while also highlighting current limitations in their representation of advanced quantum field theory concepts that future model development should address.</description>

      <title>Unitarizing non-relativistic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitarity imposes coupled constraints on elastic and inelastic amplitudes. Satisfying them requires resummation of the self-energy contributions from both elastic and inelastic channels. Inelastic channels generate anti-Hermitian contributions that can be consistently deduced from the unitarity relation underlying the optical theorem, leading to non-local separable potentials and a compact unitarization scheme in the non-relativistic regime. We present two alternative derivations of the anti-Hermitian kernel, from the continuity equation and by integrating out inelastic channels. We further extend this framework to treat non-analytic and non-convergent behavior of inelastic amplitudes in the complex momentum plane and to incorporate bound states. For non-convergent amplitudes, we demonstrate a simple renormalization procedure in which anti-Hermitian separable potentials necessarily induce Hermitian separable counterterms, yielding finite cross sections consistent with unitarity. These results provide a general tool for non-relativistic scattering problems, with clear applications to dark-matter phenomenology.</description>

      <title>Do neutrinos dream in 5D? Towards a comprehensive extra-dimensional neutrino phenomenology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides a comprehensive overview of neutrino masses and mixing in Large Extra Dimension scenarios, focusing on the phenomenological impact of a five-dimensional (5D) bulk fermion. In a flat extra dimension compactified on an $S^1/\mathbb{Z}_2$ orbifold, this fermion manifests as a Kaluza-Klein tower of right-handed neutrinos in the 4D effective theory. We systematically investigate four distinct scenarios for mass generation, considering both Dirac and Majorana mass terms originating from either the bulk or the 3-brane. For each case, we analyse the consequences for neutrino oscillations in a vacuum and in matter, deriving the resulting mass spectra and mixing patterns. By comparing these theoretical predictions with experimental data, we explore the constraints on the large extra dimensions' parameters.</description>

      <title>Momentum entanglement at colliders: the $H \to WW,ZZ$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address momentum entanglement in Higgs decays to weak boson pairs, $H \to WW,ZZ$, by discretising momentum space. The momenta of the two weak bosons are entangled, as well as the degrees of freedom in momentum and spin spaces. For $H \to ZZ$ in the four-lepton final state, we also estimate the statistical sensitivity of entanglement measures at the Large Hadron Collider and future upgrades. The discretisation method introduced here is broadly applicable, offering a framework for studies of momentum entanglement at the energy frontier.</description>

      <title>Assessing uncertainties in the determination of the trilinear Higgs self-coupling from single-Higgs observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular $e^{+}e^{-}$ colliders operating at energies below the di-Higgs production threshold can provide information on the trilinear Higgs self-coupling $\lambda_{hhh}$ via its loop contributions to single Higgs production processes and electroweak precision observables. We investigate how well a non-SM value of $\lambda_{hhh}$ can be determined indirectly via its loop contributions within a global EFT fit. Using an inert doublet extension of the SM Higgs sector as an example for a scenario of physics beyond the SM that could be realised in nature, we find that theoretical uncertainties related to the treatment of loop contributions and the truncation of the EFT expansion, which are usually neglected, play an important role in determining the sensitivity to $\lambda_{hhh}$ in a global fit. The results obtained from such an indirect determination of $\lambda_{hhh}$ without taking these additional uncertainties into account would be too optimistic, leading to an artificially high resulting precision for $\lambda_{hhh}$. They could therefore be misleading in the quest to precisely identify the underlying physics of electroweak symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Vacuum Structure of the BNT Model of Neutrino Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the vacuum structure of the Babu--Nandi--Tavartkiladze (BNT) model of neutrino mass generation, in which the Standard Model is extended by an $SU(2)_L$ scalar quadruplet with hypercharge $Y=3/2$ and a vector-like $SU(2)_L$ triplet fermion with $Y=1$, generating neutrino masses via an effective dimension-seven operator. We delineate the theoretical constraints on the model, requiring the scalar potential to be bounded from below in all field directions, ensuring perturbative unitarity of scattering amplitudes, and demanding that the electroweak vacuum corresponds to the global minimum of the potential. We find that the electroweak vacuum is not generically guaranteed to be the global minimum: several charge-breaking stationary points may coexist with -- and potentially lie below -- it in potential depth. For the electroweak-like vacuum with vanishing quadruplet expectation value, the condition of global stability reduces to two simple mass inequalities involving the doubly- and triply-charged scalars. In contrast, for the general electroweak vacuum with nonzero doublet and quadruplet expectation values -- compatible with neutrino-mass generation -- no comparably simple analytic condition emerges, and the stability must be assessed for each specific choice of scalar couplings. Nonetheless, by combining the analytic condition governing the relative depth of the two electroweak stationary points with the mass inequalities ensuring the stability of the electroweak-like configuration against charge breaking, we obtain a practical criterion for determining when the general electroweak vacuum is globally stable.</description>

      <title>Linearly Polarized Gravitational Waves from Bubble Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physics beyond the Standard Model may give rise to first-order phase transitions proceeding via the nucleation of vacuum bubbles, whose subsequent collisions generate gravitational waves (GWs). Their detection would open the possibility of investigating the universe in its first instants. If the transition is slow enough, such that it completes with the nucleation and collision of only two bubbles, the resulting GW signal is linearly polarized. We show that in this case triangular interferometers such as LISA and the Einstein Telescope could be able to not only measure the magnitude of the GW but also establish its linear polarization. This would give a strong hint about the origin of the signal.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from flavoured SU(2) early-universe phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02148v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavourful extensions of the Standard Model aimed at explaining its fermionic mass structure typically rely on symmetries, broken at high-energy scales far beyond the reach of foreseeable direct collider searches. We illustrate, using a $SU(2)$ flavour gauge group, that the breaking of these symmetries up to scales as high as $10^7$ GeV could generate a gravitational-wave signal potentially observable by future observatories. We use dimensional reduction techniques to obtain the finite-temperature effective potential and study the possible first-order phase transitions. We match these transitions to steady-state hydrodynamical solutions in order to determine the corresponding gravitational-wave spectra. We observe that order-one gauge couplings are always required for a first-order phase transition to occur. On the other hand, adding leptoquarks (as an example of particles that are typically present in a complete flavour theory) significantly extends the testable parameter space. We find excellent prospects at the Einstein Telescope for future gravitational-wave detection of flavoured $SU(2)$ early-universe phase transitions.</description>

      <title>SE+BSF4DM -- A micrOMEGAs package for Sommerfeld Effect and Bound State Formation in colored Dark Sectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SE+BSF4DM, a novel add-on package for micrOMEGAs that includes the Sommerfeld effect and bound state formation in the numerical evaluation of the dark matter relic density for QCD colored dark sectors. Including these non-perturbative effects in the relic density calculation is crucial for achieving accurate predictions in a broad class of models and SE+BSF4DM seamlessly integrates them into the standard micrOMEGAs workflow, requiring minimal user modification. The package is applicable to any model mappable onto a simplified t-channel framework, making it a versatile tool. This paper details the implementation, assets, and scope of SE+BSF4DM, serving as both a comprehensive introduction and a practical user guide.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We estimate the magnitude of the leading non-perturbative QCD corrections to the decays of the Higgs boson to the $\gamma Z$ and $\gamma \gamma$ final states. These corrections originate from the light-quark contributions to such decays. We show that the non-perturbative effects are suppressed by the small Yukawa couplings of light quarks, but that there is no further quark-mass suppression. This is at variance with what is found in the standard perturbative calculations of the light-quark contributions. We demonstrate that the non-perturbative corrections modify the $H \to \gamma Z$ and $H \to \gamma \gamma$ decay rates by $O(10^{-5})$, well below the expected precision with which such decays can be studied both at the high-luminosity LHC and at future colliders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The past five years have brought significant new results on the muon magnetic anomaly, $a_\mu = (g_\mu - 2)/2$, and on the hadronic vacuum polarization (HVP) contribution dominating the uncertainty $\Delta a_\mu$. Serious tension has emerged between the experimental and standard model(SM) values for $a_\mu$, as well as between the SM and the first precise lattice QCD values. We review the current experimental and theoretical status of $a_\mu$, along with the prospects for new results,focusing on MUonE,a new experiment at CERN, aiming to evaluate the leading order contribution to a(HVP) in a direct measurement of muonic Bhabha scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present current bounds on SMEFT operators that are mainly constrained by Higgs-boson observables, under different assumptions for the flavour structure of the UV theory. We investigate how the accuracy reached through a dedicated Higgs-boson precision physics program is starting to have a major impact in setting a lower bound on the scale of new physics, and we discuss the relevance of considering the scale evolution of the SMEFT coefficients in this context. We compare our results with the literature, pointing out the consistency of the results in spite of the different assumptions adopted in each analysis, and we discuss future steps aimed at improving the accuracy of the fit.</description>

      <title>Non-diagonal DVCS with spinless hadron-to-two-hadron transition $\gamma^* \pi \to \gamma \pi \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the formalism of hadron-to-two-hadron transition generalized parton distributions (GPDs) for spinless hadron case. Definitions of the twist-2 unpolarized and polarized $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs are introduced with a particular choice of kinematic variables that characterize the produced two-pion system. In the vicinity of $\rho(770)$, we work out the two-pion decay angular distributions of the $e^-\pi\to e^-\gamma\pi\pi$ cross section, incorporating both the Bethe-Heitler and deeply virtual Compton scattering processes. Each cross section exhibits a distinctive angular distribution, which is sensitive to the polarization states of the produced $\rho(770)$ resonance. In addition, we construct the double partial-wave expansion of $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in the two-pion decay angles as a generalization of GPDs for transition from a pion to a spin-$\ell$ resonance state. With the help of the Omn\`es representation, we constrain the $\pi\to\pi\pi$ transition GPDs in terms of the low energy $\pi\pi$ scattering phase shift and build a phenomenological model for these GPDs.</description>

      <title>Properties of Stable Massive Quark Stars in Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a holographic D3/D7 system, whose dilaton profile has been phenomenologically adjusted in the infrared. The model is used to describe a deconfined yet massive quark phase of QCD at finite density, concluding that the equation of state of such a phase can be stiff enough to support exotic dense stars as massive as 2 solar masses. Nucleons are modeled phenomenologically using the Hebeler-et.al EFT baryon phases. For the stiff phenomenological baryon phases the transition to the quark phase is weakly first order allowing for stable quark cores. We also find that holographic baryons, modeled as wrapped D5-branes, provide unrealistic pressures (in the homogeneous approximation) and have to be discarded. We compute the mass vs. radius relation and tidal deformability for these hybrid stars. Contrary to a large number of other holographic models, this holographic model indicates that quark matter could be present at the core of heavy compact stars and may be used to explore the phenomenology of such objects.</description>

      <title>Relativistic correction to the binding energies of two-body hadronic molecular states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a systematic estimation of the relativistic correction to the binding energies of two-body hadronic molecular states by comparing the numerical solutions of the three-dimensional (3D) Schr{\"o}dinger, 3D Salpeter, and fully relativistic four-dimensional (4D) Bethe-Salpeter (BS) equations derived from the same underlying interaction. The numerical results reveal a counter-intuitive property: for hadronic molecular states whose binding energies are in the MeV range, the relativistic correction is unexpectedly large. This finding contradicts the conventional expectation that a heavier exchanged mass in the interaction implies suppressed relativistic effects. Specifically, we first benchmark the results using the Wick-Cutkosky model with a one-boson-exchange (OBE) interaction of mass $m_{ex}$, and then extend the analysis to the physical $D\bar{D}$ system. We find within the $1\sim 50$ MeV binding energy region, the relativistic correction is substantial, amounting to $-90\% \sim -70\%$ of the non-relativistic result. Such a significant correction strongly suggests that analyses based solely on the 3D Schr{\"o}dinger or 3D Salpeter equations for hadronic molecular states should be treated with caution.</description>

      <title>Unified Functional-Holographic Theory of the QCD Critical End Point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a first-principles, multi-scale theory of the QCD critical end point. It unifies Dyson-Schwinger dynamics of quark propagation, functional renormalization-group evolution of the scale-dependent effective action, and Polyakov-Nambu-Jona-Lasinio thermodynamics for chiral and deconfinement order parameters. It also includes a holographic Maxwell-Chern-Simons sector that supplies baryonic and topological response within a single, renormalization group consistent framework. Within this construction the axial-anomaly channel is evolved rather than tuned. The holographic topological susceptibility feeds directly into the flow of the determinantal interaction. As a result, anomaly-induced flavor mixing weakens as deconfinement sets in. This behavior drives the chiral condensate and the Polyakov loop toward a self-dual fixed point. At this point their renormalizations coincide, their residual mixing vanishes, and a unified order parameter controls criticality. The theory is anchored to continuum-extrapolated lattice thermodynamics and conserved-charge fluctuations at vanishing baryon density. This anchoring is implemented through a lattice-calibrated Polyakov sector. The framework respects exact thermodynamic identities by enforcing stationarity at each scale. It also recovers the ideal-gas limit at high temperature and the Goldstone limit at low temperature. Solving the coupled Dyson-Schwinger, renormalization-group, and holographic equations yields the critical end point as an output rather than an assumption. The critical end point appears at temperatures around one hundred forty megaelectronvolts and baryon chemical potentials of a few hundred megaelectronvolts. The theory predicts a small positive curvature of the crossover line near zero density.</description>

      <title>Probing fully coherent radiation and parton densities using (virtual) photons at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prompt photon production in pA collisions has long been suggested as a sensitive probe of the nuclear parton distribution functions (nPDFs). In this study, we present recent results on another cold nuclear matter effect, namely fully coherent radiation induced by parton multiple scattering, which may influence the nuclear dependence of prompt photon production. Medium-induced radiation effects, implemented in leading-order direct and fragmentation photon processes, are computed for pPb collisions at the LHC. At backward rapidity, photons are sensitive to fully coherent energy loss (FCEL), while at forward rapidity, fully coherent energy gain (FCEG) plays a crucial role due to the dominance of the $qg \to q\gamma$ scattering channel. In contrast, for virtual photon production, the impact of fully coherent radiation is marginal, making Drell-Yan (DY) one of the best ways to probe nuclear PDFs. The power of the DY process is demonstrated by reweighting nPDF sets at next-to-leading order using realistic pseudo-data for LHC Run 3.</description>

      <title>Reevaluating the $a_1(1420)$ enhancement and its molecular partners in the low-lying axial-vector meson spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We assess possible axial-vector states with $G$-parity $\left(G=\pm 1\right)$ dynamically generated by pseudoscalar-vector interactions in coupled channels, driven by the Weinberg-Tomozawa term at leading order in chiral perturbation theory. The $S$-wave amplitudes are unitarized via the Bethe-Salpeter equation, and poles of the unitarized amplitudes are searched for in the complex energy plane. In the isovector sector with $I^G(J^{PC})=1^{\pm}(1^{+\mp})$, we identify two poles around 1400 MeV in the second Riemann sheet below the $K^*\bar{K}$ mass threshold. The $G=+1$ and $G=-1$ poles can be one of the origins of the peaks in the $f_0(980)\pi$ and $\phi\pi^0$ mass spectra reported by the COMPASS and BESIII collaborations, respectively, in the $\pi N \to \pi\pi\pi N$ and $J/\psi \to \eta \phi\pi$ processes, in addition to triangle singularity effects discussed in the literature. Additionally, the poles in the isoscalar sector may explain the nontrivial behavior of the $K^*\bar{K}$ spectra line shapes measured by several experiments in different reactions. Specifically, for the $0^+(1^{++})$ case, we find a sizeable $K^*\bar{K}$ component for the $f_1(1420)$. In the $0^-(1^{+-})$ scenario, the pole strongly coupled to $\rho\pi$ can be associated with the $h_1(1170)$ resonance. Lastly, in this same sector, we identify a higher pole that dominates the $K^*\bar{K}$ invariant mass in the $\chi_{cJ} \to \phi K^*\bar{K}$ decay, where the \(h_1(1415)\) is observed in the BESIII data.</description>

      <title>Exploring Leptogenesis, WIMP Dark Matter, and Gravitational Waves in an extended Scalar Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore extensions of type I seesaw framework with a scalar mediator ($\Phi$) connecting to a complex scalar dark field ($S$), and right handed neutrinos ($N_i$), with an aim to correlate neutrino mass generation, leptogenesis, and dark matter. $\mathcal{Z}_4\times CP$ turns out to be a phenomenologically viable choice of the extended symmetry, which can accommodate a dimension five effective interaction $\bar{l}_L^\alpha \tilde{H}\Phi N_i$, involving the SM lepton isodoublet ${l}_L$, and Higgs $H$; prohibiting the canonical Yukawa term $\bar{l}_L^\alpha \tilde{H} N_i$. The $\mathcal{Z}_{4}$ symmetry is spontaneously broken via the vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the $\Phi$ filed, which directly affects neutrino mass generation and leptogenesis; while the $CP$ symmetry stabilises one component of $S$, making it a viable dark matter candidate. The discrete symmetry breaking creates domain wall, which needs to be annihilated before the over-closure of the Universe. This paves the way for gravitational wave signal associated with the model set up, which probes the symmetry breaking scale, and indirectly connects to the other phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chen-Ning Yang made important contributions to the theory of solvable models in statistical mechanics, including generalizations of the Bethe Ansatz, magnetization in the Ising model, the Lee-Yang circle theorem, and the Yang-Baxter equation. Most famously, Yang made transformative contributions to the current Standard Model of elementary particle interactions. The proposal of Yang and T. D. Lee, that left-right symetry (parity) is violated in weak particle decays, established that the primary currents involved in weak interactions are left handed. The work of Yang and R. L. Mills gave a framework for force carriers coupling to these currents that are non-Abelian generalizations of the electromagnetic photon, which unlike the electrically neutral photon, carry ``charges'' to which they self-couple . Two decades of work by others on quantization and mass-generation mechanisms then culminated in the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Nucleon decays into three leptons: noncontact contributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate baryon number violating (BNV) nucleon decays into three leptons from noncontact contributions that are induced by dimension-6 (dim-6) BNV operators in low-energy effective field theory (LEFT) with an exchange of a baryon, meson, lepton, or photon field. We systematically classify all these processes that change lepton flavor by one unit and formulate their decay widths in terms of the dim-6 LEFT Wilson coefficients. By applying constraints on these Wilson coefficients derived from current experimental limits on BNV two-body nucleon decays, we obtain stringent and robust bounds on the rates of these triple-lepton modes. These bounds vary significantly from one dim-6 operator to another under consideration. Our results for the $\Delta(B-L)=0$ modes differ by several orders of magnitude from previous phase-space estimates in the literature, thereby providing a more reliable assessment of their potential occurrence. In addition, we provide improved bounds on $\Delta(B+L)=0$ modes compared to the existing experimental limits.</description>

      <title>Lepton Flavor Physics in the flipped 3-3-1-1 Model: Non-Universality and Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the flavor violation (FV) of Z decays to leptons at tree level and flavor conserving Z decays to leptons in the frame work of the flipped $ SU(3)_C\otimes SU(3)_L \otimes U(1)_X\otimes U(1)_N$,(F3311) model. In addition, we analyze the processes $l_i\rightarrow l_j \gamma$ and the leptonic three-body decay. Using the experimental bounds on these decays we set the constraint on $\sin \phi$ which represents the mixing between Z-Z' boson. The most stringent limits arises from $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ decay where $\sin \phi \sim \mathcal{ O}(10^{-3})$. The leptonic three-body decay set lower bound on the mass of the new neural gauge boson $m_{Z'} \geq 3.2TeV$. Using the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment data we set bounds to the mass of the dark matter candidates.
  Subsequently, we investigate the lepton non-universality in B decays within the $F3311$ model by calculating the generic one-loop contribution to the process $u_i\rightarrow d_j e_b \bar{\nu}_a$ in the unitary gauge as well as numerical evaluating the branching ratio $R_D, R_{D^{(*)}},R(X_c)$. We demonstrate that the $F3311$ model can address the $3.3 \sigma$ discrepancies between Standard Model and experimental data. To reaffirm our results, we also analyze the $d \to u$ transitions and $s\to u$ transitions. These two transitions also give consistent result with experiment data. Combine all experiment dat a we obtain the operating region for the mass of the model
  specifically $m_E \in [6.5, 9 ]TeV$, $m_Q \in [6,11]TeV$ and the dark matter candidate $m_\xi \in [1.5,2 ]TeV$.</description>

      <title>Heavy sterile neutrinos in $B$ decays and new QCD corrections to their semi-hadronic decay rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In modern experiments on flavour physics it is possible to search for the decays of $B$ or $D$ mesons or $\tau$ leptons into final states with heavy neutrinos $N$ (a.k.a. heavy neutral leptons). I present a common study of theorists and experimentalists from Belle II on constraints on $B \rightarrow D^{*} \ell N$. Next I discuss the status of the theory predictions of the various $N$ decay rates. In scenarios in which $N$ interacts with SM particles only through sterile-active neutrino mixing, the dependence of the lifetime on the relevant mixing angles is important to determine whether $N$ decays in the detector or outside. To calculate the inclusive decay rate into semi-hadronic final states reliably one needs to include radiative QCD corrections. I present analytic results for the QCD-corrected decay rates and discuss their phenomenological impact.</description>

      <title>Leptophilic Gauge Interactions in the SMEFT Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a "precision-ready", model-independent EFT framework that connects general leptophilic gauge interactions to their low-energy manifestations in SMEFT and LEFT. Starting from a broad U(1)'_ell extension in which leptons carry family-dependent charges (q_e, q_mu, q_tau) while quarks remain neutral, quantum consistency is ensured through a minimal set of vectorlike leptons, chiral under U(1)'_ell but vectorlike under the SM, together with singlet scalars responsible for symmetry breaking and the masses of both Z_ell and the heavy leptons. In the heavy-mediator limit, we integrate out Z_ell at tree level and derive compact, analytic SMEFT Wilson coefficients for four-lepton operators and Higgs-current structures, including hypercharge-U(1)'_ell kinetic mixing proportional to Tr(Y Q'). Renormalization-group evolution down to the electroweak scale and matching onto LEFT produce closed-form expressions directly applicable to e+e- -&gt; l+l-, neutrino trident production, nu e scattering, parity-violating Moeller observables, and muon-decay parameters. A single parameter combination, Lambda_eff = M_Zell / (g_ell * sqrt(|q q'|)), governs all leading EFT signatures, offering a unified way to map UV charge assignments onto precision observables. We delineate the validity domain of this EFT and outline its use as a "plug-and-play" interface for global fits, collider recasts, and future-collider projections.</description>

      <title>Models for differential cross section in neutron-proton scattering and their implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few analytic exponential models of elastic differential cross section, constructed as purely phenomenological models, are proposed and tested. The models incorporate energy-dependent exponential slopes, power-law prefactors, and localized Gaussian modifications which are built to reproduce the observed dip region, supplemented in some cases by logarithmic $t$-dependent slopes. Simple additive sub-leading exponential contributions that represent charge conjugation and isospin roles are introduced in the models to increase applicability and quality of fit across elastic differential cross section data of $np$, $n\bar{p}$, $pp$, and $p\bar{p}$ elastic scattering. The models reproduce the characteristic features of the elastic scattering data such as the dip-bump structure, shrinkage of the forward peak, and controlled curvature that is localized around the dip. Parameters of the models are found by fitting the experimental data of elastic $np$ differential cross section in an energy range of $\sqrt{s}$ = 3.36 GeV to 26.02 GeV, across a momentum range of $0.065 \leq \mid t\mid \leq 5.341 \textrm{GeV}^{2}$. The parameter values and their ranges, obtained by $\chi^{2}$ minimization are found within their assumed expected bounds with the $np$ data fitting. The total cross section, the slope parameter, the interaction radius, the total elastic cross section, the inelastic cross section, the ratios $\sigma_{el}/\sigma_{tot}$, and $\sigma_{inel}/\sigma_{tot}$ are predicted by the models for the $np$ scattering at all the energies, which show accurate quantitative agreement with their reference values. The results show that the proposed models not only provide accurate quantitative description of $np$ elastic differential cross section but also yield estimates of the observables that are consistent with theoretical expectations from Regge phenomenology and high-energy scattering constraints.</description>

      <title>From Dark Sectors to the Axion-Neutrino Connection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics provides a successful description of fundamental particles and their interactions but fails to explain phenomena such as neutrino oscillations, dark matter (DM), and the baryon asymmetry of the Universe. These clear signs of BSM physics motivate extensions introducing new particles and symmetries. Theoretical questions like the flavor puzzle and the strong CP problem further guide BSM frameworks. This thesis explores BSM scenarios based on two guiding principles: constructing unified frameworks that address multiple open problems in (astro)particle physics and cosmology, and emphasizing their experimental testability through detailed phenomenological analyses. This approach uncovers deep connections between seemingly disconnected sectors, offering a more complete view of fundamental physics. We investigate dark sector models for the origin of neutrino masses, proposing a novel setup: dark linear seesaw, which radiatively links neutrino mass generation to DM candidates and predicts charged lepton flavor violation. In these scenarios, dark sector particles can constitute WIMP DM, testable via direct detection experiments. We study spontaneous CP violation induced by a complex scalar singlet, acting as a common origin of low- and high-energy CP violating effects relevant for leptogenesis. We also analyze a Nelson-Barr model that solves the strong CP problem, generates a realistic CKM matrix radiatively, and yields scalar WIMP DM. Additionally, we present unified axion frameworks in which a colored sector radiatively generates neutrino masses. These models predict distinctive axion couplings to photons and fermions and accommodate axion DM in both pre- and post-inflationary cosmologies. Finally, we explore minimal flavored Peccei-Quinn symmetries that link the flavor puzzle, neutrino masses and DM within a predictive and testable framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute all the planar three-loop master integrals relevant for the leading colour N3LO QCD corrections to the production of two massive or off-shell vector bosons at hadron colliders. These integrals are organised into nine four-point integral families with massless internal propagators and two external massive legs. For each family, we construct a basis of pure master integrals and we reconstruct the corresponding canonical differential equations using finite field techniques. We evaluate the master integrals by solving the differential equations using generalised power series expansions.</description>

Modifications of the coupling within experimentally observed ranges have a sizeable impact on the total cross-section, but do not have large effects on the distributions of the invariant mass of the three-Higgs system and other global observables.</description>

Abstract: In this work we study the possibility of modeling the dark matter content in galaxies as a core-halo model consisting of self-gravitating, self-interacting fermions. For the core of the halo, the dark matter fermions are degenerate, while for the halo we have considered two possibilities: the fermions have thermalized as a perfect fluidor they will follow a standard cold dark matter Navarro-Frenk-White profile. The core density profile is obtained by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, and their properties are determined by the fermion mass, the central density and the interaction strength. The mass of the fermion and the strength of the fermion self-interaction is fixed by doing a $\chi^2$ analysis to fit that fit the rotational curves of Low Surface Brightness galaxies. It was found that the fermion mass should be in the range $38.73~\rm{eV}&lt; m_{f} &lt; 42.11~\rm{eV}$ and the interparticle strength in the range $269.69 &lt; y &lt;348.48$ at $68$ C.L. in order to reproduce the rotational curves adequately, in the case when the halo is modeled as a thermalized ideal gas. Similar values are obtained if the halo is modeled following a Navarro-Frenk-White case, namely $41.54 ~\rm{eV} &lt; m_{f} &lt;49.87 ~\rm{eV}$ and $5606.06&lt; y &lt; 17484.84$. Once fixed the values of the mass of the fermion $m_f$ and the interaction strength $y$, we tested the core-halo model with data from the Milky Way and the SPARC database. We have found good agreement between the data and the core-halo models, varying only one free parameter: the central density. Thus a single fermion can fit hundreds of galaxies. Nevertheless, the dark matter halo surface density relation or the halo total mass and radius depend strongly on the model for the halo.</description>

      <title>Radiative decays of the $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi'_c$ and $\Omega_c$ charmed baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the radiative decays of the $\Sigma_c$, $\Xi'_c$ and $\Omega_c$ charmed baryons, which belong to the flavor sextet ($\bf {6}_{\rm F}$), within the constituent quark model formalism. The electromagnetic transitions are calculated from the ground and $P$-wave states to ground states, as well as from the second shell states to both the ground and $P$-wave final states. These decays play a crucial role in confirming the existence of certain resonances when strong decays are not allowed. %A relevant case is the $\Omega_c^{0}$ spin excitation with $\bf J^P ={\frac{3}{2}}^{+}$ denoted as $\Omega_c^{*0}$. This state cannot decay strongly, but has a nonvanishing predicted electromagnetic decay width in the $\Omega_c^{0} \gamma$ channel. The $\Omega_c^{*0}$ was precisely observed in this channel. Moreover, electromagnetic decay widths are particularly useful for identifying resonances when states have the same mass and total decay width. A relevant case is the $\Omega_c (3327)$ state, whose branching ratios between the strong decay channels are comparable; thus, the radiative decay widths may help assign this state. We also make the assignment of the recently discovered $\Xi'_c(2923)^{+}$ baryon, which is consistent with being the isospin partner of the $\Xi'_c(2923)^{0}$. This study presents, for the first time, the calculation of electromagnetic decays for $D_\rho$-wave states, $\rho-\lambda$ mixed states, and $\rho$-mode radially excited states in the charm sector. Throughout our calculations, we account for uncertainties arising from both experimental and model-dependent errors.</description>

      <title>Modifications in clusterization procedures for heavy-ion collisions: minimum spanning tree, simulated annealing, coalescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new open-source cluster finding library ''Common Clusterization Library'' (CCL) is proposed to describe the clusters production when applied to the transport codes. The new library was applied to the Parton-Hadron-Quantum-Molecular Dynamics approach to be comparable with the established and well known MST and SACA implementations on the exactly same set of the events. The presented procedures were tested with rapidity density distributions and complex observables like $\langle M_{imf} \rangle$ and $\langle Z_{\text{max}} \rangle$ vs $Z_{bound}2$ at the energies of ALADiN and NA49 experiments. An improvement to the simulated annealing chain is proposed to reduce the computational time. The new stable clusters tracking algorithm for the ''lost'' cluster recovering is presented. The results of the ''box-like'' coalescence procedure and a mixed method which incorporates the coalescence algorithm steps and the negative binding energy criteria are presented. The difference between the Helium-3 found by the MST-based cluster finding procedure and the coalescence algorithm applied on the exactly same set of events and baryons is shown for the first time.</description>

      <title>General Four-Loop Beta Function for Scalar-Fermion Theories in Three Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present general four-loop template $\beta$-functions and anomalous field dimensions for renormalisable scalar-fermion theories in three dimensions. By imposing $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry, we obtain relations between the template RGE coefficients, valid in any renormalisation scheme. Directly in $d=3$, we identify a new theory with a non-trivial IR fixed point that is under perturbative control in a large-$N$ limit. We provide up-to-date numerical results for all required massive tadpole master integrals up to four loops and complement them with analytic expressions where available.</description>

      <title>Neutron-deuteron scattering revisited with the EKM chiral nuclear force and the WPCD method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02475v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the neutron-deuteron scattering using the Wave-Packet Continuum Discretization (WPCD) method with the EKM chiral nuclear force at various chiral orders. We rederive the permutation operator and solve the Faddeev-AGS equations directly, without rewriting the initial Faddeev kernel $tG_0$ and introducing pseudo-states, thereby rendering the approach easily extendable to a relativistic framework. We find that up to the next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO), although one can well describe the differential cross sections, one cannot resolve the long-standing $A_y$ puzzle, consistent with previous studies. The fact that the N$^3$LO chiral forces can well describe the $NN$ phase shifts and the results obtained with the EKM and Idaho N$^3$LO chiral forces agree with each other underscores the need for further investigations to resolve the $A_y$ puzzle, e.g., considering three-body forces or relativistic effects.</description>

      <title>Non-vanishing non-linear Static Love Number of a Class of Extremal Reissner-Nordstrom Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the tidal Love numbers for a particular axially symmetric configuration of extremal Reissner-Nordstrom geometry. By exactly solving the non-linear Einstein equations, we investigate the tidal response of extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black holes in four-dimensional spacetimes under external gravitational fields. We show that, for the specific geometry considered, the static tidal Love number remains finite and non-vanishing to all orders in the external tidal field. By contrast, we verify that the Love number of an isolated extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole remains zero, in agreement with previous expectations. Furthermore, we explicitly calculate the Zerilli-Moncrief master functions and match them with the effective field theory description.</description>

      <title>Excitation function of femtoscopic L\'evy source parameters of pion pairs in EPOS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) femtoscopic source parameters of pions provide a sensitive probe of the space-time structure of particle-emitting sources in high-energy heavy-ion collisions. Compared to one-dimensional measurements, 3D femtoscopy not only provides a valuable cross-check but also offers a more complete characterization of the source geometry and its dynamical evolution. Particularly, differences between the "out" and "side" directions are sensitive to signals of a strong first-order phase transition, while the collision-energy dependence of Levy radii may reveal non-monotonic features related to the equation of state (EoS).
  In this work, we systematically investigate the transverse mass and collision-energy dependence of the three-dimensional femtoscopic parameters of pion pairs with Levy-type sources in the STAR Beam Energy Scan (BES) range from $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7$ to $200$ GeV using the EPOS4 model. The analyzed parameters include the Levy index $\alpha$, the correlation strength $\lambda$, and the three-dimensional radii $R_{\rm {out}}$, $R_{\rm side}$ and $R_{\rm long}$ , derived quantities such as the radius difference $R_{\rm diff} = R_{\rm out}^2 - R_{\rm side}^2$ and the ratio $R_{\rm out}/R_{\rm side}$ are also investigated. The results show that the extracted radii $R_{\rm {side}}$ and $R_{\rm long}$ decrease with increasing transverse momentum and increase gradually with collision energy, while $R_{\rm {out}}$ shows little energy dependence. The Levy index $\alpha$ exhibits only a mild dependence on $m_T$ and collision energy, whereas the correlation strength $\lambda$ shows a clear $m_T$ dependence and generally decreases with increasing collision energy. A comparison with EPOS3 results indicates general agreement within approximately 2$\sigma$, with the notable exception of $R_{\rm side}$, which is systematically smaller in EPOS4.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric coefficients of two-flavor quark matter from the Kubo formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The hot quark matter created in heavy-ion collision experiments can exhibit strong temperature and chemical-potential gradients, which in turn can generate electric fields through thermoelectric effects. In this work, we investigate two relevant thermoelectric coefficients -- the thermopower (Seebeck coefficient) and the Thomson coefficient -- of two-flavor quark matter using the Kubo formalism and the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model as an effective description of dense, finite-temperature QCD. The required two-point equilibrium correlation functions are evaluated using the Matsubara formalism of thermal field theory, applying a 1/Nc expansion to the relevant multi-loop Feynman diagrams. We employ previously derived quark spectral functions obtained from one--meson-exchange diagrams above the Mott transition temperature. Our numerical results show that both thermoelectric coefficients increase approximately linearly with temperature and decrease with increasing chemical potential. We also estimate the magnitude of the electric fields that can be generated in heavy-ion collisions by thermal gradients via the Seebeck effect.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Spin-Interference Effects in Exclusive $J/\psi \to e^+e^-$ Photoproduction in Ultraperipheral Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first evidence of spin interference in exclusive $J/\psi \to e^+e^-$ photoproduction in ultraperipheral Au+Au and isobar (Ru+Ru, Zr+Zr) collisions ($\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$~GeV) at STAR. A negative $\cos(2\phi)$ modulation is observed for $p_T &lt; 100$ MeV/$c$, opposite in sign to that in $\rho^{0}\!\to\!\pi^+\pi^-$ photoproduction. This establishes for the first time that the interference sign is controlled by the spin structure of the final-state daughters, resolving the ambiguity present in the all-boson $\rho^0$ channel. The compact $J/\psi$ probes gluon distributions at perturbative scales, resulting in a weaker modulation and providing stringent constraints on Color Glass Condensate calculations. These findings demonstrate that spin-dependent interference in heavy vector mesons provides a new, experimentally accessible handle on gluon structure beyond traditional cross-section measurements.</description>

      <title>Singular $\alpha$-attractors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02969v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\alpha$-attractor models naturally appear in supergravity with hyperbolic geometry. The simplest versions of $\alpha$-attractors, T- and E-models, originate from theories with non-singular potentials. In canonical variables, these potentials have a plateau that is approached exponentially fast at large values of the inflaton field $\varphi$. In a closely related class of polynomial $\alpha$-attractors, or P-models, the potential is not singular, but its derivative is singular at the boundary. The resulting inflaton potential also has a plateau, but it is approached polynomially. In this paper, we will consider a more general class of potentials, which can be singular at the boundary of the moduli space, S-models. These potentials may have a short plateau, after which the potential may grow polynomially or exponentially at large values of the inflaton field. We will show that this class of models may provide a simple solution to the initial conditions problem for $\alpha$-attractors and may account for a very broad range of possible values of $n_{s}$ matching the recent ACT, SPT, and DESI data.</description>

Abstract: In the context of the 2HDM, and assuming that neutrinos acquire masses via the Weinberg operator, we perform a systematic analysis to determine the minimal quark and lepton flavour patterns, compatible with masses, mixing and CP violation data, realisable by Abelian symmetries. We determine four minimal models for quarks, where the number of independent parameters matches the number of observables. For the lepton sector, three minimal predictive models are identified. Namely, we find scenarios with a preference for the upper/lower octant of the $\theta_{23}$ atmospheric mixing angle, that exhibit lower bounds on the lightest neutrino masses currently probed by cosmology and testable at future neutrinoless double beta decay experiments, even for a normally-ordered neutrino masses. We investigate the phenomenology of each model taking into account all relevant theoretical, electroweak precision observables, scalar sector constraints, as well as stringent quark flavour processes such as $\overline{B} \rightarrow X_s \gamma$, $B_s \rightarrow \mu^- \mu^+$ and meson oscillations, and the charged lepton flavour-violating decays $e_\alpha^{-} \rightarrow e_\beta^{-} e_\gamma^{+} e_\delta^{-}$ and $e_\alpha \rightarrow e_\beta \gamma$. We show that, in some cases, Abelian flavour symmetries provide a natural framework to suppress flavour-changing neutral couplings and lead to scenarios featuring heavy neutral/charged scalar masses below the TeV scale within the reach of current experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study current experimental bounds on charged lepton flavor violating (CLFV) $\mu$-$e$ interactions in the model-independent framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). Assuming a generic flavor structure in the quark sector, we consider the contributions of CLFV operators to low-energy observables, including $\mu\to e\gamma$ and $\mu\to e$ conversion for quark-flavor conserving operators and CLFV meson decays for quark-flavor violating operators. At high energy, we consider limits on CLFV decays of the Higgs and Z bosons and of the top quark, and obtain bounds on operators with light quarks by recasting searches for production of $e\mu$ pairs in $pp$ collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). We connect observables at low- and high-energy by taking into account renormalization group running and matching between CLFV operators. We also discuss the sensitivity of the future Electron-Ion Collider, where the prospective bounds are derived by imposing simple cuts on final state particles. We find that, in a single operator scenario, bounds on purely leptonic operators are dominated by $\mu \rightarrow e \gamma$ and $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion. Semileptonic operators with down-type quarks are also dominantly constrained by low-energy observables, while LHC searches lead the bounds on up-type quark-flavor violating operators. Taking simplified multiple-coupling scenarios, we show that it is easy to evade the strongest low-energy bounds from spin-independent $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion, and that collider searches are competitive and complementary to constraints from spin-dependent $\mu \rightarrow e$ conversion and other low-energy probes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12407v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hypothesis of composite $XHe$ dark atoms may provide solution to the long-standing problem of direct searches for dark matter particles. The main problem of the $XHe$ dark atom is its ability to strongly interact with the nucleus of substance, arising from the unshielded nuclear attraction between the helium nucleus and the nucleus of matter. It is assumed that in order to prevent the destruction of the bound structure of dark atom, the effective potential of interaction between $XHe$ and the nucleus of substance must have dipole Coulomb barrier that prevents the fusion of dark matter atom particles with the nucleus of substance. The problem in describing the interaction between dark atom and substance nucleus is the three-body problem, for which an exact analytical solution is not available. Consequently, to assess the physical meaning of the proposed scenario, it is essential to develop a numerical approach. Our approach involves consistently developing an accurate quantum mechanical description of this three-body system, comprising bound dark atom and the external nucleus of substance. We incorporate the necessary effects and interactions to enhance the precision of the results, which helps to elucidate the most significant aspects of the proposed dark atom scenario.</description>

Abstract: The $e^+e^-$ annihilation of unpolarized beams is free from initial hadron states or initial anisotropy around the azimuthal angle, hence ideal for studying the correlations of dynamical origin via final state jets. We investigate the planar properties of the multi-jet events employing the relevant event-shape observables at next-to-next-to-leading order ($\mathcal{O}$($\alpha_{s}^{3}$)) in perturbative QCD; particularly, the azimuthal angle correlations on the long pseudo-rapidity (polar angle) range (Ridge correlation) between the inclusive jet momenta are calculated. We illustrate the significant planar properties and the strong correlations which are natural results of the energy-momentum conservation of the perturbative QCD radiation dynamics. Our study provides benchmarks of hard strong interaction background for the investigations on the collective and/or thermal effects via the Ridge-like correlation observables for complex scattering processes.</description>

      <title>Interplay of non-standard interactions and Earth's composition in atmospheric neutrino oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many geophysical and geochemical phenomena in the Earth's interior are related to physical and chemical processes in the outer core and the core-mantle boundary, which are directly linked to the isotopic composition. Determining the composition using standard geophysical methods has been challenging. Atmospheric neutrino oscillations, influenced by their weak interactions with terrestrial matter, offer a new way to gather valuable information about the Earth's internal structure and, in particular, to constrain the composition of the core. If neutrinos had as yet unknown non-standard interactions (NSI), this could affect their propagation in matter and consequently impact studies of Earth's composition using neutrino oscillation tomography. This study focuses on scalar-mediated NSI and their potential impact on atmospheric neutrino oscillations, which could obscure information about the hydrogen content in the outer core. In turn, compositional uncertainties could affect the characterization of NSI parameters. The analysis is based on a Monte-Carlo simulation of the energy distribution and azimuthal angles of neutrino-generated $\mu$ events. Using a model of the Earth consisting of 55 concentric shells with constant densities determined from the PREM, we evaluate the effect on the number of events due to changes in the outer core composition (Z/A)$_{oc}$ and the NSI strength parameter $\epsilon$. To examine the detection capability to observe such variations, we consider regions in the plane of (Z/A)$_{oc}$ and $\epsilon$ where the statistical significance of the discrepancies between the modified Earth model and the reference model is less than $1\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factor of the kaon in holographic QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18747v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The gravitational form factor (GFF) of the kaon is investigated in a bottom-up holographic QCD model, in which the strange quark mass breaks the SU(3) flavor symmetry. The probe energy ($Q^2$) dependence of the kaon GFF is explicitly shown and compared to that of the pion. It is presented that our result shows the $1/Q^2$ behavior in the high energy region, which is consistent with the perturbative QCD prediction. The gravitational radius of the kaon is also calculated, and it is found that the result is quite close to that of the pion but slightly smaller.</description>

      <title>Flavored Peccei-Quinn symmetries in the minimal $\nu$DFSZ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00088v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a Dine-Fischler-Srednicki-Zhitnitsky (DFSZ) axion model extended with two right-handed neutrino fields to realize the minimal type-I seesaw. In this $\nu$DFSZ scheme we systematically determine the simplest quark and lepton flavor patterns compatible with masses, mixing and charge-parity violation data, realized by flavored U(1) Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetries. We discuss axion dark matter production in pre and post-inflationary cosmology in this context, and predictions for the axion couplings to photons and fermions. In particular, helioscopes and haloscopes are able to probe our models via their distinct axion-to-photon couplings, while in the quark sector the most stringent constraints on axion-fermion couplings are set by $K^+ \rightarrow \pi^+ + a$. Flavor-violating constraints in the lepton sector are not as relevant as those stemming from star cooling that restrict the diagonal $ee$ and $\mu\mu$ axion couplings to charged leptons. We also obtain axion mass bounds for the most interesting models and discuss how minimal flavored PQ symmetries provide a natural framework to suppress flavor-violating couplings.</description>

      <title>Superheavy dark matter from the natural inflation in light of the highest-energy astroparticle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superheavy dark matter has been attractive as a candidate of particle dark matter. We propose a ``natural" particle model, in which the dark matter serves as the inflaton in natural inflation, while decaying to high-energy particles at energies of $10^{9}-10^{13} \, \text{GeV}$ from the prediction of the inflation. A scalar field responsible for diluting the dark matter abundance revives the natural inflation either with or without the recent data from the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and baryon acoustic oscillation results from Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. Since the dark matter must be a spin-zero scalar, we carefully study the galactic dark matter 3-body decay into fermions and two body decays into a gluon pair, and point out relevant multi-messenger bounds that constrain these decay modes. Interestingly, the predicted energy scale may coincide with the AMATERASU event and/or the KM3NeT neutrino event, KM3-230213A. We also point out particle models with dark baryon to further alleviate $\gamma$-ray bounds. This scenario yields several testable predictions for the UHECR observations, including the highest-energy neutrons that are unaffected by magnetic fields, the tensor-to-scalar ratio, the running of spectral indices, $\alpha_s\gtrsim\mathcal{O}(0.001)$, and the existence of light new colored particles that could be accessible at future collider experiments. Further measurements of high-energy cosmic rays, including their components and detailed directions, may provide insight into not only the origin of the cosmic rays but also inflation.</description>

      <title>Photoproduction and detection of $\rho'\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decays in ultra-peripheral collisions and at an electron-ion collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector meson photoproduction is an important probe of nuclear structure. Light vector mesons are most sensitive to low$-x$ structure, as long as they are not too light for perturbative QCD calculations. The $\rho'$ is of interest as an intermediate mass state (between the $\rho$ and $J/\psi$) that is easier to detect than the $\phi$.
  Using HERA data on proton targets, we make projections for lead/gold targets in UPCs at the Large Hadron Collider and RHIC, and for $ep$ and $eA$ collisions at a future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). We compare the UPC projections with ALICE data, and constrain the branching ratio divided by the square of the photon-$\rho'$ coupling. The data prefer large couplings and small branching ratio, probably less than 25\%. The photon-meson coupling predicted by generalized vector meson dominance does not fit the data. The HERA $ep$ and ALICE UPC $e$Pb data exhibit very similar $4\pi$ mass spectra, indicating that, if the system is composed of two resonances, the products of their photon couplings with their four-pion branching ratios are similar.
  The predicted rates are high for both UPCs and the EIC. The $\rho'\rightarrow\pi^+\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$ decay can be observed at the EIC with high efficiency. In $ep$ collisions at the highest energy, the forward B0 detector is needed to observe this channel down to the lowest achievable Bjorken$-x$ values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.22248v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a scenario where the Standard Model is extended by a SU(2) gauge group in the dark sector. The three associated dark gauge bosons are stabilised via a custodial symmetry triggered by an additional dark SU(2) scalar doublet, thus making them viable dark-matter candidates. After considering the most recent constraints for this model, we analyse the phase transition dynamics and compute the power spectrum of resulting stochastic gravitational-wave background. Finally, we find regions of the parameter space yielding the observed dark-matter relic density while also leading to strong enough phase transition with an associated gravitational-wave signal reaching the sensitivity of future space-based gravitational-wave detector, such as LISA, DECIGO, BBO, TianQin or Taiji.</description>

      <title>Nuclear modification factor within a dynamical approach to the complex entropic index</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel approach to the nuclear deformation factor $R_{\text{AA}}$, grounded in the dynamical effects of the Quark-Gluon Plasma on parton momentum. The approach uses the Blast-Wave method combined with Tsallis Statistics, within the Cooper-Frye freeze-out framework and, by profiting from appropriate simplifications, it gives analytical expressions that describe the observed $R_{\text{AA}}$ for two sets of independent measurements at $\sqrt{s}=2.76$ TeV and $\sqrt{s}=5.02$ TeV. A nonlinear dynamical equation describes the dynamics and leads to log-periodic oscillations. With the analytical solutions for that equation, it is possible to link the dynamical approach with the complex-$q$ formalism, which was proposed to describe the log-oscillations observed in experimental data.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group study of rho condensate at a finite isospin chemical potential in the quark meson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02745v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of an isospin chemical potential ($\mu_{I}$) within the quark-meson model, which approximates quantum chromodynamics (QCD) by modeling low energy phenomena such as chiral symmetry breaking and phase structure under varying conditions of temperature and chemical potential. Using the functional renormalization group (FRG) flow equations, we calculate the phase diagram in the chiral limit within the two-flavor quark-meson model in a finite $\mu_{I}$ with $\rho$ vector meson interactions. The $\rho$ vector meson is condensed (in addition to the chiral condensate) when the isospin chemical potential reaches a critical value $\mu_{I} = \mu_{Icrit}$ for various chemical potentials. This occurs when $\mu_{I} &gt; \mu_{Icrit}$. The $\rho$ condensation that results is numerically produced at varying $\rho$ meson couplings. The region dominated by the $\rho$ meson is separated by a second-order phase transition line at low critical $\mu_{I}$ and a first-order transition line at slightly higher values.</description>

      <title>The virtual contributions from $K^*$ in the $B \to K^*\pi h$ and $B \to K\rho h$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09578v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the significant virtual contributions of the subprocesses $D^{*}/B^{*}\to D\pi$ and $ \rho\to\omega \pi/K\bar{K}$ in the three-body hadronic $B$ meson decays, we study the off-shell effects of the resonance $K^*$ decaying into the $K^*\pi$ or $K\rho$ system in the decays $B \to K^*\pi h$ and $B \to K\rho h$ (with $h=\pi, K$) within the perturbative QCD approach. The strong coupling constants $g_{K^*K^*\pi}$ and $g_{K^*K\rho}$ involved in this work are derived from the coupling constant $g_{\rho\omega\pi}$ under the flavor SU$(3)$ symmetry. The $CP$ averaged branching fractions for the quasi-two-body decays $B\to K^*[\to K^*\pi] h$ and $B\to K^*[\to K\rho] h$ are predicted to be on the order of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-7}$ in this study. And the branching fractions for the decays $B\to K^*[\to K\rho] h$ are found to be around half of the corresponding results for the $B\to K^*[\to K^*\pi] h$ channels, mainly due to the phase space difference between the $K\rho$ and $K^*\pi$ pairs originating from the intermediate state $K^*$. Experimental data for the $K^*$ decaying into the final states $K^*\pi$ and $K\rho$ in the $B$ meson decays is expected to be obtained by the LHCb and Belle-II experiments in the near future.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07698v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse electromagnetic leptogenesis within the framework of an effective field theory, where the dynamics is governed by the gauge-invariant dipole operator $O_{NB}$. The Wilson coefficient $C_{NB}$ is matched at one loop and renormalisation-group (RG) evolved to the electroweak scale. After electroweak symmetry breaking we compute flavour-dependent two-body decay widths and CP asymmetries for $N\to\nu+\gamma/Z$, and solve the fully flavoured Boltzmann equations. In the $N_1$-dominated regime the freeze-out baryon asymmetry is $Y_B^{\rm FO}\lesssim 10^{-17}$, far below the observed value $Y_B^{\rm obs}\simeq 8.7\times 10^{-11}$. The suppression is structural: gauge invariance forces a Higgs insertion; therefore dipole couplings $\mu\propto v/M_{\Psi}^2$ while the matched coefficient $C_{NB}$ is loop-generated and further reduced by RG running. We note that in the quasi-degenerate limit the self-energy resonance can be operative and suggest a plausible path to $Y_B^{\rm obs}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.22526v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments use Monte Carlo event generators to predict neutrino-nucleus interactions. Cross section uncertainties are typically implemented by varying the parameters of the model(s) used in the generator. We study the performance of two commonly-used model configurations of the GENIE generator (G18_10a_02_11a and AR23_0i_00_000) and their uncertainties by tuning parameters to cross section data, and then comparing the resulting tuned prediction to a suite of other measurements from T2K, MicroBooNE, and MINERvA. This reveals whether the model can simultaneously describe several datasets, as well as whether the uncertainties are adequately robust. We find that G18 and especially AR23 are reasonable in predicting lower-energy measurements from T2K and MicroBooNE, but unable to describe MINERvA data, and discuss the implications for short-baseline oscillation searches. We attempt to replicate a tuning procedure developed by MicroBooNE using several different measurements, and find substantially different results depending on which measurement is used, and that the MicroBooNE tune does not agree with other measurements. We conclude that the SBN experiment should not tune its generator to external data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that measuring dark matter signal by projecting quantum sensors in the collective excited state can highly suppress the non-collective noise background, hence improving the sensitivity significantly. We trace the evolution of the sensors' state in the presence of both dark matter effect and sensors' decoherence effects, optimizing the protocol execution time, and show that the suppression of background by a factor equal to the number of sensors is possible. This method does not require the entanglement of sensors during the signal accumulation time, hence circumventing the difficulty of maintaining the lifetime of the entangled state that is present in other enhancement proposals. This protocol is also general regarding the type of qubit sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.23808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultralight scalar dark matter may couple to the Standard Model through dimension-five operators that contain the field-strength tensors of the gauge interactions. Recent progress in nuclear clocks is projected to increase the sensitivity to such couplings by several orders of magnitude. Future experimental constraints may even have Planck-scale sensitivity, calling for a study of such couplings in a framework that includes quantum gravity. We take a first step towards providing the theoretical constraints on such couplings that arise in asymptotically safe gravity. We find evidence that such couplings vanish in asymptotically safe gravity and are also not generated in a perturbative quantum-gravity regime that describes quantum gravity as an effective field theory.</description>

Abstract: Ab initio predictions of two-loop electroweak contributions to observables are increasingly essential for precision collider experiments, yet their evaluation remains very challenging. We connect recurrence techniques and dispersive method in order to evaluate complex multi-loop Feynman diagrams. By expressing multi-point Passarino-Veltman functions in a two-point basis and using shifted space-time dimensions with recurrence relations, we minimize the number of required dispersive integrals. This approach reduces computation time and enables a precise and efficient analysis of one- and two-loop diagrams.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by several mild excesses around 95 GeV, we investigate the prospects for a light scalar $S$ produced via Higgsstrahlung, $e^+e^- \to Z(\mu^+\mu^-)S$, at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories. We take the CEPC as a benchmark, with a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}=240$ GeV and an integrated luminosity of $L=20~\mathrm{ab}^{-1}$. We focus on the decay modes $S\to\tau^+\tau^-$ and $S\to b\bar b$. To maximize sensitivity, we employ the particle-level transformer networks Particle Transformer (ParT) and its more-interactive variant MIParT, which exploit the features of all reconstructed objects and their correlations. For a representative signal benchmark, this approach improves the expected statistical precision on the signal strength by factors of 2.4 in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel and 1.4 in the $b\bar b$ channel compared to a cut-based analysis. Within the flipped Next-to-Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (N2HDM-F), the CEPC can measure the signal strength with a statistical precision down to 1.0% in the $\tau^+\tau^-$ channel and 0.68% in the $b\bar b$ channel using MIParT. It can achieve a $5\sigma$ discovery for $\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS}&gt;1.6\times10^{-2}$ or $\mu_{bb}^{ZS}&gt;4.9\times10^{-3}$, and reach 1% precision for $\mu_{\tau\tau}^{ZS}&gt;0.96$ or $\mu_{bb}^{ZS}&gt;0.14$. These gains are expected to qualitatively carry over to other future lepton colliders such as FCC-ee and the ILC. Our results demonstrate the potential of particle-level machine-learning techniques to strengthen light Higgs searches at future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Inflation RIDES Again</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05799v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the recent Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) results, we revisit chaotic inflation based on a single complex scalar field with mass term $M^2 |\Phi|^2$, which usually predicts a spectra index $n_s\approx 0.96$ but a too-large tensor to scalar ratio $r\approx 0.16$. With radiative corrections, the potential $M^2 |\Phi|^2 \ln \left( |\Phi|^2/\Lambda^2 \right)$ induces spontaneous symmetry breaking near the scale $\Lambda$, yielding a Pseudo Nambu-Goldstone boson which can play the role of a quintessence field, hence radiative inflation and dark energy (RIDE). Including a non-minimal coupling to gravity
  $\xi |\Phi|^2 R^2$ reduces $r$, allowing a good fit of the RIDE model to Planck data. Allowing a small additional quartic coupling correction $\lambda |\Phi|^4$ increases both $n_s$ and $r$, with a good fit to ACT data sets achieved for $\xi \approx 1$.</description>

      <title>The Intrinsic Dimension of Collider Events and Model-Independent Searches in 100 Dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20760v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The phase space of hadron collider events spans hundreds of dimensions, generating an intricate geometry that we are just starting to explore. The number of possible new physics signals is exponential in the number of dimensions and detecting all of them is currently impossible for any human or artificial intelligence. In this work we introduce a method to search for new physics model-independently in this high-dimensional space. It is based on the measurement of the most basic property of the manifold of collider events, its dimensionality. Our proposed technique does not suffer from a look-elsewhere effect that grows exponentially with the number of dimensions of the dataset, and by construction is insensitive to energy scale uncertainties. We illustrate its potential by finding new physics in simulated events with hundreds of phase space dimensions, taking as input single particles rather than jets. This study sets the stage for new model-independent search strategies based on global properties of collider data manifolds.</description>

      <title>Saturation effects in exclusive vector meson production in DIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate saturation effects in exclusive vector meson production in deep inelastic scattering (DIS), where we model fluctuations within the target protons as localized color-charge hotspots. Based on the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) framework and the dipole picture for vector meson production, we examine the dependencies of coherent and incoherent scattering cross sections on the momentum transfer. We draw conclusions on the effectiveness of our hot spot model and the strength of the suppression of the scattering cross sections caused by saturation effects. We find that saturation has mild effects in the given energy and charge-density ranges, but can also show that suppression becomes more prominent as the color-charge density inside the proton increases.</description>

      <title>Holographic description of the kaon gravitational form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the kaon gravitational form factor (GFF) using a bottom-up holographic QCD approach that incorporates SU(3) flavor symmetry breaking through the strange quark mass. We present the resulting Q^2 dependence of the kaon GFF and compare it with that of the pion. In the high-energy limit, the kaon GFF exhibits a 1/Q^2 falloff, in agreement with perturbative QCD. Furthermore, we extract the gravitational radius of the kaon and find it to be almost the same as that of the pion, with a slightly smaller value.</description>

      <title>Species scale associated with Weinberg operator and bound on Majorana neutrino mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When states in a tower like the Kaluza-Klein or the string tower couple to another state through the irrelevant operators of the same type, their contributions to the loop corrections of the relevant or the marginal operators are not negligible, threatening the perturbativity. This can be avoided provided the cutoff scale is lower than the species scale associated with the irrelevant operator. We apply this to towers of states associated with the neutrino which couple to the Higgs through the Weinberg operator, the dimension-5 irrelevant operator generating the Majorana neutrino mass. Requiring the `Majorana species scale', the species scale associated with the Weinberg operator, to be below the gravitational species scale, one finds the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass determined by the species number. The Festina-Lente bound also gives the lower bound on the Majorana neutrino mass, but it is not so stringent. Meanwhile, even if the neutrino mass is of the Dirac type at the renormalizable level, the Majorana mass term still can be written in the effective field theory action so far as the Weinberg operator is not forbidden. Even if the Majorana neutrino mass is larger than the Dirac one, so far as there are sufficient degrees of freedom with mass smaller than the scale of the cosmological constant, the observation of the Majorana nature of the neutrino may not contradict to quantum gravity constraints which rules out the neutrino mass purely given by the Majorana type.</description>

      <title>Dark Classification Matters: Searching for Primordial Black Holes with LSST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present projected constraints on the abundance of primordial black holes (PBHs) as a constituent of dark matter, based on microlensing observations from the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. We use a catalogue of microlensing light curves simulated with Rubin Observatory's OpSims to demonstrate that competitive constraints crucially rely on minimising the false positive rate (FPR) of the classification algorithm. We propose the Bayesian information criterion and a Boosted Decision Tree as effective discriminators and compare their derived efficiency and FPR to a more standard $\chi^2$-test.</description>

      <title>SN 2025coe: A Multiple-Peaked Calcium-Strong Transient from A White-Dwarf Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SN 2025coe is a calcium-strong transient located at an extremely large projected offset $\sim$39.3 kpc from the center of its host, the nearby early-type galaxy NGC 3277 at a distance of $\sim$25.5 Mpc. In this paper, we present multi-band photometric and spectroscopic observations spanning $\sim$100 days post-discovery. Its multi-band light curves display {multiple} distinct peaks: (1) an initial peak at $t \approx 1.6$ days attributed to shock cooling emission, (2) a secondary peak of $M_{R, \, peak} \approx$ $-$15.8 mag at $t \approx 10.2$ days powered by radioactive decay, and (3) a {possible} late-time bump at $t \approx 42.8$ days likely caused by ejecta-circumstellar material/clump interaction. Spectral evolution of SN 2025coe reveals a fast transition to the nebular phase within 2 months, where it exhibits an exceptionally high [Ca II]/[O I] ratio larger than 6. Modeling of the bolometric light curve suggests an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} = 0.29^{+0.14}_{-0.15} \, M_{\odot}$, a $^{56}$Ni mass of $M_{\rm ^{56}Ni} = 2.4^{+0.06}_{-0.05} \times 10^{-2} M_{\odot}$, and a progenitor envelope with mass $M_e = 1.4^{+6.9}_{-1.2} \times 10^{-3} \, M_{\odot}$ and radius $R_e = 13.5^{+64.1}_{-11.1} \, R_{\odot}$. The tidal disruption of a hybrid HeCO white dwarf (WD) by a low-mass CO WD provides a natural explanation for the low ejecta mass, the small fraction of $^{56}$Ni, and the presence of an extended, low-mass envelope.</description>

      <title>Transport properties of stochastic fluids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12557v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study heat conduction and momentum transport in the context of stochastic fluid dynamics. We consider a fluid described by model H in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin. We study both non-critical and critical fluids, and we investigate transport properties in two as well as three dimensions. Our results are based on numerical simulations of model H using a Metropolis algorithm, and we employ Kubo relations to extract transport coefficients. We observe the expected logarithmic divergence of the shear viscosity in a two-dimensional non-critical fluid. At a critical point, we find that the transport coefficients exhibit power-law scaling with the system size $L$. The strongest divergence is seen for the thermal conductivity $\kappa$ in two dimensions. We find $\kappa\sim L^{x_\kappa}$ with $x_\kappa=1.6\pm 0.1$. The divergence is weaker in three dimensions, $x_\kappa=1.25 \pm 0.3$, and the scaling exponent for the shear viscosity, $x_\eta$, is significantly smaller than $x_\kappa$ in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Two Shades of Quark Color: Parallel Canons across the Cold War Divide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23909v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The introduction of the color quantum number is conventionally narrated as a linear progression from the quark-model statistics paradox to quantum chromodynamics (QCD). This paper challenges that teleology by arguing that "color" emerged as two conceptually distinct constructs during the Cold War. The first, originating with Han and Nambu and culminating in QCD, conceived of color as a local gauge charge, the source of a fundamental force mediated by gluons. The second, developed at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna, treated color as a hidden, three-valued label--a statistical and structural property within a composite, S-matrix-inflected hadron model. We trace these parallel narratives, linking the Dubna approach to a holist epistemology that prioritizes observable amplitudes and global constraints, and the QCD approach to a reductionist program grounded in micro-dynamics. A case study of Fermilab's E-36 experimental chain (1970--78) shows how an observables-first design-tuned to S-matrix and Regge constraints on forward elastic scattering--performed robustly within its natural domain but was ultimately discontinued amid declining theoretical interest and involvement. The subsequent hegemony of QCD retroactively projected its gauge-theoretic conception of color onto history, erasing this epistemic diversity. We conclude that the marginalization of Dubna's structural color was not merely a political outcome of the Cold War but a result of deep ontological and philosophical divergences, advocating for a domain-sensitive pluralism in the historiography of particle physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Three-Family Supersymmetric Pati-Salam Models from Type IIA Intersecting D6-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalizing three-family chiral fermion conditions to $I_{ac}=-(3+h)$ and $I_{ac'}=h$, with positive integer $h$, we extend the landscape of three-family ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in a broader region. Differing from the former investigation with $I_{ac}=-3$ and $I_{ac'}=0$, we do not restrict that the $a$ stack of D6-branes must be parallel to the orientifold image of the $c$-stack along one of the three two-tori. In this investigation, without the simple parallel construction, we find four new classes of supersymmetric Pati-Salam models that are allowed by the extended three generation condition with $I_{ac}=3, I_{ac'}=-6$ and $I_{ac}=-1, I_{ac'}=-2$ through the intersections of $a$- and $c/c'$-branes. Moreover, with the $SU(2)'_{L}$ gauge coupling realized from $SU(2)_{L_1}\times SU(2)_{L_2}$ symmetry breaking, the canonical normalization requirement of the gauge kinetic term provides an alternative approach that can be imposed before the renormalization group equation evolution for $SU(2)'_L$ gauge coupling. This turns out to be an effective mechanism to realize the string-scale gauge coupling relation, especially for the new supersymmetric Pati-Salam models with large $g_b/g_a$ ratio. We show that this symmetry-breaking modified renormalization group evolution can highly suppress $g_b/g_a$, and finally realizes string-scale gauge coupling relations for the extended supersymmetric Pati-Salam models as well.</description>
