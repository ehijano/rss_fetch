      <title>The mass-metallicity relation as a ruler for galaxy evolution: insights from the James Webb Space Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy evolution emerges from the balance between cosmic gas accretion, fueling star formation, and supernova (SN) feedback, regulating the metal enrichment. Hence, the stellar mass ($M_*$) - gas metallicity relation (MZR) is key to understand the physics of galaxies. High-quality JWST data enable accurate measurements of the MZR up to redshift z=10. Our aims are to understand the observed MZR, its connection with the star formation rate (SFR), the role played by SFR stochasticity, and how it is regulated by SN feedback. We compare the MZR from the JADES, CEERS, and UNCOVER surveys, which comprise about 180 galaxies at $z=3-10$ with $10^6&lt;M_*/M_\odot&lt;10^{10}$, with 200 galaxies from the SERRA cosmological simulations. To interpret the MZR, we develop a minimal model for galaxy evolution that includes: cosmic accretion modulated with an amplitude $A_{100}$ on 100 Myr; a time delay $t_d$ between SFR and SN; SN-driven outflows with a varying mass loading factor $\epsilon_{SN}$. Using our minimal model, we find the observed mean MZR is reproduced by weak outflows ($\epsilon_{SN}=1/4$), in line with findings from JADES. Matching the observed MZR dispersion requires $t_d=20$ Myr and a $A_{100}=1/3$ modulation of the accretion rate. Successful models have low stochasticity ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.2$), yielding a MZR dispersion of $\sigma_{Z}=0.2$. Such values are close but lower than SERRA predictions ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.24$, $\sigma_{Z}=0.3$), clarifying why SERRA show no clear MZR trend and some tension with the observations. As the MZR is very sensitive to SFR stochasticity, models predicting high r.m.s. values ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.5$) result in a ``chemical chaos'' (i.e. $\sigma_{Z}=1.4$), virtually destroying the MZR. As a consequence, invoking a highly stochastic SFR ($\sigma_{SFR}=0.8$) to explain the overabundance of bright, super-early galaxies leads to inconsistencies with the observed MZR.</description>

      <title>Modelling the multi-wavelength detection of protoclusters. I: An excess of submillimetre galaxies in protocluster cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies of galaxy protoclusters yield insights into galaxy cluster formation complementary to those obtained via `archaeological' studies of present-day galaxy clusters. Submillimetre-selected galaxies (SMGs) are one class of sources used to find high-redshift protoclusters. However, due to the rarity of protoclusters (and thus the large simulation volume required) and the complexity of modeling dust emission from galaxies, the relationship between SMGs and protoclusters has not been adequately addressed in the theoretical literature. In this work, we apply the L-GALAXIES semi-analytic model (SAM) to the Millennium N-body simulation. We assign submillimetre (submm) flux densities to the model galaxies using a scaling relation from previous work, in which dust radiative transfer was performed on high-resolution galaxy zoom simulations. We find that the fraction of model galaxies that are submm-bright is higher in protocluster cores than in both protocluster `outskirts' and the field; the fractions for the latter two are similar. This excess is not driven by an enhanced starburst frequency. Instead, the primary reason is that overdense environments have a relative overdensity of high-mass halos and thus `oversample' the high-mass end of the star formation main sequence relative to less-dense environments. The fraction of SMGs that are optically bright is dependent on stellar mass and redshift but independent of environment. The fraction of galaxies for which the majority of star formation is dust-obscured is higher in protocluster cores, primarily due to the dust-obscured fraction being correlated with stellar mass. Our results can be used to guide and interpret multi-wavelength studies of galaxy populations in protoclusters.</description>

      <title>An ALMA survey of submillimetre galaxies in the Extended Chandra Deep Field South: an unbiased study of SMG environments measured with narrowband imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are some of the most extreme star-forming systems in the Universe, whose place in the framework of galaxy evolution is as yet uncertain. It has been hypothesised that SMGs are progenitors of local early-type galaxies, requiring that SMGs generally reside in galaxy cluster progenitors at high redshift. We test this hypothesis and explore SMG environments using a narrowband VLT/HAWK-I+GRAAL study of H$\alpha$ and [OIII] emitters around an unbiased sample of three ALMA-identified and spectroscopically-confirmed SMGs at $z \sim 2.3$ and $z \sim 3.3$, where these SMGs were selected solely on spectroscopic redshift. Comparing with blank-field observations at similar epochs, we find that one of the three SMGs lies in an overdensity of emission-line sources on the $\sim4$ Mpc scale of the HAWK-I field of view, with overdensity parameter $\delta_{g} = 2.6^{+1.4}_{-1.2}$. A second SMG is significantly overdense only on $\lesssim 1.6$ Mpc scales and the final SMG is consistent with residing in a blank field environment. The total masses of the two overdensities are estimated to be $\log(M_{h}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) =$12.1--14.4, leading to present-day masses of $\log(M_{h,z=0}/{\rm M}_{\odot}) =$12.9--15.9. These results imply that SMGs occupy a range of environments, from overdense protoclusters or protogroups to the blank field, suggesting that while some SMGs are strong candidates for the progenitors of massive elliptical galaxies in clusters, this may not be their only possible evolutionary pathway.</description>

      <title>Apocalypse When? No Certainty of a Milky Way -- Andromeda Collision</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that our own Milky Way is on a collision course with the neighbouring Andromeda galaxy. As a result of their merger, predicted in around five billion years, the two large spiral galaxies that define the present Local Group would form a new elliptical galaxy. Here we consider the latest and most accurate observations by the Gaia and Hubble space telescopes, along with recent consensus mass estimates to derive possible future scenarios and identify the major sources of uncertainty in the evolution of the Local Group over the next 10 billion years. We find that the next most massive Local Group member galaxies -- namely, M33 and the Large Magellanic Cloud -- distinctly and radically affect the Milky Way - Andromeda orbit. While including M33 increases the merger probability, the orbit of the Large Magellanic Cloud runs perpendicular to the Milky Way - Andromeda orbit and makes their merger less likely. In the full system, we find that uncertainties in the present positions, motions, and masses of all galaxies leave room for drastically different outcomes, and a probability of close to 50% that there is no Milky Way - Andromeda merger during the next 10 billion years.</description>

      <title>Reverberation mapping of high-mass and high-redshift quasars using gravitational time delays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mass estimates of black holes (BHs) in the centers of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) often rely on the radius-luminosity relation. However, this relation, usually probed by reverberation mapping (RM), is poorly constrained in the high-luminosity and high-redshift ends due to the very long expected lag times. Multiply imaged AGN may thus offer a unique opportunity to explore the radius-luminosity relation at these ends. In addition to comprising several magnified images which enable a more efficient light-curve sampling, the time delay between multiple images of strongly lensed quasars can also aid in making such RM measurements feasible on reasonable timescales: If the time delay is, for example, of the order of the expected time lag, changes in the emission lines in the leading image can be observed around the same time as the changes in the continuum in the trailing image. In this work we probe the typical time-delay distribution in galaxy-cluster lenses and estimate the number of both high-mass ($\sim10^9-10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$), and high-redshift ($z\gtrsim4-12$) quasars that are expected to be strongly lensed by clusters. We find that less than one, very massive (and luminous, L$_{UV}&gt;10^{46.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$) multiply imaged quasar is expected across the sky down to 30 AB mag. Nonetheless, up to several dozen thousand M$_{BH}\sim10^{6}$-$10^{8}$ M$_{\odot}$ broad-line AGN at $z&gt;4$ should be multiply imaged by galaxy clusters and detectable with JWST, hundreds with $\textit{Euclid}$ and several thousands with the $\textit{Roman}$ Space Telescope, across the whole sky. These could supply an important calibration for the BH mass scaling in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Evolution of H$\alpha$ Equivalent Widths from $z \sim 0.4-2.2$: implications for star formation and legacy surveys with Roman and Euclid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the `intrinsic' H$\alpha$ EW distributions of $z \sim 0.4 - 2.2$ narrowband-selected H$\alpha$ samples from HiZELS and DAWN using a forward modeling approach. We find an EW - stellar mass anti-correlation with steepening slopes $-0.18\pm0.03$ to $-0.24^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ at $z \sim 0.4$ and $z\sim 2.2$, respectively. Typical EW increases as $(1+z)^{1.78^{+0.22}_{-0.23}}$ for a $10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ emitter from $15^{+2.4}_{-2.3}$\r{A} ($z \sim 0.4$) to $67.7^{+10.4}_{-10.0}$\r{A} ($z \sim 2.2$) and is steeper with decreasing stellar mass highlighting the high EW nature of low-mass high-$z$ systems. We model this redshift evolving anti-correlation, $W_0(M,z)$, and find it produces H$\alpha$ luminosity and SFR functions strongly consistent with observations validating the model and allowing us to use $W_0(M,z)$ to investigate the relative contribution of H$\alpha$ emitters towards cosmic SF. We find EW$_0 &gt; 200$ \r{A} emitters contribute significantly to cosmic SF activity at $z \sim 1.5 - 2$ making up $\sim 40$% of total SF consistent with sSFR $&gt; 10^{-8.5}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($\sim 45 - 55$%). Overall, this highlights the importance of high EW systems at high-$z$. Our $W_0(M,z)$ model also reproduces the cosmic sSFR evolution found in simulations and observations and show that tension between the two can simply arise from selection effects in observations. Lastly, we forecast Roman and Euclid grism surveys using $W_0(M,z)$ including observational efficiency and limiting resolution effects where we predict $\sim 24000$ and $\sim 30000$ $0.5 &lt; z &lt; 1.9$ H$\alpha$ emitters per deg$^{-2}$, respectively, down to $&gt;5\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ including $10^{7.2 - 8}$ M$_\odot$ galaxies at $z &gt; 1$ with EW$_0 &gt;1000$\r{A}. Both Roman and Euclid will enable us to observe with unprecedented detail some of the most bursty/high EW, low-mass star-forming galaxies near cosmic noon.</description>

      <title>Dynamical friction in rotating ultralight dark matter galactic cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical friction and stellar orbital motion in spiral galaxies with dark matter composed of ultralight bosons in the state of {rotating} Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) are studied. It is found that the dynamical friction force is significantly affected by the topological charge of the vortex structure of the BEC core with the strongest effect at distances near the galactic center. It is also shown that the ultralight dark matter self-interaction plays an important role in studying the dynamical friction.</description>

      <title>Simulating intermediate black hole mass measurements for a sample of galaxies with nuclear star clusters using ELT/HARMONI high spatial resolution integral-field stellar kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fraction of low-mass galaxies hosting an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH, with masses $M_{\rm BH} \approx 10^2-10^5$ M$_\odot$), is sensitive to how black hole seeds formed in the early Universe but is observationally still unconstrained. In this paper, we assemble a sample of dwarf galaxies within 10 Mpc hosting bright nuclear star clusters (NSCs) that could host IMBHs. For a subset of them, we use their observed surface brightness from {\it Hubble Space Telescope} (\hst) images, an assumed synthetic spectrum of their stellar population, Jeans Anisotropic Model (JAM) of the stellar dynamics, and the {\tt HSIM} simulator software to create mock observations with the High Angular Resolution Monolithic Optical and Near-infrared Integral (HARMONI) field spectrograph for the Extremely Large Telescope (ELT). We analyze the simulated data cube like real data, using JAM to infer the IMBH mass and its error in a Bayesian framework. Our simulations show that the ELT/HARMONI instrument can clearly detect the existence of IMBH demographics in NSCs down to a mass of about 0.5\% of the NSC.</description>

      <title>MHD lensing in inhomogeneous ISM for qualitative understanding of the morphology of supernova remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Morphological evolution of expanding shells of fast-mode magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves through an inhomogeneous ISM is investigated in order to qualitatively understand the complicated morphology of shell-type supernova remnants (SNR). Interstellar clouds with high Alfv\'en velocity act as concave lenses to diverge the MHD waves, while those with slow Alfv\'en velocity act as convex lenses to converge the waves to the focal points. By combination of various types of clouds and fluctuations with different Alfv\'en velocities, sizes, or wavelengths, the MHD-wave shells attain various morphological structures, exhibiting filaments, arcs, loops, holes, and focal strings, mimicking old and deformed SNRs.</description>

      <title>Do all the quasars and high-excitation radio galaxies (HERGs) in the 3CRR catalog contain a magnetically arrested disk (MAD)?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the magnetization, an accretion disk with large-scale magnetic field can be separated into either standard and normal evolution (SANE) or magnetically arrested disk (MAD), which are difficult to identify from observations. It is still unclear whether all the radio-loud active galactic nuclei (RLAGNs) with a thin disk and strong radio emissions contain a MAD. We investigate this issue by utilizing the 3CRR catalog. We compile a sample of 35 quasars and 14 high-excitation radio galaxies powered by a thin accretion disk. In order to consistently compare with the MAD sample given by Li et al. (2022), the optical-UV emissions of our sample are all detected by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). It is found that the average X-ray luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$) of our sample is about 5.0 times higher than that of radio-quiet AGNs (RQAGNs) with matching optical-UV luminosity ($L_{\rm UV}$), in general accord with the factor of 4.5 times in MAD sample within the uncertainty. The relationship between radio (5~GHz) and X-ray (2 keV) luminosities in the 3CRR sources is also found to be consistent with the MAD sample. Furthermore, the jet efficiencies of 3CRR sources are consistent with those from the GRMHD simulations of MAD. Therefore, we suggest that probably all the quasars and at least a fraction of high-excitation radio galaxies in the 3CRR catalog, and perhaps all the RLAGNs with strong radio emissions contain a MAD.</description>

      <title>Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument. II. Statistical Properties from the First Data Release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the identification of changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGNs) from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument First Data Release and Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 16 at z \leq 0.9. To confirm the CL-AGNs, we utilize spectral flux calibration assessment via an [O\,{\sc iii}]-based calibration, pseudo-photometry examination, and visual inspection. This rigorous selection process allows us to compile a statistical catalog of 561 CL-AGNs, encompassing 527 $\rm H\beta$, 149$\rm H\alpha$, and 129 Mg II CL behaviors. In this sample, we find 1) a 283:278 ratio of turn-on to turn-off CL-AGNs. 2) the critical value for CL events is confirmed around Eddington ratio \sim 0.01. 3) a strong correlation between the change in the luminosity of the broad emission lines (BEL) and variation in the continuum luminosity, with Mg II and $\rm H\beta$ displaying similar responses during CL phases. 4) the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich diagram for CL-AGNs shows no statistically difference from the general AGN catalog. 5) five CL-AGNs are associated with asymmetrical mid-infrared flares, possibly linked to tidal disruption events. Given the large CL-AGNs and the stochastic sampling of spectra, we propose that some CL events are inherently due to typical AGN variability during low accretion rates, particularly for CL events of the singular BEL. Finally, we introduce a Peculiar CL phase, characterized by a gradual decline over decades in the light curve and the complete disappearance of entire BEL in faint spectra, indicative of a real transition in the accretion disk.</description>

      <title>The most distant HI galaxies discovered by the 500 m dish FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral hydrogen (HI) is the primary component of the cool interstellar medium (ISM) and is the reservoir of fuel for star formation. Owing to the sensitivity of existing radio telescopes, our understanding of the evolution of the ISM in galaxies remains limited, as it is based on only a few hundred galaxies detected in HI beyond the local Universe. With the high sensitivity of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we carried out a blind HI search, the FAST Ultra-Deep Survey (FUDS), which extends to redshifts up to 0.42 and a sensitivity of 50 $\rm \mu Jy \cdot beam^{-1}$. Here, we report the first discovery of six galaxies in HI at $z&gt;0.38$. For these galaxies, the FAST angular resolution of $\sim\,4'$ corresponds to a mean linear size of $\sim1.3\,h_{70}^{-1}\,$Mpc. These galaxies are among the most distant HI emission detections known, with one having the most massive HI content ($10^{10.93 \pm 0.04}~h_{70}^{-2}\, \rm M_\odot$). Using recent data from the DESI survey, and new observations with the Hale, BTA, and Keck telescopes, optical counterparts are detected for all galaxies within the 3-$\sigma$ positional uncertainty ($0.5\,h_{70}^{-1}\,$Mpc) and $\rm 200\,km \cdot s^{-1}$ in recession velocity. Assuming that the dominant source of HI is the identified optical counterpart, we find an evidence of evolution in the HI content of galaxies over the last 4.2 Gyr. Our new high-redshift HI galaxy sample provides the opportunity to better investigate the evolution of cool gas in galaxies. A larger sample size in the future will allow us to refine our knowledge of the formation and evolution of galaxies.</description>

      <title>Charting the Lyman-alpha escape fraction in the range 2.9&lt;z&lt;6.7 and consequences for the LAE reionisation contribution</title>

Abstract: The escape of Lyman-alpha photons at redshifts greater than two is an ongoing subject of study and an important quantity to further understanding of Lyman-alpha emitters (LAEs), the transmission of Lyman-alpha photons through the interstellar medium and intergalactic medium, and the impact these LAEs have on cosmic reionisation. This study aims to assess the Lyman-alpha escape fraction over the redshift range 2.9&lt;z&lt;6.7, focusing on VLT/MUSE-selected, gravitationally lensed, intrinsically faint LAEs. These galaxies are of particular interest as the potential drivers of cosmic reionisation. We assessed the Lyman-alpha escape fraction in two ways: through an individual study of 96 LAEs behind the A2744 lensing cluster, with JWST/NIRCam and HST data, and through a study of the global evolution of the escape fraction using the state-of-the-art luminosity functions for LAEs and the UV-selected `parent' population (dust-corrected). We compared these studies to those in the literature based on brighter samples. We find a negligible redshift evolution of the escape fraction for our individual galaxies; it is likely that it was washed out by significant intrinsic scatter. We observed a more significant evolution towards higher escape fractions with decreasing UV magnitude and fit this relation. When comparing the two luminosity functions to derive the escape fraction in a global sense, we saw agreement with previous literature when integrating the luminosity functions to a bright limit. However, when integrating using a faint limit equivalent to the observational limits of our samples, we observed enhanced escape fraction values, particularly around z~6, where the escape fraction becomes consistent with 100%. This indicates for the faint regimes we sampled that galaxies towards reionisation tend to allow very large fractions of Lyman-alpha photons to escape. (shortened)</description>

      <title>Relation between the geometric shape and rotation of Galactic globular clusters</title>

Abstract: We homogeneously measured the elliptical shapes of 163 globular clusters (GCs) using the on-sky distribution of their cluster members and the third data release of the ESA mission Gaia (DR3). The astrometry enables the differentiation of stars within clusters from those in the field. This feature is particularly valuable for clusters located in densely populated areas of the sky, where conventional methods for measuring the geometry of the GCs are not applicable. The median axial ratio of our full sample is $\langle b/a \rangle = 0.935^{+0.033}_{-0.090}$ and $0.986^{+0.009}_{-0.004}$ for the subset of 11 GCs previously studied based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We investigated whether the minor axis of the ellipses can be interpreted as a pseudo-rotation axis by comparing it to measurements of cluster rotation. Using the radial velocities from Gaia, we detected rotation for three clusters, NGC 5139, NGC 104, and NGC 6341, and observed an alignment between the pseudo-rotation axis and the 2D projection of the real rotation axis. To expand the set of clusters for which rotation has been detected, we analyzed multiple literature references. Depending on the reference used for comparison, we observed an alignment in between 76% to 100% of the clusters. The lack of an alignment observed in some clusters may be linked to different scales analyzed in various studies. Several studies have demonstrated that the orientation of rotation varies with the distance from the center. We estimate that the next Gaia release will increase the number of stars with radial velocities in GCs from $\sim 10,000$ in Gaia DR3 to $\sim 55,000$ in Gaia DR4. This will enable the measurement of rotation and ellipticities at identical angular scales for additional clusters, which will help us to clarify whether the previously mentioned alignment occurs in all clusters.</description>

      <title>A closer look at dwarf galaxies exhibiting MIR variability: AGN confirmation and comparison with non-variable dwarf galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting active black holes in dwarf galaxies has proven to be a challenge due to their small size and weak electromagnetic signatures. Mid-infrared variability has emerged as a promising tool that can be used to detect active low-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies. We analyzed 10.4 years of photometry from the ALL$WISE$/NEO$WISE$ multi-epoch catalogs, identifying 25 objects with AGN-like variability. Independent confirmation of AGN activity was found in 68% of these objects using optical and near-infrared diagnostics. Notably, we discovered a near-infrared coronal line [S IX] $\lambda$ 1.252 $\mu$m in J1205, the galaxy with the lowest stellar mass (log M$_{*}$ = 7.5 M$_{\odot}$) and low metallicity (12 + log(O/H) = 7.46) in our sample. Additionally, we found broad Pa$\alpha$ potentially from the BLR in two targets, and their implied black hole masses are consistent with black hole-stellar mass relations. Comparing non-variable galaxies with similar stellar masses and $WISE$ $W1-W2$ colors, we found no clear trends between variability and large-scale galaxy properties. However, we found that AGN activity likely causes redder $W1-W2$ colors in variable targets, while for the non-variable galaxies, the contribution stems from strong star formation activity. A high incidence of optical broad lines was also observed in variable targets. Our results suggest that mid-infrared variability is an effective method for detecting AGN activity in low-mass galaxies and can help uncover a larger sample of active low-mass ($&lt;$ 10$^{6}$ M$_{\odot}$) black holes in the universe.</description>

      <title>Tip of the Red Giant Branch Distances with JWST. II. I-band Measurements in a Sample of Hosts of 9 SN Ia Match HST Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hubble Tension, a &gt;5 sigma discrepancy between direct and indirect measurements of the Hubble constant (H0), has persisted for a decade and motivated intense scrutiny of the paths used to infer H0. Comparing independently-derived distances for a set of galaxies with different standard candles, such as the tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) and Cepheid variables, can test for systematics in the middle rung of the distance ladder. The I band is the preferred filter for measuring the TRGB due to constancy with color, a result of low sensitivity to population differences in age and metallicity supported by stellar models. We use James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) observations with the maser host NGC 4258 as our geometric anchor to measure I-band (F090W vs F090W-F150W) TRGB distances to 7 hosts of 9 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) within 27 Mpc: NGC 1448, NGC 1559, NGC 2525, NGC 3370, NGC 3447, NGC 5584, and NGC 5643. We compare these with Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Cepheid-based relative distance moduli for the same galaxies and anchor. We find no evidence of a difference between their weighted means, 0.01 +/- 0.04 (stat) +/- 0.04 (sys) mag. We produce fourteen variants of the TRGB analysis, altering the smoothing level and color range used to measure the tips to explore their impact. For some hosts, this changes the identification of the strongest peak, but this causes little change to the sample mean difference producing a full range of 0.01 to 0.03 mag, all consistent at 1 sigma with no difference. The result matches past comparisons of I-band TRGB and Cepheids when both use HST. SNe and anchor samples observed with JWST are too small to yield a measure of H0 that is competitive with the HST sample of 42 SNe Ia and 4 anchors; however, they already provide a vital systematic crosscheck to HST measurements of the distance ladder.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundance gradients of organic molecules within a protostellar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00070v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of low-mass protostellar systems show evidence of rich complex organic chemistry. Their low luminosity, however, makes determining abundance distributions of complex organic molecules (COMs) within the water snowline challenging. However, the excitation conditions sampled by differing molecular distributions may produce substantive changes in the resulting emission. Thus, molecular excitation may recover spatial information from spatially unresolved data. By analyzing spatially-unresolved NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) observations of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN, we aim to determine if CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN are distributed differently in the protostellar disk around HOPS-370, a highly-luminous intermediate mass protostar. Rotational diagram analysis of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN yields rotational temperatures of $198 \pm 1.2$ K and $448 \pm 19$ K, respectively, suggesting the two molecules have different spatial distributions. Source-specific 3D LTE radiative transfer models are used to constrain the spatial distribution of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN within the disk. A uniform distribution with an abundance of $4\times10^{-8}$ reproduces the CH$_3$OH observations. In contrast, the spatial distribution of CH$_3$CN needs to be either more compact (within $\sim120$ au versus $\sim240$ au for CH$_3$OH) or exhibiting a factor of $\gtrsim 15$ increase in abundance in the inner $\sim55$ au. A possible explanation for the difference in spatial abundance distributions of CH$_3$OH and CH$_3$CN is carbon-grain sublimation.</description>

      <title>The extremes of AGN variability: outbursts, deep fades, changing looks, exceptional spectral states, and semi-periodicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00089v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extremes of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) variability offer valuable new insights into the drivers and physics of AGN. We discuss some of the most extreme cases of AGN variability; the highest amplitudes, deep minima states, extreme spectral states, Seyfert-type changes, and semi-periodic signals, including new X-ray observations. The properties of changing-look (CL) AGN are briefly reviewed and a classification scheme is proposed which encompasses the variety of CL phenomena; distinguishing slow and fast events, repeat events, and frozen-look AGN which do not show any emission-line response. Long-term light curves that are densely covered over multiple years, along with follow-up spectroscopy, are utilized to gain insight into the underlying variability mechanisms including accretion disk and broad-line region physics. Remarkable differences are seen, for instance, in the optical spectral response to extreme outbursts, implying distinct intrinsic variability mechanisms. Furthermore, we discuss methods for distinguishing between CL AGN and CL look-alike events (tidal disruption events or supernovae in dense media). Finally, semi-periodic light curve variability is addressed and the latest multiwavelength (MWL) light curve of the binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidate OJ 287 from the MOMO project is presented. Recent results from that project have clearly established the need for new binary SMBH modelling matching the tight new constraints from observations, including the measurement of a low (primary) SMBH mass of ~10^8 Msun which also implies that OJ 287 is no longer in the regime of near-future pulsar timing arrays.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of subgroups of stars associated with open clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00140v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have identified star clusters with multiple components based on accurate spatial distributions and/or proper motions from Gaia DR3, utilising diverse diagnostics to improve our understanding of subgroup evolution. These findings motivated us to search for subgroups among the objects examined in our previous work, which employed fractal statistics. The present study considers seven open clusters that exhibit significant dispersion in age and/or proper motion distributions, suggesting that they would not be single clusters. For characterizing the stellar groups, we calculate the membership probability using Bayesian multi-dimensional analysis by fitting the observed proper motion distribution of the candidates. A probability distribution is also used to determine the distance of the cluster, which is obtained from the mean value of the distance modes. The photometry from Gaia DR3 is compared with evolutionary models to estimate the cluster age and total mass. In our sample, double components are found only for Markarian 38 and NGC 2659. The other five clusters are confirmed as being single. The structural parameters, such as Q, Lambda_MSR and Sigma_LDR are compared with results from N-body simulations to investigate how the morphology of the stellar clustering evolves. The new results, for a more complete sample of cluster members, provide a better definition of the distribution type (central concentration or substructured region) inferred from the m-s plot.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.00358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new Newtonian limit of general relativity is established for stationary axisymmetric gravitationally bound differentially rotating matter distributions with internal pressure. The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal gravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation. The coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also modified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel dynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of collisionless dark matter for disc galaxies, offering an explanation for their observed rotation curves. Halos of abundant cold dark matter particles are not required.</description>

Abstract: The AGORA Cosmorun (arXiv:2106.09738) is a set of hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations carried out within the AGORA High-resolution Galaxy Simulations Comparison Project (arXiv:1308.2669,arXiv:1610.03066). These simulations show the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-sized galaxy using eight of the most widely used numerical codes in the community (Art-I, Enzo, Ramses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gear, Gizmo, and Arepo). In this short report, we describe the public release of the raw output data from all of these simulations at z = 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (plus at z=1, 0 when available), and several metadata files containing the halo centers, virial quantities, and merger trees. The data from even thinner timesteps will be released as soon as the upcoming collaboration papers (VII-IX) are submitted and accepted.</description>

      <title>North Polar Spur: gaseous plume(s) from star-forming regions at $\sim$3-5 kpc from Galactic Center?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that the North Polar Spur (NPS) and many less prominent structures are formed by gaseous metal-rich plumes associated with star-forming regions (SFRs). The SFRs located at the tangent to the 3-5 kpc rings might be particularly relevant to NPS. A multi-temperature mixture of gaseous components and cosmic rays rises above the Galactic disk under the action of their initial momentum and buoyancy. Eventually, the plume velocity becomes equal to that of the ambient gas, which rotates with different angular speed than the stars in the disk. As a result, the plumes acquire characteristic bent shapes. An ad hoc model of plumes' trajectories shows an interesting resemblance to the morphology of structures seen in the radio continuum and X-rays.</description>

      <title>Multi-band analysis of strong gravitationally lensed post-blue nugget candidates from the Kilo-Degree Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the early stages of galaxy evolution, a significant fraction of galaxies undergo a transitional phase between the ``blue nugget" systems, which arise from the compaction of large, active star-forming disks, and the ``red nuggets", which are red and passive compact galaxies. These objects are typically only observable with space telescopes, and detailed studies of their size, mass, and stellar population parameters have been conducted on relatively small samples. Strong gravitational lensing can offer a new opportunity to study them in detail, even with ground-based observations. In this study, we present the first 6 \textit{bona fide} sample of strongly lensed post-blue nugget (pBN) galaxies, which were discovered in the Kilo Degree Survey. By using the lensing-magnified luminosity from optical and near-infrared bands, we have derived robust structural and stellar population properties of the multiple images of the background sources. \rui{The pBN galaxies have very small sizes of $\rm R_{eff}&lt;1.3$ kpc, high mass density inside 1 kpc of $ \rm \log (\Sigma_1/M_{\odot} \mathrm{kpc}^{-2})&gt;9.3$, and low specific star formation rates of $\log (\mathrm{sSFR/Gyr})\lesssim0$, The size-mass and $\Sigma_1$-mass relations of this sample are consistent with those of the red nuggets, while their sSFR is close to the lower end of compact star-forming blue nugget systems at the same redshift, suggesting a clear evolutionary link between them.</description>

      <title>Ne VIII in the warm-hot circumgalactic medium of FIRE simulations and in observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The properties of warm-hot gas around $\sim L_{*}$ galaxies can be studied with absorption lines from highly ionized metals. We predict Ne VIII column densities from cosmological zoom-in simulations of halos with masses in $\sim 10^{12}$ and $\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ from the FIRE project. Ne VIII traces the volume-filling, virial-temperature gas in $\sim 10^{12}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos. In $\sim 10^{13}\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ halos the Ne VIII gas is clumpier, and biased towards the cooler part of the warm-hot phase. We compare the simulations to observations by the CASBaH and CUBS surveys. We show that when inferring halo masses from stellar masses to compare simulated and observed halos, it is important to account for the scatter in the stellar-mass-halo-mass relation, especially at $\,\mathrm{M}_{\star} \gtrsim 10^{10.5} \,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Median Ne VIII columns in the fiducial FIRE-2 model are about as high as observed upper limits allow, while the simulations analyzed do not reproduce the highest observed columns. This suggests that the median Ne VIII profiles predicted by the simulations are consistent with observations, but that the simulations may underpredict the scatter. We find similar agreement with analytical models that assume a product of the halo gas fraction and metallicity (relative to solar) $\sim 0.1$-$0.3$, indicating that observations are consistent with plausible CGM temperatures, metallicities, and gas masses. Variants of the FIRE simulations with a modified supernova feedback model and/or AGN feedback included (as well as some other cosmological simulations from the literature) more systematically underpredict Ne VIII columns. The circumgalactic Ne VIII observations therefore provide valuable constraints on simulations that otherwise predict realistic galaxy properties.</description>

      <title>The CAVITY project. The spatially resolved stellar population properties of galaxies in voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10823v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Universe is shaped as a web-like structure, formed by clusters, filaments, and walls that leave large volumes in between named voids. Galaxies in voids have been found to be of a later type, bluer, less massive, and to have a slower evolution than galaxies in denser environments (filaments and walls). However, the effect of the void environment on their stellar population properties is still unclear. We aim to address this question using 118 optical integral field unit datacubes from the Calar Alto Void Integral-field Treasury surveY (CAVITY), observed with the PMAS/PPaK spectrograph at the 3.5m telescope at the Calar Alto Observatory (Almer\'ia, Spain). We used the non-parametric full spectral fitting code STARLIGHT to estimate their stellar population properties: stellar mass, stellar mass surface density, age, star formation rate (SFR), and specific star formation rate (sSFR). We analysed the results through the global and spatially resolved properties. Then, we compared them with a control sample of galaxies in filaments and walls from the CALIFA survey, matched in stellar mass and morphological type. Key findings include void galaxies having a slightly higher half-light radius (HLR), lower stellar mass surface density, and younger ages across all morphological types, and slightly elevated SFR and sSFR (only significant enough for Sas). Many of these differences appear in the outer parts of spiral galaxies in voids (HLR &gt; 1), which are younger and exhibit a higher sSFR, indicative of less evolved discs. This trend is also found for early-type spirals, suggesting a slower transition from star-forming to quiescent states in voids. Our analysis indicates that void galaxies, influenced by their surroundings, undergo a more gradual evolution, especially in their outer regions, with a more pronounced effect for low-mass galaxies.</description>

      <title>Faraday tomography with CHIME: the `tadpole' feature G137+7</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A direct consequence of Faraday rotation is that the polarized radio sky does not resemble the total intensity sky at long wavelengths. We analyze G137+7, which is undetectable in total intensity but appears as a depolarization feature. We use the first polarization maps from the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment. Our $400-729$ MHz bandwidth and angular resolution, $17'$ to $30'$, allow us to use Faraday synthesis to analyze the polarization structure. In polarized intensity and polarization angle maps, we find a "tail" extending $10^\circ$ from the "head" and designate the combined object the "tadpole". Similar polarization angles, distinct from the background, indicate that the head and tail are physically associated. The head appears as a depolarized ring in single channels, but wideband observations show that it is a Faraday rotation feature. Our investigations of H I and H$\alpha$ find no connections to the tadpole. The tail suggests motion of either the gas or an ionizing star through the ISM; the B2(e) star HD 20336 is a candidate. While the head features a coherent, $\sim -8$ rad m$^2$ Faraday depth, Faraday synthesis also identifies multiple components in both the head and tail. We verify the locations of the components in the spectra using QU fitting. Our results show that $\sim$octave-bandwidth Faraday rotation observations at $\sim 600$ MHz are sensitive to low-density ionized or partially-ionized gas which is undetectable in other tracers.</description>

      <title>Are isolated compact galaxy groups special?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is often believed that isolated, compact groups of galaxies (CGs) are special systems. But CGs have rarely been compared to regular groups, which are selected very differently. We study the global properties of a subsample of 80 groups of four members (CG4s), as well as their correlations, within the HMCG Hickson-like sample of compact groups, and compare them with those of the regular groups of Lim et al.. The latter are split into three control samples, complete in redshift and magnitude: one with the four brightest members, one with the four closest members to the brightest group galaxy (BGG) with less than three magnitudes in range (Control4Cs), and one with exactly four members (RG4s). The vast majority of CG4s are located within regular groups, and a large preponderance of the BGGs of these CG4s are the same as those of their host groups. CG4s are smaller than the groups of all other samples and more luminous than RG4s, both results as expected from their selection as high surface brightness systems. However, CG4s have similar luminosities as Control4Cs. CG4s also have higher velocity dispersions, probably because of a too permissive redshift accordance criterion. The BGGs of CG4s are not more dominant in luminosity than those of RG4s, but they are significantly more offset relative to the group size, because the Lim groups are built around their BGGs. In summary, compact groups have similar properties to the regular groups of four galaxies and to the cores of regular groups, once selection criteria of CGs are considered. A large fraction of CGs are the cores of regular groups, isolated on the sky by construction, but rarely isolated in real space (from simulations), indicating that they are often plagued by chance alignments of host groups galaxies along the line of sight.</description>

      <title>Barb\'a 2: A new supergiant-rich Galactic stellar cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a new supergiant-rich stellar cluster hidden by extinction and christen it as Barb\'a 2, in honor of its discoverer Rodolfo Barb\'a. The cluster is at a distance of $7.39^{+0.65}_{-0.55}$ kpc and contains several supergiants, of which we provide spectral classifications for one blue, one yellow, and five red ones. The cluster extinction indicates an above-average grain-size ($R_{5495} \sim 3.7$), its age has a minimum value of 10 Ma, and its core radius is $0.84\pm0.19$ pc.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of renormalization group improved gravity from the kinematics of SPARC galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00531v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Renormalization Group correction to General Relativity (RGGR) proposes a logarithmic running of the gravitational coupling $\left(G\right)$, resulting in a modified description of gravity. This has the potential to explain the observed kinematics of the galaxies, including the missing-mass problem. We, for the first time, based on the galaxy morphological types, investigate the dynamics of a diverse collection of galaxies present in the Spitzer Photometry for Accurate Rotation Curve (SPARC) catalog. We phenomenologically constrain the RGGR model parameter $\left(\bar\nu\right)$ along with the mass-to-light ratio for a sample of 100 SPARC galaxies, selected from four different morphological types, viz. early, spiral, late, and starburst. Our statistical analysis finds RGGR to fit the observed galaxy kinematics consistently. The constrained RGGR model parameter also supports the claim that it has a near-linear dependence on the galactic baryonic mass. From our morphology study, we find that the parameter $\bar\nu$ decreases from the early-type to the starburst galaxies. Finally, the renormalization group improved gravity is tested against the two established empirical relations for the SPARC catalog, viz., the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) and the Baryonic Tully Fisher relation (BTFR), both are found to be satisfied consistently.</description>

      <title>Constraining a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in DHOST theories with the orbit of the S2 star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the observed data of the S2 orbit around the black hole Sgr A$^*$ and the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we make a constraint on parameters of a disformal Schwarzschild black hole in quadratic degenerate higher-order scalar-tensor (DHOST) theories. This black hole belongs to a class of non-stealth solutions and owns an extra disformal parameter described the deviation from general relativity. Our results show that the best fit value of the disformal parameter is positive. However, in the range of $1\sigma$, we also find that general relativity remains to be consistent with the observation of the S2 orbit.</description>
