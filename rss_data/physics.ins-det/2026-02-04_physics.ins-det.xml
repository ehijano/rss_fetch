      <title>A rapid low-background assay of $^{210}$Pb in archaeological lead</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.02674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a fast and highly efficient method for the measurement of $^{210}$Pb in metallic archaeological lead using the commercial low-background liquid scintillation counter Wallac Quantulus 1220 installed at the University of Milano-Bicocca (Italy). By combining an optimized chemical preparation with pulse-shape analysis (PSA), the technique achieves sensitivities at the level of a few $10^2$ mBq/kg within one week of measurement, using sample masses below 1 g. The method enables the simultaneous identification of the $\beta$ decays of $^{210}$Pb and $^{210}$Bi and the $\alpha$ decay of $^{210}$Po, allowing a direct verification of secular equilibrium within the decay chain. With extended acquisition times, detection limits below 100 mBq/kg are reached after approximately 40 days. This approach provides a rapid, accessible, and reliable tool for the radiopurity screening of lead, and is well suited for quality control and R&amp;D activities in next-generation low-background and rare-event physics experiments. Moreover, the method has the potential to be extended to other materials relevant for low-background applications.</description>

      <title>Production of GEM-like structures for cryogenic applications, using laser-cutting techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel concept for electroluminescence (EL) structures was recently proposed. In it, a wavelength-shifting material is deposited inside the holes of GEM-like structures which, after suitable optical treatment of its electrodes, improves the light collection and detection efficiency in noble gas TPCs. This new development directly addresses problems related with the scalability of future dual-phase TPCs for rare-event searches, matching (and potentially exceeding) the performance of conventional EL techniques.
  We report the newest developments on the production of such structures using laser-based techniques, namely the manufacture of a first batch of the so-called FAT-GEMs. This process allows low-cost and reproducible manufacturing of a high volume of such structures.
  In addition to the detailed description of the production, we present a performance assessment in pure argon, at a gas density close to the one expected in LAr conditions. An energy resolution of 23.5$\pm$1~\% (FWHM) at 5.9~keV was obtained, indicating a consistent improvement over previous batch. The optical treatment of the electrode surfaces has been greatly simplified and modestly improved, while charging-up effects arising from the use of laminates eliminated.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Stitched Prototypes Chip for the ALICE ITS3 Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During LHC Long Shutdown 3, the ALICE experiment will replace the three innermost layers of its Inner Tracking System (ITS2) with a new vertex detector, the ITS3. This new detector will be assembled using wafer-scale, stitched Monolithic Active Pixel Sensors (MAPS) fabricated using a 65nm CMOS technology node, which will be thinned and bent to form truly cylindrical layers around the beam pipe. To validate the new technology, several prototypes were developed and extensively characterized. This work focuses on the results of a test beam campaign performed at the CERN PS in September 2024, using a \SI{10}{\giga\eV} pion beam, to estimate detection efficiency and spatial resolution of the babyMOSS prototype, a smaller version of the MOnolithic Stitched Sensor (MOSS). Both non-irradiated and irradiated chips are tested, and the results confirm that the prototypes meet the ITS3 requirements, demonstrating a detection efficiency above 99\%, with a fake-hit rate below 10$^{-6}$ hits/pixel/event and a spatial resolution around \SI{5}{\micro\meter}.</description>

      <title>Fabrication and Characterization of p-type Inverted Coaxial Point Contact (ICPC) Detectors with a-Ge Dual-Blocking Contacts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and characterization of two p-type inverted coaxial point contact (ICPC) high-purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, SAP16 and SAP17, produced from USD-grown crystals with net impurity concentrations of $\sim 3\times10^{10}\,\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$. Both devices employ \emph{thin} amorphous-germanium (a-Ge) dual-blocking contacts, implemented here for the first time on ICPC detectors, to provide bipolar charge blocking while limiting dead-layer thickness. Electrical tests at 76~K demonstrate stable operation with picoampere-level leakage currents and sub-pF capacitance: SAP17 reached $\sim 4.62$~pA at the maximum tested bias (500~V) and operated stably at 400~V with $C\simeq 0.503$~pF. \emph{Meanwhile,} SAP16 achieved superior spectroscopic performance, with energy resolutions of 2.42\% at 59.5~keV and 0.36\% at 662~keV. Gamma-ray spectroscopy with $^{241}$Am and $^{137}$Cs shows that modest geometric differences lead to measurable changes in depletion behavior and charge-collection uniformity, consistent with electrostatic modeling. Angular-response measurements further reveal pronounced directional sensitivity at 59.5~keV, whereas the 662~keV response is essentially isotropic over the measured range. These results validate thin a-Ge dual-blocking contacts for ICPC HPGe detectors and highlight geometry-driven trade-offs among leakage current, depletion, and energy resolution relevant to low-background and low-threshold applications.</description>

      <title>ATLAS MDT TDC Simulations for LHC Run3 and HL-LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) started the Run 3 operation in 2022, and the peak instantaneous luminosity in Run 3 may reach 3 x 10^34 cm-2s-1. The ATLAS Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) chambers are the main component of the precision tracking system in the ATLAS muon spectrometer. It is important to understand any potential issues with the MDT Front-End (FE) readout electronics for an expected level-1 (L1) trigger rate of 100 kHz and a complex deadtime of over 5% for Run 3 operations. We use raw data collected in 2022 to emulate the expected hit rates in MDT chambers and perform a realistic simulation on the ATLAS Muon TDC (Time-to-Digital Converter) (AMT) chip with the current configuration. We study the AMT chip performances by analyzing the trigger/L1/readout buffer occupancies and hit loss fractions under different luminosities with L1 rate of 100 kHz by using the Modelsim software. The hit loss fraction of the hottest MDT chamber (BIL3C05) is lower than 5% due to FE readout, even at a luminosity of 5.01 x 10^34 cm-2s-1 with a deadtime of 5% and a L1 rate of 100 kHz, indicating that AMT can operate under Run 3 conditions without problems. The MDT trigger and readout electronics will be replaced for triggerless readout during High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) runs. We also simulate the AMT behavior in the triggerless mode up to 7.44 x 10^34 cm-2s-1 and propose possible AMT configurations in case some FE electronics could not be replaced during the long shutdown 3 (LS3).</description>

      <title>GRANITE: Mechanical Characterization and Optical Inspection of Large-Area TPC Electrodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11400v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for mechanical stability and high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for electrode quality assurance called GRANITE: Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes. GRANITE is built around a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\,\text{m}\times1.8\,\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.
  We demonstrate the setup's capabilities in two key areas: first, using laser scanners, we characterize wire tension, and in an independent measurement wire deflection due to gravity and electrostatic forces is determined. The setup achieves a precision of $20\,\mu\text{m}$ for the relative measurement of only electrostatic displacement. Furthermore, GRANITE can measure gravitational sag down to $200\,\mu\text{m}$ in an absolute measurement; this precision improves to $50\,\mu\text{m}$ when applying model-based corrections for systematic effects. The performance achieved exceeds the needs for the characterisation of the electrode sagging in future experiments, which typically aims to ensure a maximal sag on the order of $500\,\mu\text{m}$.
  Second, we use GRANITE's high resolution camera to image all wires of XENON1T's cathode grid. Subsets of these images are then hand sorted and used to train an autoencoder, to reliably classify wire images as either pristine wires or images containing severe anomalous features. These anomalies appear e.g. as staining and may be potential defects. The interpretation of the classification results is complicated by the fact that most wire segments are not spotless, but show a varying amount of anomalous features. Follow-up studies are needed to identify the exact nature of such features on wires.</description>

      <title>GRANITE: High-Resolution Imaging and Electrical Qualification of Large-Area TPC Electrodes</title>

Abstract: Next-generation dual-phase time projection chambers (TPCs) for rare event searches will require large-scale, high-precision electrodes. To meet the stringent requirements for high-voltage performance of such an experiment, we have developed a scanning setup for comprehensive electrode quality assurance. The system is built around the GRANITE (Granular Robotic Assay for Novel Integrated TPC Electrodes) facility: a gantry robot on top of a $2.5\,\text{m}\times1.8\,\text{m}$ granite table, equipped with a suite of non-contact metrology devices.
  We developed a coaxial wire scanning head to measure and correlate localized high-voltage discharge currents in air with high-resolution surface images. We find that the identified discharge 'hotspots' are transient and show no significant correlation with static visual features. Next, we established a quantitative relationship between artificially induced abrasive surface damage on the wires and a reduction in the discharge inception voltage. This work provides a novel non-invasive tool for qualifying wires dedicated for use in electrodes for future low-background experiments.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in accelerator technology have led to significant improvements in the quality of muon beams over the past decades. Investigations of the muon and muonium enable precise measurements of fundamental constants, as well as searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model. Furthermore, by utilizing muon beams with high intensity and polarization, studies of the dynamics of the muon and muonium within atomic level can offer valuable insights into materials science. This review presents recent progress and prospects at the frontiers of muon beams and high-precision muonium physics. It also provides an overview of novel methods and detection techniques to achieve high sensitivities in different areas, including particle physics, nuclear physics, materials science and beyond.</description>
