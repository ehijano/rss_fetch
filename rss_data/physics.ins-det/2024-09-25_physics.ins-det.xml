      <title>Maximizing NMR Sensitivity: A Guide to Receiver Gain Adjustment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance is revolutionizing in parallel with the development of methodology and all electronics and hardware around it. The primary objective of such modifications is to make the system more reliable and sensitive. Almost a decade ago, Bruker introduced an Avance NEO console with an extended dynamic range of the receiver gain (RG). The system offered a maximum sensitivity even at very low RG. This feature is handy in the case of hyperpolarization when too much signal can cause clipping of the free induction decay signal. We analyzed the RG profile for our spectrometer's 1H, 2H, 13C, and 15N nuclei and found nonmonotonous sensitivity behavior characterized by signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). For example, 13C SNR at RG = 18 is 5.5% higher than SNR at maximum RG = 101 and 51.6% higher than at RG = 20.2. Having found this, we advertise here that other NMR users with any spectrometers should calibrate their SNR vs. RG and find the RG value right for their experiments, as automatic RG adjustment does not know about the actual performance of each system. We offer a tool and strategy for such an optimization and exemplify the benefits of using SNR-adjusted RG value with hyperpolarized [1-13C]pyruvate measurements.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modelling of Active Target Time Projection Chamber for Low Energy Nuclear Physic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A numerical model based on hydrodynamic approach has been developed to emulate the device dynamics of active target Time Projection Chamber which is utilized for studying nuclear reaction through three dimensional tracking of concerned low energy particles. The proposed model has been used to investigate the performance of a prototype active target Time Projection Chamber, namely SAT-TPC, to be fabricated at Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics, for its application in nuclear physics experiments. A case study of non-relativistic elastic scattering $^4He+^{12}C$ with beam energy $25~MeV$ and current $2.3~pA$ has been opted for this purpose. The effect of beam induced space charge on the tracking performance the SAT-TPC prototype has been studied to optimize the beam current and scheme of the anode readout segmentation. The model has been validated by comparing its results to that of a particle model used to explain observed distortion in scattered particle tracks in a low energy nuclear physics experiment.</description>

      <title>Uncertainty quantification in flow cytometry using a cell sorter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cytometry, it is difficult to disentangle the contributions of population variance and instrument noise towards total measured variation. Fundamentally, this is due to the fact that one cannot measure the same particle multiple times. We propose a simple experiment that uses a cell sorter to distinguish instrument-specific variation. For a population of beads whose intensities are distributed around a single peak, the sorter is used to collect beads whose measured intensities lie below some threshold. This subset of particles is then remeasured. If the variation in the measured values is only due to the sample, the second set of measurements should also lie entirely below our threshold. Any 'spillover' is therefore due to instrument specific effects - we demonstrate how the distribution of the post-sort measurements is sufficient to extract an estimate of the cumulative variability induced by the instrument. A distinguishing feature of our work is that we do not make any assumptions about the sources of said noise. We then show how 'local affine transformations' let us transfer these estimates to cytometers not equipped with a sorter. We use our analysis to estimate noise for a set of three instruments and two bead types, across a range of sample flow rates. Lastly, we discuss the implications of instrument noise on optimal classification, as well as other applications.</description>

      <title>Wide-field microwave magnetic field imaging with nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16528v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-invasive imaging of microwave (MW) magnetic fields with microscale lateral resolution is pivotal for various applications, such as MW technologies and integrated circuit failure analysis. Diamond nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center magnetometry has emerged as an ideal tool, offering $\mu$m-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, high sensitivity, and non-invasive imaging compatible with diverse samples. However, up until now, it has been predominantly used for imaging of static or low-frequency magnetic fields or, concerning MW field imaging, to directly characterize the same microwave device used to drive the NV spin transitions. In this work we leverage an NV center ensemble in diamond for wide-field imaging of MW magnetic fields generated by a test device employing a differential measurement protocol. The microscope is equipped with a MW loop to induce Rabi oscillations between NV spin states, and the MW field from the device-under-test is measured through local deviations in the Rabi frequency. This differential protocol yields magnetic field maps of a 2.57 GHz MW field with a sensitivity of $\sim$ 9 $\mu$T Hz$^{-1/2}$ for a total measurement duration of $T = 357$ s, covering a $340\times340$ $\mu$m$^2$ field of view with a $\mu$m-scale spatial resolution and a DUT input power dynamic range of 30 dB. This work demonstrates a novel NV magnetometry protocol, based on differential Rabi frequency measurement, that extends NV wide-field imaging capabilities to imaging of weak MW magnetic fields that would be difficult to measure directly through standard NV Rabi magnetometry.</description>

      <title>The Design and Construction of the Chips Water Cherenkov Neutrino Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11728v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CHIPS (CHerenkov detectors In mine PitS) was a prototype large-scale water Cherenkov detector located in northern Minnesota. The main aim of the R&amp;D project was to demonstrate that construction costs of neutrino oscillation detectors could be reduced by at least an order of magnitude compared to other equivalent experiments. This article presents design features of the CHIPS detector along with details of the implementation and deployment of the prototype. While issues during and after the deployment of the detector prevented data taking, a number of key concepts and designs were successfully demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Effect of UV light irradiation on charge neutralization in XPS measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00663v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When XPS analyses are performed on insulator surfaces, shift and deformation of spectra peaks typically take place due to the surface charging. To achieve reliable XPS measurements, neutralization techniques have been widely adopted but their effectiveness are still limited, and thus, new neutralization technologies are urgently needed. Here, stable XPS spectra in which all the peaks undergo a reduced and nearly constant shift without significant deformation and broadening were obtained by introducing the UV light irradiation, implying that the introduction of the UV light can not only greatly attenuate the strength but also significantly improve both the temporal stability and the spatial uniformity of the surface charging during XPS measurements. This phenomenon, referred to as UV-assisted neutralization in this article, was found as effective as the most commonly used dual beam charge neutralization. Further observations show that the suppression of the charging issue comes from the adsorption of the UV-excited photoelectrons onto the X-ray irradiation region. This neutralization method, combined with the binding energy referencing, can be expected to become a promising alternative technique for solving the charging issues in XPS measurements.</description>

      <title>Development and Implementation of Advanced Beam Diagnostic and Abort Systems in SuperKEKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16184v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The SuperKEKB/Belle II experiment aims to collect high-statistics data of B meson pairs to explore new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). SuperKEKB, an upgraded version of the KEKB accelerator, has achieved a world-record luminosity of $4.71 \times 10^{34} \, \mathrm{cm^{-2}s^{-1}}$ in 2022 but continues to strive for higher luminosities. One of the major obstacles is Sudden Beam Loss (SBL) events, which cause substantial beam losses and damage to the Belle~II detector. To find a hint for addressing SBL challenges, advanced beam diagnostic systems and enhanced beam abort systems have been developed. The diagnostic system aims to accurately pinpoint the start of beam losses, while the upgraded abort system quickly disposes of anomalous beams to minimize damage.
  This paper details the development and implementation of these systems, including high-speed loss monitors, time synchronization with the White Rabbit system, and data acquisition systems. Efforts to understand the mechanisms of SBL events, using acoustic sensors to detect discharges, are also discussed. These measures aim to improve the operational stability and luminosity of SuperKEKB, contributing to the experiment's success.</description>
