      <title>PromptMind Team at EHRSQL-2024: Improving Reliability of SQL Generation using Ensemble LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents our approach to the EHRSQL-2024 shared task, which aims to develop a reliable Text-to-SQL system for electronic health records. We propose two approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs) for prompting and fine-tuning to generate EHRSQL queries. In both techniques, we concentrate on bridging the gap between the real-world knowledge on which LLMs are trained and the domain specific knowledge required for the task. The paper provides the results of each approach individually, demonstrating that they achieve high execution accuracy. Additionally, we show that an ensemble approach further enhances generation reliability by reducing errors. This approach secured us 2nd place in the shared task competition. The methodologies outlined in this paper are designed to be transferable to domain-specific Text-to-SQL problems that emphasize both accuracy and reliability.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for the Internal Democracy of Political Parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article argues that AI can enhance the measurement and implementation of democratic processes within political parties, known as Intra-Party Democracy (IPD). It identifies the limitations of traditional methods for measuring IPD, which often rely on formal parameters, self-reported data, and tools like surveys. Such limitations lead to the collection of partial data, rare updates, and significant demands on resources. To address these issues, the article suggests that specific data management and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis, can improve the measurement (ML about) and practice (ML for) of IPD. The article concludes by considering some of the principal risks of ML for IPD, including concerns over data privacy, the potential for manipulation, and the dangers of overreliance on technology.</description>

      <title>Convolution and Cross-Correlation of Count Sketches Enables Fast Cardinality Estimation of Multi-Join Queries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the increasing rate of data generated by critical systems, estimating functions on streaming data has become essential. This demand has driven numerous advancements in algorithms designed to efficiently query and analyze one or more data streams while operating under memory constraints. The primary challenge arises from the rapid influx of new items, requiring algorithms that enable efficient incremental processing of streams in order to keep up. A prominent algorithm in this domain is the AMS sketch. Originally developed to estimate the second frequency moment of a data stream, it can also estimate the cardinality of the equi-join between two relations. Since then, two important advancements are the Count sketch, a method which significantly improves upon the sketch update time, and secondly, an extension of the AMS sketch to accommodate multi-join queries. However, combining the strengths of these methods to maintain sketches for multi-join queries while ensuring fast update times is a non-trivial task, and has remained an open problem for decades as highlighted in the existing literature. In this work, we successfully address this problem by introducing a novel sketching method which has fast updates, even for sketches capable of accurately estimating the cardinality of complex multi-join queries. We prove that our estimator is unbiased and has the same error guarantees as the AMS-based method. Our experimental results confirm the significant improvement in update time complexity, resulting in orders of magnitude faster estimates, with equal or better estimation accuracy.</description>
