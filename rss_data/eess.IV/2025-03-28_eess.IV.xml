      <title>D2SA: Dual-Stage Distribution and Slice Adaptation for Efficient Test-Time Adaptation in MRI Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variations in Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners and acquisition protocols cause distribution shifts that degrade reconstruction performance on unseen data. Test-time adaptation (TTA) offers a promising solution to address this discrepancies. However, previous single-shot TTA approaches are inefficient due to repeated training and suboptimal distributional models. Self-supervised learning methods are also limited by scarce date scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Dual-Stage Distribution and Slice Adaptation (D2SA) via MRI implicit neural representation (MR-INR) to improve MRI reconstruction performance and efficiency, which features two stages. In the first stage, an MR-INR branch performs patient-wise distribution adaptation by learning shared representations across slices and modelling patient-specific shifts with mean and variance adjustments. In the second stage, single-slice adaptation refines the output from frozen convolutional layers with a learnable anisotropic diffusion module, preventing over-smoothing and reducing computation. Experiments across four MRI distribution shifts demonstrate that our method can integrate well with various self-supervised learning (SSL) framework, improving performance and accelerating convergence under diverse conditions.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Video Enhances Physical Fidelity in Video Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how to enhance the physical fidelity of video generation models by leveraging synthetic videos derived from computer graphics pipelines. These rendered videos respect real-world physics, such as maintaining 3D consistency, and serve as a valuable resource that can potentially improve video generation models. To harness this potential, we propose a solution that curates and integrates synthetic data while introducing a method to transfer its physical realism to the model, significantly reducing unwanted artifacts. Through experiments on three representative tasks emphasizing physical consistency, we demonstrate its efficacy in enhancing physical fidelity. While our model still lacks a deep understanding of physics, our work offers one of the first empirical demonstrations that synthetic video enhances physical fidelity in video synthesis.

      <title>Exploiting Temporal State Space Sharing for Video Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Video semantic segmentation (VSS) plays a vital role in understanding the temporal evolution of scenes. Traditional methods often segment videos frame-by-frame or in a short temporal window, leading to limited temporal context, redundant computations, and heavy memory requirements. To this end, we introduce a Temporal Video State Space Sharing (TV3S) architecture to leverage Mamba state space models for temporal feature sharing. Our model features a selective gating mechanism that efficiently propagates relevant information across video frames, eliminating the need for a memory-heavy feature pool. By processing spatial patches independently and incorporating shifted operation, TV3S supports highly parallel computation in both training and inference stages, which reduces the delay in sequential state space processing and improves the scalability for long video sequences. Moreover, TV3S incorporates information from prior frames during inference, achieving long-range temporal coherence and superior adaptability to extended sequences. Evaluations on the VSPW and Cityscapes datasets reveal that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, establishing a new standard for VSS with consistent results across long video sequences. By achieving a good balance between accuracy and efficiency, TV3S shows a significant advancement in spatiotemporal modeling, paving the way for efficient video analysis. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Ashesham/TV3S.git.</description>

      <title>Exploring CLIP's Dense Knowledge for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels aims to achieve pixel-level predictions using Class Activation Maps (CAMs). Recently, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been introduced in WSSS. However, recent methods primarily focus on image-text alignment for CAM generation, while CLIP's potential in patch-text alignment remains unexplored. In this work, we propose ExCEL to explore CLIP's dense knowledge via a novel patch-text alignment paradigm for WSSS. Specifically, we propose Text Semantic Enrichment (TSE) and Visual Calibration (VC) modules to improve the dense alignment across both text and vision modalities. To make text embeddings semantically informative, our TSE module applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a dataset-wide knowledge base and enriches the text representations with an implicit attribute-hunting process. To mine fine-grained knowledge from visual features, our VC module first proposes Static Visual Calibration (SVC) to propagate fine-grained knowledge in a non-parametric manner. Then Learnable Visual Calibration (LVC) is further proposed to dynamically shift the frozen features towards distributions with diverse semantics. With these enhancements, ExCEL not only retains CLIP's training-free advantages but also significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods with much less training cost on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.</description>

      <title>Generalized Ray Tracing with Basis functions for Tomographic Projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work aims at the precise and efficient computation of the x-ray projection of an image represented by a linear combination of general shifted basis functions that typically overlap. We achieve this with a suitable adaptation of ray tracing, which is one of the most efficient methods to compute line integrals. In our work, the cases in which the image is expressed as a spline are of particular relevance. The proposed implementation is applicable to any projection geometry as it computes the forward and backward operators over a collection of arbitrary lines. We validate our work with experiments in the context of inverse problems for image reconstruction and maximize the image quality for a given resolution of the reconstruction grid.</description>

      <title>Operating Room Workflow Analysis via Reasoning Segmentation over Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analyzing operating room (OR) workflows to derive quantitative insights into OR efficiency is important for hospitals to maximize patient care and financial sustainability. Prior work on OR-level workflow analysis has relied on end-to-end deep neural networks. While these approaches work well in constrained settings, they are limited to the conditions specified at development time and do not offer the flexibility necessary to accommodate the OR workflow analysis needs of various OR scenarios (e.g., large academic center vs. rural provider) without data collection, annotation, and retraining. Reasoning segmentation (RS) based on foundation models offers this flexibility by enabling automated analysis of OR workflows from OR video feeds given only an implicit text query related to the objects of interest. Due to the reliance on large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, current RS approaches struggle with reasoning about semantic/spatial relationships and show limited generalization to OR video due to variations in visual characteristics and domain-specific terminology. To address these limitations, we first propose a novel digital twin (DT) representation that preserves both semantic and spatial relationships between the various OR components. Then, building on this foundation, we propose ORDiRS (Operating Room Digital twin representation for Reasoning Segmentation), an LLM-tuning-free RS framework that reformulates RS into a "reason-retrieval-synthesize" paradigm. Finally, we present ORDiRS-Agent, an LLM-based agent that decomposes OR workflow analysis queries into manageable RS sub-queries and generates responses by combining detailed textual explanations with supporting visual evidence from RS. Experimental results on both an in-house and a public OR dataset demonstrate that our ORDiRS achieves a cIoU improvement of 6.12%-9.74% compared to the existing state-of-the-arts.</description>

      <title>Embedding Compression Distortion in Video Coding for Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, video transmission serves not only the Human Visual System (HVS) for viewing but also machine perception for analysis. However, existing codecs are primarily optimized for pixel-domain and HVS-perception metrics rather than the needs of machine vision tasks. To address this issue, we propose a Compression Distortion Representation Embedding (CDRE) framework, which extracts machine-perception-related distortion representation and embeds it into downstream models, addressing the information lost during compression and improving task performance. Specifically, to better analyze the machine-perception-related distortion, we design a compression-sensitive extractor that identifies compression degradation in the feature domain. For efficient transmission, a lightweight distortion codec is introduced to compress the distortion information into a compact representation. Subsequently, the representation is progressively embedded into the downstream model, enabling it to be better informed about compression degradation and enhancing performance. Experiments across various codecs and downstream tasks demonstrate that our framework can effectively boost the rate-task performance of existing codecs with minimal overhead in terms of bitrate, execution time, and number of parameters. Our codes and supplementary materials are released in https://github.com/Ws-Syx/CDRE/.</description>

      <title>Double Blind Imaging with Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blind inverse problems in imaging arise from uncertainties in the system used to collect (noisy) measurements of images. Recovering clean images from these measurements typically requires identifying the imaging system, either implicitly or explicitly. A common solution leverages generative models as priors for both the images and the imaging system parameters (e.g., a class of point spread functions). To learn these priors in a straightforward manner requires access to a dataset of clean images as well as samples of the imaging system. We propose an AmbientGAN-based generative technique to identify the distribution of parameters in unknown imaging systems, using only unpaired clean images and corrupted measurements. This learned distribution can then be used in model-based recovery algorithms to solve blind inverse problems such as blind deconvolution. We successfully demonstrate our technique for learning Gaussian blur and motion blur priors from noisy measurements and show their utility in solving blind deconvolution with diffusion posterior sampling.</description>

      <title>Reflections on Diversity: A Real-time Virtual Mirror for Inclusive 3D Face Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time 3D face manipulation has significant applications in virtual reality, social media and human-computer interaction. This paper introduces a novel system, which we call Mirror of Diversity (MOD), that combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for texture manipulation and 3D Morphable Models (3DMMs) for facial geometry to achieve realistic face transformations that reflect various demographic characteristics, emphasizing the beauty of diversity and the universality of human features. As participants sit in front of a computer monitor with a camera positioned above, their facial characteristics are captured in real time and can further alter their digital face reconstruction with transformations reflecting different demographic characteristics, such as gender and ethnicity (e.g., a person from Africa, Asia, Europe). Another feature of our system, which we call Collective Face, generates an averaged face representation from multiple participants' facial data. A comprehensive evaluation protocol is implemented to assess the realism and demographic accuracy of the transformations. Qualitative feedback is gathered through participant questionnaires, which include comparisons of MOD transformations with similar filters on platforms like Snapchat and TikTok. Additionally, quantitative analysis is conducted using a pretrained Convolutional Neural Network that predicts gender and ethnicity, to validate the accuracy of demographic transformations.</description>

      <title>Online Reasoning Video Segmentation with Just-in-Time Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reasoning segmentation (RS) aims to identify and segment objects of interest based on implicit text queries. As such, RS is a catalyst for embodied AI agents, enabling them to interpret high-level commands without requiring explicit step-by-step guidance. However, current RS approaches rely heavily on the visual perception capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs), leading to several major limitations. First, they struggle with queries that require multiple steps of reasoning or those that involve complex spatial/temporal relationships. Second, they necessitate LLM fine-tuning, which may require frequent updates to maintain compatibility with contemporary LLMs and may increase risks of catastrophic forgetting during fine-tuning. Finally, being primarily designed for static images or offline video processing, they scale poorly to online video data. To address these limitations, we propose an agent framework that disentangles perception and reasoning for online video RS without LLM fine-tuning. Our innovation is the introduction of a just-in-time digital twin concept, where -- given an implicit query -- a LLM plans the construction of a low-level scene representation from high-level video using specialist vision models. We refer to this approach to creating a digital twin as "just-in-time" because the LLM planner will anticipate the need for specific information and only request this limited subset instead of always evaluating every specialist model. The LLM then performs reasoning on this digital twin representation to identify target objects. To evaluate our approach, we introduce a new comprehensive video reasoning segmentation benchmark comprising 200 videos with 895 implicit text queries. The benchmark spans three reasoning categories (semantic, spatial, and temporal) with three different reasoning chain complexity.</description>

      <title>Inverse Problem Approach to Aberration Correction for in vivo Transcranial Imaging Based on a Sparse Representation of Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10389v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transcranial ultrasound imaging is currently limited by attenuation and aberration induced by the skull. First used in contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), highly echoic microbubbles allowed for the development of novel imaging modalities such as ultrasound localization microscopy (ULM). Herein, we develop an inverse problem approach to aberration correction (IPAC) that leverages the sparsity of microbubble signals. We propose to use the \textit{a priori} knowledge of the medium based upon microbubble localization and wave propagation to build a forward model to link the measured signals directly to the aberration function. A standard least-squares inversion is then used to retrieve the aberration function. We first validated IPAC on simulated data of a vascular network using plane wave as well as divergent wave emissions. We then evaluated the reproducibility of IPAC \textit{in vivo} in 5 mouse brains. We showed that aberration correction improved the contrast of CEUS images by 4.6 dB. For ULM images, IPAC yielded sharper vessels, reduced vessel duplications, and improved the resolution from 21.1 $\mu$m to 18.3 $\mu$m. Aberration correction also improved hemodynamic quantification for velocity magnitude and flow direction.</description>

      <title>Quantization-aware Matrix Factorization for Low Bit Rate Image Compression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lossy image compression is essential for efficient transmission and storage. Traditional compression methods mainly rely on discrete cosine transform (DCT) or singular value decomposition (SVD), both of which represent image data in continuous domains and, therefore, necessitate carefully designed quantizers. Notably, these methods consider quantization as a separate step, where quantization errors cannot be incorporated into the compression process. The sensitivity of these methods, especially SVD-based ones, to quantization errors significantly degrades reconstruction quality. To address this issue, we introduce a quantization-aware matrix factorization (QMF) to develop a novel lossy image compression method. QMF provides a low-rank representation of the image data as a product of two smaller factor matrices, with elements constrained to bounded integer values, thereby effectively integrating quantization with low-rank approximation. We propose an efficient, provably convergent iterative algorithm for QMF using a block coordinate descent (BCD) scheme, with subproblems having closed-form solutions. Our experiments on the Kodak and CLIC 2024 datasets demonstrate that our QMF compression method consistently outperforms JPEG at low bit rates below 0.25 bits per pixel (bpp) and remains comparable at higher bit rates. We also assessed our method's capability to preserve visual semantics by evaluating an ImageNet pre-trained classifier on compressed images. Remarkably, our method improved top-1 accuracy by over 5 percentage points compared to JPEG at bit rates under 0.25 bpp. The project is available at https://github.com/pashtari/lrf .</description>

      <title>Denoising VAE as an Explainable Feature Reduction and Diagnostic Pipeline for Autism Based on Resting state fMRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00068v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are developmental conditions characterized by restricted interests and difficulties in communication. The complexity of ASD has resulted in a deficiency of objective diagnostic biomarkers. Deep learning methods have gained recognition for addressing these challenges in neuroimaging analysis, but finding and interpreting such diagnostic biomarkers are still challenging computationally. Here, we propose a feature reduction pipeline using resting-state fMRI data. We used Craddock atlas and Power atlas to extract functional connectivity data from rs-fMRI, resulting in over 30 thousand features. By using a denoising variational autoencoder, our proposed pipeline further compresses the connectivity features into 5 latent Gaussian distributions, providing is a low-dimensional representation of the data to promote computational efficiency and interpretability. To test the method, we employed the extracted latent representations to classify ASD using traditional classifiers such as SVM on a large multi-site dataset. The 95% confidence interval for the prediction accuracy of SVM is [0.63, 0.76] after site harmonization using the extracted latent distributions. Without using DVAE for dimensionality reduction, the prediction accuracy is 0.70, which falls within the interval. The DVAE successfully encoded the diagnostic information from rs-fMRI data without sacrificing prediction performance. The runtime for training the DVAE and obtaining classification results from its extracted latent features was 7 times shorter compared to training classifiers directly on the raw data. Our findings suggest that the Power atlas provides more effective brain connectivity insights for diagnosing ASD than Craddock atlas. Additionally, we visualized the latent representations to gain insights into the brain networks contributing to the differences between ASD and neurotypical brains.</description>

Abstract: Computed Tomography (CT) is a widely used imaging technique that provides detailed cross-sectional views of objects. Over the past decade, Deep Learning-based Reconstruction (DLR) methods have led efforts to enhance image quality and reduce noise, yet they often require large amounts of data and are computationally intensive. Inspired by recent advancements in scene reconstruction, some approaches have adapted NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) techniques for CT reconstruction. However, these methods are not ideal for direct 3D volume reconstruction. In this paper, we propose a novel Discretized Gaussian Representation (DGR) for CT reconstruction, which directly reconstructs the 3D volume using a set of discretized Gaussian functions in an end-to-end manner. To further enhance computational efficiency, we introduce a Fast Volume Reconstruction technique that aggregates the contributions of these Gaussians into a discretized volume in a highly parallelized fashion. Our extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate that DGR achieves superior reconstruction quality and significantly improved computational efficiency compared to existing DLR and instance reconstruction methods. Our code has been provided for review purposes and will be made publicly available upon publication.</description>

      <title>MAP-based Problem-Agnostic diffusion model for Inverse Problems</title>

Abstract: Diffusion models have indeed shown great promise in solving inverse problems in image processing. In this paper, we propose a novel, problem-agnostic diffusion model called the maximum a posteriori (MAP)-based guided term estimation method for inverse problems. To leverage unconditionally pretrained diffusion models to address conditional generation tasks, we divide the conditional score function into two terms according to Bayes' rule: an unconditional score function (approximated by a pretrained score network) and a guided term, which is estimated using a novel MAP-based method that incorporates a Gaussian-type prior of natural images. This innovation allows us to better capture the intrinsic properties of the data, leading to improved performance. Numerical results demonstrate that our method preserves contents more effectively compared to state-of-the-art methods--for example, maintaining the structure of glasses in super-resolution tasks and producing more coherent results in the neighborhood of masked regions during inpainting.</description>

      <title>Segmenting Bi-Atrial Structures Using ResNext Based Framework</title>

Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, significantly contributing to mortality, particularly in older populations. While pulmonary vein isolation is a standard treatment, its effectiveness is limited in patients with persistent AF. Recent research highlights the importance of targeting additional atrial regions, particularly fibrotic areas identified via late gadolinium-enhanced MRI (LGE-MRI). However, existing manual segmentation methods are time-consuming and prone to variability. Deep learning techniques, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown promise in automating segmentation. However, most studies focus solely on the left atrium (LA) and rely on small datasets, limiting generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage framework incorporating ResNeXt encoders and a cyclic learning rate to segment both the right atrium (RA) and LA walls and cavities in LGE-MRIs. Our method aims to improve the segmentation of challenging small structures, such as atrial walls while maintaining high performance in larger regions like the atrial cavities. The results demonstrate that our approach offers superior segmentation accuracy and robustness compared to traditional architectures, particularly for imbalanced class structures.</description>

      <title>SparseGS: Real-Time 360{\deg} Sparse View Synthesis using Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00206v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently enabled real-time rendering of unbounded 3D scenes for novel view synthesis. However, this technique requires dense training views to accurately reconstruct 3D geometry. A limited number of input views will significantly degrade reconstruction quality, resulting in artifacts such as "floaters" and "background collapse" at unseen viewpoints. In this work, we introduce SparseGS, an efficient training pipeline designed to address the limitations of 3DGS in scenarios with sparse training views. SparseGS incorporates depth priors, novel depth rendering techniques, and a pruning heuristic to mitigate floater artifacts, alongside an Unseen Viewpoint Regularization module to alleviate background collapses. Our extensive evaluations on the Mip-NeRF360, LLFF, and DTU datasets demonstrate that SparseGS achieves high-quality reconstruction in both unbounded and forward-facing scenarios, with as few as 12 and 3 input images, respectively, while maintaining fast training and real-time rendering capabilities.</description>

      <title>Grayscale to Hyperspectral at Any Resolution Using a Phase-Only Lens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02798</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02798v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstructing a HxWx31 hyperspectral image from a HxW grayscale snapshot measurement that is captured using only a single diffractive optic and a filterless panchromatic photosensor. This problem is severely ill-posed, but we present the first model that produces high-quality results. We make efficient use of limited data by training a conditional denoising diffusion model that operates on small patches in a shift-invariant manner. During inference, we synchronize per-patch hyperspectral predictions using guidance derived from the optical point spread function. Surprisingly, our experiments reveal that patch sizes as small as the PSFs support achieve excellent results, and they show that local optical cues are sufficient to capture full spectral information. Moreover, by drawing multiple samples, our model provides per-pixel uncertainty estimates that strongly correlate with reconstruction error. Our work lays the foundation for a new class of high-resolution snapshot hyperspectral imagers that are compact and light-efficient.</description>
