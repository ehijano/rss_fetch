      <title>Resonant Locking Between Binary Systems Induced by Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of gravitational waves (GWs) with matter is thought to be typically negligible in the Universe. We identify a possible exception in the case of resonant interactions, where GWs emitted by a background binary system such as an inspiraling supermassive black hole (SMBH) binary causes a resonant response in a stellar-mass foreground binary and the frequencies of the two systems become, and remain, synchronized. We point out that such locking is not only possible, but can significantly reduce the binaries' merger time for $\mathcal{O}(1-10^4)$ binaries in the host galaxy of the merging SMBHs of $10^{9-11}M_{\odot}$ for standard general relativity and even more either in ``wet'' SMBH mergers or in certain modified theories of gravity where the inspiral rate is reduced. This could leave an imprint on the period distribution of stellar mass binaries in post-merger galaxies which could be detectable by future GW detectors, such as LISA.</description>

      <title>Signatures of cubic gravity in the strong regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of Einsteinian cubic gravity in the strong gravitational regime. In the first part, we explore analytical solutions for a static, spherically symmetric metric, establishing the existence of maximally symmetric de Sitter solutions, as well as asymptotically de Sitter solutions, with an effective cosmological constant. We also study, analytically and numerically, how the horizon properties are affected by cubic gravity. Our results reveal that a positive coupling constant reduces the horizon size, while a negative one increases it. In the second part, we analyze potential observational signatures of cubic terms, focusing on their effects on the bending of light. Specifically, we investigate the angular difference, related to the deflection angle but valid near the source, along with the behavior of the photon sphere. Our findings show that the strongest effects of the cubic terms occur in the strong gravity regime, and there exists a direct relationship between the value of the coupling constant and the photon sphere position, opening up the possibility to constrain cubic gravity with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Spinning generalizations of Majumdar-Papapetrou multi-black hole spacetimes: light rings, lensing and shadows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of the Majumdar-Papapetrou multi-black hole spacetime was recently constructed by Teo and Wan [1], describing charged and spinning (extremal) balanced black holes in asymptotically flat spacetime. We explore the dynamics of null geodesics on this geometry, focusing on the two-center solution. Using the topological charge formalism, we show that various light ring arrangements arise from different choices of individual angular momenta: light rings with opposite topological charges can merge and annihilate each other, resulting in configurations with a total of 4, 6, or 8 light rings. Using backward ray-tracing, we obtained the shadow and lensing of these spacetimes. The former, in particular, closely resembles those for the double-Kerr metric.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic cosmology in $q$-deformed entropic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the implications of $q$-deformed theory on anisotropic Bianchi type-I cosmological model within the framework of Verlinde's entropic gravity. The $q$-deformed theory, rooted in quantum group structures, provides a natural generalization of classical particle dynamics and offers a useful framework for exploring deviations in standard cosmological models. By incorporating the principles of entropic gravity, which conceptualize gravity as an emergent entropic force, we derive the dynamical equations governing the Bianchi type-I anisotropic model influenced by $q$-deformation. Finally, we analyze the axisymmetric solution of Bianchi type-I model and these findings highlight the potential impact of $q$-deformation on the dynamics of the early universe and its subsequent evolution.</description>

      <title>Nature of phase transitions and metastability in scalar-tensor theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact stars above a critical stellar mass develop large scalar fields in some scalar-tensor theories. This scenario, called spontaneous scalarization, has been an intense topic of study since it passes weak-field gravity tests naturally while providing clear observables in the strong-field regime. The underlying mechanism for the onset of scalarization is often depicted as a second-order phase transition. Here, we show that a first-order phase transition is in fact the most common mechanism. This means metastability and transitions between locally stable compact object configurations are much more likely than previously believed, opening vast new avenues for observational prospects.</description>

      <title>From Matter Density to Deflection Angle and Gravitational Lensing Using Perturbative Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we develop a perturbative method to compute the deflection angle of null or timelike signals in spacetimes filled with a static and spherically symmetric (SSS) perfect fluid with fairly arbitrary density distributions. After solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations, the metric functions of the spacetime are obtained either as asymptotic series or as expansions around a finite boundary. The deflection angles of null or timelike signals in the weak-field limit in such spacetimes can then be expressed as series expansions in terms of the impact parameter, with coefficients determined by the metric expansions and, in turn, the density distribution function. Gravitational lensing equations are also solved perturbatively to derive the apparent angles of the lensed images. Comparing our analytical formulas with numerical results demonstrates the validity and efficiency of our method and results. This procedure establishes a direct connection between the mass density, the deflection angle, and the apparent angles of gravitationally lensed images. We apply these methods and results to the generalized Navarro-Frenk-White model and some other density profiles to analyze the influence of the density parameters.</description>

      <title>Impact of Higher-order Tidal Corrections on the Measurement Accuracy of Neutron Star Tidal Deformability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron stars (BNS) provide information about the internal structure of neutron stars (NSs), helping to verify dense matter equations of state. We investigate how the measurement accuracy of NS's tidal deformability can be improved by incorporating the higher-order post-Newtonian (pN) tidal corrections up to 7.5 pN. We assume an aligned-spin BNS system and adopt TaylorF2, which is the most commonly used pN waveform model. To calculate the measurement error, we use a semi-analytic method, Fisher Matrix, which is much faster than performing parameter estimation simulations. We employ Universal Relation to remove additional parameters that appear in higher-order corrections beyond 6 pN. We find that the effect of tidal corrections shows no behavior of convergence with increasing pN orders. Assuming a fiducial binary NS system whose physical parameters are compatible with GW170817, we find that the measurement error of tidal deformability ($\tilde{\lambda}$) decreases linearly as the effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}$) increases and the tidal deformability can be better measured for stiffer equation of states.</description>

      <title>Constructing regular black holes from multi-polytropic equations of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regular black holes are imagined as solutions to Einstein's field equations, with no singularities, albeit characterized by the presence of an internal structure. With the intention not to use non-linear electrodynamics, we here propose to obtain new classes of solutions that can also satisfy the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations, plus adding a non-zero core. Thus, we present regular black holes as solutions to the TOV equations using multipolytropic equations of state and investigate whether these solutions behave, tuning the underlying free parameters. Our analysis demonstrates that, within specific parameter ranges, repulsive gravity effects may occur in precise regions. Accordingly, black hole remnants are also investigated, showing that, under certain circumstances, they may turn into dark energy sources in view of the corresponding repulsive gravity effects, located outside the horizons. Moreover, quite remarkably, critical sets of parameters imply that solutions may exhibit transitions to regular repulsive relativistic compact objects from black hole behaviors. Finally, we explore the interpretation of these regular black hole solutions in terms of topological thermodynamic defects.</description>

      <title>Bounce solutions with quantum vacuum effects of massive fields and subsequent Starobinsky inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the previous work about the cosmological solutions with bounce without modifications of gravity or introducing an extra scalar field. The main finding was that the bounce is possible in the initially contracting Universe filled with matter. After a strong contraction, matter gains the equation of state close to the one of radiation, such that the effect on matter on the evolution of the FLRW metric disappears at the classical level. However, this effect comes back owing to the quantum trace anomaly in the matter/radiation sector. In the present contribution, we explore the weak impact of massive fields on the anomaly-driven bounce solution and discuss the role of the vacuum terms. The masses are assumed small and regarded as small perturbations, which enables using trace anomaly even in this case. On the other hand, by adding the $R^2$ term to the action, we arrive at the model with the trans-Planckian bounce and subsequent Starobinsky inflation. In such a framework, using the numerical analysis, we consider three scenarios providing bounce solutions.</description>

      <title>A Compact theorem on the compactness of ultra-compact objects with monotonically decreasing matter fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-gravitating horizonless ultra-compact objects that possess light rings have attracted the attention of physicists and mathematicians in recent years. In the present compact paper we raise the following physically interesting question: Is there a lower bound on the global compactness parameters ${\cal C}\equiv\text{max}_r\{2m(r)/r\}$ of spherically symmetric ultra-compact objects? Using the non-linearly coupled Einstein-matter field equations we explicitly prove that spatially regular ultra-compact objects with monotonically decreasing density functions (or monotonically decreasing radial pressure functions) are characterized by the lower bound ${\cal C}\geq1/3$ on their dimensionless compactness parameters.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Vacuum Condensate Stars in the Effective Theory of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low energy effective theory of gravity comprises two elements of quantum theory joined to classical general relativity. The first is the quantum conformal anomaly, which is responsible for macroscopic correlations on light cones and a stress tensor that can strongly modify the classical geometry at black hole horizons. The second is the formulation of vacuum energy as $\Lambda_{\rm eff}\!\propto\! F^2$ in terms of an exact $4$-form abelian gauge field strength $F\!=\!dA$. When $A$ is identified with the Chern-Simons $3$-form of the Euler class, defined in terms of the spin connection, a $J\cdot A$ interaction is generated by the conformal anomaly of massless fermions. Due to the extreme blueshifting of local frequencies in the near-horizon region of a `black hole,' the lightest fermions of the Standard Model can be treated as massless there, contributing to the anomaly and providing a $3$-current source $J$ for the `Maxwell' equation $d\ast F = \ast J$. In this phase boundary region, torsion is activated, and $F$ can change rapidly. The Schwarzschild black hole horizon is thereby replaced by a surface, with a positive surface tension and $\mathbb{R}\otimes \mathbb{S}^2$ worldtube topology, separating regions of differing vacuum energy. The result is a gravitational vacuum condensate star, a cold, compact, horizonless object with a $p_{_V}\!=\! - \rho_{_V}$ zero entropy, non-singular de Sitter interior and thin quantum phase boundary layer at the Schwarzschild radius $2GM/c^2$.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Thermodynamics via Tsallis Statistical Mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An investigation of black hole thermodynamics based on Tsallis statistical mechanics is explored through the study of the thermodynamics of a gas system located near the horizon of a black hole. In spite of the difficulty in exploring black hole thermodynamics through statistical mechanics, the entropy of the nearby gas system is found to be proportional to the black hole's horizon area using Gibbs-Boltzmann statistical mechanics. This allows us to study black hole thermodynamics by using statistical mechanics through the thermodynamic behaviors of the gas system. Since the entropy of the black hole is proportional to the horizon area, it is more suitable to use non-extensive statistical mechanics instead of the usual Gibbs-Boltzmann ones. In this work, the black hole entropy is derived based on Tsallis statistical mechanics, one of well-known non-extensive statistical mechanics. It is found that the black hole entropy gets a modification due to non-extensivity. By using such an entropy, the black hole can be stabilized due to the non-extensivity, and the bound on the non-extensive parameter is also determined.</description>

      <title>Comment on "The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces" (arXiv:2308.06669v3)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03294v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ``The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Carcassi, Calder\'on and Aidala (arXiv:2308.06669v3) is a thoughtful dissection of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics that seeks to pinpoint difficulties inherent in postulating that the physical states are elements of a Hilbert space. Its pivotal charge against Hilbert spaces is that by a change of variables, which is a change-of-basis unitary transformation, one ``can map states with finite expectation values to those with infinite ones''. In the present comment it is shown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the error is spotted. In consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes ``the expectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time" is also faulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces ``turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity'' is unsubstantiated. Two other objections to Hilbert spaces on physical grounds, both technically correct, are the isomorphism of separable Hilbert spaces and the unavoidable existence of infinite-expectation-value states. The former is of little relevance but the latter remains an issue without a fully satisfactory solution, although the evidence so far is that it is physically innocuous. All in all, while the authors' thesis that Hilbert spaces must be given up ought to be taken seriously, it seems insufficiently supported to be convincing.</description>

      <title>Tuning the cosmic instrument: robust cosmology through combined probes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01722v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As wide-field surveys yield increasingly precise data, multiprobe analyses offer significant advantages. In this work, we use our previously developed framework for jointly analyzing cosmic microwave background (CMB) and large-scale structure data. We analyze combinations of three CMB (Planck PR3, Planck PR4, and ACT+WMAP) datasets, DESI Y1 Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) data, and a $9\times 2$pt low-$z$ dataset comprising KiDS-1000, BOSS DR12, and Planck CMB lensing/Integrated Sachs Wolfe (including all cross-correlations). We first assess internal consistency, finding a mild ($&lt;2\sigma$) tension between CMB and low-$z$ datasets in the full parameter space and hints of systematics in Planck PR3 and KiDS-1000. We then derive constraints in $\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$ and, motivated by recent DESI results, dynamical dark energy ($w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) and free neutrino mass extensions. In $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, we derive a novel $9\times2$pt constraint of $S8=0.777^{+0.17}_{-0.17}$ and find strong consistency among CMB datasets. In $w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$, adding low-$z$ to CMB+BAO tightens $(w_0,w_a)$ constraints by 50\% (in figure-of-merit terms) in our baseline combination of Planck PR4 + low-$z$ + BAO. The posterior accommodates a cosmological constant ($w_0 = -1, w_a = 0$) within $1\sigma$, in contrast to the $\sim2\sigma$ preference for evolving dark energy from CMB+BAO alone. For neutrino masses, our baseline dataset yields a systematics-robust constraint of $M_\nu&lt;0.12\mathrm{eV}$ in $\nu\Lambda\mathrm{CDM}$. Allowing dynamical dark energy and free neutrino mass ($\nu w_0w_a\mathrm{CDM}$) broadens and shifts the neutrino mass posterior higher, yielding a $1.8\sigma$ constraint ($M_\nu=0.16^{+0.09}_{-0.09}\mathrm{eV}$) in our baseline. Our analysis demonstrates the power of multiprobe analyses for assessing tensions, identifying systematics and providing robust constraints.</description>

Abstract: In the large$-N$ limit, no known no-go theorem rules out thermal time crystals that spontaneously break continuous time-translation, unlike in the large volume limit. If thermal time crystals exist in holographic CFTs, they would correspond to ensemble-dominating black holes with eternally time-varying exterior geometries. We point out that recent work on a conjectured non-linear instability of slowly rotating Kerr-AdS$_4$ produced viable candidates for such states. Then we show that the existence of holographic microcanonical time crystals would imply violations of the AdS Penrose inequality (PI). We proceed to look for violations of the PI in spherical symmetry, working with Einstein-scalar gravity with the most general possible boundary conditions compatible with boundary conformal invariance. We derive a set of ODEs for maximally PI-violating initial data. Solving these numerically, we find strong evidence that in the particular case of spherical symmetry, the PI holds iff the positive mass theorem (PMT) holds. This suggests that holographic CFT$_3$ time crystals can only possibly exist at non-zero angular momentum, at least in the absence of electric charge. We also discover neutral hairy black holes in a consistent truncation of M-theory that has a PMT and boundary conditions respecting conformal invariance, disproving an existing no-hair conjecture. Finally, we show that previous PI-violating solutions by the author all existed in theories where the PMT is violated. Unfortunately, our results imply that there currently are no known examples where the PI functions as a non-trivial Swampland constraint.</description>

      <title>Integrable deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dimensional reduction of gravity theories to $D=2$ along commuting Killing isometries is well-known to be classically integrable. The resulting system typically features a coset $\sigma$-model coupled to a dilaton and a scale factor of the dimensional reduction. In this article, we construct two families of deformations of dimensionally reduced gravity that preserve the Lax integrable structure.
  The first family is an extension of the Auxiliary Field Deformation recently introduced by Ferko and Smith, while the second family consists in the embedding of the Yang-Baxter $\sigma$-model into $D=2$ dimensionally reduced gravity. For both deformations we construct flat Lax representations. The Auxiliary Field Deformation, in particular, preserves the rich algebraic structure underlying the undeformed model and, leaving the canonical structure of the Lax connection's spatial components essentially unchanged, allows us to prove its integrability also in the Hamiltonian sense.</description>

      <title>Impact of phase signal formulations on tilt-to-length coupling noise in the LISA test mass interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tilt-to-length (TTL) coupling in the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) can generate spurious displacement noise that potentially affects the measurement of gravitational wave signals. In each test mass interferometer, the coupling of misalignments with spacecraft angular jitter produces noise in the longitudinal pathlength signal. This signal comes from the phase readout combinations of an interfering measurement beam and a local reference beam at a quadrant photodetector, but various formulations exist for its calculation. Selection of this pathlength signal formulation affects the TTL coupling noise. We therefore simulated two pathlength signal candidates, the complex sum and the averaged phase, and evaluated their performance in the LISA test mass interferometer under the assumption of static alignment imperfections. All simulations were performed using three different methods with cross-checked results. We find with all three methods that the averaged phase is the choice with equal or less TTL coupling noise in four out of the five test cases. Finally, we show that the non-linear TTL contributions in the test mass interferometer to be negligible in all our test-cases, no matter which formulation of pathlength signal is chosen.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent scenario for jet and stellar explosion in collapsar: General relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulation with dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A resistive magnetohydrodynamics simulation with a dynamo term is performed for modeling the collapsar in full general relativity. As an initial condition, a spinning black hole and infalling stellar matter are modeled based on a stellar evolution result, superimposing a weak toroidal magnetic field. After the growth of a massive torus around the black hole, the magnetic field is amplified in it, developing poloidal fields via dynamo. In an early stage of the torus growth, magnetic fluxes that fall to the vicinity of the central black hole are swallowed by the black hole and global poloidal magnetic fields that can be the source of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism are not developed. However, in a later stage in which the ram pressure of the infalling matter becomes weak, the magnetic field amplified by the black hole spin via the winding becomes large enough to expel the infalling matter by the magnetic pressure, and subsequently, a global poloidal magnetic field that penetrates the black hole is established, launching a jet along the spin axis by the Blandford-Znajek mechanism with the luminosity suitable for explaining typical long gamma-ray bursts. Together with the jet launch, the effectively viscous effect in the inner region of the torus and the magnetocentrifugal effect drive the stellar explosion with the explosion energy comparable to typical or powerful supernovae. We also find large amounts of synthesized $^{56}$Ni and Zn associated with the stellar explosion. In the presence of jet launching, $r$-process elements are weakly synthesized. The numerical results of the explosion energy, ejecta mass, and $^{56}$Ni mass are in a good agreement with those for observed broad-lined type Ic supernovae. Our result illustrates a self-consistent scenario for the gamma-ray-burst-associated broad-lined type Ic supernovae.</description>

      <title>Elucidating the Dark Energy and Dark Matter Phenomena Within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enigmatic phenomenon of dark energy (DE) is regarded as the elusive entity driving the accelerated expansion of our Universe. A plausible candidate for DE is the non-zero Einstein Cosmological Constant $\Lambda_{E}$ manifested as a constant energy density of the vacuum, yet it seemingly defies gravitational effects. In this work, we interpret the non-zero $\Lambda_{E}$ through the lens of scale-invariant cosmology. We revisit the conformal scale factor $\lambda$ and its defining equations within the Scale-Invariant Vacuum (SIV) paradigm. Furthermore, we address the profound problem of the missing mass across galactic and extragalactic scales by deriving an MOND-like relation, $g \sim \sqrt{a_0\,g_N}$, within the SIV context. Remarkably, the values obtained for $\Lambda_{E}$ and the MOND fundamental acceleration, $a_0$, align with observed magnitudes, specifically, $a_0 \approx 10^{-10} \, \mathrm{m} \, \mathrm{s}^{-2}$ and $\Lambda_{E} \approx 1.8 \times 10^{-52} \, \mathrm{m}^{-2}$. Moreover, we propose a novel early dark energy term, $\tilde{T}_{\mu\nu} \sim \kappa H$, within the SIV paradigm, which holds potential relevance for addressing the Hubble tension.

      <title>Constraints on minimally and conformally coupled ultralight dark matter with the EPTA</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02420v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millisecond pulsars are extremely stable natural timekeepers. Pulsar Timing Array experiments, tracking subtle changes in the pulsars' rotation periods, can shed light on the presence of ultralight particles in our Galaxy. In this conference paper, we start by reviewing the most conservative scenario, in which ultralight particles interact only gravitationally. In this setting, we show that Pulsar Timing Arrays are able to constrain the presence of ultralight fields up to a few tenths of the observed dark matter abundance. Then, we consider conformally coupled ultralight candidates, demonstrating that the constraints on the universal scalar coupling of the field to Standard Model particles improve on existing bounds by several orders of magnitude, in the relevant mass range analyzed by Pulsar Timing Arrays. The discussion presented here is based on [1,2].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02498v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss minimal covariant quantum space-time ${\cal M}^{1,3}_0$, which is defined through the minimal doubleton representation of $\mathfrak{so}(4,2)$. An elementary definition in terms of generators and relations is given. This space is shown to admit a semi-classical interpretation as quantized twistor space ${\mathbb C} P^{1,2}$, viewed as a quantized $S^2$-bundle over a 3+1-dimensional $k=-1$ FLRW space-time. In particular we find an over-complete set of (quasi-) coherent states, with a large hierarchy between the uncertainty scale and the geometric curvature scale. This provides an interesting background for the IKKT model, leading to a $\mathfrak{hs}$-extended gravitational gauge theory, which is free of ghosts due to the constraints on phase space arising from the doubleton representation.</description>

      <title>Primordial Sharp Features through the Nonlinear Regime of Structure Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sudden violations of the slow-roll regime during inflation, a natural prediction of many UV-complete inflationary models, give rise to sharp features in the primordial power spectrum. At large scales, these features provide a unique window into the physics of inflation, with constraints primarily derived from Cosmic Microwave Background observations of linearly evolved primordial fluctuations. However, on smaller scales, it is less clear whether primordial features would survive the late-time nonlinear cosmological evolution, as they are expected to be washed out by mode coupling. In this paper, we run dedicated N-body simulations to tackle this question. We demonstrate that, while oscillatory-like patterns are erased over time by nonlinearities, signatures of primordial sharp features can persist through the nonlinear regime of structure formation. Those take the form of a localised power enhancement or decrease in the matter power spectrum, whose amplitude and position can in principle be used to recover the scale of the primordial feature, and an oscillatory pattern in the halo mass function. While these findings highlight the power for constraining inflationary physics at small scales, they also show the challenges posed by potential degeneracies with other physical processes relevant in the nonlinear regime of structure formation such as non-cold dark matter candidates. Our results open new avenues for probing inflationary physics in large scale structures and galactic physics and emphasise the need for refined theoretical tools to robustly constrain primordial features.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes of a Schwarzschild black hole within the Bondi-Sachs framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06636v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Studies of quasinormal modes (QNMs) of black holes have a long and well established history. Predominantly, much research in this area has customarily focused on the equations given by Regge, Wheeler and Zerilli. In this work we study linearized perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole using the Characteristic formulation of numerical relativity, with an emphasis on the computation of QNMs. Within this formalism, the master equation describing gravitational perturbations is known to satisfy a fourth order differential equation. We analyse the singular points of this master equation, and obtain series solutions whose coefficients are given by three term recurrence relations, from which Leaver's continued fraction method can be applied. Using this technique, we recover the standard Schwarzschild quasinormal modes. In addition, we find that imposing purely outgoing boundary conditions, a natural feature of the Bondi-Sachs framework, leads to the recovery of the algebraically special mode.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics of a homogeneous scalar field non-minimally coupled to torsion gravity, which also interacts with cold dark matter through energy and momentum transfer. The matter and radiation perfect fluids are modeled using the Sorkin-Schutz formalism. We identify scaling regimes of the field during both the radiation and matter eras. Additionally, we discovered a field-dominated scaling attractor; however, it does not exhibit accelerated expansion, making it unsuitable for describing dark energy. Nevertheless, we find two attractor solutions that do exhibit accelerated expansion: one is a quintessence-like fixed point, and the other is a de Sitter fixed point.</description>

      <title>Towards a group structure for superluminal velocity boosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Canonical subluminal Lorentz boosts have a clear geometric interpretation. They can be neatly expressed as hyperbolic rotations, that leave both the family of $2$-sheet hyperboloids within the light cone, and the family $1$-sheet hyperboloids exterior to it, invariant. In this work, we construct a map between the two families of hypersurfaces and interpret the corresponding operators as superluminal velocity boosts. Though a physical observer cannot `jump' the light speed barrier, to pass from one regime to the other (at least not classically), the existence of superluminal motion does not, by itself, generate paradoxes. The implications of this construction for recent work on the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed by Dragan and Ekert, are discussed. The geometric picture reproduces their `superboost' operator in $(1+1)$ dimensions but generalises to $(1+3)$ dimensions in a very different way. This leaves open an important possibility, which appears to be closed to existing models, namely, the possibility of embedding the superluminal boosts within a group structure, without generating additional unwanted phenomenology, that contradicts existing experimental results. We prove that the set containing both subluminal and superluminal boosts forms a group, in $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes, and outline a program to extend these results to higher-dimensional geometries.</description>

Abstract: The present work shows that the second law of thermodynamics gets naturally satisfied during the entire cosmic evolution of the universe starting from inflation to the late dark energy era, without imposing any exotic condition. This makes the inter-connection between cosmology and thermodynamics more concrete. Consequently, it also depicts that why the matter fields are not in thermal equilibrium with the apparent horizon during most of the cosmic era of the universe, except for the fluids with $\omega = -1/3$ leading to the transitions of the universe from an accelerating to a decelerating era and vice-versa.</description>

      <title>Geometrical origin for the compaction function for primordial black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05544v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a geometrical origin for the Shibata-Sasaki compaction function, which is known to be a reliable indicator of primordial black hole formation at least during radiation domination. In the long-wavelength limit, we identify it with a compactness function in the static spacetime obtained by removing the cosmological scale factor from the metric and this explains why it cannot be greater than $1/2$. If its maximum is below $1/2$, the perturbation is of type I. If its maximum equals $1/2$, it corresponds to an extremal surface, which is simultaneously a bifurcating trapping horizon and admits a circular photon orbit in the static spacetime. In the long-wavelength regime of the physical expanding Universe, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction reaches its maximum value of $1/2$ at maximal and minimal surfaces on the constant time spacelike hypersurface, which feature a type II perturbation and both correspond to photon spheres expanding along with the cosmological expansion. Thus, the Shibata-Sasaki compaction measures how close to the type II configuration the perturbed region is.</description>

Abstract: In the 1970s, Fulling, Davies, and Unruh demonstrated that the vacuum state perceived by an inertial observer in Minkowski space appears as a thermal bath to a uniformly accelerated observer. We explore the transformation of the Wigner distribution of a real scalar field from an inertial to a Rindler frame, utilizing both Minkowski and Unruh modes. We present a general expression for the reduced Wigner distribution for a specific set of massless scalar field configurations, and validate it against known distributions within this set. This includes arbitrary Gaussian states of Unruh-Minkowski modes, the Minkowski vacuum state, the Rindler vacuum, and the thermal bath of Unruh particles. Additionally, we analyze several other distributions, such as a uniform momentum distribution, a slight deviation from the Minkowski vacuum, and a distribution with a Fermionic component in the Rindler frame. The conclusions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Formulating the complete initial boundary value problem in numerical relativity to model black hole echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In an attempt to simulate black hole echoes (generated by potential quantum-gravitational structure) in numerical relativity, we recently described how to implement a reflecting boundary outside of the horizon of a black hole in spherical symmetry. Here, we generalize this approach to spacetimes with no symmetries and implement it numerically using the generalized harmonic formulation. We cast the evolution equations and the numerical implementation into a Summation By Parts (SBP) scheme, which seats our method closer to a class of provably numerically stable systems. We implement an embedded boundary numerical framework that allows for arbitrarily shaped domains on a rectangular grid and even boundaries that evolve and move across the grid. As a demonstration of this framework, we study the evolution of gravitational wave scattering off a boundary either inside, or just outside, the horizon of a black hole. This marks a big leap toward the goal of a generic framework to obtain gravitational waveforms for behaviors motivated by quantum gravity near the horizons of merging black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The expansion of the universe in $f(R,T)$ gravity is studied. By focusing on functions of the form $f(R,T)=f_1(R)+f_2(T)$, we assert that present day acceleration can be achieved if the functional form of $f_2(T)$ either grows slowly or falls as a function of $T$. In particular, we demonstrate that when $f_2(T) \propto T^{-1}$, the universe transitions to exponential growth at late times, just as it does in the standard cosmological model. A comparison of predictions of this model, with Type Ia supernovae shows that this model fits the data as well or even slightly better than the standard cosmological model without increasing the number of parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07017v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the $(1+3)$-dimensional `superboost' operators, proposed in Dragan and Ekert's most recent work on superluminal reference frames \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, are simply the canonical Lorentz boosts, expressed in nonstandard notation. Their $(1+3)$-dimensional `superflip', which is claimed to interchange time and space dimensions for a superluminal observer, travelling with infinite speed, is equivalent to applying the identity operator together with an arbitrary relabeling. Physically, it corresponds to staying put within the canonical rest frame, then renaming space as `time' and time as `space'. We conclude that their extension of the `quantum principle of relativity', proposed in earlier work on $(1+1)$-dimensional spacetimes \cite{Dragan:2019grn}, to ordinary Minkowski space \cite{Dragan:2022txt}, is simply Einstein's principle of relativity, proposed in 1905.</description>

      <title>Transition from adiabatic inspiral to plunge for eccentric binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09160v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole binaries with small mass ratios will be critical targets for the forthcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. They also serve as useful tools for understanding the properties of binaries at general mass ratios. In its early stages, such a binary's gravitational-wave-driven inspiral can be modeled as the smaller body flowing through a sequence of geodesic orbits of the larger black hole's spacetime. Its motion through this sequence is determined by the rate at which backreaction changes an orbit's integrals of motion $E$, $L_z$, and $Q$. Key to the motion being close to a geodesic at any moment is the idea that the effect of backreaction is small compared to a ``restoring force'' arising from the potential which governs geodesic motion. This restoring force holds the small body on a geodesic trajectory as the backreaction causes that geodesic to slowly evolve. As the inspiraling body approaches the last stable orbit (LSO), the restoring force becomes weaker and the backreaction becomes stronger. Once the small body evolves past the LSO, its trajectory converges to a plunging geodesic. This work aims to smoothly connect these two disparate regimes: the slowly evolving adiabatic inspiral and the final plunge. Past work has focused on this transition to plunge for circular systems. Here, we study the transition for binaries with eccentricity. A well-defined eccentric transition will make it possible to develop small-mass-ratio binary waveform models that terminate in a physically reasonable way, rather than abruptly terminating as an inspiral-only model ends. A model that can explore the parameter space of eccentricity may also be useful for understanding the final cycles of eccentric binaries at less extreme mass ratios, such as those likely to be observed by ground-based detectors.</description>

      <title>Approximate helical symmetry in compact binaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.16373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inspiral of a circular, non-precessing binary exhibits an approximate helical symmetry. The effects of eccentricity, precession, and radiation reaction break the exact symmetry. We estimate the failure of this symmetry using the flux of the BMS charge corresponding to helical symmetry carried away by gravitational waves. We analytically compute the helical flux for binaries moving on eccentric orbits and quasi-circular orbits without precession using post-Newtonian theory. The helical flux is non-vanishing at the 0PN order for eccentric orbits as expected. We analytically predict the helical flux to be at a relative 5PN order for quasi-circular non-precessing binaries. This prediction is compared with 113 quasi-circular non-precessing numerical relativity waveforms from the SXS catalog. We find good agreement between analytical and numerical results for quasi-circular non-precessing binaries establishing that helical symmetry starts to break at 5PN for these binaries.</description>

      <title>On the Unruh effect for hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.18155v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, after the introduction of the notion of spacetime of maximal proper acceleration and its associated fundamental geometric and kinematic properties, the Unruh temperature formula is generalized to the case of hyperbolic observers in spacetimes of maximal proper acceleration. Such a generalization implies the existence of a maximal value for the Unruh temperature. We discuss this result for an electrodynamic model of point charged particle in a spacetime of maximal proper acceleration. It is shown that according to this mathematical model, the maximal Unruh temperature must be of order $10^5\, K$ for current high acceleration gradient laser-plasma acceleration experiments.</description>

      <title>A geometric template bank for the detection of spinning low-mass compact binaries with moderate orbital eccentricity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06433v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compact binaries on eccentric orbits are another class of gravitational-wave (GW) sources that can provide a wealth of information on binary formation pathways and astrophysical environments. However, historically, eccentricity is often neglected in modelled GW searches for compact binaries. We show that currently used modelled searches that employ quasi-circular template banks are highly ineffectual in detecting binary neutron star (BNS) and neutron star--black hole (NSBH) systems with orbital eccentricities in the range of $[10^{-5},0.15]$ at a GW frequency of $15$Hz. For populations of moderately eccentric BNS and NSBH binaries with (anti-)aligned component spins, we demonstrate that quasi-circular template banks fail to detect up to $\sim 40\%$ of such systems. To alleviate these inefficiencies, we develop the first \emph{geometric} template bank for the search of BNSs and NSBH binaries that includes masses, (anti-)aligned spins and moderate eccentricity. Utilising the post-Newtonian inspiral waveform {\tt TaylorF2Ecc} and a global coordinate transformation, we construct a globally flat metric to efficiently place eccentric templates. Our geometric template bank is highly effectual, and significantly improves the recovery of eccentric signals with less than $6\%$ of signals missed due to the finite template spacing in the bank.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07971v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For neutron stars, there exist universal relations insensitive to the equation of states, the so called I-Love-Q relations, which show the connections among the moment of inertia, tidal Love number and quadrupole moment. In this paper, we show that these relations also apply to dark stars, bosonic or fermionic. The relations can be extended to higher ranges of the variables, clarifying the deviations for dark stars in the literature, as those curves all approximate the ones generated by a polytropic equation of state, when taking the low density (pressure) limit. Besides, we find that for equation of states with scaling symmetries, the I-Love-Q curves do not change when adjusting the scaling parameters.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars in light of the HESS J1731-347 remnant and the PREX-II experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The recent analysis on the central compact object in the HESS J1731-347 remnant suggests interestingly small values for its mass and radius. Such an observation favors soft nuclear models that may be challenged by the observation of massive compact stars. In contrast, the recent PREX-II experiment, concerning the neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb, points towards stiff equations of state that favor larger compact star radii. In the present study, we aim to explore the compatibility between stiff hadronic equations of state (favored by PREX-II) and the HESS J1731-347 remnant in the context of hybrid stars. For the construction of hybrid equations of state we use three widely employed Skyrme models combined with the well-known vector MIT bag model. Furthermore we consider two different scenarios concerning the energy density of the bag. In the first case, that of a constant bag parameter, we find that the resulting hybrid equations of state are strongly disfavored by the observation of $\sim2 M_\odot$ pulsars. However, the introduction of a Gaussian density dependence yields results that are compatible with the conservative $2 M_\odot$ constraint. The utilization of recent data based on the observation of PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0952-0607 and GW190814 allows for the imposition of additional constraints on the relevant parameters and the stiffness of the two phases. Interestingly, we find that the derived hybrid equations of state do not satisfy the PSR J0030+0451 constraints in $1\sigma$ and only marginally agree with the $2\sigma$ estimations. In addition, we estimate that the observation of massive pulsars, like PSR J0952-0607, in combination with the existence of HESS J1731-347, may require a strong phase transition below $\sim 1.7n_0$. Finally, we show that the supermassive compact object involved in GW190814 could potentially be explained as a rapidly rotating hybrid star.</description>

Abstract: We study finite-coupling effects of QFT on a rigid de Sitter (dS) background taking the $O(N)$ vector model at large $N$ as a solvable example. Extending standard large $N$ techniques to the dS background, we analyze the phase structure and late-time four-point functions. Explicit computations reveal that the spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is prohibited due to strong IR effects, akin to flat two-dimensional space. Resumming loop diagrams, we compute the late-time four-point functions of vector fields at large $N$, demonstrating that their spectral density is meromorphic in the spectral plane and positive along the principal series. These results offer highly nontrivial checks of unitarity and analyticity for cosmological correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the nature of primordial fluctuations is pivotal to unraveling the Universe's early evolution. While these fluctuations are observed to be nearly scale-invariant, quasi-adiabatic, and Gaussian on large scales, their small-scale behavior remains poorly constrained, offering a potential window into new physics. Recent detections of a stochastic gravitational wave background in the nanohertz frequency range by pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), including NANOGrav, PPTA, EPTA+InPTA, and CPTA, align with astrophysical predictions from supermassive black hole binaries but could also encode signatures of primordial phenomena. We investigate whether the observed signal originates from primordial isocurvature or adiabatic fluctuations by fitting them to the latest NANOGrav dataset. Through comprehensive Bayesian model comparison, we evaluate the distinguishability of these scenarios given current PTA sensitivities. Our results demonstrate that existing data cannot conclusively differentiate between isocurvature and adiabatic sources, highlighting the need for enhanced observational capabilities to probe the primordial universe at small scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00846v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in gravitational-wave interferometers, particularly the next generation, are poised to profoundly impact gravitational wave astronomy and multimessenger astrophysics. A hybrid quantum algorithm is proposed to carry out quantum inference of parameters from compact binary coalescences detected in gravitational-wave interferometers. It performs quantum Bayesian Inference with Renormalization and Downsampling (qBIRD). We choose binary black hole (BBH) mergers from LIGO observatories as the first case to test the algorithm, but its application can be extended to more general instances. The quantum algorithm is able to generate corner plots of relevant parameters such as chirp mass, mass ratio, spins, etc. by inference of simulated gravitational waves with known injected parameter values with zero noise, Gaussian noise and real data, thus recovering an accuracy equivalent to that of classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo inferences. The simulations are performed with sets of 2 and 4 parameters. These results enhance the possibilities to extend our capacity to track signals from coalescences over longer durations and at lower frequencies extending the accuracy and promptness of gravitational wave parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Stability and topological nature of charged Gauss-Bonnet AdS black holes in five dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamics of Reissner-Nordstrom Gauss-Bonnet (RN-GB) black holes in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space with three horizon geometries (k=+1,0,-1) within the grand canonical ensemble. Using the recently developed topological approach to black hole thermodynamics, inspired by Duan's $\phi$-mapping theory, we analyze the black holes by treating both critical points in the phase diagram and black hole solutions as defects in the thermodynamic parameter space. Our results show that the Gauss-Bonnet coupling significantly alters the topological classification of RN-GB AdS black holes, distinguishing them from their RN AdS counterparts in the grand canonical ensemble, while aligning with their canonical ensemble counterparts. Complementary analyses of local stability using specific heat validate the implication of topological analysis. Furthermore, an evaluation of global stability via Gibbs free energy provides a comprehensive understanding on the system's phase structure. Notably, for k=+1, topological analysis suggests liquid-gas type phase transitions, whereas global analysis favors Hawking-Page transitions. For k=-1, topology indicates a single stable black hole branch, yet the global analysis reveals the presence of Hawking-Page transition.</description>

Abstract: In the present study, we employ three distinct, physically motivated speed of sound bounds to construct hybrid models, where the high-density phase is described by the maximally stiff equation of state. In particular, we consider the bounds related to special relativity, relativistic kinetic theory and conformality. The low-density hadronic phase is described by a state-of-the-art microscopic relativistic Brueckner-Hartree-Fock theory. This work aims to access the effect of the different speed of sound constraints on the relevant parameter space of the key parameters of first-order phase transitions by utilizing recent astronomical data. This involves a systematic analysis that also includes two distinct schemes for the construction of hybrid models (abrupt and smooth). Finally, a relevant discussion is conducted on the possible occurrence of a thermodynamic inconsistency that is related to the stability of the high-density phase over hadronic matter at large densities.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously Constraining the Neutron Star Equation of State and Mass Distribution through Multimessenger Observations and Nuclear Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With ongoing advancements in nuclear theory and experimentation, together with a growing body of neutron star (NS) observations, a wealth of information on the equation of state (EOS) for matter at extreme densities has become accessible. Here, we utilize a hybrid EOS formulation that combines an empirical parameterization centered around the nuclear saturation density with a generic three-segment piecewise polytrope model at higher densities. We incorporate data derived from chiral effective field theory ($\chi$EFT), perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD), and from experiments such as PREX-II and CREX. Furthermore, we examine the influence of a total of 129 NS mass measurements up to April 2023, as well as simultaneous mass and radius measurements derived from the X-ray emission from surface hot spots on NSs. Additionally, we consider constraints on tidal properties inferred from the gravitational waves emitted by coalescing NS binaries. To integrate this extensive and varied array of constraints, we utilize a hierarchical Bayesian statistical framework to simultaneously deduce the EOS and the distribution of NS masses. We find that incorporating data from $\chi$EFT significantly tightens the constraints on the EOS of NSs near or below the nuclear saturation density. However, constraints derived from pQCD computations and nuclear experiments such as PREX-II and CREX have minimal impact.</description>

      <title>Search for a Gravitational-Wave Background from Sound Speed Resonance from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's First Three Observing Runs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14929v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We search for a stochastic gravitational-wave background (SGWB) originating from scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) with the sound speed resonance (SSR) effect using data from Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo's first three observing runs. The SSR mechanism, characterized by an oscillating sound speed squared term, can induce a nonperturbative parametric amplification of specific perturbation modes during inflation, leading to enhanced primordial curvature perturbations and a significant SIGW signal. We perform a Bayesian analysis to constrain the model parameters describing the SGWB spectrum from the SSR effect. Our results show no statistically significant evidence for the presence of such a signal in the current data. Consequently, we place an upper limit of $|\tau_0| \lesssim 5.9 \times 10^3\,\mathrm{s}$ at $95\%$ confidence level on the start time of the oscillation in the SSR model. These results demonstrate the capability of current gravitational wave detectors to probe inflation models through the SSR mechanism and paves the way for future searches with improved sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Mode-sum prescription for renormalized expectation values for a charged quantum scalar field on a charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18211v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new mode-sum prescription for the efficient computation of renormalized expectation values for a massive, charged, quantum scalar field propagating on a curved space-time background. Our method is applicable to any static, spherically-symmetric, four-dimensional space-time with a time-independent, background electrostatic potential and can be used to find the renormalized scalar condensate, current and stress-energy tensor. As an explicit example, we present a calculation of these quantities for a charged scalar field in the Hartle-Hawking state on a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole background.</description>

      <title>On Chord Dynamics and Complexity Growth in Double-Scaled SYK</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the time evolution governed by the two-sided chord Hamiltonian in the double-scaled SYK model, which induces a probability distribution over operators in the double-scaled algebra. Through the bulk-to-boundary map, this distribution translates into dynamical profiles of bulk states within the chord Hilbert space. We derive analytic expressions for such profiles, valid across a broad parameter range and all time scales. Additionally, we demonstrate how distinct semi-classical behaviors emerge by localizing within specific energy regions in the semi-classical limit. We revisit the doubled Hilbert space formalism as an isometric map between the one-particle sector of the chord Hilbert space and the doubled zero-particle sector. Utilizing this map, we obtain analytic results for correlation functions and investigate the dynamical properties of operator Krylov complexity for chords, establishing an equivalence between the chord number generating function and the crossed four-point correlation function. We also explore finite-temperature effects, showing that operator spreading slows as temperature decreases. In the semi-classical limit, we perform a saddle point analysis and incorporate the one-loop determinant to derive the normalized time-ordered four-point correlation function. The leading correction reproduces the \(1/N\) connected contribution observed in the large-\(p\) SYK model at infinite temperature. Finally, we examine the time evolution of operator Krylov complexity for a matter chord in the triple-scaled regime, linking it to the renormalized two-sided length in JT gravity with matter.</description>

      <title>Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10306v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. The algorithm reproduces relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the ``Density Frame", which is a formulation of viscous hydrodynamics we review and clarify here. This formulation is first order in time and requires no auxiliary dynamical fields such as $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$. The only parameters are the shear and bulk viscosities and the equation of state. By adopting the 3+1 split of general relativity, we extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Re(l)ality: The View From Nowhere vs. The View From Everywhere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20520v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the fiber bundle framework, this work investigates the conceptual and mathematical foundations of reference frames in General Relativity by contrasting two paradigms. The View from Nowhere interprets frame representations as perspectives on an invariant equivalence class, while the View from Everywhere posits each frame representation as constituting reality itself. TWhat emerges is a conception of reality that I term "Relality". The paper critically examines the philosophical and practical implications of these views, with a focus on reconciling theory with experimental practice. Central to the discussion is the challenge of providing a perspicuous characterisation of ontology. The View from Nowhere aligns with the so-called sophisticated approach on symmetries and it complicates the empirical grounding of theoretical constructs. In contrast, the View from Everywhere offers a relational ontology that avoids the abstraction of equivalence classes.</description>
