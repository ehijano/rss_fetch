      <title>"For Us By Us": Intentionally Designing Technology for Lived Black Experiences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HCI research to date has only scratched the surface of the unique approaches racially minoritized communities take to building, designing, and using technology systems. While there has been an increase in understanding how people across racial groups create community across different platforms, there is still a lack of studies that explicitly center on how Black technologists design with and for their own communities. In this paper, we present findings from a series of semi-structured interviews with Black technologists who have used, created, or curated resources to support lived Black experiences. From their experiences, we find a multifaceted approach to design as a means of survival, to stay connected, for cultural significance, and to bask in celebratory joy. Further, we provide considerations that emphasize the need for centering lived Black experiences in design and share approaches that can empower the broader research community to conduct further inquiries into design focused on those in the margins.</description>

      <title>Exploring Empty Spaces: Human-in-the-Loop Data Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data augmentation is crucial to make machine learning models more robust and safe. However, augmenting data can be challenging as it requires generating diverse data points to rigorously evaluate model behavior on edge cases and mitigate potential harms. Creating high-quality augmentations that cover these "unknown unknowns" is a time- and creativity-intensive task. In this work, we introduce Amplio, an interactive tool to help practitioners navigate "unknown unknowns" in unstructured text datasets and improve data diversity by systematically identifying empty data spaces to explore. Amplio includes three human-in-the-loop data augmentation techniques: Augment With Concepts, Augment by Interpolation, and Augment with Large Language Model. In a user study with 18 professional red teamers, we demonstrate the utility of our augmentation methods in helping generate high-quality, diverse, and relevant model safety prompts. We find that Amplio enabled red teamers to augment data quickly and creatively, highlighting the transformative potential of interactive augmentation workflows.</description>

      <title>Mechanic Maker: Accessible Game Development Via Symbolic Learning Program Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Game development is a highly technical practice that traditionally requires programming skills. This serves as a barrier to entry for would-be developers or those hoping to use games as part of their creative expression. While there have been prior game development tools focused on accessibility, they generally still require programming, or have major limitations in terms of the kinds of games they can make. In this paper we introduce Mechanic Maker, a tool for creating a wide-range of game mechanics without programming. It instead relies on a backend symbolic learning system to synthesize game mechanics from examples. We conducted a user study to evaluate the benefits of the tool for participants with a variety of programming and game development experience. Our results demonstrated that participants' ability to use the tool was unrelated to programming ability. We conclude that tools like ours could help democratize game development, making the practice accessible regardless of programming skills.</description>

      <title>What Did I Say Again? Relating User Needs to Search Outcomes in Conversational Commerce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in natural language processing and deep learning have accelerated the development of digital assistants. In conversational commerce, these assistants help customers find suitable products in online shops through natural language conversations. During the dialogue, the assistant identifies the customer's needs and preferences and subsequently suggests potentially relevant products. Traditional online shops often allow users to filter search results based on their preferences using facets. Selected facets can also serve as a reminder of how the product base was filtered. In conversational commerce, however, the absence of facets and the use of advanced natural language processing techniques can leave customers uncertain about how their input was processed by the system. This can hinder transparency and trust, which are critical factors influencing customers' purchase intentions. To address this issue, we propose a novel text-based digital assistant that, in the product assessment step, explains how specific product aspects relate to the user's previous utterances to enhance transparency and facilitate informed decision-making. We conducted a user study (N=135) and found a significant increase in user-perceived transparency when natural language explanations and highlighted text passages were provided, demonstrating their potential to extend system transparency to the product assessment step in conversational commerce.</description>

      <title>MARLens: Understanding Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning for Traffic Signal Control via Visual Analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The issue of traffic congestion poses a significant obstacle to the development of global cities. One promising solution to tackle this problem is intelligent traffic signal control (TSC). Recently, TSC strategies leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) have garnered attention among researchers. However, the evaluation of these models has primarily relied on fixed metrics like reward and queue length. This limited evaluation approach provides only a narrow view of the model's decision-making process, impeding its practical implementation. Moreover, effective TSC necessitates coordinated actions across multiple intersections. Existing visual analysis solutions fall short when applied in multi-agent settings. In this study, we delve into the challenge of interpretability in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), particularly within the context of TSC. We propose MARLens a visual analytics system tailored to understand MARL-based TSC. Our system serves as a versatile platform for both RL and TSC researchers. It empowers them to explore the model's features from various perspectives, revealing its decision-making processes and shedding light on interactions among different agents. To facilitate quick identification of critical states, we have devised multiple visualization views, complemented by a traffic simulation module that allows users to replay specific training scenarios. To validate the utility of our proposed system, we present three comprehensive case studies, incorporate insights from domain experts through interviews, and conduct a user study. These collective efforts underscore the feasibility and effectiveness of MARLens in enhancing our understanding of MARL-based TSC systems and pave the way for more informed and efficient traffic management strategies.</description>

      <title>CSLens: Towards Better Deploying Charging Stations via Visual Analytics -- A Coupled Networks Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has surged, prompting a corresponding rise in the installation of charging stations. This proliferation has underscored the importance of expediting the deployment of charging infrastructure. Both academia and industry have thus devoted to addressing the charging station location problem (CSLP) to streamline this process. However, prevailing algorithms addressing CSLP are hampered by restrictive assumptions and computational overhead, leading to a dearth of comprehensive evaluations in the spatiotemporal dimensions. Consequently, their practical viability is restricted. Moreover, the placement of charging stations exerts a significant impact on both the road network and the power grid, which necessitates the evaluation of the potential post-deployment impacts on these interconnected networks holistically. In this study, we propose CSLens, a visual analytics system designed to inform charging station deployment decisions through the lens of coupled transportation and power networks. CSLens offers multiple visualizations and interactive features, empowering users to delve into the existing charging station layout, explore alternative deployment solutions, and assess the ensuring impact. To validate the efficacy of CSLens, we conducted two case studies and engaged in interviews with domain experts. Through these efforts, we substantiated the usability and practical utility of CSLens in enhancing the decision-making process surrounding charging station deployment. Our findings underscore CSLens's potential to serve as a valuable asset in navigating the complexities of charging infrastructure planning.</description>

      <title>Can We Delegate Learning to Automation?: A Comparative Study of LLM Chatbots, Search Engines, and Books</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning is a key motivator behind information search behavior. With the emergence of LLM-based chatbots, students are increasingly turning to these tools as their primary resource for acquiring knowledge. However, the transition from traditional resources like textbooks and web searches raises concerns among educators. They worry that these fully-automated LLMs might lead students to delegate critical steps of search as learning. In this paper, we systematically uncover three main concerns from educators' perspectives. In response to these concerns, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 92 university students to compare three learning sources with different automation levels. Our results show that LLMs support comprehensive understanding of key concepts without promoting passive learning, though their effectiveness in knowledge retention was limited. Additionally, we found that academic performance impacted both learning outcomes and search patterns. Notably, higher-competence learners engaged more deeply with content through reading-intensive behaviors rather than relying on search activities.</description>

      <title>A Smart Chair for Health Monitoring in Daily Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent research has focused on the risks associated with poor sitting posture and the impact of sitting on biological parameters, such as heart rate because prolonged sitting is common across all ages and professions. In this work, we propose a novel approach that can display simultaneously posture and heart rate in real-time. In this device, pressure sensors are embedded into a flexible separate cushion easily put on any chair to provide sitting behaviours and a smartwatch-like PPG module is worn on the user's wrist. Regarding posture classification, pressure figures of ten pressure sensors under the seat bottom are inputs of four machine learning models, giving a high accuracy of 99 per cent. Besides, the Electrocardiography recording module is illustrated with the same results as a commercial device called DFRobot. Another advantage of this smart chair is that it not only simultaneously displays both sitting postures and heart rates on external devices like laptops, mobile phones, or televisions through microcontrollers but also offers the relationship between them to help people adjust their sitting behaviours, avoiding influencing heart rate. The smart chair is expected to be useful equipment for people with a sedentary lifestyle, especially office workers.</description>

      <title>Open-vocabulary Multimodal Emotion Recognition: Dataset, Metric, and Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) is an important research topic. This paper advocates for a transformative paradigm in MER. The rationale behind our work is that current approaches often rely on a limited set of basic emotion labels, which do not adequately represent the rich spectrum of human emotions. These traditional and overly simplistic emotion categories fail to capture the inherent complexity and subtlety of human emotional experiences, leading to limited generalizability and practicality. Therefore, we propose a new MER paradigm called Open-vocabulary MER (OV-MER), which encompasses a broader range of emotion labels to reflect the richness of human emotions. This paradigm relaxes the label space, allowing for the prediction of arbitrary numbers and categories of emotions. To support this transition, we provide a comprehensive solution that includes a newly constructed database based on LLM and human collaborative annotations, along with corresponding metrics and a series of benchmarks. We hope this work advances emotion recognition from basic emotions to more nuanced emotions, contributing to the development of emotional AI.</description>

      <title>Avatar Appearance and Behavior of Potential Harassers Affect Users' Perceptions and Response Strategies in Social Virtual Reality (VR): A Mixed-Methods Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sexual harassment has been recognized as a significant social issue. In recent years, the emergence of harassment in social virtual reality (VR) has become an important and urgent research topic. We employed a mixed-methods approach by conducting online surveys with VR users (N = 166) and semi-structured interviews with social VR users (N = 18) to investigate how users perceive sexual harassment in social VR, focusing on the influence of avatar appearance. Moreover, we derived users' response strategies to sexual harassment and gained insights on platform regulation. This study contributes to the research on sexual harassment in social VR by examining the moderating effect of avatar appearance on user perception of sexual harassment and uncovering the underlying reasons behind response strategies. Moreover, it presents novel prospects and challenges in platform design and regulation domains.</description>

      <title>Customizing Generated Signs and Voices of AI Avatars: Deaf-Centric Mixed-Reality Design for Deaf-Hearing Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates innovative interaction designs for communication and collaborative learning between learners of mixed hearing and signing abilities, leveraging advancements in mixed reality technologies like Apple Vision Pro and generative AI for animated avatars. Adopting a participatory design approach, we engaged 15 d/Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) students to brainstorm ideas for an AI avatar with interpreting ability (sign language to English, voice to English) that would facilitate their face-to-face communication with hearing peers. Participants envisioned the AI avatars to address some issues with human interpreters, such as lack of availability, and provide affordable options to expensive personalized interpreting service. Our findings indicate a range of preferences for integrating the AI avatars with actual human figures of both DHH and hearing communication partners. The participants highlighted the importance of having control over customizing the AI avatar, such as AI-generated signs, voices, facial expressions, and their synchronization for enhanced emotional display in communication. Based on our findings, we propose a suite of design recommendations that balance respecting sign language norms with adherence to hearing social norms. Our study offers insights on improving the authenticity of generative AI in scenarios involving specific, and sometimes unfamiliar, social norms.</description>

      <title>Practicing Stress Relief for the Everyday: Designing Social Simulation Using VR, AR, and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stress is an inevitable part of day-to-day life yet many find themselves unable to manage it themselves, particularly when professional or peer support are not always readily available. As self-care becomes increasingly vital for mental well-being, this paper explores the potential of social simulation as a safe, virtual environment for practicing stress relief for everyday situations. Leveraging the immersive capabilities of VR, AR, and LLMs, we developed eight interactive prototypes for various everyday stressful scenarios (e.g. public speaking) then conducted prototype-driven semi-structured interviews with 19 participants. We reveal that people currently lack effective means to support themselves through everyday stress and found that social simulation fills a gap for simulating real environments for training mental health practices. We outline key considerations for future development of simulation for self-care, including risks of trauma from hyper-realism, distrust of LLM-recommended timing for mental health recommendations, and the value of accessibility for self-care interventions.</description>

      <title>DreamGarden: A Designer Assistant for Growing Games from a Single Prompt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coding assistants are increasingly leveraged in game design, both generating code and making high-level plans. To what degree can these tools align with developer workflows, and what new modes of human-computer interaction can emerge from their use? We present DreamGarden, an AI system capable of assisting with the development of diverse game environments in Unreal Engine. At the core of our method is an LLM-driven planner, capable of breaking down a single, high-level prompt -- a dream, memory, or imagined scenario provided by a human user -- into a hierarchical action plan, which is then distributed across specialized submodules facilitating concrete implementation. This system is presented to the user as a garden of plans and actions, both growing independently and responding to user intervention via seed prompts, pruning, and feedback. Through a user study, we explore design implications of this system, charting courses for future work in semi-autonomous assistants and open-ended simulation design.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Viral Nature of Toxicity in Competitive Online Video Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Toxicity is a widespread phenomenon in competitive online video games. In addition to its direct undesirable effects, there is a concern that toxicity can spread to others, amplifying the harm caused by a single player's misbehavior. In this study, we estimate whether and to what extent a player's toxic speech spreads, causing their teammates to behave similarly. To this end, we analyze proprietary data from the free-to-play first-person action game Call of Duty: Warzone. We formulate and implement an instrumental variable identification strategy that leverages the network of interactions among players across matches. Our analysis reveals that all else equal, all of a player's teammates engaging in toxic speech increases their probability of engaging in similar behavior by 26.1 to 30.3 times the average player's likelihood of engaging in toxic speech. These findings confirm the viral nature of toxicity, especially toxic speech, in competitive online video games.</description>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming programming practices, offering significant capabilities for code generation activities. While researchers have explored the potential of LLMs in various domains, this paper focuses on their use in programming tasks, drawing insights from user studies that assess the impact of LLMs on programming tasks. We first examined the user interaction behaviors with LLMs observed in these studies, from the types of requests made to task completion strategies. Additionally, our analysis reveals both benefits and weaknesses of LLMs showing mixed effects on the human and task. Lastly, we looked into what factors from the human, LLM or the interaction of both, affect the human's enhancement as well as the task performance. Our findings highlight the variability in human-LLM interactions due to the non-deterministic nature of both parties (humans and LLMs), underscoring the need for a deeper understanding of these interaction patterns. We conclude by providing some practical suggestions for researchers as well as programmers.</description>

      <title>An Approach to Elicit Human-Understandable Robot Expressions to Support Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the intentions of robots is essential for natural and seamless human-robot collaboration. Ensuring that robots have means for non-verbal communication is a basis for intuitive and implicit interaction. For this, we contribute an approach to elicit and design human-understandable robot expressions. We outline the approach in the context of non-humanoid robots. We paired human mimicking and enactment with research from gesture elicitation in two phases: first, to elicit expressions, and second, to ensure they are understandable. We present an example application through two studies (N=16 \&amp; N=260) of our approach to elicit expressions for a simple 6-DoF robotic arm. We show that it enabled us to design robot expressions that signal curiosity and interest in getting attention. Our main contribution is an approach to generate and validate understandable expressions for robots, enabling more natural human-robot interaction.</description>

      <title>Automatic deductive coding in discourse analysis: an application of large language models in learning analytics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deductive coding is a common discourse analysis method widely used by learning science and learning analytics researchers for understanding teaching and learning interactions. It often requires researchers to manually label all discourses to be analyzed according to a theoretically guided coding scheme, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. The emergence of large language models such as GPT has opened a new avenue for automatic deductive coding to overcome the limitations of traditional deductive coding. To evaluate the usefulness of large language models in automatic deductive coding, we employed three different classification methods driven by different artificial intelligence technologies, including the traditional text classification method with text feature engineering, BERT-like pretrained language model and GPT-like pretrained large language model (LLM). We applied these methods to two different datasets and explored the potential of GPT and prompt engineering in automatic deductive coding. By analyzing and comparing the accuracy and Kappa values of these three classification methods, we found that GPT with prompt engineering outperformed the other two methods on both datasets with limited number of training samples. By providing detailed prompt structures, the reported work demonstrated how large language models can be used in the implementation of automatic deductive coding.</description>

      <title>ACE: A LLM-based Negotiation Coaching System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The growing prominence of LLMs has led to an increase in the development of AI tutoring systems. These systems are crucial in providing underrepresented populations with improved access to valuable education. One important area of education that is unavailable to many learners is strategic bargaining related to negotiation. To address this, we develop a LLM-based Assistant for Coaching nEgotiation (ACE). ACE not only serves as a negotiation partner for users but also provides them with targeted feedback for improvement. To build our system, we collect a dataset of negotiation transcripts between MBA students. These transcripts come from trained negotiators and emulate realistic bargaining scenarios. We use the dataset, along with expert consultations, to design an annotation scheme for detecting negotiation mistakes. ACE employs this scheme to identify mistakes and provide targeted feedback to users. To test the effectiveness of ACE-generated feedback, we conducted a user experiment with two consecutive trials of negotiation and found that it improves negotiation performances significantly compared to a system that doesn't provide feedback and one which uses an alternative method of providing feedback.</description>

      <title>LightSC: The Making of a Usable Security Classification Tool for DevSecOps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DevSecOps, as the extension of DevOps with security training and tools, has become a popular way of developing modern software, especially in the Internet of Things arena, due to its focus on rapid development, with short release cycles, involving the user/client very closely. Security classification methods, on the other hand, are heavy and slow processes that require high expertise in security, the same as in other similar areas such as risk analysis or certification. As such, security classification methods are hardly compatible with the DevSecOps culture, which to the contrary, has moved away from the traditional style of penetration testing done only when the software product is in the final stages or already deployed.
  In this work, we first propose five principles for a security classification to be \emph{DevOps-ready}, two of which will be the focus for the rest of the paper, namely to be tool-based and easy to use for non-security experts, such as ordinary developers or system architects. We then exemplify how one can make a security classification methodology DevOps-ready. We do this through an interaction design process, where we create and evaluate the usability of a tool implementing the chosen methodology. Since such work seems to be new within the usable security community, and even more so in the software development (DevOps) community, we extract from our process a general, three-steps `recipe' that others can follow when making their own security methodologies DevOps-ready. The tool that we build is in itself a contribution of this process, as it can be independently used, extended, and/or integrated by developer teams into their DevSecOps tool-chains. Our tool is perceived (by the test subjects) as most useful in the design phase, but also during the testing phase where the security class would be one of the metrics used to evaluate the quality of their software.</description>

      <title>"I Want It That Way": Enabling Interactive Decision Support Using Large Language Models and Constraint Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A critical factor in the success of decision support systems is the accurate modeling of user preferences. Psychology research has demonstrated that users often develop their preferences during the elicitation process, highlighting the pivotal role of system-user interaction in developing personalized systems. This paper introduces a novel approach, combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with Constraint Programming to facilitate interactive decision support. We study this hybrid framework through the lens of meeting scheduling, a time-consuming daily activity faced by a multitude of information workers. We conduct three studies to evaluate the novel framework, including a diary study (n=64) to characterize contextual scheduling preferences, a quantitative evaluation of the system's performance, and a user study (n=10) with a prototype system. Our work highlights the potential for a hybrid LLM and optimization approach for iterative preference elicitation and design considerations for building systems that support human-system collaborative decision-making processes.</description>

      <title>Web3 and the State: Indian state's redescription of blockchain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The article closely reads a discussion paper by the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog and a strategy paper by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) advocating non-financial use cases of blockchain in India. By noting the discursive shift from transparency to trust to adjustably transparent enacted in these two documents, and consequently the Indian state's redescription of blockchain, the paper foregrounds how blockchain systems are being designated as "decentral" but have recentralizing effects where the state reinvents and re-establishes itself as an intermediary. The paper illustrates how discursive shifts concerning trust, transparency, (de)centralization and (dis)intermediation are crucial sites for investigating redescriptions of emerging sociotechnical systems.</description>

      <title>In Situ AI Prototyping: Infusing Multimodal Prompts into Mobile Settings with MobileMaker</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03806v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have made it easier to rapidly prototype AI-powered features, especially for mobile use cases. However, gathering early, mobile-situated user feedback on these AI prototypes remains challenging. The broad scope and flexibility of LLMs means that, for a given use-case-specific prototype, there is a crucial need to understand the wide range of in-the-wild input users are likely to provide and their in-context expectations for the AI's behavior. To explore the concept of in situ AI prototyping and testing, we created MobileMaker: a platform that enables designers to rapidly create and test mobile AI prototypes directly on devices. This tool also enables testers to make on-device, in-the-field revisions of prototypes using natural language. In an exploratory study with 16 participants, we explored how user feedback on prototypes created with MobileMaker compares to that of existing prototyping tools (e.g., Figma, prompt editors). Our findings suggest that MobileMaker prototypes enabled more serendipitous discovery of: model input edge cases, discrepancies between AI's and user's in-context interpretation of the task, and contextual signals missed by the AI. Furthermore, we learned that while the ability to make in-the-wild revisions led users to feel more fulfilled as active participants in the design process, it might also constrain their feedback to the subset of changes perceived as more actionable or implementable by the prototyping tool.</description>

      <title>Social Conjuring: Multi-User Runtime Collaboration with AI in Building Virtual 3D Worlds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence has shown promise in prompting virtual worlds into existence, yet little attention has been given to understanding how this process unfolds as social interaction. We present Social Conjurer, a framework for AI-augmented dynamic 3D scene co-creation, where multiple users collaboratively build and modify virtual worlds in real-time. Through an expanded set of interactions, including social and tool-based engagements as well as spatial reasoning, our framework facilitates the creation of rich, diverse virtual environments. Findings from a preliminary user study (N=12) provide insight into the user experience of this approach, how social contexts shape the prompting of spatial environments, and perspective on social applications of prompt-based 3D co-creation. In addition to highlighting the potential of AI-supported multi-user world creation and offering new pathways for AI-augmented creative processes in VR, this article presents a set of implications for designing human-centered interfaces that incorporate AI models into 3D content generation.</description>

      <title>Large Language Models as Zero-Shot Human Models for Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03548v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human models play a crucial role in human-robot interaction (HRI), enabling robots to consider the impact of their actions on people and plan their behavior accordingly. However, crafting good human models is challenging; capturing context-dependent human behavior requires significant prior knowledge and/or large amounts of interaction data, both of which are difficult to obtain. In this work, we explore the potential of large-language models (LLMs) -- which have consumed vast amounts of human-generated text data -- to act as zero-shot human models for HRI. Our experiments on three social datasets yield promising results; the LLMs are able to achieve performance comparable to purpose-built models. That said, we also discuss current limitations, such as sensitivity to prompts and spatial/numerical reasoning mishaps. Based on our findings, we demonstrate how LLM-based human models can be integrated into a social robot's planning process and applied in HRI scenarios. Specifically, we present one case study on a simulated trust-based table-clearing task and replicate past results that relied on custom models. Next, we conduct a new robot utensil-passing experiment (n = 65) where preliminary results show that planning with a LLM-based human model can achieve gains over a basic myopic plan. In summary, our results show that LLMs offer a promising (but incomplete) approach to human modeling for HRI.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen an explosive increase in research on large language models (LLMs), and accompanying public engagement on the topic. While starting as a niche area within natural language processing, LLMs have shown remarkable potential across a broad range of applications and domains, including games. This paper surveys the current state of the art across the various applications of LLMs in and for games, and identifies the different roles LLMs can take within a game. Importantly, we discuss underexplored areas and promising directions for future uses of LLMs in games and we reconcile the potential and limitations of LLMs within the games domain. As the first comprehensive survey and roadmap at the intersection of LLMs and games, we are hopeful that this paper will serve as the basis for groundbreaking research and innovation in this exciting new field.</description>

      <title>WatChat: Explaining perplexing programs by debugging mental models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05334v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Often, a good explanation for a program's unexpected behavior is a bug in the programmer's code. But sometimes, an even better explanation is a bug in the programmer's mental model of the language or API they are using. Instead of merely debugging our current code ("giving the programmer a fish"), what if our tools could directly debug our mental models ("teaching the programmer to fish")? In this paper, we apply recent ideas from computational cognitive science to offer a principled framework for doing exactly that. Given a "why?" question about a program, we automatically infer potential misconceptions about the language/API that might cause the user to be surprised by the program's behavior -- and then analyze those misconceptions to provide explanations of the program's behavior. Our key idea is to formally represent misconceptions as counterfactual (erroneous) semantics for the language/API, which can be inferred and debugged using program synthesis techniques. We demonstrate our framework, WatChat, by building systems for explanation in two domains: JavaScript type coercion, and the Git version control system. We evaluate WatChatJS and WatChatGit by comparing their outputs to experimentally-collected human-written explanations in these two domains: we show that WatChat's explanations exhibit key features of human-written explanation, unlike those of a state-of-the-art language model.</description>

      <title>Cost-Effective Online Multi-LLM Selection with Versatile Reward Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16587v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), the diversity of multi-LLM tasks and the variability in their pricing structures have become increasingly important, as costs can vary greatly between different LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the \textit{C2MAB-V}, a \underline{C}ost-effective \underline{C}ombinatorial \underline{M}ulti-armed \underline{B}andit with \underline{V}ersatile reward models for optimal LLM selection and usage. This online model differs from traditional static approaches or those reliant on a single LLM without cost consideration. With multiple LLMs deployed on a scheduling cloud and a local server dedicated to handling user queries, \textit{C2MAB-V} facilitates the selection of multiple LLMs over a combinatorial search space, specifically tailored for various collaborative task types with different reward models. Based on our designed online feedback mechanism and confidence bound technique, \textit{C2MAB-V} can effectively address the multi-LLM selection challenge by managing the exploration-exploitation trade-off across different models, while also balancing cost and reward for diverse tasks. The NP-hard integer linear programming problem for selecting multiple LLMs with trade-off dilemmas is addressed by: i) decomposing the integer problem into a relaxed form by the local server, ii) utilizing a discretization rounding scheme that provides optimal LLM combinations by the scheduling cloud, and iii) continual online updates based on feedback. Theoretically, we prove that \textit{C2MAB-V} offers strict guarantees over versatile reward models, matching state-of-the-art results for regret and violations in some degenerate cases. Empirically, we show that \textit{C2MAB-V} effectively balances performance and cost-efficiency with nine LLMs for three application scenarios.</description>

      <title>What is lost in Normalization? Exploring Pitfalls in Multilingual ASR Model Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the pitfalls in evaluating multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) models, with a particular focus on Indic language scripts. We investigate the text normalization routine employed by leading ASR models, including OpenAI Whisper, Meta's MMS, Seamless, and Assembly AI's Conformer, and their unintended consequences on performance metrics. Our research reveals that current text normalization practices, while aiming to standardize ASR outputs for fair comparison, by removing inconsistencies such as variations in spelling, punctuation, and special characters, are fundamentally flawed when applied to Indic scripts. Through empirical analysis using text similarity scores and in-depth linguistic examination, we demonstrate that these flaws lead to artificially improved performance metrics for Indic languages. We conclude by proposing a shift towards developing text normalization routines that leverage native linguistic expertise, ensuring more robust and accurate evaluations of multilingual ASR models.</description>

Abstract: Generating user intent from a sequence of user interface (UI) actions is a core challenge in comprehensive UI understanding. Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have led to substantial progress in this area, but their demands for extensive model parameters, computing power, and high latency makes them impractical for scenarios requiring lightweight, on-device solutions with low latency or heightened privacy. Additionally, the lack of high-quality datasets has hindered the development of such lightweight models. To address these challenges, we propose UI-JEPA, a novel framework that employs masking strategies to learn abstract UI embeddings from unlabeled data through self-supervised learning, combined with an LLM decoder fine-tuned for user intent prediction. We also introduce two new UI-grounded multimodal datasets, "Intent in the Wild" (IIW) and "Intent in the Tame" (IIT), designed for few-shot and zero-shot UI understanding tasks. IIW consists of 1.7K videos across 219 intent categories, while IIT contains 914 videos across 10 categories. We establish the first baselines for these datasets, showing that representations learned using a JEPA-style objective, combined with an LLM decoder, can achieve user intent predictions that match the performance of state-of-the-art large MLLMs, but with significantly reduced annotation and deployment resources. Measured by intent similarity scores, UI-JEPA outperforms GPT-4 Turbo and Claude 3.5 Sonnet by 10.0% and 7.2% respectively, averaged across two datasets. Notably, UI-JEPA accomplishes the performance with a 50.5x reduction in computational cost and a 6.6x improvement in latency in the IIW dataset. These results underscore the effectiveness of UI-JEPA, highlighting its potential for lightweight, high-performance UI understanding.</description>

Abstract: Analyzing and finding anomalies in multi-dimensional datasets is a cumbersome but vital task across different domains. In the context of financial fraud detection, analysts must quickly identify suspicious activity among transactional data. This is an iterative process made of complex exploratory tasks such as recognizing patterns, grouping, and comparing. To mitigate the information overload inherent to these steps, we present a tool combining automated information highlights, Large Language Model generated textual insights, and visual analytics, facilitating exploration at different levels of detail. We perform a segmentation of the data per analysis area and visually represent each one, making use of automated visual cues to signal which require more attention. Upon user selection of an area, our system provides textual and graphical summaries. The text, acting as a link between the high-level and detailed views of the chosen segment, allows for a quick understanding of relevant details. A thorough exploration of the data comprising the selection can be done through graphical representations. The feedback gathered in a study performed with seven domain experts suggests our tool effectively supports and guides exploratory analysis, easing the identification of suspicious information.</description>
