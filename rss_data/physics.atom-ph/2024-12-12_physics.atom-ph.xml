      <title>Diffraction patterns in attosecond photoionization time delay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Upon absorbing a photon, the ionized electron sails through the target force field in attoseconds to reach free space. This navigation probes details of the potential landscape that get imprinted into the phase of the ionization amplitude. The Eisenbud-Wigner-Smith (EWS) time delay, the energy derivative of this phase, provides the navigation time relative to the time of the electron's ``free'' exit. This time is influenced by the diffraction of the electron from the potential landscape, offering structural and dynamical information about interactions. If the potential has an intrinsic symmetry, a regular pattern in the time delay, including subpatterns of delays and advances, may occur from the diffraction process. The recent synthesis of a polyhedral fluorocarbon instigates the current study of photoionization from a cubic molecule. Our simulation of the EWS delay unravels rich diffraction motifs within $\pm$100 attoseconds in both energy and angular distributions. Averaging over the Euler angles from the laboratory to the molecular frame and over the photoelectron azimuthal direction indicates that the pattern should be discernible in ultrafast chronoscopy. The study benchmarks diffraction in molecular photoionization as a fundamental process which can be experimentally accessed through ultrafast time delay.</description>

      <title>Inelastic scattering of vortex electrons beyond the Born approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the inelastic scattering of vortex electrons by a hydrogen atom. In our study, special emphasis is placed on the effects of the Coulomb interaction between a projectile electron and a target atom. To understand these effects, we construct vortex electron wave functions both from free space and distorted solutions of the Schr\"odinger equation. These wave functions give rise to the first Born and distorted wave scattering amplitudes, respectively. The derived theory has been employed to investigate the $1s \rightarrow 2p$ transition of a hydrogen atom induced by electrons with the kinetic energies in the range from 20 to 100 eV. The results of the calculations have clearly indicated that the Coulomb interaction can significantly affect the phase pattern and probability density of a vortex electron beam as well as the squared transition amplitudes. For the latter, the most pronounced effect was found for the excitation to the $\ket{2p\, m_f=0}$ sublevel and large scattering angles.</description>

      <title>Determining Absolute Neutrino Mass using Quantum Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Next generation tritium decay experiments to determine the absolute neutrino mass require high-precision measurements of $\beta$-decay electron energies close to the kinematic end point. To achieve this, the development of high phase-space density sources of atomic tritium is required, along with the implementation of methods to control the motion of these atoms to allow extended observation times. A promising approach to efficiently and accurately measure the kinetic energies of individual $\beta$-decay electrons generated in these dilute atomic gases, is to determine the frequency of the cyclotron radiation they emit in a precisely characterised magnetic field. This cyclotron radiation emission spectroscopy (CRES) technique can benefit from recent developments in quantum technologies. Absolute static-field magnetometry and electrometry, which is essential for the precise determination of the electron kinetic energies from the frequency of their emitted cyclotron radiation, can be performed using atoms in superpositions of circular Rydberg states. Quantum-limited microwave amplifiers will allow precise cyclotron frequency measurements to be made with maximal signal-to-noise ratios and minimal observation times. Exploiting the opportunities offered by quantum technologies in these key areas, represents the core activity of the Quantum Technologies for Neutrino Mass (QTNM) project. Its goal is to develop a new experimental apparatus that can enable a determination of the absolute neutrino mass with a sensitivity on the order of 10~meV/$c^2$.</description>

      <title>Limited thermal and spin transport in a dissipative superfluid junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Limited transport occurs in various systems when microscopic details give way to fundamental principles, ranging from quantized conductance for fermions in one dimension to quantum-limited sound and spin diffusivity in strongly interacting Fermi gases. However, limited transport in dissipative open quantum systems is rare due to the lack of many conservation laws. In particular, thermal and spin transport in interacting systems under particle dissipation are largely unexplored. Here we observe dissipation-induced but limited thermal and spin transport through a dissipative one-dimensional junction connecting two superfluids of unitary Fermi gases. The thermal and spin conductances of the superfluid junction increase sharply with particle dissipation and seemingly approach values for a non-dissipative, non-interacting system -- limited due to quantum confinement of the junction. This behavior is independent of the dissipation mechanism, being either spin-dependent or pairwise losses. This work may inform theories on interacting open quantum systems and opens up perspectives for dissipative control of spin and thermoelectric transport.</description>

      <title>Coherent postionization dynamics of molecules based on adiabatic strong-field approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Taking N2 and O2 as examples, we theoretically study the post-ionization dynamics of molecules in strong laser fields using a density matrix method for open systems, focusing on the effect of ionization-produced coherence on the dynamics of residual ions. We introduce the adiabatic strong-field approximation (ASFA) method to predict the coherences between ionic states resulting from multiorbital strong-field ionizations. Compared with the standard SFA, the ASFA method can be applied across a wide range of laser intensities due to the consideration of orbital distortion effects. Based on the ASFA, it is found that there are obvious coherences between ionic states in residual molecular ions. These coherences significantly influence the transitions between ionic states, which finally change the post-ionization dynamics of molecular ions. Our findings reveal the importance of the ionization-produced coherences in modulating post-ionization molecular dynamics.</description>

      <title>Atomic-optical interferometry in fractured loops: a general solution for Rydberg radio frequency receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of novel radio frequency atomic receivers brings attention to the theoretical description of atom-light interactions in sophisticated, multilevel schemes. Of special interest, are the schemes where several interaction paths interfere with each other, bringing about the phase-sensitive measurement of detected radio fields. In the theoretical modeling of those cases, the common assumptions are often insufficient to determine the boundary detection parameters, such as receiving bandwidth or saturation point, critical for practical considerations of atomic sensing technology. This evokes the resurfacing of a long-standing problem on how to describe an atom-light interaction in a fractured loop. In such a case, the quantum steady state is not achieved even with constant, continuous interactions. Here we propose a method for modeling of such a system, basing our approach on the Fourier expansion of a non-equilibrium steady state. The proposed solution is both numerically effective and able to predict edge cases, such as saturation. Furthermore, as an example, we employ this method to provide a complete description of a Rydberg superheterodyne receiver, obtaining the boundary parameters describing the operation of this atomic detector.</description>

      <title>Engineering propagating cat states with driving-assisted cavity QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22423v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a method for generating optical cat states in propagating pulses based on cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). This scheme uses multiple four-level systems (4LSs) inside an optical cavity as an emitter. Time-modulating driving stimulates the emitter to produce a superposition of coherent states entangled with the 4LSs. The postselection of an appropriate state of the 4LSs leads to a multicomponent cat state in a propagating pulse. Taking atomic decay and cavity loss into account, we optimize the cavity external loss rate to maximize the fidelity. We find that its optimum value is formulated similarly to that of other generation methods for propagating states, which suggests a universal property of cavity-QED systems interacting with fields outside the cavity.</description>

      <title>Spin Squeezing with Magnetic Dipoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement can improve the measurement precision of quantum sensors beyond the shot noise limit. Neutral atoms, the basis of some of the most precise and accurate optical clocks and interferometers, do not naturally exhibit all-to-all interactions that are traditionally used to generate such entangled states. Instead, we take advantage of the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction native to most neutral atoms to realize spin-squeezed states. We achieve 7.1 dB of metrologically useful squeezing using the finite-range spin exchange interactions in an erbium quantum gas microscope. We further propose and demonstrate that introducing atomic motion protects the spin sector coherence at low fillings, significantly improving the achievable spin squeezing in a 2D dipolar system. This work's protocol can be implemented with most neutral atoms, opening the door to quantum-enhanced metrology in other itinerant dipolar systems, such as molecules or optical lattice clocks, and serves as a novel method for studying itinerant quantum magnetism with long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Proposal for a Bell Test with Entangled Atoms of Different Mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a Bell test experiment using momentum-entangled atom pairs of different masses, specifically metastable helium isotopes 3He* and 4He*, though the method extends to other atom species. Entanglement is generated via collisions, after which the quantum states are manipulated using two independent atom interferometers, enabling precise phase control over each species. Numerical simulations predict a significant violation of Bell's inequality under realistic conditions. This proposal opens a new paradigm to study the intersection of quantum mechanics and gravity.</description>
