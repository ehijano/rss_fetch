      <title>Products of displaced Laguerre-Gaussian beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a framework for propagating products of displaced Laguerre-Gaussian beams under the free-space paraxial wave equation. Using an optical analogy to quantum coherent states, we express the product as a linear superposition of Laguerre-Gaussian beams, with complex coefficients that encode displacements and mode overlaps. Our formalism enables direct calculation of the net orbital angular momentum and reduces propagation to tracking the evolution of independent weighted modes. These components share a common spherical phase and radial coordinate scaling, while acquiring distinct Gouy phases set by their total modal numbers. By absorbing the Gouy phase into the displacement coefficients, we make the transverse rotational dynamics governed by orbital angular momentum explicit. Our framework supports the engineering of structured light beams from the product of multiple optical vortices for applications that require controlled three-dimensional positioning.</description>

      <title>Spatiotemporal coupled Airy-Airy wavepacket and its propagation dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05805v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Airy beams, celebrated for their self-acceleration, diffraction-free propagation, and self-healing properties, have garnered significant interest in optics and photonics, with applications spanning ultrafast optics, laser processing, nonlinear optics, and optical communications. Recent research primarily aims at independent control of Airy beams in both spatial and spatiotemporal domains. In a pioneering approach, we have successfully generated and controlled a spatiotemporal coupled (STc) Airy-Airy wavepacket, achieving its rotation while preserving vertical distribution in the spatiotemporal domain. Furthermore, we have investigated the self-acceleration and self-healing properties of the STc Airy-Airy wavepacket in this domain, noting that its dynamically adjustable rotation and spatiotemporal coupling capability provide a novel strategy for managing ultrafast lasers, with potential advancements in optical micromanipulation and time-domain coding communication.</description>

      <title>Interferometric measurement of nuclear resonant phase shift with a nanoscale Young double waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05823v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The phase shift of an electromagnetic wave, imprinted by its interaction with atomic scatterers, is a central quantity in optics and photonics. In particular, it encodes information about optical resonances and photon-matter interaction. While being a routine task in the optical regime, interferometric measurements of phase shifts in the x-ray frequency regime are notoriously challenging due to the short wavelengths and associated stability requirements. As a result, the methods demonstrated to date are unsuitable for nanoscopic systems. Here, we demonstrate a nanoscale interferometer, inspired by Young's double-slit experiment, to measure the dispersive phase shift due to the 14.4 keV nuclear resonance of the M\"ossbauer isotope $^{57}$Fe coupled to an x-ray waveguide. From the single-photon interference patterns, we precisely extract the phase shifts in the vicinity of the nuclear resonance resolved in photon energy by using Bayesian inference. We find that the combined information from phase shift and absorbance reveals microscopic coupling parameters, which are not accessible from the intensity data alone. The demonstrated principle lays a basis for integrated x-ray interferometric sensors.</description>

      <title>Ground state exciton-polariton condensation by coherent Floquet driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The on-demand selective population transfer between states in multilevel quantum systems is a challenging problem with implications for a wide-range of physical platforms including photon and exciton-polariton Bose- Einstein condensates (BECs). Here, we introduce an universal strategy for this selective transfer based on a strong time-periodic energy modulation, which is experimentally demonstrated by using a GHz acoustic wave to control the gain and loss of confined modes of an exciton-polariton BEC in a microcavity. The harmonic acoustic field shifts the energy of the excitonic BEC component relative to the photonic ones, which generates a dynamic population transfer within a multimode BEC that can be controlled by the acoustic amplitude. In this way, the full BEC population can be selectively transferred to the ground state to yield a single-level emission consisting of a spectral frequency comb with GHz repetition rates as well as picosecond-scale correlations. A theoretical model reproduces the observed time evolution and reveals a dynamical interplay between bosonic stimulation and the adiabatic Landau-Zener-like population transfer. Our approach provides a new avenue for the Floquet engineering of light-matter systems and enables tunable single- or multi-wavelength ultrafast pulsed laser-like emission for novel information technologies.</description>

      <title>Resource-efficient crosstalk mitigation for the high-fidelity operation of photonic integrated circuits with induced phase shifters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits (PICs) are key platforms for the compact and stable manipulation of classical and quantum light. Imperfections arising from fabrication constraints, tolerances, and operation wavelength limit the accuracy of intended operations on light and impede the practical utility of current PICs. In particular, crosstalk between reconfigurable phase shifters is challenging to characterize due to the large number of parameters to estimate and the difficulty in isolating individual parameters. Previous studies have attempted to model crosstalk solely as an interaction between controlled phase shifters, overlooking the broader scope of this issue. We introduce the concept of induced phase shifter, arising from crosstalk on bare waveguide sections as predicted by simulations, resulting in an exhaustive description and systematic analysis of crosstalk. We characterize induced phase shifters in physical devices using a machine learning-based method and propose a mitigation framework. This framework further allows to establish a criterion certifying that a given interferometer has a sufficient number of degrees of freedom adequately laid out to fully mitigate crosstalk. Our approach is experimentally validated on a 12-mode Clements interferometer. We demonstrate the efficacy of our extended crosstalk model to accurately recover physical crosstalk properties of the PIC and cancel induced phase shifters following our mitigation framework.</description>

      <title>Enhanced interferometric resolution via N-fold intensity-product measurements without sacrificing phase sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fisher information theory sets a fundamental bound on the minimum measurement error achievable from independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) measurement events. The assumption of identical and independent distribution often implies a Gaussian distribution, as seen in classical scenarios like coin tossing and an optical system exhibiting Poisson statistics. In an interferometric optical sensing platform, this translates to a fundamental limit in phase sensitivity, known as the shot-noise limit (SNL), which cannot be surpassed without employing quantum techniques. Here, we, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, experimentally demonstrate a SNL-like feature on resolution of an unknown signal when intensity-product measurement technique is applied to N-divided MZI output subfields. Given the Poisson-distributed photon statistics, the N-divided subfields ensure the i.i.d. condition required by Fisher information theory. Thus, the N-fold intensity-product technique holds promise for enhancing the precision of conventional optical sensing platforms such as a fiber-optic gyroscope and wavelength meter, while preserving the original phase sensitivity of the output field.</description>

      <title>Inverse-designed nanophotonic neural network accelerators for ultra-compact optical computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse-designed nanophotonic devices offer promising solutions for analog optical computation. High-density photonic integration is critical for scaling such architectures toward more complex computational tasks and large-scale applications. Here, we present an inverse-designed photonic neural network (PNN) accelerator on a high-index contrast material platform, enabling ultra-compact and energy-efficient optical computing. Our approach introduces a wave-based inverse-design method based on three dimensional finite-difference time-domain (3D-FDTD) simulations, exploiting the linearity of Maxwell's equations to reconstruct arbitrary spatial fields through optical coherence. By decoupling the forward-pass process into linearly separable simulations, our approach is highly amenable to computational parallelism, making it particularly well suited for acceleration using graphics processing units (GPUs) and other parallel computing platforms, thereby enhancing scalability across large problem domains. We fabricate and experimentally validate two inverse-designed PNN accelerators on the silicon-on-insulator platform, achieving on-chip MNIST and MedNIST classification accuracies of 89% and 90% respectively, within ultra-compact footprints of just 20 $\times$ 20 $\mu$m$^{2}$ and 30 $\times$ 20 $\mu$m$^{2}$. Our results establish a scalable and energy-efficient platform for analog photonic computing, effectively bridging inverse nanophotonic design with high-performance optical information processing.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enabled Astronomical Polarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last decade or so, metasurface optical components have received considerable scientific and industrial interest for a variety of applications. The miniaturization afforded by metasurfaces could benefit astronomy in particular (which is an often-cited potential application area for metasurfaces). However, few developed examples in which metasurface components offer a unique benefit to astronomical instrumentation - substantiated by the production of scientific data - have been shown. Here, we present the Solar Imaging Metasurface Polarimeter (SIMPol), a first-of-its-kind telescope for snapshot imaging polarimetry of the sun around a Sr I line at 460.7 nm enabled by a metasurface polarization-analyzing grating. This high-performance grating exhibits an overall efficiency of nearly 70% and high polarization contrast (diattenuation) across its four observation channels. We demonstrate SIMPol's integration into a major observatory telescope facility with two different imaging modes. In both cases, Zeeman polarization signatures were clearly observed in two adjacent spectral lines of Fe I and Sr I around 460.7 nm. This work demonstrates an early success of metasurface polarization optics in a real application in astronomical instrumentation (here, polarimetric observations of the solar atmosphere), and heralds the application of metasurfaces and emergent nanophotonic technologies in astronomy more broadly.</description>

      <title>Phonon dephasing times determined with time-delayed, broadband CARS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coherent Raman scattering techniques as coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS), offer significant advantages in terms of pixel dwell times and speed as compared to spontaneous Raman scattering for investigations of crystalline materials. However, the spectral information in CARS is often hampered by the presence of a non-resonant contribution to the scattering process that shifts and distorts the Raman peaks. In this work, we apply a method to obtain non-resonant background-free spectra based on time-delayed, broadband CARS (TD-BCARS) using an intra-pulse excitation scheme. In particular, this method can measure the phononic dephasing times across the full phonon spectrum at once. We test the methodology on amorphous SiO2 (glass), which is used to characterize the setup-specific and material-independent response times, and then apply TD-BCARS to the analysis of single crystals of diamond and ferroelectrics of potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) and potassium titanyl arsenate (KTA). For diamond, we determine a dephasing time of t = 7.81 ps for the single sp3 peak.</description>

      <title>Stringent requirements for detecting light-induced gravitational effects using interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intense laser fields have been proposed as a means to generate light-induced gravitational effects, providing a novel approach to investigate gravity and its coupling to electromagnetism in a controlled laboratory setting. In this article, a detection scheme based on interferometry is introduced to assess the feasibility of observing such effects. Initially, the space-time deformation and the resulting induced phase difference are evaluated in homogeneous electric fields. Using the theoretical minimum phase sensitivity bound -- a known result in quantum information -- and accounting for background signal coming from photon-photon scattering -- a fundamental quantum electrodynamics effect related to vacuum properties -- a set of stringent requirements for detectability is obtained. Then, a more realistic scenario is considered where gravitational effects are generated by an e-dipole pulse. In all cases considered, it is demonstrated that observing these effects presents significant challenges, even with the capabilities of current and foreseen laser infrastructures.</description>

      <title>40Gbps Tri-type Quantum Random Number Generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional quantum random number generators can produce only one type of random number, while the optimal distribution of random numbers for different applications is usually distinct. The typical solution to this challenge is either using different quantum phenomena for different types of random number, or converting one distribution of random numbers to another type. However, the former solution requires multiple hardware systems, while the latter one sacrifices a lot of secure bits. Here, we develop a quantum random number generator that can on-demand produce three distribution types of random numbers at over 60 Gbits/s (Gbps) raw bits by measuring the quantum vacuum noise. After randomness extraction, over 42 Gbps secure bit rate is demonstrated for uniform random numbers, and over 14 Gbps secure bit rate for Gaussian random number. Due to the lack of Rayleigh randomness extraction, only denoised Rayleigh raw bits are generated. Switching between different types of random numbers is achieved in electronics, which does not affect the generation rate. The random numbers pass NIST and Dieharder tests, and are available for various applications, which can be continuously accessed via Cisco Quantum Random Number web service.</description>

      <title>Electrically reconfigurable extended lasing state in an organic liquid-crystal microcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Small-footprint, low-power arrays of coupled coherent emitters with the capability of near- and far-field engineering and coherence control are highly sought after to meet modern nanophotonics evolving needs. Between existing solutions based on vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers, phase masks in bulk traditional cavity-based systems, and lattices of exciton-polariton condensates, only the strongly light-matter coupled systems were shown to be capable of controlled on-chip interaction between the individual coherent states while often operating at cryogenic temperatures. Here we demonstrate electrically controlled in-plane interaction between optically reconfigurable spatially separated lasing states, operating at room temperature in the weak light-matter coupling regime. We show spatially extended coherent lasing state or "supermode" with wide-range micro-scale control of near-field, far-field and on-chip phase-locking tuning functionality. An extended lasing state appears due to near-field transverse coupling between distinct spatially pumped lasing states in the plane of an organic liquid crystal-filled microcavity. We realize electrical control over the interaction strength between lasing states and corresponding mutual coherence going beyond nearest neighbours through electrical tuning of the microcavity optical modes with external voltage, and a spin-selective directional coupling regime by using a photonic analogue of the Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit interaction.</description>

      <title>A low-loss telecom-band nanofiber cavity for interfacing Yb atomic qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the fabrication of an optical nanofiber cavity designed for efficient interface with ytterbium (Yb) atoms at telecom-wavelength transitions. Replacing the conventional hydrogen-oxygen flame with a deuterium-oxygen flame in the heat-and-pull method suppresses hydroxyl-induced absorption losses and enables low-loss nanofiber production with minimal modifications to the existing fabrication system. Using this technique, we fabricate a nanofiber cavity at 1389 nm that exhibits an intrinsic round-trip loss of $0.31(2)\%$ and a finesse of $2.0(1)\times 10^{3}$. This performance corresponds to a projected cooperativity of 90 when interfaced with Yb atoms, indicating that the cavity is well suited for efficient atom-photon coupling at telecom wavelength transitions. Our results establish a practical route for developing fiber-integrated atom-photon interfaces in the telecom band, a critical step toward scalable quantum communication and distributed quantum computing.</description>

Abstract: Quantum emitters are a key component in photonic quantum technologies. Enhancing their single-photon emission by engineering the photonic environment using cavities can significantly improve the overall efficiency in quantum information processing. However, this enhancement is often constrained by the need for precise nanoscale control over the emitter's position within micro- or nano-cavities. Inspired by the fascinating physics of moir\'e patterns, we present an approach to strongly modify the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter using a finely designed multilayer moir\'e photonic crystal with a robust isolated-flatband dispersion. Theoretical analysis reveals that, due to its nearly infinite photonic density of states, the moir\'e cavity can simultaneously achieve a high Purcell factor and exhibit large tolerance over the emitter's position. We experimentally demonstrate the coupling between this moir\'e cavity and a quantum dot through the cavity-determined polarization of the dot's emission. The radiative lifetime of the quantum dot can be tuned by a factor of 40, ranging from 42 ps to 1692 ps, which is attributed to strong Purcell enhancement and Purcell inhibition effects. Our findings pave the way for moir\'e flatband cavity-enhanced quantum light sources, quantum optical switches, and quantum nodes for quantum internet applications.</description>

      <title>Exciton--hyperbolic-phonon-polariton Hybridization in Biased Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04796</link>

Abstract: Excitons in biased bilayer graphene are electrically tunable optical excitations residing in the mid-infrared (MIR) spectral range, where intrinsic optical transitions are typically scarce. Such a tunable material system with an excitonic response offer a rare platform for exploring light-matter interactions and optical hybridization of quasiparticles residing in the long wavelength spectrum. In this work, we demonstrate that when the bilayer is encapsulated in hexagonal-boron-nitride (hBN)-a material supporting optical phonons and hyperbolic-phonon-polaritons (HPhPs) in the MIR-the excitons can be tuned into resonance with the HPhP modes. We find that the overlap in energy and momentum of the two MIR quasiparticles facilitate the formation of multiple strongly coupled hybridized exciton-HPhP states. Using an electromagnetic transmission line model, we derive the dispersion relations of the hybridized states and show that they are highly affected and can be manipulated by the symmetry of the system, determining the hybridization selection rules. Our results establish a general tunable MIR platform for engineering strongly coupled quasiparticle states in biased graphene systems, opening new directions for studying and controlling light-matter interactions in the long-wavelength regime.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Non-Rayleigh Speckles Generated from Nonlinear Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically derive an expression for a speckle field's intensity probability density function (PDF) in a nonlinear medium. The analytically driven results are in good agreement with the numerical outcomes. In a focusing nonlinear medium, the local intensity of the speckle is enhanced as manifested through the longer tail of the PDF. In contrast, the local intensity of speckle is reduced in the presence of a defocusing nonlinearity, and the tail of the probability density function also reduces. This change in local intensity of the speckles arises due to the cubic Kerr nonlinearity, which eventually modifies the second-order statistics. Hence, the intensity correlation is altered as per the nature of the associated nonlinearity while the field correlation remains invariant of both types of the nonlinear conditions.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast intrinsic optical-to-electrical conversion dynamics in graphene photodetector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Optical-to-electrical (O-E) conversion in graphene is a central phenomenon for realizing anticipated ultrafast and low-power-consumption information technologies. However, revealing its mechanism and intrinsic time scale require uncharted terahertz (THz) electronics and device architectures. Here, we succeeded in resolving O-E conversion processes in high-quality graphene by on-chip electrical readout of ultrafast photothermoelectric current. By suppressing the RC time constant using a resistive zinc oxide top gate, we constructed a gate-tunable graphene photodetector with a bandwidth of up to 220 GHz. By measuring nonlocal photocurrent dynamics, we found that the photocurrent extraction from the electrode is instantaneous without a measurable carrier transit time across several-micrometer-long graphene, following the Shockley-Ramo theorem. The time for photocurrent generation is exceptionally tunable from immediate to &gt; 4 ps, and its origin is identified as Fermi-level-dependent intraband carrier-carrier scattering. Our results bridge the gap between ultrafast optical science and device engineering, accelerating ultrafast graphene optoelectronic applications.</description>

      <title>On-chip transfer of ultrashort graphene plasmon wavepackets using terahertz electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Steering transport of ultrashort polariton wavepackets is essential for achieving on-chip integrated nanocircuits with tightly confined electromagnetic fields towards ultrafast information processing. However, conventional optical techniques have struggled to integrate the necessary components for transferring polariton signals. Here, we address this challenge by electrically generating, manipulating, and reading out terahertz graphene plasmon-polariton wavepackets on-chip. By injecting an electrical pulse into graphene via an ohmic contact, we achieve coherent conversion of the pulse into a plasmon wavepacket exhibiting a pulse duration of 1.2 ps and extreme three-dimensional spatial confinement within a volume of $2.1 \times 10^{-18} m^3$. We reveal the transport properties of plasmons along graphene ribbons in different dielectric environments, providing a basis for designing graphene plasmonic circuits. Furthermore, we find that the conversion efficiency between the electrical pulses and plasmon wavepackets reaches ~30% thanks to the absence of a momentum mismatch. With unprecedented controllability, our platform represents a significant advance in on-chip handling of plasmonic signals in various van der Waals heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Optical Properties of Biological Structures using Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>
