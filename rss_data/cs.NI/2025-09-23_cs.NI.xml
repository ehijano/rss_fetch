      <title>5GC-Bench: A Framework for Stress-Testing and Benchmarking 5G Core VNFs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The disaggregated, cloud-native design of the 5G Core (5GC) enables flexibility and scalability but introduces significant challenges. Control-plane procedures involve complex interactions across multiple Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), while the user plane must sustain diverse and resource-intensive traffic. Existing tools often benchmark these dimensions in isolation, rely on synthetic workloads, or lack visibility into fine-grained resource usage. This paper presents 5GC-Bench, a modular framework for stress-testing the 5GC under realistic workloads. 5GC-Bench jointly emulates signaling and service traffic, supporting both VNF profiling and end-to-end service-chain analysis. By characterizing bottlenecks and resource demands, it provides actionable insights for capacity planning and performance optimization. We integrated 5GC-Bench with the OpenAirInterface (OAI) 5GC and deployed it on a real 5G testbed, demonstrating its ability to uncover resource constraints and expose cross-VNF dependencies under scenarios that mirror operational 5G deployments. To foster reproducibility and further research, we release publicly all the artifacts.</description>

      <title>Using Age of Information for Throughput Optimal Spectrum Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a spectrum sharing problem where two users attempt to communicate over N channels. The Primary User (PU) has prioritized transmissions and its occupancy on each channel over time can be modeled as a Markov chain. The Secondary User (SU) needs to determine which channels are free at each time-slot and attempt opportunistic transmissions. The goal of the SU is to maximize its own throughput, while simultaneously minimizing collisions with the PU, and satisfying spectrum access constraints. To solve this problem, we first decouple the multiple-channel problem into N single-channel problems. For each decoupled problem, we prove that there exists an optimal threshold policy that depends on the last observed PU occupancy and the freshness of this occupancy information. Second, we establish the indexability of the decoupled problems by analyzing the structure of the optimal threshold policy. Using this structure, we derive a Whittle index-based scheduling policy that allocates SU transmissions using the Age of Information (AoI) of accessed channels. We also extend our insights to PU occupancy models that are correlated across channels and incorporate learning of unknown Markov transition matrices into our policies. Finally, we provide detailed numerical simulations that demonstrate the performance gains of our approach.</description>

      <title>Whack-a-Mole: Deterministic Packet Spraying Across Multiple Network Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Whack-a-Mole, a deterministic packet spraying algorithm for distributing packets across multiple network paths with provably tight discrepancy bounds. The algorithm is motivated by large-scale distributed AI/ML training and inference workloads, where collective completion time (CCT) and effective training time ratio (ETTR) are highly sensitive to tail latency and transport imbalance. Whack-a-Mole represents the path profile as a discrete allocation of $m$ selection units across $n$ paths and uses a bit-reversal counter to choose a path for each packet. We prove that the discrepancy between expected and actual packet counts per path is bounded by $O(\log m)$ over any contiguous packet sequence. The algorithm responds quickly to congestion feedback by reducing allocations to degraded paths and redistributing load to healthier ones. This combination of deterministic distribution, low per-packet overhead, and compatibility with erasure-coded transport makes Whack-a-Mole an effective building block for multipath transport protocols that aim to minimize CCT and maximize GPU utilization.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Network Slice Placement with Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular networks are increasingly realized through software-based entities, with core functions deployed as Virtual Network Functions (VNFs) on Commercial-off-the-Shelf (COTS) hardware. Network slicing has emerged as a key enabler of 5G by providing logically isolated Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for diverse applications. With the adoption of cloud-native infrastructures, the placement of network slices across heterogeneous multi-cloud environments poses new challenges due to variable resource capabilities and slice-specific requirements. This paper introduces a modular framework for autonomous and near-optimal VNF placement based on a disaggregated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach. The framework incorporates real traffic profiles to estimate slice resource demands and employs a MARL-based scheduler to minimize deployment cost while meeting QoS constraints. Experimental evaluation on a multi-cloud testbed shows a 19x speed-up compared to combinatorial optimization, with deployment costs within 7.8% of the optimal. While the method incurs up to 2.42x more QoS violations under high load, the trade-off provides significantly faster decision-making and reduced computational complexity. These results suggest that MARL-based approaches offer a scalable and cost-efficient solution for real-time network slice placement in heterogeneous infrastructures.</description>

      <title>Online Learning for Optimizing AoI-Energy Tradeoff under Unknown Channel Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a real-time monitoring system where a source node (with energy limitations) aims to keep the information status at a destination node as fresh as possible by scheduling status update transmissions over a set of channels. The freshness of information at the destination node is measured in terms of the Age of Information (AoI) metric. In this setting, a natural tradeoff exists between the transmission cost (or equivalently, energy consumption) of the source and the achievable AoI performance at the destination. This tradeoff has been optimized in the existing literature under the assumption of having a complete knowledge of the channel statistics. In this work, we develop online learning-based algorithms with finite-time guarantees that optimize this tradeoff in the practical scenario where the channel statistics are unknown to the scheduler. In particular, when the channel statistics are known, the optimal scheduling policy is first proven to have a threshold-based structure with respect to the value of AoI (i.e., it is optimal to drop updates when the AoI value is below some threshold). This key insight was then utilized to develop the proposed learning algorithms that surprisingly achieve an order-optimal regret (i.e., $O(1)$) with respect to the time horizon length.</description>

      <title>Accurate and Efficient Prediction of Wi-Fi Link Quality Based on Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless communications are characterized by their unpredictability, posing challenges for maintaining consistent communication quality. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of various prediction models, with a focus on achieving accurate and efficient Wi-Fi link quality forecasts using machine learning techniques. Specifically, the paper evaluates the performance of data-driven models based on the linear combination of exponential moving averages, which are designed for low-complexity implementations and are then suitable for hardware platforms with limited processing resources. Accuracy of the proposed approaches was assessed using experimental data from a real-world Wi-Fi testbed, considering both channel-dependent and channel-independent training data. Remarkably, channel-independent models, which allow for generalized training by equipment manufacturers, demonstrated competitive performance. Overall, this study provides insights into the practical deployment of machine learning-based prediction models for enhancing Wi-Fi dependability in industrial environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Internet Quality Barometer (IQB), a framework aiming to redefine Internet quality beyond ``speed''. IQB (i) defines Internet quality in a user-centric way by considering popular use cases, (ii) maps network requirements to use cases through a set of weights and quality thresholds, and (iii) leverages publicly available Internet performance datasets, to calculate the IQB score, a composite metric that reflects the quality of Internet experience.</description>

      <title>Optimal Service Mode Assignment in a Simple Computation Offloading System: Extended Version</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a simple computation offloading model where jobs can either be fully processed in the cloud or be partially processed at a local server before being sent to the cloud to complete processing. Our goal is to design a policy for assigning jobs to service modes, i.e., full offloading or partial offloading, based on the state of the system, in order to minimize delay in the system. We show that when the cloud server is idle, the optimal policy is to assign the next job in the system queue to the cloud for processing. However, when the cloud server is busy, we show that, under mild assumptions, the optimal policy is of a threshold type, that sends the next job in the system queue to the local server if the queue exceeds a certain threshold. Finally, we demonstrate this policy structure through simulations.</description>

      <title>Intra-DP: A High Performance Collaborative Inference System for Mobile Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained mobile devices presents significant challenges, particularly in achieving real-time performance while simultaneously coping with limited computational resources and battery life. While Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) offers collaborative inference with GPU servers as a promising solution, existing approaches primarily rely on layer-wise model partitioning and undergo significant transmission bottlenecks caused by the sequential execution of DNN operations. To address this challenge, we present Intra-DP, a high-performance collaborative inference system optimized for DNN inference on MEC. Intra DP employs a novel parallel computing technique based on local operators (i.e., operators whose minimum unit input is not the entire input tensor, such as the convolution kernel). By decomposing their computations (operations) into several independent sub-operations and overlapping the computation and transmission of different sub-operations through parallel execution, Intra-DP mitigates transmission bottlenecks in MEC, achieving fast and energy-efficient inference. The evaluation demonstrates that Intra-DP reduces per-inference latency by up to 50% and energy consumption by up to 75% compared to state-of-the-art baselines, without sacrificing accuracy.</description>

      <title>Drift Plus Optimistic Penalty - A Learning Framework for Stochastic Network Optimization with Improved Regret Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03762v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of joint routing and scheduling in queueing networks, where the edge transmission costs are unknown. At each time-slot, the network controller receives noisy observations of transmission costs only for those edges it selects for transmission. The network controller's objective is to make routing and scheduling decisions so that the total expected cost is minimized. This problem exhibits an exploration-exploitation trade-off, however, previous bandit-style solutions cannot be directly applied to this problem due to the queueing dynamics. In order to ensure network stability, the network controller needs to optimize throughput and cost simultaneously. We show that the best achievable cost is lower bounded by the solution to a static optimization problem, and develop a network control policy using techniques from Lyapunov drift-plus-penalty optimization and multi-arm bandits. We show that the policy achieves a sub-linear regret of order $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$, as compared to the best policy that has complete knowledge of arrivals and costs. Finally, we evaluate the proposed policy using simulations and show that its regret is indeed sub-linear.</description>

      <title>Agentic DDQN-Based Scheduling for Licensed and Unlicensed Band Allocation in Sidelink Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06775v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an agentic double deep Q-network (DDQN) scheduler for licensed/unlicensed band allocation in New Radio (NR) sidelink (SL) networks. Beyond conventional reward-seeking reinforcement learning (RL), the agent perceives and reasons over a multi-dimensional context that jointly captures queueing delay, link quality, coexistence intensity, and switching stability. A capacity-aware, quality of service (QoS)-constrained reward aligns the agent with goal-oriented scheduling rather than static thresholding. Under constrained bandwidth, the proposed design reduces blocking by up to 87.5% versus threshold policies while preserving throughput, highlighting the value of context-driven decisions in coexistence-limited NR SL networks. The proposed scheduler is an embodied agent (E-agent) tailored for task-specific, resource-efficient operation at the network edge.</description>
