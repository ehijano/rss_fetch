      <title>Online Safety for All: Sociocultural Insights from a Systematic Review of Youth Online Safety in the Global South</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20308v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Youth online safety research in HCI has historically centered on perspectives from the Global North, often overlooking the unique particularities and cultural contexts of regions in the Global South. This paper presents a systematic review of 66 youth online safety studies published between 2014 and 2024, specifically focusing on regions in the Global South. Our findings reveal a concentrated research focus in Asian countries and predominance of quantitative methods. We also found limited research on marginalized youth populations and a primary focus on risks related to cyberbullying. Our analysis underscores the critical role of cultural factors in shaping online safety, highlighting the need for educational approaches that integrate social dynamics and awareness. We propose methodological recommendations and a future research agenda that encourages the adoption of situated, culturally sensitive methodologies and youth-centered approaches to researching youth online safety regions in the Global South. This paper advocates for greater inclusivity in youth online safety research, emphasizing the importance of addressing varied sociocultural contexts to better understand and meet the online safety needs of youth in the Global South.</description>

      <title>"I've talked to ChatGPT about my issues last night.": Examining Mental Health Conversations with Large Language Models through Reddit Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of large language models (LLMs) in supporting mental health by analyzing Reddit posts and comments about mental health conversations with ChatGPT. Our findings reveal that users value ChatGPT as a safe, non-judgmental space, often favoring it over human support due to its accessibility, availability, and knowledgeable responses. ChatGPT provides a range of support, including actionable advice, emotional support, and validation, while helping users better understand their mental states. Additionally, we found that ChatGPT offers innovative support for individuals facing mental health challenges, such as assistance in navigating difficult conversations, preparing for therapy sessions, and exploring therapeutic interventions. However, users also voiced potential risks, including the spread of incorrect health advice, ChatGPT's overly validating nature, and privacy concerns. We discuss the implications of LLMs as tools for mental health support in both everyday health and clinical therapy settings and suggest strategies to mitigate risks in LLM-powered interactions.</description>

      <title>Narrative-Centered Emotional Reflection: Scaffolding Autonomous Emotional Literacy with AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reflexion is an AI-powered platform designed to enable structured emotional self-reflection at scale. By integrating real-time emotion detection, layered reflective prompting, and metaphorical storytelling generation, Reflexion empowers users to engage in autonomous emotional exploration beyond basic sentiment categorization. Grounded in theories of expressive writing, cognitive restructuring, self-determination, and critical consciousness development, the system scaffolds a progressive journey from surface-level emotional recognition toward value-aligned action planning. Initial pilot studies with diverse participants demonstrate positive outcomes in emotional articulation, cognitive reframing, and perceived psychological resilience. Reflexion represents a promising direction for scalable, theory-informed affective computing interventions aimed at fostering emotional literacy and psychological growth across educational, therapeutic, and public health contexts.</description>

      <title>Thoughtful, Confused, or Untrustworthy: How Text Presentation Influences Perceptions of AI Writing Tools</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AI writing tools have been shown to dramatically change the way people write, yet the effects of AI text presentation are not well understood nor always intentionally designed. Although text presentation in existing large language model interfaces is linked to the speed of the underlying model, text presentation speed can impact perceptions of AI systems, potentially influencing whether AI suggestions are accepted or rejected. In this paper, we analyze the effects of varying text generation speed in creative and professional writing scenarios on an online platform (n=297). We find that speed is correlated with perceived humanness and trustworthiness of the AI tool, as well as the perceived quality of the generated text. We discuss its implications on creative and writing processes, along with future steps in the intentional design of AI writing tool interfaces.</description>

      <title>Perception-aware Sampling for Scatterplot Visualizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visualizing data is often a crucial first step in data analytics workflows, but growing data sizes pose challenges due to computational and visual perception limitations. As a result, data analysts commonly down-sample their data and work with subsets. Deriving representative samples, however, remains a challenge. This paper focuses on scatterplots, a widely-used visualization type, and introduces a novel sampling objective -- perception-awareness -- aiming to improve sample efficacy by targeting humans' perception of a visualization.
  We make the following contributions: (1) We propose perception-augmented databases and design PAwS: a novel perception-aware sampling method for scatterplots that leverages saliency maps -- a computer vision tool for predicting areas of attention focus in visualizations -- and models perception-awareness via saliency, density, and coverage objectives. (2) We design ApproPAwS: a fast, perception-aware method for approximate visualizations, which exploits the fact that small visual perturbations are often imperceptible to humans. (3) We introduce the concept of perceptual similarity as a metric for sample quality, and present a novel method that compares saliency maps to measure it. (4) Our extensive experimental evaluation shows that our methods consistently outperform prior art in producing samples with high perceptual similarity, while ApproPAwS achieves up to 100x speed-ups with minimal loss in visual fidelity. Our user study shows that PAwS is often preferred by humans, validating our quantitative findings.</description>

      <title>Explanation format does not matter; but explanations do - An Eggsbert study on explaining Bayesian Optimisation tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a family of methods for finding optimal parameters when the underlying function to be optimised is unknown. BO is used, for example, for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning and as an expert support tool for tuning cyberphysical systems. For settings where humans are involved in the tuning task, methods have been developed to explain BO (Explainable Bayesian Optimization, XBO). However, there is little guidance on how to present XBO results to humans so that they can tune the system effectively and efficiently. In this paper, we investigate how the XBO explanation format affects users' task performance, task load, understanding and trust in XBO. We chose a task that is accessible to a wide range of users. Specifically, we set up an egg cooking scenario with 6 parameters that participants had to adjust to achieve a perfect soft-boiled egg. We compared three different explanation formats: a bar chart, a list of rules and a textual explanation in a between-subjects online study with 213 participants. Our results show that adding any type of explanation increases task success, reduces the number of trials needed to achieve success, and improves comprehension and confidence. While explanations add more information for participants to process, we found no increase in user task load. We also found that the aforementioned results were independent of the explanation format; all formats had a similar effect.This is an interesting finding for practical applications, as it suggests that explanations can be added to BO tuning tasks without the burden of designing or selecting specific explanation formats. In the future, it would be interesting to investigate scenarios of prolonged use of the explanation formats and whether they have different effects on users' mental models of the underlying system.</description>

      <title>In defence of post-hoc explanations in medical AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20741v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the early days of the Explainable AI movement, post-hoc explanations have been praised for their potential to improve user understanding, promote trust, and reduce patient safety risks in black box medical AI systems. Recently, however, critics have argued that the benefits of post-hoc explanations are greatly exaggerated since they merely approximate, rather than replicate, the actual reasoning processes that black box systems take to arrive at their outputs. In this article, we aim to defend the value of post-hoc explanations against this recent critique. We argue that even if post-hoc explanations do not replicate the exact reasoning processes of black box systems, they can still improve users' functional understanding of black box systems, increase the accuracy of clinician-AI teams, and assist clinicians in justifying their AI-informed decisions. While post-hoc explanations are not a "silver bullet" solution to the black box problem in medical AI, we conclude that they remain a useful strategy for addressing the black box problem in medical AI.</description>

      <title>Integrating Human Feedback into a Reinforcement Learning-Based Framework for Adaptive User Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Adaptive User Interfaces (AUI) play a crucial role in modern software applications by dynamically adjusting interface elements to accommodate users' diverse and evolving needs. However, existing adaptation strategies often lack real-time responsiveness. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for addressing complex, sequential adaptation challenges, enabling adaptive systems to learn optimal policies based on previous adaptation experiences. Although RL has been applied to AUIs,integrating RL agents effectively within user interactions remains a challenge.
  In this paper, we enhance a RL-based Adaptive User Interface adaption framework by incorporating personalized human feedback directly into the leaning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on a single pre-trained RL model, our approach trains a unique RL agent for each user, allowing individuals to actively shape their personal RL agent's policy, potentially leading to more personalized and responsive UI adaptations. To evaluate this approach, we conducted an empirical study to assess the impact of integrating human feedback into the RL-based Adaptive User Interface adaption framework and its effect on User Experience (UX). The study involved 33 participants interacting with AUIs incorporating human feedback and non-adaptive user interfaces in two domains: an e-learning platform and a trip-planning application. The results suggest that incorporating human feedback into RL-driven adaptations significantly enhances UX, offering promising directions for advancing adaptive capabilities and user-centered design in AUIs.</description>

      <title>Effect of Avatar Head Movement on Communication Behaviour, Experience of Presence and Conversation Success in Triadic Conversations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactive communication in virtual reality can be used in experimental paradigms to increase the ecological validity of hearing device evaluations. This requires the virtual environment to elicit natural communication behaviour in listeners. This study evaluates the effect of virtual animated characters' head movements on participants' communication behaviour and experience.
  Triadic conversations were conducted between a test participant and two confederates. To facilitate the manipulation of head movements, the conversation was conducted in telepresence using a system that transmitted audio, head movement data and video with low delay. The confederates were represented by virtual animated characters (avatars) with different levels of animation: Static heads, automated head movement animations based on speech level onsets, and animated head movements based on the transmitted head movements of the interlocutors. A condition was also included in which the videos of the interlocutors' heads were embedded in the visual scene.
  The results show significant effects of animation level on the participants' speech and head movement behaviour as recorded by physical sensors, as well as on the subjective sense of presence and the success of the conversation. The largest effects were found for the range of head orientation during speech and the perceived realism of avatars. Participants reported that they were spoken to in a more helpful way when the avatars showed head movements transmitted from the interlocutors than when the avatars' heads were static.
  We therefore conclude that the representation of interlocutors must include sufficiently realistic head movements in order to elicit natural communication behaviour.</description>

      <title>Mapping a Movement: Exploring a Proposed Police Training Facility in Atlanta and the Stop Cop City Movement through Online Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2021, the City of Atlanta and Atlanta Police Foundation launched plans to build a large police training facility in the South River Forest in unincorporated DeKalb County, GA. Residents of Atlanta and DeKalb County, environmental activists, police and prison abolitionists, and other activists and concerned individuals formed the movement in opposition to the facility, known as the Stop Cop City / Defend the Atlanta Forest movement. Social media and digital maps became common tools for communicating information about the facility and the movement. Here, we examine online maps about the facility and the opposition movement, originating from grassroots organizations, the City of Atlanta, news media outlets, the Atlanta Police Foundation, and individuals. We gather and examine 32 publicly available maps collected through the Google Search API, Twitter (now X), Instagram and reddit. Using a framework of critical cartography, we conduct a content analysis of these maps to identify the mapping technologies and techniques (data, cartographic elements, styles) used by different stakeholders and roles that maps and mapping technologies can play in social movements. We examine the extent to which these maps provide data to confirm or contradict concerns raised by grassroots organizations and local residents about the facility. We find that stakeholders and mapmakers use geospatial tools in different ways and likely have varied access to mapping technologies. We argue that documenting the use of maps to communicate information about a contentious project can help enumerate community positions and perspectives, and we advocate for accessible mapmaking tools. We conclude by discussing the implications of accessibility of mapping technology and posting maps to social media, and share example map images that extend the geographic information systems (GIS) techniques seen in the retrieved maps.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Wayfinding Assistant for Blind and Low-Vision Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Navigating unfamiliar places continues to be one of the most persistent and essential everyday obstacles for those who are blind or have limited vision (BLV). Existing assistive technologies, such as GPS-based navigation systems, AI-powered smart glasses, and sonar-equipped canes, often face limitations in real-time obstacle avoidance, precise localization, and adaptability to dynamic surroundings. To investigate potential solutions, we introduced PathFinder, a novel map-less navigation system that explores different models for understanding 2D images, including Vision Language Models (VLMs), Large Language Models (LLMs), and employs monocular depth estimation for free-path detection. Our approach integrates a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm on depth images to determine the longest obstacle-free path, ensuring optimal route selection while maintaining computational efficiency. We conducted comparative evaluations against existing AI-powered navigation methods and performed a usability study with BLV participants. The results demonstrate that PathFinder achieves a favorable balance between accuracy, computational efficiency, and real-time responsiveness. Notably, it reduces mean absolute error (MAE) and improves decision-making speed in outdoor navigation compared to AI-based alternatives. Participant feedback emphasizes the system's usability and effectiveness in outside situations, but also identifies issues in complicated indoor locations and low-light conditions. Usability testing revealed that 73% of participants understood how to use the app in about a minute, and 80% praised its balance of accuracy, quick response, and overall convenience.</description>

      <title>Refiner: Restructure Retrieval Content Efficiently to Advance Question-Answering Capabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11357v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are limited by their parametric knowledge, leading to hallucinations in knowledge-extensive tasks. To address this, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) incorporates external document chunks to expand LLM knowledge. Furthermore, compressing information from document chunks through extraction or summarization can improve LLM performance. Nonetheless, LLMs still struggle to notice and utilize scattered key information, a problem known as the "lost-in-the-middle" syndrome. Therefore, we typically need to restructure the content for LLM to recognize the key information. We propose $\textit{Refiner}$, an end-to-end extract-and-restructure paradigm that operates in the post-retrieval process of RAG. $\textit{Refiner}$ leverages a single decoder-only LLM to adaptively extract query-relevant contents verbatim along with the necessary context, and section them based on their interconnectedness, thereby highlights information distinction, and aligns downstream LLMs with the original context effectively. Experiments show that a trained $\textit{Refiner}$ (with 7B parameters) exhibits significant gain to downstream LLM in improving answer accuracy, and outperforms other state-of-the-art advanced RAG and concurrent compressing approaches in various single-hop and multi-hop QA tasks. Notably, $\textit{Refiner}$ achieves a 80.5% tokens reduction and a 1.6-7.0% improvement margin in multi-hop tasks compared to the next best solution. $\textit{Refiner}$ is a plug-and-play solution that can be seamlessly integrated with RAG systems, facilitating its application across diverse open-source frameworks.</description>

      <title>MATCHA: Can Multi-Agent Collaboration Build a Trustworthy Conversational Recommender?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-agent collaboration framework called MATCHA for conversational recommendation system, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enhance personalization and user engagement. Users can request recommendations via free-form text and receive curated lists aligned with their interests, preferences, and constraints. Our system introduces specialized agents for intent analysis, candidate generation, ranking, re-ranking, explainability, and safeguards. These agents collaboratively improve recommendations accuracy, diversity, and safety. On eight metrics, our model achieves superior or comparable performance to the current state-of-the-art. Through comparisons with six baseline models, our approach addresses key challenges in conversational recommendation systems for game recommendations, including: (1) handling complex, user-specific requests, (2) enhancing personalization through multi-agent collaboration, (3) empirical evaluation and deployment, and (4) ensuring safe and trustworthy interactions.</description>

      <title>TreeHop: Generate and Filter Next Query Embeddings Efficiently for Multi-hop Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems face significant challenges in multi-hop question answering (MHQA), where complex queries require synthesizing information across multiple document chunks. Existing approaches typically rely on iterative LLM-based query rewriting and routing, resulting in high computational costs due to repeated LLM invocations and multi-stage processes. To address these limitations, we propose TreeHop, an embedding-level framework without the need for LLMs in query refinement. TreeHop dynamically updates query embeddings by fusing semantic information from prior queries and retrieved documents, enabling iterative retrieval through embedding-space operations alone. This method replaces the traditional "Retrieve-Rewrite-Vectorize-Retrieve" cycle with a streamlined "Retrieve-Embed-Retrieve" loop, significantly reducing computational overhead. Moreover, a rule-based stop criterion is introduced to further prune redundant retrievals, balancing efficiency and recall rate. Experimental results show that TreeHop rivals advanced RAG methods across three open-domain MHQA datasets, achieving comparable performance with only 5\%-0.4\% of the model parameter size and reducing the query latency by approximately 99\% compared to concurrent approaches. This makes TreeHop a faster and more cost-effective solution for deployment in a range of knowledge-intensive applications. For reproducibility purposes, codes and data are available here: https://github.com/allen-li1231/TreeHop.</description>

      <title>Prompting LLMs for Code Editing: Struggles and Remedies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20196v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming software engineering, with coding assistants embedded in an IDE becoming increasingly prevalent. While research has focused on improving the tools and understanding developer perceptions, a critical gap exists in understanding how developers actually use these tools in their daily workflows, and, crucially, where they struggle. This paper addresses part of this gap through a multi-phased investigation of developer interactions with an LLM-powered code editing and transformation feature, Transform Code, in an IDE widely used at Google. First, we analyze telemetry logs of the feature usage, revealing that frequent re-prompting can be an indicator of developer struggles with using Transform Code. Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis of unsatisfactory requests, identifying five key categories of information often missing from developer prompts. Finally, based on these findings, we propose and evaluate a tool, AutoPrompter, for automatically improving prompts by inferring missing information from the surrounding code context, leading to a 27% improvement in edit correctness on our test set.</description>

      <title>Exploring AI-powered Digital Innovations from A Transnational Governance Perspective: Implications for Market Acceptance and Digital Accountability Accountability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to AI-powered digital innovations within a transnational governance framework. By integrating Latourian actor-network theory (ANT), this study examines how institutional motivations, regulatory compliance, and ethical and cultural acceptance drive organisations to develop and adopt AI innovations, enhancing their market acceptance and transnational accountability. We extend the TAM framework by incorporating regulatory, ethical, and socio-technical considerations as key social pressures shaping AI adoption. Recognizing that AI is embedded within complex actor-networks, we argue that accountability is co-constructed among organisations, regulators, and societal actors rather than being confined to individual developers or adopters. To address these challenges, we propose two key solutions: (1) internal resource reconfiguration, where organisations restructure their governance and compliance mechanisms to align with global standards; and (2) reshaping organisational boundaries through actor-network management, fostering engagement with external stakeholders, regulatory bodies, and transnational governance institutions. These approaches allow organisations to enhance AI accountability, foster ethical and regulatory alignment, and improve market acceptance on a global scale.</description>

      <title>mrCAD: Multimodal Refinement of Computer-aided Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A key feature of human collaboration is the ability to iteratively refine the concepts we have communicated. In contrast, while generative AI excels at the \textit{generation} of content, it often struggles to make specific language-guided \textit{modifications} of its prior outputs. To bridge the gap between how humans and machines perform edits, we present mrCAD, a dataset of multimodal instructions in a communication game. In each game, players created computer aided designs (CADs) and refined them over several rounds to match specific target designs. Only one player, the Designer, could see the target, and they must instruct the other player, the Maker, using text, drawing, or a combination of modalities. mrCAD consists of 6,082 communication games, 15,163 instruction-execution rounds, played between 1,092 pairs of human players. We analyze the dataset and find that generation and refinement instructions differ in their composition of drawing and text. Using the mrCAD task as a benchmark, we find that state-of-the-art VLMs are better at following generation instructions than refinement instructions. These results lay a foundation for analyzing and modeling a multimodal language of refinement that is not represented in previous datasets.</description>

      <title>AI in Software Engineering: Perceived Roles and Their Impact on Adoption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates how developers conceptualize AI-powered Development Tools and how these role attributions influence technology acceptance. Through qualitative analysis of 38 interviews and a quantitative survey with 102 participants, we identify two primary Mental Models: AI as an inanimate tool and AI as a human-like teammate. Factor analysis further groups AI roles into Support Roles (e.g., assistant, reference guide) and Expert Roles (e.g., advisor, problem solver). We find that assigning multiple roles to AI correlates positively with Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use, indicating that diverse conceptualizations enhance AI adoption. These insights suggest that AI4SE tools should accommodate varying user expectations through adaptive design strategies that align with different Mental Models.</description>

      <title>A Picture is Worth a Thousand Prompts? Efficacy of Iterative Human-Driven Prompt Refinement in Image Regeneration Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With AI-generated content becoming ubiquitous across the web, social media, and other digital platforms, it is vital to examine how such content are inspired and generated. The creation of AI-generated images often involves refining the input prompt iteratively to achieve desired visual outcomes. This study focuses on the relatively underexplored concept of image regeneration using AI, in which a human operator attempts to closely recreate a specific target image by iteratively refining their prompt. Image regeneration is distinct from normal image generation, which lacks any predefined visual reference. A separate challenge lies in determining whether existing image similarity metrics (ISMs) can provide reliable, objective feedback in iterative workflows, given that we do not fully understand if subjective human judgments of similarity align with these metrics. Consequently, we must first validate their alignment with human perception before assessing their potential as a feedback mechanism in the iterative prompt refinement process. To address these research gaps, we present a structured user study evaluating how iterative prompt refinement affects the similarity of regenerated images relative to their targets, while also examining whether ISMs capture the same improvements perceived by human observers. Our findings suggest that incremental prompt adjustments substantially improve alignment, verified through both subjective evaluations and quantitative measures, underscoring the broader potential of iterative workflows to enhance generative AI content creation across various application domains.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional precipitation index prediction based on CNN-LSTM hybrid framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of weather indicators is of great significance in disaster prevention and mitigation, agricultural production, and transportation. Precipitation, as one of the key meteorological indicators, plays a crucial role in water resource management, agricultural production, and urban flood control. This study proposes a multidimensional precipitation index prediction model based on a CNN- LSTM hybrid framework, aiming to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts. The dataset is sourced from Pune, Maharashtra, India, covering monthly mean precipitation data from 1972 to 2002. This dataset includes nearly 31 years (1972-2002) of monthly average precipitation, reflecting the long-term fluctuations and seasonal variations of precipitation in the region. By analyzing these time series data, the CNN-LSTM model effectively captures local features and long-term dependencies. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 6.752, which demonstrates a significant advantage over traditional time series prediction methods in terms of prediction accuracy and generalization ability. Furthermore, this study provides new research ideas for precipitation prediction. However, the model requires high computational resources when dealing with large-scale datasets, and its predictive ability for multidimensional precipitation data still needs improvement. Future research could extend the model to support and predict multidimensional precipitation data, thereby promoting the development of more accurate and efficient meteorological prediction technologies.</description>

      <title>Conversations with AI Chatbots Increase Short-Term Vaccine Intentions But Do Not Outperform Standard Public Health Messaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based chatbots show promise in persuasive communication, but existing studies often rely on weak controls or focus on belief change rather than behavioral intentions or outcomes. This pre-registered multi-country (US, Canada, UK) randomized controlled trial involving 930 vaccine-hesitant parents evaluated brief (three-minute) multi-turn conversations with LLM-based chatbots against standard public health messaging approaches for increasing human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine intentions for their children. Participants were randomly assigned to: (1) a weak control (no message), (2) a strong control reflecting the standard of care (reading official public health materials), or (3 and 4) one of two chatbot conditions. One chatbot was prompted to deliver short, conversational responses, while the other used the model's default output style (longer with bullet points). While chatbot interactions significantly increased self-reported vaccination intent (by 7.1-10.3 points on a 100-point scale) compared to no message, they did not outperform standard public health materials, with the conversational chatbot performing significantly worse. Additionally, while the short-term effects of chatbot interactions faded during a 15-day follow-up, the effects of public health material persisted relative to no message. These findings suggest that while LLMs can effectively shift vaccination intentions in the short-term, their incremental value over existing public health communications is questionable, offering a more tempered view of their persuasive capabilities and highlighting the importance of integrating AI-driven tools alongside, rather than replacing, current public health strategies.</description>

      <title>Federated learning, ethics, and the double black box problem in medical AI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning approach that allows multiple devices or institutions to collaboratively train a model without sharing their local data with a third-party. FL is considered a promising way to address patient privacy concerns in medical artificial intelligence. The ethical risks of medical FL systems themselves, however, have thus far been underexamined. This paper aims to address this gap. We argue that medical FL presents a new variety of opacity -- federation opacity -- that, in turn, generates a distinctive double black box problem in healthcare AI. We highlight several instances in which the anticipated benefits of medical FL may be exaggerated, and conclude by highlighting key challenges that must be overcome to make FL ethically feasible in medicine.</description>

      <title>Efficient Listener: Dyadic Facial Motion Synthesis via Action Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating realistic listener facial motions in dyadic conversations remains challenging due to the high-dimensional action space and temporal dependency requirements. Existing approaches usually consider extracting 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) coefficients and modeling in the 3DMM space. However, this makes the computational speed of the 3DMM a bottleneck, making it difficult to achieve real-time interactive responses. To tackle this problem, we propose Facial Action Diffusion (FAD), which introduces the diffusion methods from the field of image generation to achieve efficient facial action generation. We further build the Efficient Listener Network (ELNet) specially designed to accommodate both the visual and audio information of the speaker as input. Considering of FAD and ELNet, the proposed method learns effective listener facial motion representations and leads to improvements of performance over the state-of-the-art methods while reducing 99% computational time.</description>

      <title>Confidence-based Intent Prediction for Teleoperation in Bimanual Robotic Suturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic-assisted procedures offer enhanced precision, but while fully autonomous systems are limited in task knowledge, difficulties in modeling unstructured environments, and generalisation abilities, fully manual teleoperated systems also face challenges such as delay, stability, and reduced sensory information. To address these, we developed an interactive control strategy that assists the human operator by predicting their motion plan at both high and low levels. At the high level, a surgeme recognition system is employed through a Transformer-based real-time gesture classification model to dynamically adapt to the operator's actions, while at the low level, a Confidence-based Intention Assimilation Controller adjusts robot actions based on user intent and shared control paradigms. The system is built around a robotic suturing task, supported by sensors that capture the kinematics of the robot and task dynamics. Experiments across users with varying skill levels demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed approach, showing statistically significant improvements in task completion time and user satisfaction compared to traditional teleoperation.</description>

      <title>RecGaze: The First Eye Tracking and User Interaction Dataset for Carousel Interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carousel interfaces are widely used in e-commerce and streaming services, but little research has been devoted to them. Previous studies of interfaces for presenting search and recommendation results have focused on single ranked lists, but it appears their results cannot be extrapolated to carousels due to the added complexity. Eye tracking is a highly informative approach to understanding how users click, yet there are no eye tracking studies concerning carousels. There are very few interaction datasets on recommenders with carousel interfaces and none that contain gaze data.
  We introduce the RecGaze dataset: the first comprehensive feedback dataset on carousels that includes eye tracking results, clicks, cursor movements, and selection explanations. The dataset comprises of interactions from 3 movie selection tasks with 40 different carousel interfaces per user. In total, 87 users and 3,477 interactions are logged. In addition to the dataset, its description and possible use cases, we provide results of a survey on carousel design and the first analysis of gaze data on carousels, which reveals a golden triangle or F-pattern browsing behavior.
  Our work seeks to advance the field of carousel interfaces by providing the first dataset with eye tracking results on carousels. In this manner, we provide and encourage an empirical understanding of interactions with carousel interfaces, for building better recommender systems through gaze information, and also encourage the development of gaze-based recommenders.</description>

      <title>Modeling AI-Human Collaboration as a Multi-Agent Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an agent-based simulation to formalize AI-human collaboration as a function of task structure, advancing a generalizable framework for strategic decision-making in organizations. Distinguishing between heuristic-based human adaptation and rule-based AI search, we model interactions across modular (parallel) and sequenced (interdependent) tasks using an NK model. Our results reveal that in modular tasks, AI often substitutes for humans - delivering higher payoffs unless human expertise is very high, and the AI search space is either narrowly focused or extremely broad. In sequenced tasks, interesting complementarities emerge. When an expert human initiates the search and AI subsequently refines it, aggregate performance is maximized. Conversely, when AI leads, excessive heuristic refinement by the human can reduce payoffs. We also show that even "hallucinatory" AI - lacking memory or structure - can improve outcomes when augmenting low-capability humans by helping escape local optima. These results yield a robust implication: the effectiveness of AI-human collaboration depends less on context or industry, and more on the underlying task structure. By elevating task decomposition as the central unit of analysis, our model provides a transferable lens for strategic decision-making involving humans and an agentic AI across diverse organizational settings.</description>

      <title>When Testing AI Tests Us: Safeguarding Mental Health on the Digital Frontlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Red-teaming is a core part of the infrastructure that ensures that AI models do not produce harmful content. Unlike past technologies, the black box nature of generative AI systems necessitates a uniquely interactional mode of testing, one in which individuals on red teams actively interact with the system, leveraging natural language to simulate malicious actors and solicit harmful outputs. This interactional labor done by red teams can result in mental health harms that are uniquely tied to the adversarial engagement strategies necessary to effectively red team. The importance of ensuring that generative AI models do not propagate societal or individual harm is widely recognized -- one less visible foundation of end-to-end AI safety is also the protection of the mental health and wellbeing of those who work to keep model outputs safe. In this paper, we argue that the unmet mental health needs of AI red-teamers is a critical workplace safety concern. Through analyzing the unique mental health impacts associated with the labor done by red teams, we propose potential individual and organizational strategies that could be used to meet these needs, and safeguard the mental health of red-teamers. We develop our proposed strategies through drawing parallels between common red-teaming practices and interactional labor common to other professions (including actors, mental health professionals, conflict photographers, and content moderators), describing how individuals and organizations within these professional spaces safeguard their mental health given similar psychological demands. Drawing on these protective practices, we describe how safeguards could be adapted for the distinct mental health challenges experienced by red teaming organizations as they mitigate emerging technological risks on the new digital frontlines.</description>

Abstract: Augmented/Mixed Reality (AR/MR) technologies usher in a new era of immersive, collective experiences, differentiating them from traditional mobile systems. As these technologies evolve, prioritizing privacy and security is critical. This paper focuses on gait privacy, where gait, the way a person walks, can reveal sensitive information such as age, ethnicity, or disorders. We present GaitGuard, a real-time system that protects gait privacy against video-based gait extraction attacks in MR environments. GaitGuard leverages a multi-threaded framework to efficiently process video frames, incorporating dedicated modules for stream capture, body detection and tracking, and privacy leak mitigation. We compare and combine multiple mitigation techniques, offering guidance to navigate the privacy-utility tradeoff. Through extensive experiments covering 248 settings across mitigation regions, types, and tunable parameters, we assess the impact of these techniques on privacy, video quality, and system performance. GaitGuard reduces the confidence of video-based gait extraction attacks by introducing a substantial distribution shift (Jensen-Shannon Divergence of 0.63, indicating highly altered gait features) and a decrease in identification risks by up to 68%, while maintaining 29 FPS and preserving video clarity. GaitGuard provides a practical real-time solution for privacy-preserving MR applications without affecting the MR user experience based on 20 subjective user surveys.</description>

      <title>Perception in Pixels: Effects of Avatar Representation in Video-Mediated Collaborative Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactive collaborative video is now a common part of remote work. Despite its prevalence, traditional video conferencing can be challenging, sometimes causing social discomforts that undermine process and outcomes. Avatars on 2D displays offer a promising alternative for enhancing self-representation, bridging the gap between virtual reality (VR) and traditional non-immersive video. However, the use of such avatars in activity-oriented group settings remains underexplored. To address this gap, we conducted a mixed-methods, within-subject study investigating the impacts of avatar-mediated versus traditional video representations on collaboration satisfaction and self-esteem. 32 participants (8 groups of 4 with pre-established relationships) engaged in goal-directed activities, followed by group interviews. Results indicate that avatars significantly enhance self-esteem and collaboration satisfaction, while qualitative insights reveal the dynamic perceptions and experiences of avatars, including benefits, challenges, and factors influencing adoption likelihood. Our study contributes to understanding and implications of avatars as a camera-driven representation in video-mediated collaborative interactions.</description>

      <title>Scideator: Human-LLM Scientific Idea Generation Grounded in Research-Paper Facet Recombination</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.14634v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The scientific ideation process often involves blending salient aspects of existing papers to create new ideas, and facet-based ideation is an established framework for idea generation. To see how large language models (LLMs) might assist in this process, we contribute a novel mixed-initiative ideation tool called Scideator. Starting from a user-provided set of scientific papers, Scideator extracts key facets -- purposes, mechanisms, and evaluations -- from these and related papers, allowing users to explore the idea space by interactively recombining facets to synthesize inventive ideas. Scideator also helps users gauge idea originality by searching the literature for overlaps, assessing idea novelty and providing explanations. To support these tasks, Scideator introduces three LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) modules: Analogous Paper Facet Finder, Faceted Idea Generator, and Idea Novelty Checker. In a within-subjects user study (N=22) with computer-science researchers comparing Scideator to a strong baseline, our tool provided significantly more creativity support, particularly with respect to exploration, which participants considered the most important factor for idea generation.</description>

      <title>Perfectly to a Tee: Understanding User Perceptions of Personalized LLM-Enhanced Narrative Interventions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16732v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stories about overcoming personal struggles can effectively illustrate the application of psychological theories in real life, yet they may fail to resonate with individuals' experiences. In this work, we employ large language models (LLMs) to create tailored narratives that acknowledge and address unique challenging thoughts and situations faced by individuals. Our study, involving 346 young adults across two settings, demonstrates that personalized LLM-enhanced stories were perceived to be better than human-written ones in conveying key takeaways, promoting reflection, and reducing belief in negative thoughts. These stories were not only seen as more relatable but also similarly authentic to human-written ones, highlighting the potential of LLMs in helping young adults manage their struggles. The findings of this work provide crucial design considerations for future narrative-based digital mental health interventions, such as the need to maintain relatability without veering into implausibility and refining the wording and tone of AI-enhanced content.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01397v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There has been growing interest from both practitioners and researchers in engaging end users in AI auditing, to draw upon users' unique knowledge and lived experiences. However, we know little about how to effectively scaffold end users in auditing in ways that can generate actionable insights for AI practitioners. Through formative studies with both users and AI practitioners, we first identified a set of design goals to support user-engaged AI auditing. We then developed WeAudit, a workflow and system that supports end users in auditing AI both individually and collectively. We evaluated WeAudit through a three-week user study with user auditors and interviews with industry Generative AI practitioners. Our findings offer insights into how WeAudit supports users in noticing and reflecting upon potential AI harms and in articulating their findings in ways that industry practitioners can act upon. Based on our observations and feedback from both users and practitioners, we identify several opportunities to better support user engagement in AI auditing processes. We discuss implications for future research to support effective and responsible user engagement in AI auditing and red-teaming.</description>

      <title>VIGMA: An Open-Access Framework for Visual Gait and Motion Analytics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gait disorders are commonly observed in older adults, who frequently experience various issues related to walking. Additionally, researchers and clinicians extensively investigate mobility related to gait in typically and atypically developing children, athletes, and individuals with orthopedic and neurological disorders. Effective gait analysis enables the understanding of the causal mechanisms of mobility and balance control of patients, the development of tailored treatment plans to improve mobility, the reduction of fall risk, and the tracking of rehabilitation progress. However, analyzing gait data is a complex task due to the multivariate nature of the data, the large volume of information to be interpreted, and the technical skills required. Existing tools for gait analysis are often limited to specific patient groups (e.g., cerebral palsy), only handle a specific subset of tasks in the entire workflow, and are not openly accessible. To address these shortcomings, we conducted a requirements assessment with gait practitioners (e.g., researchers, clinicians) via surveys and identified key components of the workflow, including (1) data processing and (2) data analysis and visualization. Based on the findings, we designed VIGMA, an open-access visual analytics framework integrated with computational notebooks and a Python library, to meet the identified requirements. Notably, the framework supports analytical capabilities for assessing disease progression and for comparing multiple patient groups. We validated the framework through usage scenarios with experts specializing in gait and mobility rehabilitation. VIGMA is available at https://github.com/komar41/VIGMA.</description>

      <title>MER 2025: When Affective Computing Meets Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: MER2025 is the third year of our MER series of challenges, aiming to bring together researchers in the affective computing community to explore emerging trends and future directions in the field. Previously, MER2023 focused on multi-label learning, noise robustness, and semi-supervised learning, while MER2024 introduced a new track dedicated to open-vocabulary emotion recognition. This year, MER2025 centers on the theme "When Affective Computing Meets Large Language Models (LLMs)".We aim to shift the paradigm from traditional categorical frameworks reliant on predefined emotion taxonomies to LLM-driven generative methods, offering innovative solutions for more accurate and reliable emotion understanding. The challenge features four tracks: MER-SEMI focuses on fixed categorical emotion recognition enhanced by semi-supervised learning; MER-FG explores fine-grained emotions, expanding recognition from basic to nuanced emotional states; MER-DES incorporates multimodal cues (beyond emotion words) into predictions to enhance model interpretability; MER-PR investigates whether emotion prediction results can improve personality recognition performance. For the first three tracks, baseline code is available at MERTools, and datasets can be accessed via Hugging Face. For the last track, the dataset and baseline code are available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Cam-2-Cam: Exploring the Design Space of Dual-Camera Interactions for Smartphone-based Augmented Reality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20035v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Off-the-shelf smartphone-based AR systems typically use a single front-facing or rear-facing camera, which restricts user interactions to a narrow field of view and small screen size, thus reducing their practicality. We present Cam-2-Cam, an interaction concept implemented in three smartphone-based AR applications with interactions that span both cameras. Results from our qualitative analysis conducted on 30 participants presented two major design lessons that explore the interaction space of smartphone AR while maintaining critical AR interface attributes like embodiment and immersion: (1) Balancing Contextual Relevance and Feedback Quality serves to outline a delicate balance between implementing familiar interactions people do in the real world and the quality of multimodal AR responses and (2) Preventing Disorientation using Simultaneous Capture and Alternating Cameras which details how to prevent disorientation during AR interactions using the two distinct camera techniques we implemented in the paper. Additionally, we consider observed user assumptions or natural tendencies to inform future implementations of dual-camera setups for smartphone-based AR. We envision our design lessons as an initial pioneering step toward expanding the interaction space of smartphone-based AR, potentially driving broader adoption and overcoming limitations of single-camera AR.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI: The Era of Semantic Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14562v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work demonstrated great promise in the idea of orchestrating collaborations between LLMs, human input, and various tools to address the inherent limitations of LLMs. We propose a novel perspective called semantic decoding, which frames these collaborative processes as optimization procedures in semantic space. Specifically, we conceptualize LLMs as semantic processors that manipulate meaningful pieces of information that we call semantic tokens (known thoughts). LLMs are among a large pool of other semantic processors, including humans and tools, such as search engines or code executors. Collectively, semantic processors engage in dynamic exchanges of semantic tokens to progressively construct high-utility outputs. We refer to these orchestrated interactions among semantic processors, optimizing and searching in semantic space, as semantic decoding algorithms. This concept draws a direct parallel to the well-studied problem of syntactic decoding, which involves crafting algorithms to best exploit auto-regressive language models for extracting high-utility sequences of syntactic tokens. By focusing on the semantic level and disregarding syntactic details, we gain a fresh perspective on the engineering of AI systems, enabling us to imagine systems with much greater complexity and capabilities. In this position paper, we formalize the transition from syntactic to semantic tokens as well as the analogy between syntactic and semantic decoding. Subsequently, we explore the possibilities of optimizing within the space of semantic tokens via semantic decoding algorithms. We conclude with a list of research opportunities and questions arising from this fresh perspective. The semantic decoding perspective offers a powerful abstraction for search and optimization directly in the space of meaningful concepts, with semantic tokens as the fundamental units of a new type of computation.</description>

      <title>Problem Solving Through Human-AI Preference-Based Cooperation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07461v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While there is a widespread belief that artificial general intelligence (AGI) -- or even superhuman AI -- is imminent, complex problems in expert domains are far from being solved. We argue that such problems require human-AI cooperation and that the current state of the art in generative AI is unable to play the role of a reliable partner due to a multitude of shortcomings, including difficulty to keep track of a complex solution artifact (e.g., a software program), limited support for versatile human preference expression and lack of adapting to human preference in an interactive setting. To address these challenges, we propose HAICo2, a novel human-AI co-construction framework. We take first steps towards a formalization of HAICo2 and discuss the difficult open research problems that it faces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05452v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Musculoskeletal injuries during military training significantly impact readiness, making prevention through activity monitoring crucial. While Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices offers promising solutions, it faces challenges in processing continuous data streams and recognizing diverse activities without predefined sessions. This paper introduces an end-to-end framework for preprocessing, analyzing, and recognizing activities from wearable data in military training contexts. Using data from 135 soldiers wearing \textit{Garmin--55} smartwatches over six months with over 15 million minutes. We develop a hierarchical deep learning approach that achieves 93.8% accuracy in temporal splits and 83.8% in cross-user evaluation. Our framework addresses missing data through physiologically-informed methods, reducing unknown sleep states from 40.38% to 3.66%. We demonstrate that while longer time windows (45-60 minutes) improve basic state classification, they present trade-offs in detecting fine-grained activities. Additionally, we introduce an intuitive visualization system that enables real-time comparison of individual performance against group metrics across multiple physiological indicators. This approach to activity recognition and performance monitoring provides military trainers with actionable insights for optimizing training programs and preventing injuries.</description>

      <title>From tools to thieves: Measuring and understanding public perceptions of AI through crowdsourced metaphors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18045v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: How has the public responded to the increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-based technologies? We investigate public perceptions of AI by collecting over 12,000 responses over 12 months from a nationally representative U.S. sample. Participants provided open-ended metaphors reflecting their mental models of AI, a methodology that overcomes the limitations of traditional self-reported measures by capturing more nuance. Using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative clustering and qualitative coding, we identify 20 dominant metaphors shaping public understanding of AI. To analyze these metaphors systematically, we present a scalable framework integrating language modeling (LM)-based techniques to measure key dimensions of public perception: anthropomorphism (attribution of human-like qualities), warmth, and competence. We find that Americans generally view AI as warm and competent, and that over the past year, perceptions of AI's human-likeness and warmth have significantly increased ($+34\%, r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.01; +41\%, r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.05$). These implicit perceptions, along with the identified dominant metaphors, strongly predict trust in and willingness to adopt AI ($r^2 = 0.21, 0.18, p &lt; 0.001$). Moreover, we uncover systematic demographic differences in metaphors and implicit perceptions, such as the higher propensity of women, older individuals, and people of color to anthropomorphize AI, which shed light on demographic disparities in trust and adoption. In addition to our dataset and framework for tracking evolving public attitudes, we provide actionable insights on using metaphors for inclusive and responsible AI development.</description>

      <title>Time2Lang: Bridging Time-Series Foundation Models and Large Language Models for Health Sensing Beyond Prompting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07608v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging. Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks). Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length, unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.</description>

      <title>Inaccuracy of an E-Dictionary and Its Influence on Chinese Language Users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electronic dictionaries have largely replaced paper dictionaries and become central tools for L2 learners seeking to expand their vocabulary. Users often assume these resources are reliable and rarely question the validity of the definitions provided. The accuracy of major E-dictionaries is seldom scrutinized, and little attention has been paid to how their corpora are constructed. Research on dictionary use, particularly the limitations of electronic dictionaries, remains scarce. This study adopts a combined method of experimentation, user survey, and dictionary critique to examine Youdao, one of the most widely used E-dictionaries in China. The experiment involved a translation task paired with retrospective reflection. Participants were asked to translate sentences containing words that are insufficiently or inaccurately defined in Youdao. Their consultation behavior was recorded to analyze how faulty definitions influenced comprehension. Results show that incomplete or misleading definitions can cause serious misunderstandings. Additionally, students exhibited problematic consultation habits. The study further explores how such flawed definitions originate, highlighting issues in data processing and the integration of AI and machine learning technologies in dictionary construction. The findings suggest a need for better training in dictionary literacy for users, as well as improvements in the underlying AI models used to build E-dictionaries.</description>
