      <title>Polarization Entanglement with highly non-degenerate photon pairs enhanced by effective walk-off compensation method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate polarization entanglement in highly non-degenerate photon pairs, generated through Type-0 spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) using bulk periodically poled Lithium Niobate (PPLN) crystals. Through the utilization of both a beam displacer interferometer scheme and a Sagnac interferometer, we ensure high polarisation contrast and stable interference of the highly non-degenerate photon pairs, which however causes substantial spatial and temporal walk-offs of the photon paths which poses a formidable challenge. We introduce an effective compensation method using birefringent crystal wedges to eliminate spatial and temporal walkoffs simultaneously. This method is implemented in our entangled photon source (EPS) designed specifically for testing entanglement-based quantum key distribution (EBQKD) between ground and satellite, as part of the Quantum Encryption and Science Satellite (QEYSSat) mission funded by the Canadian Space Agency (CSA). We observed a coincidence rate of N = (33.33+-0.05)kHz, a significant improvement compared to the absence of the spatial compensation. We also observed an estimated pair generation rate of (2.92+-0.12)MHz and an entanglement visibility of (96.6+-0.3)% from only 1.0mW of pump power, making it a promising source for long-distance quantum communication for ground-to-satellite and fiber optic links.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian and Liouvillian learning in weakly-dissipative quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06768v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss Hamiltonian and Liouvillian learning for analog quantum simulation from non-equilibrium quench dynamics in the limit of weakly dissipative many-body systems. We present various strategies to learn the operator content of the Hamiltonian and the Lindblad operators of the Liouvillian. We compare different ans\"atze based on an experimentally accessible "learning error" which we consider as a function of the number of runs of the experiment. Initially, the learning error decreasing with the inverse square root of the number of runs, as the error in the reconstructed parameters is dominated by shot noise. Eventually the learning error remains constant, allowing us to recognize missing ansatz terms. A central aspect of our approach is to (re-)parametrize ans\"atze by introducing and varying the dependencies between parameters. This allows us to identify the relevant parameters of the system, thereby reducing the complexity of the learning task. Importantly, this (re-)parametrization relies solely on classical post-processing, which is compelling given the finite amount of data available from experiments. A distinguishing feature of our approach is the possibility to learn the Hamiltonian, without the necessity of learning the complete Liouvillian, thus further reducing the complexity of the learning task. We illustrate our method with two, experimentally relevant, spin models.</description>

      <title>A computational test of quantum contextuality, and even simpler proofs of quantumness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell non-locality is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics whereby measurements performed on "spatially separated" quantum systems can exhibit correlations that cannot be understood as revealing predetermined values. This is a special case of the more general phenomenon of "quantum contextuality", which says that such correlations can occur even when the measurements are not necessarily on separate quantum systems, but are merely "compatible" (i.e. commuting). Crucially, while any non-local game yields an experiment that demonstrates quantum advantage by leveraging the "spatial separation" of two or more devices (and in fact several such demonstrations have been conducted successfully in recent years), the same is not true for quantum contextuality: finding the contextuality analogue of such an experiment is arguably one of the central open questions in the foundations of quantum mechanics.
  In this work, we show that an arbitrary contextuality game can be compiled into an operational "test of contextuality" involving a single quantum device, by only making the assumption that the device is computationally bounded. Our work is inspired by the recent work of Kalai et al. (STOC '23) that converts any non-local game into a classical test of quantum advantage with a single device. The central idea in their work is to use cryptography to enforce spatial separation within subsystems of a single quantum device. Our work can be seen as using cryptography to enforce "temporal separation", i.e. to restrict communication between sequential measurements.
  Beyond contextuality, we employ our ideas to design a "proof of quantumness" that, to the best of our knowledge, is arguably even simpler than the ones proposed in the literature so far.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Transfer in Interacting, Multiple-Excitation Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum state transfer (QST) describes the coherent passage of quantum information from one node in a network to another. Experiments on QST span a diverse set of platforms and currently report transport across up to tens of nodes in times of several hundred nanoseconds with fidelities that can approach 90% or more. Theoretical studies examine both the lossless time evolution associated with a given (Hermitian) lattice Hamiltonian and methods based on the master equation that allows for losses. In this paper, we describe Monte Carlo techniques which enable the discovery of a Hamiltonian that gives high-fidelity QST. We benchmark our approach in geometries appropriate to coupled optical cavity-emitter arrays and discuss connections to condensed matter Hamiltonians of localized orbitals coupled to conduction bands. The resulting Jaynes-Cummings-Hubbard and periodic Anderson models can, in principle, be engineered in appropriate hardware to give efficient QST.</description>

      <title>Ultraprecise time-difference measurement via enhanced dual pointers with multiple weak interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Standard weak measurement with an assistant pointer and single weak interaction constrains measurement precision and quantity of interaction parameters, and a compelling characterization of quantum effect featuring weak-value amplification (WVA) remains elusive. Here, we theoretically and experimentally demonstrate an enhanced dual-pointer WVA scheme based on multiple weak interactions and variable spectrum sources. Developing triple weak interactions, momentum P pointer reaches an optimal time-difference precision of $3.34 \times {10^{-5}}$ as at 6 nm spectral width, and intensity I pointer achieves a displacement resolution of 148.8 fm within 400 kHz linewidth. A quantum effect associated with an anomalous weak value is revealed by an observable violation of a Leggett-Garg inequality. The I-pointer weak value is measured to be 1478 using multiple weak interactions and high signal-to-noise detection, achieving a two-order-of-magnitude WVA enhancement compared to standard weak measurement. Our work opens up a practical avenue for minuscule quantumness measurements in challenging environments.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping Classical Shadows for Neural Quantum State Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the advantages of using autoregressive neural quantum states as ansatze for classical shadow tomography to improve its predictive power.We introduce a novel estimator for optimizing the cross-entropy loss function using classical shadows, and a new importance sampling strategy for estimating the loss gradient during training using stabilizer samples collected from classical shadows. We show that this loss function can be used to achieve stable reconstruction of GHZ states using a transformer-based neural network trained on classical shadow measurements. This loss function also enables the training of neural quantum states representing purifications of mixed states. Our results show that the intrinsic capability of autoregressive models in representing physically well-defined density matrices allows us to overcome the weakness of Pauli-based classical shadow tomography in predicting both high-weight observables and nonlinear observables such as the purity of pure and mixed states.</description>

      <title>The Algorithm for Solving Quantum Linear Systems of Equations With Coherent Superposition and Its Extended Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum algorithms for attacking symmetric cryptography involve the rank problem of quantum linear equations. In this paper, we first propose two quantum algorithms for solving quantum linear systems of equations with coherent superposition and construct their specific quantum circuits. Unlike previous related works, our quantum algorithms are universal. Specifically, the two quantum algorithms can both compute the rank and general solution by one measurement. The difference between them is whether the data register containing the quantum coefficient matrix can be disentangled with other registers and keep the data qubits unchanged. On this basis, we apply the two quantum algorithms as a subroutine to parallel Simon's algorithm (with multiple periods), Grover Meets Simon algorithm, and Alg-PolyQ2 algorithm, respectively. Afterwards, we construct a quantum classifier within Grover Meets Simon algorithm and the test oracle within Alg-PolyQ2 algorithm in detail, including their respective quantum circuits. To our knowledge, no such specific analysis has been done before. We rigorously analyze the success probability of those algorithms to ensure that the success probability based on the proposed quantum algorithms will not be lower than that of those original algorithms. Finally, we discuss the lower bound of the number of CNOT gates for solving quantum linear systems of equations with coherent superposition, and our quantum algorithms reach the optimum in terms of minimizing the number of CNOT gates. Furthermore, our analysis indicates that the proposed algorithms are mainly suitable for conducting attacks against lightweight symmetric ciphers, within the effective working time of an ion trap quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Optically-Sampled Superconducting-Nanostrip Photon-Number Resolving Detector for Non-Classical Quantum State Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photon number-resolving detectors (PNRDs) are the ultimate optical sensors. Superconducting-nanostrip photon detectors (SNSPDs), traditionally known as ON-OFF detectors, have recently been found to have photon number resolving capability without multiplexing. This discovery positions them to become true PNRDs. However, their practical use is limited by the need to precisely detect tiny signal differences with low signal-to-noise ratios within sub-nanosecond time frames. We overcome this challenge using optical sampling with a dual-output Mach Zehnder modulator (DO-MZM) and ultra-short pulsed laser. By adjusting the DO-MZM's bias voltage to nearly balance the outputs, this method enables sensitive detection of picosecond-order signal differences, achieving a temporal resolution of 1.9 ps and facilitating real-time photon number resolution. We applied this method to produce various non-classical quantum states, enhancing their non-classicality through photon number resolution. This advancement marks a significant shift from principle verification to practical application for SNSPD-type PNRDs in diverse quantum optics fields.</description>

      <title>FlexiSCD: Flexible Surface Code Deformer for Dynamic Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Error Correction (QEC) codes are vital for protecting quantum computers from noise by encoding quantum information redundantly in physical qubits. However, dynamic defects pose a significant challenge, potentially rendering physical qubits faulty during computation across various quantum platforms. Current defect mitigation strategies focus on surface codes, but often fail to fully restore QEC capability or disrupt logical operations. In our paper, we introduce FlexiSCD, a code deformation framework that integrates adaptive defect mitigation into surface code workflows. It strategically crafts basic deformation instructions based on gauge transformations, enabling optimized processes tailored to specific defects, restoring QEC capability efficiently with fewer qubit resources. We also design an adaptive code layout for efficient logical operations. Our evaluation demonstrates that FlexiSCD reduces failure rates by $35\times\sim70\times$ and requires only half the qubit resources compared to previous methods. It surpasses previous defect removal techniques, preserving QEC capability and improving surface code communication.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Steered Quantum Coherence and Magic Resource under Sudden Quench</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of l_1-norm of steered quantum coherence (SQC), steered quantum relative entropy (SQRE), and magic resource quantifier (QRM) in the one-dimensional XY spin chain in the presence of time dependent transverse magnetic field. We find that the system's response is highly sensitive to the initial state and magnetic field strength. % We show that the dynamics of SQC, SQRE and MRQ revealing the critical point associated with equilibrium quantum phase transition (QPT) of the system. All quantities show maximum at QPT when the initial state is prepared in the ferromagnetic phase. Conversely, they undergo abrupt changes at quantum critical point if the initial state of the system is paramagnetic. Moreover, our results confirm that, when quench is done to the quantum critical point, the first suppression (revival) time scales linearly with the system size, and remarkably, its scaling ratio remains consistent for all quenches, irrespective of the initial phase of the system. % These results highlight the interplay between the quantum information resources and dynamics of quantum systems away from the equilibrium. Such insights could be vital for quantum information processing and understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Distributed Exact Generalized Grover's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computation has garnered immense attention in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, where each computational node necessitates fewer qubits and quantum gates. In this paper, we focus on a generalized search problem involving multiple targets within an unordered database and propose a Distributed Exact Generalized Grover's Algorithm (DEGGA) to address this challenge by decomposing it into arbitrary $t$ components, where $2 \leq t \leq n$. Specifically, (1) our algorithm ensures accuracy, with a theoretical probability of identifying the target states at $100\%$; (2) if the number of targets is fixed, the pivotal factor influencing the circuit depth of DEGGA is the partitioning strategy, rather than the magnitude of $n$; (3) our method requires a total of $n$ qubits, eliminating the need for auxiliary qubits; (4) we elucidate the resolutions (two-node and three-node) of a particular generalized search issue incorporating two goal strings (000000 and 111111) by applying DEGGA. The feasibility and effectiveness of our suggested approach is further demonstrated by executing the quantum circuits on MindSpore Quantum (a quantum simulation software). Eventually, through the decomposition of multi-qubit gates, DEGGA diminishes the utilization of quantum gates by $90.7\%$ and decreases the circuit depth by $91.3\%$ in comparison to the modified Grover's algorithm by Long. It is increasingly evident that distributed quantum algorithms offer augmented practicality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum walks provide an alternative method for quantum search problems. Most of the earlier studies confirmed that quadratic speedup exists in some synthetic Hamiltonians, but whether there is quadratic speedup in real physical systems is elusive. Here, we investigate three physical systems with long-range atom-atom interaction which are possible good candidates for realizing the quantum search, including one-dimensional atom arrays either trapped in an optical lattice or coupled to waveguide near band edge or dispersively coupled to a good cavity. We find that all three systems can provide near-optimal quantum search if there is no dissipation. However, if the dissipation is considered only the latter two systems (i.e., waveguide-QED and cavity-QED systems) can still have high success probabilities because the latter two systems can significantly enhance the atom-atom interaction even if they are far apart and the spectra gap can be much larger which can reduce the search time and the effects of dissipation significantly. Our studies here can provide helpful instructions for realizing quantum search in real physical systems in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Simulation Algorithms in the Path Integral Formulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a new paradigm for quantum simulation that is based on path integration that allows quantum speedups to be observed for problems that are more naturally expressed using the path integral formalism rather than the conventional sparse Hamiltonian formalism. We provide two novel quantum algorithms based on Hamiltonian versions of the path integral formulation and another for Lagrangians of the form $\frac{m}{2}\dot{x}^2 - V(x)$. This Lagrangian path integral algorithm is based on a new rigorous derivation of a discrete version of the Lagrangian path integral. Our first Hamiltonian path integral method breaks up the paths into short timesteps. It is efficient under appropriate sparsity assumptions and requires a number of queries to oracles that give the eigenvalues and overlaps between the eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian terms that scales as $t^{o(1)}/\epsilon^{o(1)}$ for simulation time $t$ and error $\epsilon$. The second approach uses long-time path integrals for near-adiabatic systems and has query complexity that scales as $O(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ if the energy eigenvalue gaps and simulation time is sufficiently long. Finally, we show that our Lagrangian simulation algorithm requires a number of queries to an oracle that computes the discrete Lagrangian that scales, in the continuum limit, as $\widetilde{O}(t^2/\epsilon)$ if $V(x)$ is bounded and finite and the wave function obeys appropriate position and momentum cutoffs. This shows that Lagrangian dynamics can be efficiently simulated on quantum computers and opens up the possibility for quantum field theories for which the Hamiltonian is unknown to be efficiently simulated on quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Using non-Gaussian quantum states for detection of a given phase shift</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Injecting a non-Gaussian (Fock or Shr\"odinger cat) quantum state into the dark port of a two-arm interferometer and a strong classical light into the bright one, it is possible, in principle, to detect a given phase shift unambiguously using the orthogonality between the original and displaced in the interferometer non-Gaussian states.
  The optical losses degrade the sensitivity, introducing the finite "false positive" and "false negative" detection errors. However, using the state-of-art photodetectors, it is still possible to obtain better detection fidelity than in the case of Gaussian quantum states.</description>

      <title>Circuit Design of Two-Step Quantum Search Algorithm for Solving Traveling Salesman Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum search algorithms, such as Grover's algorithm, are expected to efficiently solve constrained combinatorial optimization problems. However, implementing a quantum search algorithm for solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP) on a circuit poses a potential challenge because current quantum search algorithms for TSP assume that an initial state of equal superposition of feasible solution states satisfying the constraint is already prepared a priori. The time complexity of brute-force preparation of the initial state increases exponentially with the factorial growth of feasible solutions, posing a considerable obstacle in designing quantum circuits for large-scale TSP. To overcome this problem, we propose a two-step quantum search algorithm with two distinct operators for preparing the initial state and solving TSP. The algorithm first amplifies an equal superposition state of all feasible solutions of TSP and subsequently amplifies the optimal solution states among these feasible solution states. Our algorithm, encoded in the higher-order unconstrained binary optimization (HOBO) representation, notably reduces the required number of qubits, enabling efficient preparation of the initial state with a unified circuit design and solving TSP with a quadratic speedup in the absence of prior knowledge of feasible solutions.</description>

Abstract: It presents a significant challenge to elucidate the relationship between the phases of open quantum many-body systems and the spectral structure of their governing Liouvillian, which determines how the density matrix evolves. Previous studies have focused on the Liouvillian gap, defined as the decay rate of the most slowly-decaying mode, as a key indicator of dissipative phase transition, noting its closure in symmetry-broken phases and opening in disordered phases. In this work, we propose an additional spectral gap, termed the oscillating-mode gap, defined as the decay rate of the most slowly-decaying oscillating mode. Through the analysis of a prototype dissipative boson system, we demonstrate the necessity of both the Liouvillian gap and the oscillating-mode gap for the comprehensive characterization of the system's phases and the transitions between them.</description>

      <title>Oracle Separation between Noisy Quantum Polynomial Time and the Polynomial Hierarchy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the oracle separation between the physically motivated complexity class of noisy quantum circuits, inspired by definitions such as those presented by Chen, Cotler, Huang, and Li (2022). We establish that with a constant error rate, separation can be achieved in terms of NP. When the error rate is $\Omega(\log n/n)$, we can extend this result to the separation of PH. Notably, our oracles, in all separations, do not necessitate error correction schemes or fault tolerance, as all quantum circuits are of constant depth. This indicates that even quantum computers with minor errors, without error correction, may surpass classical complexity classes under various scenarios and assumptions. We also explore various common noise settings and present new classical hardness results, generalizing those found in studies by Raz and Tal (2022) and Bassirian, Bouland, Fefferman, Gunn, and Tal (2021), which are of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Optical transition parameters of the silicon T centre</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The silicon T centre's narrow, telecommunications-band optical emission, long spin coherence, and direct photonic integration have spurred interest in this emitter as a spin-photon interface for distributed quantum computing and networking. However, key parameters of the T centre's spin-selective optical transitions remain undetermined or ambiguous in literature. In this paper we present a Hamiltonian of the T centre TX state and determine key parameters of the optical transition from T$_0$ to TX$_0$ from a combined analysis of published results, density functional theory, and new spectroscopy. We resolve ambiguous values of the internal defect potential in the literature, and we present the first measurements of electrically tuned T centre emission. As a result, we provide a model of the T centre's optical and spin properties under strain, electric, and magnetic fields that can be utilized for realizing quantum technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of quantum information processing for macroscopic qubits is based on the fact that every macroscopic qubit has a conserved number of particles. However, from an experimental point of view, every such qubit experiences processes of decoherence that impact the possibilities for entanglement generation between such qubits and use in quantum information processing efficiently. One of the most prospective methods for generating entanglement between distant atomic BECs is quantum nondemolition measurements. Here, we study how the effects of photon measurement impact the entanglement when photon loss decoherence is included. We employ the thermally entangled state representation (TESR) and integral within the ordered operator(IWOP) approach to obtain the accurate density matrix in a photon loss channel. We demonstrate that varying outcomes of photon number measurements lead to the generation of distinct entangled states, each exhibiting unique characteristics. We find that using the Hofmann-Takeuchi and Duan-Giedke-Cirac-Zoller criterion provides advantages in entanglement detection compared to the Wineland squeezing and EPR steering criterion in such settings.</description>

      <title>Showcasing extractable work of quantum battery via entropic uncertainty relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of entropic uncertainty relations (EURs) in discerning the energy variation in quantum batteries (QBs) modelled by battery-charger-field in the presence of bosonic and fermionic reservoirs. Our results suggest that the extractable works (exergy and ergotropy) have versatile characteristics in different scenarios, resulting in a complex relationship between tightness and extractable work. It is worth noting that the tightness of the lower bound of entropic uncertainty can be a good indicator for energy conversion efficiency in charging QBs. Furthermore, we disclose how the EUR including uncertainty and lower bound contributes to energy conversion efficiency in the QB system. It is believed that these findings will be beneficial for better understanding the role of quantum uncertainty in evaluating quantum battery performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random walks behave very differently for classical and quantum particles. Here we unveil a ubiquitous distinctive behavior of random walks of a photon in a one-dimensional lattice in the presence of a finite number of traps, at which the photon can be destroyed and the walk terminates. While for a classical random walk the photon is unavoidably destroyed by the traps, for a quantum walk the photon can remain alive and the walk continues forever. Such an intriguing behavior is illustrated by considering photonic random walks in synthetic mesh lattices with controllable decoherence, which enables to switch from quantum to classical random walks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new quantum circuit synthesis (QCS) framework, Qsyn, for developers to research, develop, test, experiment, and then contribute their QCS algorithms and tools to the framework. Our framework is more developer-friendly than other modern QCS frameworks in three aspects: (1) We design a rich command-line interface so that developers can easily design various testing scenarios and flexibly conduct experiments on their algorithms. (2) We offer detailed access to many data representations on different abstract levels of quantum circuits so that developers can optimize their algorithms to the extreme. (3) We define a rigid developing flow and environment so that developers can ensure their development qualities with the best modern software engineering practices. We illustrate the friendliness of our framework with a showcase of developing a T-Count Optimization algorithm and demonstrate our performance superiority with fair comparisons to other modern QCS frameworks.</description>

      <title>Dephasing-induced mobility edges in quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mobility edges (ME), separating Anderson-localized states from extended states, are known to arise in the single-particle energy spectrum of certain one-dimensional lattices with aperiodic order. Dephasing and decoherence effects are widely acknowledged to spoil Anderson localization and to enhance transport, suggesting that ME and localization are unlikely to be observable in the presence of dephasing. Here it is shown that, contrary to such a wisdom, ME can be created by pure dephasing effects in quasicrystals in which all states are delocalized under coherent dynamics. Since the lifetimes of localized states induced by dephasing effects can be extremely long, rather counter-intuitively decoherence can enhance localization of excitation in the lattice. The results are illustrated by considering photonic quantum walks in synthetic mesh lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Constructing an optimal mixer for Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Hamiltonian is crucial for enhancing the performance of QAOA in solving combinatorial optimization problems. We present a systematic methodology for constructing the QAOA tailored mixer Hamiltonian, ensuring alignment with the inherent symmetries of classical optimization problem objectives. The key to our approach is to identify an operator that commutes with the action of the group of symmetries on the QAOA underlying Hilbert space and meets the essential technical criteria for effective mixer Hamiltonian functionality. We offer a construction method specifically tailored to the symmetric group $S_d$, prevalent in a variety of combinatorial optimization problems. By rigorously validating the required properties, providing a concrete formula and corresponding quantum circuit for implementation, we establish the viability of the proposed mixer Hamiltonian. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the classical mixer $B$ commutes only with a subgroup of $S_d$ of significantly smaller order than the group itself, enhancing the efficiency of the proposed approach. To evaluate the effectiveness of our methodology, we compare two QAOA variants utilizing different mixer Hamiltonians: conventional $B=\sum X_i$ and the newly proposed $H_M$ in edge coloring and graph partitioning problems across various graphs. We observe statistically significant differences in mean values, with the new variant consistently demonstrating superior performance across multiple independent simulations. Additionally, we analyze the phenomenon of poor performance in alternative warm-start QAOA variants, providing a conceptual explanation supported by recent literature findings.</description>

      <title>What is Quantum Parallelism, Anyhow?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Central to the power of quantum computing is the concept of quantum parallelism: quantum systems can explore and process multiple computational paths simultaneously. In this paper, we discuss the elusive nature of quantum parallelism, drawing parallels with classical parallel computing models to elucidate its fundamental characteristics and implications for algorithmic performance. We begin by defining quantum parallelism as arising from the superposition of quantum states, allowing for the exploration of multiple computational paths in parallel. To quantify and visualize quantum parallelism, we introduce the concept of quantum dataflow diagrams, which provide a graphical representation of quantum algorithms and their parallel execution paths. We demonstrate how quantum parallelism can be measured and assessed by analyzing quantum algorithms such as the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Amplitude Amplification (AA) iterations using quantum dataflow diagrams. Furthermore, we examine the interplay between quantum parallelism and classical parallelism laws, including Amdahl's and Gustafson's laws. While these laws were originally formulated for classical parallel computing systems, we reconsider their applicability in the quantum computing domain. We argue that while classical parallelism laws offer valuable insights, their direct application to quantum computing is limited due to the unique characteristics of quantum parallelism, including the role of destructive interference and the inherent limitations of classical-quantum I/O. Our analysis highlights the need for an increased understanding of quantum parallelism and its implications for algorithm design and performance.</description>

      <title>Separable Power of Classical and Quantum Learning Protocols Through the Lens of No-Free-Lunch Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The No-Free-Lunch (NFL) theorem, which quantifies problem- and data-independent generalization errors regardless of the optimization process, provides a foundational framework for comprehending diverse learning protocols' potential. Despite its significance, the establishment of the NFL theorem for quantum machine learning models remains largely unexplored, thereby overlooking broader insights into the fundamental relationship between quantum and classical learning protocols. To address this gap, we categorize a diverse array of quantum learning algorithms into three learning protocols designed for learning quantum dynamics under a specified observable and establish their NFL theorem. The exploited protocols, namely Classical Learning Protocols (CLC-LPs), Restricted Quantum Learning Protocols (ReQu-LPs), and Quantum Learning Protocols (Qu-LPs), offer varying levels of access to quantum resources. Our derived NFL theorems demonstrate quadratic reductions in sample complexity across CLC-LPs, ReQu-LPs, and Qu-LPs, contingent upon the orthogonality of quantum states and the diagonality of observables. We attribute this performance discrepancy to the unique capacity of quantum-related learning protocols to indirectly utilize information concerning the global phases of non-orthogonal quantum states, a distinctive physical feature inherent in quantum mechanics. Our findings not only deepen our understanding of quantum learning protocols' capabilities but also provide practical insights for the development of advanced quantum learning algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum prepare-and-measure scenario has been studied under various physical assumptions on the emitted states. Here, we first discuss how different assumptions are conceptually and formally related. We then identify one that can serve as a relaxation of all others, corresponding to a limitation on the one-shot accessible information of the state ensemble. This motivates us to study the optimal state discrimination probability of a source subject to these various physical assumptions. We derive general and tight bounds for states restricted by their quantum dimension, their vacuum component, an arbitrary uniform overlap, the magnitude of higher-dimensional signals and the experimenter's trust in their device. Our results constitute a first step towards a more unified picture of semi-device-independent quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>ZX Graphical Calculus for Continuous-Variable Quantum Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-variable (CV) quantum information processing is a promising candidate for large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, analysis of CV quantum process relies mostly on direct computation of the evolution of operators in the Heisenberg picture, and the features of CV space has yet to be thoroughly investigated in an intuitive manner. One key ingredient for further exploration of CV quantum computing is the construction of a computational model that brings visual intuition and new tools for analysis. In this paper, we delve into a graphical computational model, inspired by a similar model for qubit-based systems called the ZX~calculus, that enables the representation of arbitrary CV quantum process as a simple directed graph. We demonstrate the utility of our model as a graphical tool to comprehend CV processes intuitively by showing how equivalences between two distinct quantum processes can be proven as a sequence of diagrammatic transformations in certain cases. We also examine possible applications of our model, such as measurement-based quantum computing, characterization of Gaussian and non-Gaussian processes, and circuit optimization.</description>

      <title>Memory-corrected quantum repeaters with adaptive syndrome identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the challenge of incorporating encoded quantum memories into an exact secret key rate analysis for small and intermediate-scale quantum repeaters. To this end, we introduce the check matrix model and quantify the resilience of stabilizer codes of up to eleven qubits against Pauli noise, obtaining analytical expressions for effective logical error probabilities. Generally, we find that the five-qubit and Steane codes either outperform more complex, larger codes in the experimentally relevant parameter regimes or have a lower resource overhead. Subsequently, we apply our results to calculate lower bounds on the asymptotic secret key rate in memory-corrected quantum repeaters when using the five-qubit or Steane codes on the memory qubits. The five-qubit code drastically increases the effective memory coherence time, reducing a phase flip probability of $1\%$ to $0.001\%$ when employing an error syndrome identification adapted to the quantum noise channel. Furthermore, it mitigates the impact of faulty Bell state measurements and imperfect state preparation, lowering the minimally required depolarization parameter for non-zero secret key rates in an eight-segment repeater from $98.4\%$ to $96.4\%$. As a result, the memory-corrected quantum repeater can often generate secret keys in experimental parameter regimes where the unencoded repeater fails to produce a secret key. In an eight-segment repeater, one can even achieve non-vanishing secret key rates up to distances of 2000 km for memory coherence times of $t_c = 10$ s or less using multiplexing. Assuming a zero-distance link-coupling efficiency $p_0 = 0.7$, a depolarization parameter $\mu = 0.99$, $t_c = 10$ s, and an 800 km total repeater length, we obtain a secret key rate of 4.85 Hz, beating both the unencoded repeater that provides 1.25 Hz and ideal twin-field quantum key distribution with 0.71 Hz at GHz clock rates.</description>

      <title>Quantum Mini-Apps: A Framework for Developing and Benchmarking Quantum-HPC Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the increasing maturity and scale of quantum hardware and its integration into HPC systems, there is a need to develop robust techniques for developing, characterizing, and benchmarking quantum-HPC applications and middleware systems. This requires a better understanding of interaction, coupling, and common execution patterns between quantum and classical workload tasks and components. This paper identifies six quantum-HPC execution motifs - recurring execution patterns characterized by distinct coupling and interaction modes. These motifs provide the basis for a suite of quantum mini-apps - simplified application prototypes that encapsulate essential characteristics of production systems. To support these developments, we introduce a mini-app framework that offers the necessary abstractions for creating and executing mini-apps across heterogeneous quantum-HPC infrastructure, making it a valuable tool for performance characterizations and middleware development.</description>

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states of light, such as GKP states, are essential resources for optical continuous-variable quantum computing. The ability to efficiently produce these states would open up tremendous prospects for quantum technologies in general and fault-tolerant quantum computing in particular. This letter demonstrates a versatile method using a quantum memory cavity to overcome the probabilistic nature of the breeding protocols and generate non-Gaussian states at high rates with scalability perspectives. The performances of our experimental setup are illustrated with the generation of Schr\"odinger cat states of amplitude alpha = 1.63 with a fidelity of more than 60% at a generation rate in the kHz range, which is higher than the state of the art for such states.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Dynamics in Quantum Continuous-Variable States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the weakness of gravitational coupling, all quantum experiments up to date in which gravity plays a role utilized the field of the Earth. Since this field undergoes practically undetectable back-action from quantum particles, it effectively admits a classical description as a fixed background Newtonian field or spacetime. This argument strongly motivates theoretical and experimental research towards a demonstration of gravitation between two quantum masses, as this is one of the most straightforward scenarios where quantum features of gravity could be observed. Several proposals studied the possibility of generating entanglement between two massive objects. Along the same lines, with a particular focus on gravity, this thesis introduces general tools to tackle interaction-mediated entanglement and applies them to two particles prepared in continuous-variable states.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization via a quantum projection filter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a simplified model of open quantum systems undergoing imperfect measurements obtained via a projection filter approach. We use this approximate filter in the feedback stabilization problem specifically in the case of Quantum Non-Demolition (QND) measurements. The feedback design relies on the structure of the exponential family utilized for the projection process. We demonstrate that the introduced feedback guarantees exponential convergence of the original filter equation toward a predefined target state, corresponding to an eigenstate of the measurement operator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study focuses on strategic-form games extended in the Eisert-Wilkens-Lewenstein scheme by two unitary operations. Conditions are determined under which the pair of unitary operators, along with classical strategies, form a game invariant under isomorphic transformations of the input classical game. These conditions are then applied to determine these operators, resulting in five main classes of games satisfying the isomorphism criterion, and a theorem is proved providing a practical criterion for this isomorphism. The interdependencies between different classes of extensions are identified, including limit cases in which one class transforms into another.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical and quantum mechanical descriptions of motion are fundamentally different. The universality of free fall (UFF) is a distinguishing feature of the classical motion (which has been verified with astonishing precision), while quantum theory tell us only about probabilities and uncertainties thus breaking the UFF. There are strong reasons to believe that the classical description must emerge, under plausible hypothesis, from quantum mechanics. In this Essay we show that the UFF is an emergent phenomenon: the coarse-grained quantum distribution for high energy levels leads to the classical distribution as the lowest order plus quantum corrections. We estimate the size of these corrections on the E\"otv\"os parameter and discuss the physical implications.</description>

      <title>Efficient soft-output decoders for the surface code</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoders that provide an estimate of the probability of a logical failure conditioned on the error syndrome ("soft-output decoders") can reduce the overhead cost of fault-tolerant quantum memory and computation. In this work, we construct efficient soft-output decoders for the surface code derived from the Minimum-Weight Perfect Matching and Union-Find decoders. We show that soft-output decoding can improve the performance of a "hierarchical code," a concatenated scheme in which the inner code is the surface code, and the outer code is a high-rate quantum low-density parity-check code. Alternatively, the soft-output decoding can improve the reliability of fault-tolerant circuit sampling by flagging those runs that should be discarded because the probability of a logical error is intolerably large.</description>

      <title>Phase coding semi-quantum key distribution system based on the Single-state protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-quantum key distribution (SQKD) allows sharing random keys between a quantum user and a classical user. However, implementing classical user operations is challenging, posing a hurdle to achieving the Single-state protocol. By using the "selective modulation" method, the feasibility of SQKD is verified in principle. The proposal of the selective modulation method enables the realization of other protocols for SQKD. To advance experimental progress in SQKD, we propose and implement a phase-encoded semi-quantum key distribution system based on the Single-state protocol and the "selective modulation" method. The system operates at a frequency of 100MHz and an average photon number of 0.1. The interference contrast achieved 96.52%, the average quantum bit error rate was 1.19%, and the raw key rate reached 88Kbps. Our experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and stability of the proposed phase-encoded semi-quantum key distribution system. Furthermore, by leveraging the "selective modulation" scheme proposed in this paper, we develop a comprehensive theoretical description of selective modulation. Through an analysis of quantum state evolution, we assess the security of our system, ultimately demonstrating its resilience against attacks targeting quantum states. The classical user of our system requires only two optical devices, significantly reducing the equipment requirements and enhancing its application potential. This work validates the feasibility of semi-quantum key distribution experiments and provides ideas for future research on semi-quantum key distribution experiments and security studies.</description>

      <title>A Room-Temperature Solid-State Maser Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Masers once represented the state-of-the-art in low noise microwave amplification technology, but eventually became obsolete due to their need for cryogenic cooling. Masers based on solid-state spin systems perform most effectively as amplifiers, since they provide a large density of spins and can therefore operate at relatively high powers. Whilst solid-state masers oscillators have been demonstrated at room temperature, continuous-wave amplification in these systems has only ever been realized at cryogenic temperatures. Here we report on a continuous-wave solid-state maser amplifier operating at room temperature. We achieve this feat using a practical setup that includes an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy center spins in a diamond crystal, a strong permanent magnet and simple laser diode. We describe important amplifier characteristics including gain, bandwidth, compression power and noise temperature and discuss the prospects of realizing a room-temperature near-quantum-noise-limited amplifier with this system. Finally, we show that in a different mode of operation the spins can be used to cool the system noise in an external circuit to cryogenic levels, all without the requirement for physical cooling.</description>

      <title>Distributed Quantum Computation with Minimum Circuit Execution Time over Quantum Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Present quantum computers are constrained by limited qubit capacity and restricted physical connectivity, leading to challenges in large-scale quantum computations. Distributing quantum computations across a network of quantum computers is a promising way to circumvent these challenges and facilitate large quantum computations. However, distributed quantum computations require entanglements (to execute remote gates) which can incur significant generation latency and, thus, lead to decoherence of qubits. In this work, we consider the problem of distributing quantum circuits across a quantum network to minimize the execution time. The problem entails mapping the circuit qubits to network memories, including within each computer since limited connectivity within computers can affect the circuit execution time. We provide two-step solutions for the above problem: In the first step, we allocate qubits to memories to minimize the estimated execution time; for this step, we design an efficient algorithm based on an approximation algorithm for the max-quadratic-assignment problem. In the second step, we determine an efficient execution scheme, including generating required entanglements with minimum latency under the network resource and decoherence constraints; for this step, we develop two algorithms with appropriate performance guarantees under certain settings or assumptions. We consider multiple protocols for executing remote gates, viz., telegates and cat-entanglements. With extensive simulations over NetSquid, a quantum network simulator, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our developed techniques and show that they outperform a scheme based on prior work by up to 95%.</description>

      <title>Optimized Generation of Entanglement by Real-Time Ordering of Swapping Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-distance quantum communication in quantum networks faces significant challenges due to the constraints imposed by the no-cloning theorem. Most existing quantum communication protocols rely on the a priori distribution of entanglement pairs (EPs), a process known to incur considerable latency due to its stochastic nature. In this work, we consider the problem of minimizing the latency of establishing an EP across a pair of nodes in a quantum network. While prior research has primarily focused on minimizing the expected generation latency by selecting {\em static} entanglement routes and/or swapping trees in advance, our approach considers a real-time adaptive strategy -- wherein the order of entanglement-swapping operations (hence, the swapping tree used) is progressively determined at runtime based on the runtime success/failure of the stochastic events. In this context, we present a greedy algorithm that iteratively determines the best route and/or entanglement-swapping operation to perform at each stage based on the current network. We evaluate our schemes on randomly generated networks and observe a reduction in latency of up to 40% from the optimal offline approach.</description>

      <title>Deviations from random matrix entanglement statistics for kicked quantum chaotic spin-$1/2$ chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is commonly expected that for quantum chaotic many body systems the statistical properties approach those of random matrices when increasing the system size. We demonstrate for various kicked spin-$1/2$ chain models that the average eigenstate entanglement indeed approaches the random matrix result. However, the distribution of the eigenstate entanglement differs significantly. While for autonomous systems such deviations are expected, they are surprising for the more scrambling kicked systems. We attribute the origin of the deviations to the local two-dimensional Hilbert spaces. This is also supported by similar deviations occurring in a local random matrix model with global diagonal coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite quantum communication is a promising way to build long distance quantum links, making it an essential complement to optical fiber for quantum internetworking beyond metropolitan scales. A satellite point to point optical link differs from the more common fiber links in many ways, both quantitative (higher latency, strong losses) and qualitative (nonconstant parameter values during satellite passage, intermittency of the link, impossibility to set repeaters between the satellite and the ground station). We study here the performance of a quantum link between two ground stations, using a quantum-memory-equipped satellite as a quantum repeater. In contrast with quantum key distribution satellite links, the number of available quantum memory slots m, together with the unavoidable round-trip communication latency t of at least a few milliseconds, severely reduces the effective average repetition rate to m/t -- at most a few kilohertz for foreseeable quantum memories. Our study uses two approaches, which validate each other: 1) a simple analytical model of the effective rate of the quantum link; 2) an event-based simulation using the open source Quantum Internet Simulation Package (QuISP). The important differences between satellite and fiber links led us to modify QuISP itself. This work paves the way to the study of hybrid satellite- and fiber-based quantum repeater networks interconnecting different metropolitan areas.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fighting against noise is crucial for NISQ devices to demonstrate practical quantum applications. In this work, we give a new paradigm of quantum error mitigation based on the vectorization of density matrices. Different from the ideas of existing quantum error mitigation methods that try to distill noiseless information from noisy quantum states, our proposal directly changes the way of encoding information and maps the density matrices of noisy quantum states to noiseless pure states, which is realized by a novel and NISQ-friendly measurement protocol and a classical post-processing procedure. Our protocol requires no knowledge of the noise model, no ability to tune the noise strength, and no ancilla qubits for complicated controlled unitaries. Under our encoding, NISQ devices are always preparing pure quantum states which are highly desired resources for variational quantum algorithms to have good performance in many tasks. We show how this protocol can be well-fitted into variational quantum algorithms. We give several concrete ansatz constructions that are suitable for our proposal and do theoretical analysis on the sampling complexity, the expressibility, and the trainability. We also give a discussion on how this protocol is influenced by large noise and how it can be well combined with other quantum error mitigation protocols. The effectiveness of our proposal is demonstrated by various numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of interferometric power as a discordlike measure in Markovian environments, such as dephasing, depolarizing, and generalized amplitude damping. Moreover, we compare the dynamics of interferometric power and entanglement by choosing proper initial conditions. Our study shows that in all cases where the sudden death of entanglement appears, interferometric power decays asymptotically. Therefore, quantum metrology based on interferometric power is more robust than entanglement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex quantum many-body dynamics spread initially localized quantum information across the entire system. Information scrambling refers to such a process, whose simulation is one of the promising applications of quantum computing. We demonstrate the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the interferometric protocol for calculating out-of-time-ordered correlators to study the scrambling property of a one-dimensional kicked-Ising model on 20-qubit trapped-ion quantum processors. The simulated quantum circuits have a geometrically local structure that exhibits the ballistic growth of entanglement, resulting in the circuit depth being linear in the number of qubits for the entire state to be scrambled. We experimentally confirm the growth of signals in the Hayden-Preskill recovery protocol and the decay of out-of-time-ordered correlators at late times. As an application of the created scrambling circuits, we also experimentally demonstrate the calculation of the microcanonical expectation values of local operators adopting the idea of thermal pure quantum states.</description>

      <title>Towards Robust Benchmarking of Quantum Optimization Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benchmarking the performance of quantum optimization algorithms is crucial for identifying utility for industry-relevant use cases. Benchmarking processes vary between optimization applications and depend on user-specified goals. The heuristic nature of quantum algorithms poses challenges, especially when comparing to classical counterparts. A key problem in existing benchmarking frameworks is the lack of equal effort in optimizing for the best quantum and, respectively, classical approaches. This paper presents a comprehensive set of guidelines comprising universal steps towards fair benchmarks. We discuss (1) application-specific algorithm choice, ensuring every solver is provided with the most fitting mathematical formulation of a problem; (2) the selection of benchmark data, including hard instances and real-world samples; (3) the choice of a suitable holistic figure of merit, like time-to-solution or solution quality within time constraints; and (4) equitable hyperparameter training to eliminate bias towards a particular method. The proposed guidelines are tested across three benchmarking scenarios, utilizing the Max-Cut (MC) and Travelling Salesperson Problem (TSP). The benchmarks employ classical mathematical algorithms, such as Branch-and-Cut (BNC) solvers, classical heuristics, Quantum Annealing (QA), and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).</description>

      <title>Analytical lower bound on the number of queries to a black-box unitary operation in deterministic exact transformations of unknown unitary operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several counter-intuitive go-theorems have recently been shown for transformations of unknown unitary operations; deterministic and exact complex conjugation, inversion, and transposition of a general $d$-dimensional unknown unitary operation are implementable with a finite number of queries of the black-box unitary operation. However, the minimum numbers of the required queries are not known except for $d=2$ unitary inversion and unitary transposition (numerical) and unitary conjugation (analytic). In this work, we derive complementary no-go theorems for deterministic and exact implementations of inversion and transposition of a $d$-dimensional unknown unitary operation under certain numbers of queries. The obtained no-go theorem indicates that the analytical lower bound of the number of queries for unitary inversion is $d^2$ and that for unitary transposition is $4$ for $d=2$ and $d+3$ for $d \geq 3$. We have developed a new framework that utilizes differentiation to obtain the analytical lower bounds on the number of queries to the black-box unitary operation required to implement a transformation given by a general differentiable function mapping a unitary operation to another unitary operation, which reproduces the lower bound of the number of queries for unitary complex conjugation $d-1$. As a corollary, we show the relationship between the tightness of the lower bounds and the existence of optimal catalytic transformations, which is a new aspect recently identified in the study of deterministic and exact unitary inversion. Furthermore, we extend our framework to the probabilistic setting where the transformation is required to succeed with a certain probability, thereby showing a possible tradeoff relation between query numbers and the required success probability.</description>

      <title>Mirror-enhanced acceleration induced geometric phase: towards detection of Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fulling-Davies-Unruh effect contains great amount of theoretical importance in various branches of physics. Requirement of very high acceleration hinders its experimental evidence. We propose a novel model to capture this effect experimentally through measuring the Pancharatnam-Berry phase (PBP) of the accelerated quantum system. We find that allowing the qubit's motion along one of the parallel directions of two parallel mirrors and by keeping it in between them, PBP can be greatly enhanced. Our investigation shows that for the current measurable PBP ($\sim 10^{-6}$ rad), energy gap $\sim1$ GHz of the qubit, distance between two mirrors $L\sim150$ (or $300)\,m$ and detector's position $z_0 \sim3.3\,m$ the required acceleration of the qubit can be as low as $a\sim 10^9~ m/s^2$. This value is potentially very achievable within the current technology and thereby providing a very close to realistic model for experimentally verify the aforesaid quantum phenomenon.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Clifford twirling for cost-optimal quantum error mitigation in early FTQC regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twirling noise affecting quantum gates is essential in understanding and controlling errors, but applicable operations to noise are usually restricted by symmetries inherent in quantum gates. In this Letter, we propose symmetric Clifford twirling, a Clifford twirling utilizing only symmetric Clifford operators that commute with certain Pauli subgroups. We fully characterize how each Pauli noise is converted through the twirling and show that certain Pauli noise can be scrambled to a noise exponentially close to the global white noise. We further demonstrate that the effective noise of some highly structured circuits, such as Trotterized Hamiltonian simulation circuits, is scrambled to global white noise, and even a single use of CNOT gate can significantly accelerate the scrambling. These findings enable us to mitigate errors in non-Clifford operations with minimal sampling overhead in the early stages of fault-tolerant quantum computing, where executing non-Clifford operations is expected to be significantly more challenging than Clifford operations. Furthermore, they offer new insights into various fields of physics where randomness and symmetry play crucial roles.</description>

      <title>Federated Hierarchical Tensor Networks: a Collaborative Learning Quantum AI-Driven Framework for Healthcare</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Healthcare industries frequently handle sensitive and proprietary data, and due to strict privacy regulations, they are often reluctant to share data directly. In today's context, Federated Learning (FL) stands out as a crucial remedy, facilitating the rapid advancement of distributed machine learning while effectively managing critical concerns regarding data privacy and governance. The fusion of federated learning and quantum computing represents a groundbreaking interdisciplinary approach with immense potential to revolutionize various industries, from healthcare to finance. In this work, we proposed a federated learning framework based on quantum tensor networks, which leverages the principles of many-body quantum physics. Currently, there are no known classical tensor networks implemented in federated settings. Furthermore, we investigated the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed framework by conducting a differential privacy analysis to ensure the security of sensitive data across healthcare institutions. Experiments on popular medical image datasets show that the federated quantum tensor network model achieved a mean receiver-operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC) between 0.91-0.98. Experimental results demonstrate that the quantum federated global model, consisting of highly entangled tensor network structures, showed better generalization and robustness and achieved higher testing accuracy, surpassing the performance of locally trained clients under unbalanced data distributions among healthcare institutions.</description>

      <title>Hype or Heuristic? Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Join Order Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying optimal join orders (JOs) stands out as a key challenge in database research and engineering. Owing to the large search space, established classical methods rely on approximations and heuristics. Recent efforts have successfully explored reinforcement learning (RL) for JO. Likewise, quantum versions of RL have received considerable scientific attention. Yet, it is an open question if they can achieve sustainable, overall practical advantages with improved quantum processors.
  In this paper, we present a novel approach that uses quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) for JO based on a hybrid variational quantum ansatz. It is able to handle general bushy join trees instead of resorting to simpler left-deep variants as compared to approaches based on quantum(-inspired) optimisation, yet requires multiple orders of magnitudes fewer qubits, which is a scarce resource even for post-NISQ systems.
  Despite moderate circuit depth, the ansatz exceeds current NISQ capabilities, which requires an evaluation by numerical simulations. While QRL may not significantly outperform classical approaches in solving the JO problem with respect to result quality (albeit we see parity), we find a drastic reduction in required trainable parameters. This benefits practically relevant aspects ranging from shorter training times compared to classical RL, less involved classical optimisation passes, or better use of available training data, and fits data-stream and low-latency processing scenarios. Our comprehensive evaluation and careful discussion delivers a balanced perspective on possible practical quantum advantage, provides insights for future systemic approaches, and allows for quantitatively assessing trade-offs of quantum approaches for one of the most crucial problems of database management systems.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian-based Quantum Reinforcement Learning for Neural Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in Quantum Computing (QC) and Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) represent promising steps in tackling complex computational challenges. On the one hand, Variational Quantum Algorithms such as QAOA can be used to solve a wide range of combinatorial optimization problems. On the other hand, the same class of problems can be solved by NCO, a method that has shown promising results, particularly since the introduction of Graph Neural Networks. Given recent advances in both research areas, we introduce Hamiltonian-based Quantum Reinforcement Learning (QRL), an approach at the intersection of QC and NCO. We model our ansatzes directly on the combinatorial optimization problem's Hamiltonian formulation, which allows us to apply our approach to a broad class of problems. Our ansatzes show favourable trainability properties when compared to the hardware efficient ansatzes, while also not being limited to graph-based problems, unlike previous works. In this work, we evaluate the performance of Hamiltonian-based QRL on a diverse set of combinatorial optimization problems to demonstrate the broad applicability of our approach and compare it to QAOA.</description>

      <title>Subradiance and Superradiant Long Range Excitation Transport among Quantum Emitter Ensembles in a Waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In contrast to free space, in waveguides the dispersive and dissipative dipole-dipole interactions among quantum emitters exhibit a periodic behavior over remarkably long distances. We propose a novel setup exploiting this long-range periodicity in order to create highly excited subradiant states and facilitate fast controlled collective energy transport amongst far-apart ensembles coupled to a waveguide. For sufficiently large ensembles collective superradiant emission into the fiber modes dominates over its free space counterpart. We show that for a large number of emitters a fast transverse coherent pulse can create almost perfect subradiant states with up to $50\%$ excitation. On the other hand, for a coherent excitation of one sub-ensemble above an overall excitation fraction of $50\%$ we find a nearly lossless and fast energy transfer to the ground state sub-ensemble. This transport can be enhanced or suppressed by controlling the positions of the ensembles relative to each other, while it can also be realized with a random position distribution. In the optimally enhanced case this fast transfer appears as superradiant emission with subsequent superabsorption, yet, without a superradiant decay after the absorption. The highly excited subradiant states as well as the superradiant excitation transfer appear as suitable building blocks in applications like active atomic clocks, quantum batteries, quantum information protocols and quantum metrology procedures such as fiber-based Ramsey schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the protocol of Gao and Jafferis arXiv:1911.07416 to allow wormhole teleportation between two entangled copies of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model communicating only through a classical channel. We demonstrate in finite $N$ simulations that the protocol exhibits the characteristic holographic features of wormhole teleportation discussed and summarized in Jafferis et al. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05424-3 . We review and exhibit in detail how these holographic features relate to size winding which, as first shown by Brown et al. arXiv:1911.06314 and Nezami et al. arXiv:2102.01064, encodes a dual description of wormhole teleportation.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>

Abstract: This dissertation explores quantum computation using qudits encoded into large spins, emphasizing the concept of quantum co-design to harness the unique capabilities of physical platforms for enhanced quantum information processing. First, we delve into the generation of high-fidelity universal gate sets for quantum computation with qudits. Leveraging principles from quantum optimal control, Rydberg physics, and the atomic structure of alkaline-earth atoms, we propose protocols for high-fidelity universal gate sets in the ground state of 87Sr with reasonable experimental parameters. Next, we analyze schemes to encode a qubit in the large spin qudits for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC). By comprehending the most dominant noise in the physical system, we develop FTQC protocols that outperform the standard protocols. Finally, considering spin qudits for neutral atom quantum computation, we studied protocols for converting leakage errors to erasure errors resource efficiently. Also, we developed cooling methods for neutral atoms without destroying the quantum information.</description>

      <title>Robust Quantum Sensing with Multiparameter Decorrelation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The performance of a quantum sensor is fundamentally limited by noise. This noise is particularly damaging when it becomes correlated with the readout of a target signal, caused by fluctuations of the sensor's operating parameters. These uncertainties limit sensitivity in a way that can be understood with multiparameter estimation theory. We develop a new approach, adaptable to any quantum platform, for designing robust sensing protocols that leverages multiparameter estimation theory and machine learning to decorrelate a target signal from fluctuating off-target (``nuisance'') parameters. Central to our approach is the identification of information-theoretic goals that guide a machine learning agent through an otherwise intractably large space of potential sensing protocols. As an illustrative example, we apply our approach to a reconfigurable optical lattice to design an accelerometer whose sensitivity is decorrelated from lattice depth noise. We demonstrate the effect of decorrelation on outcomes and Bayesian inferencing through statistical analysis in parameter space, and discuss implications for future applications in quantum metrology and computing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly-driven nonlinear optical processes such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion and spontaneous four-wave mixing can produce multiphoton nonclassical beams of light which have applications in quantum information processing and sensing. In contrast to the low-gain regime, new physical effects arise in a high-gain regime due to the interactions between the nonclassical light and the strong pump driving the nonlinear process. Here, we describe and experimentally observe a gain-induced group delay between the multiphoton pulses generated in a high-gain type-II spontaneous parametric down-conversion source. Since the group delay introduces distinguishability between the generated photons, it will be important to compensate for it when designing quantum interference devices in which strong optical nonlinearities are required.</description>

      <title>How much entanglement is needed for emergent anyons and fermions?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that particles with exotic properties can emerge in systems made of simple constituents such as qubits, due to long-range quantum entanglement. In this paper, we provide quantitative characterizations of entanglement necessary for emergent anyons and fermions by using the geometric entanglement measure (GEM) which quantifies the maximal overlap between a given state and any short-range entangled states. For systems with emergent anyons, based on the braiding statistics, we show that the GEM scales linearly in the system size regardless of microscopic details. The phenomenon of emergent anyons can also be understood within the framework of quantum error correction (QEC). Specifically, we show that the GEM of any 2D stabilizer codes must be at least quadratic in the code distance. Our proof is based on a generic prescription for constructing string operators, establishing a rigorous and direct connection between emergent anyons and QEC. For systems with emergent fermions, despite that the ground state subspaces could be exponentially huge and their coding properties could be rather poor, we show that the GEM also scales linearly in the system size. Our results also establish an intriguing link between quantum anomaly and entanglement: a quantum state respecting anomalous $1$-form symmetries, be it pure or mixed, must be long-range entangled, offering a non-trivial class of intrinsically mixed state phases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14938v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While a wide variety of astrophysical and cosmological phenomena suggest the presence of Dark Matter, all evidence remains via its gravitational effect on the known matter. As such, it is conceivable that this evidence could be explained by a modification to gravitation and/or concepts of inertia. Various formulations of modified gravity exist, each giving rise to several non-canonical outcomes. This motivates us to propose an experiment searching for departures from (quantum) Newtonian predictions in a bipartite setting with gravitational accelerations $\lesssim 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$, i.e., where the effective force needs to be stronger than Newtonian to account for the Dark Matter effects. Since quantum particles naturally source weak gravitation, their non-relativistic dynamics offers opportunities to test this small acceleration regime. We show that two nearby mesoscopic quantum masses accumulate significantly larger entanglement in modified gravity models, such as the Modified Newtonian Dynamics. Our calculations include Casimir-Polder forces as well as tidal effects next to the surface of the earth, and confirm that entanglement is observable within the limits imposed by environmental decoherence. We demonstrate how the temperature can be fine-tuned such that modified gravity is certified simply by witnessing the entanglement generated from uncorrelated thermal states, eliminating the need for precise noise characterization. Overall, the required parameters could be realized in a tabletop experiment.</description>

Abstract: We investigate one-photon annihilation of the electron-positron pair in the field of a central, very heavy and positively charged atomic nucleus. The explicit formula for the annihilation rate of this process $\Gamma^{(b)}_{1 \gamma}$ is derived. Our formula for this rate can directly be used to describe the actual one-photon annihilation in the ground (bound) states of all positronium hydrides HPs, quasi-stable triplet states of the positron-helium atoms $e^{+}[$ He($2^{3}S_e$)] ions and other systems.</description>

Given the human bias of favouring the familiar over the unknown, early exposure to concepts of quantum information helps learners build stronger appetence for the field, as well as allowing them to develop an intuitive approach to it. In this work, I present an intuitive gamified approach to one of the core concepts in quantum error correction: the stabiliser formalism.</description>

      <title>New Procedure for Evaluation of U(3) Coupling and Recoupling Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A simple method to calculate Wigner coupling coefficients and Racah recoupling coefficients for U(3) in two group-subgroup chains is presented. While the canonical U(3)-&gt;U(2)-&gt;U(1) coupling and recoupling coefficients are applicable to any system that respects U(3) symmetry, the U(3)-&gt;SO(3) coupling coefficients are more specific to nuclear structure studies. This new procedure precludes the use of binomial coefficients and alternating sums which were used in the 1973 formulation of Draayer and Akiyama, and hence provides faster and more accurate output of requested results. The resolution of the outer multiplicity is based on the null space concept of the U(3) generators proposed by Arne Alex et al., whereas the inner multiplicity in the angular momentum subgroup chain is obtained from the dimension of the null space of the SO(3) raising operator. A C++ library built on this new methodology will be published in a complementary journal that specializes in the management and distribution of such programs.</description>

      <title>Revolutionizing Quantum Mechanics: The Birth and Evolution of the Many-Worlds Interpretation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Many-worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics has captivated physicists and philosophers alike since its inception in the mid-20th century. This paper explores the historical roots, evolution, and implications of the MWI within the context of quantum theory. Beginning with an overview of early developments in quantum mechanics and the emergence of foundational interpretations, we delve into the origins of the MWI through the groundbreaking work of physicist Hugh Everett III. Everett's doctoral thesis proposed a radical solution to the measurement problem, positing the existence of multiple branching universes to account for quantum phenomenon. We trace the evolution of the MWI, examining its refinement and elaboration by subsequent physicists such as John Wheeler. Furthermore, we discuss the MWI's impact on contemporary physics, including its connections to quantum information theory and ongoing experimental tests. By providing a comprehensive analysis of the MWI's historical development and current relevance, this paper offers insights into one of the most provocative interpretations of quantum mechanics and its implications for our understanding of the universe.</description>

      <title>Mixed quantum-classical modeling of exciton-phonon scattering in solids: Application to optical linewidths of monolayer MoS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07058v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a mixed quantum-classical framework for the microscopic and non-Markovian modeling of exciton-phonon scattering in solid-state materials, and apply it to calculate the optical linewidths of monolayer MoS2. Within this framework, we combine reciprocal-space mixed quantum-classical dynamics with models for the quasiparticle band structure as well as the electron-hole and carrier-phonon interactions, parametrized against ab initio calculations, although noting that a direct interfacing with ab initio calculations is straightforward in principle. We introduce various parameters for truncating the Brillouin zone to select regions of interest. Variations of these parameters allow us to determine linewidths in the limit of asymptotic material sizes. Obtained asymptotic linewidths are found to agree favorably with experimental measurements across a range of temperatures. As such, our framework establishes itself as a promising route towards unraveling the non-Markovian and microscopic principles governing the nonadiabatic dynamics of solids.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Bell Tests with Decoherence Effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07141v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inflationary universe creates particle pairs, which are entangled in their momenta due to momentum conservation. Operators involving the momenta of the fluctuations can be rewritten into pseudo-spin operators, such as the Gour-Khanna-Mann-Revzen (GKMR) pseudo-spin. Making use of these pseudo-spin operators, cosmological Bell inequalities can be formulated. The violation of these Bell inequalities indicates the quantum nature of primordial fluctuations.
  In this work, we focus on primordial curvature perturbations. Since curvature perturbations arise from gravity, their action includes the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. We clarify the role of the boundary term in selecting suitable initial conditions for linear perturbations.
  After that, we proceed to the interactions of cosmological perturbations, including the bulk and boundary interaction terms, which introduce decoherence effects. These decoherence effects change the expectation value of the Bell operator, and gradually restore the Bell inequality. We describe this process by a ``Bell test curve'', which offers a window for testing the quantum origin of cosmological perturbations. We also explore the possibility of extracting the information of the decoherence rate and the structure of primordial interactions from the Bell test curve.</description>

      <title>Dual role of longitudinal optical phonons for generation of coherent oscillations in gallium arsenide under optical pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07159v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel and simple picture of the generation dynamics of coherent longitudinal optical (LO) phonons and LO-phonon-plasmon-coupled (LOPC) modes by the ultrafast infrared pump-pulses in gallium arsenide (GaAs) employing the low-temperature approximation. LO phonons exhibit a pronounced coupling with plasmons formed by the optically excited electrons in the excited states of GaAs. This coupling results in the coherent oscillation of the LOPC modes in the excited states. The pump pulse also induces stimulated Raman scattering, which generates the coherent LO-phonon oscillation in the ground state. This picture is incorporated into a simplified model, and the time evolution of the density operator is calculated using the Lindblad-type quantum master equation. The theoretical results explain well the reported experimental results on the coherent oscillation of LO phonons and LOPC modes observed through transient reflection measurements. Above all, our model provides a natural reason for the simultaneous manifestation of the LO phonons and the LOPC modes.</description>

      <title>Necessity of orthogonal basis vectors for the two-anyon problem in one-dimensional lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Few-body physics for anyons has been intensively studied within the anyon-Hubbard model, including the quantum walk and Bloch oscillations of two-anyon states. However, the known theoretical proposal and experimental simulations of two-anyon states in one-dimensional lattice have been carried out by expanding the wavefunction in terms of non-orthogonal basis vectors, which introduces extra non-physical degrees of freedom. In the present work, we deduce the finite difference equations for the two-anyon state in the one-dimensional lattice by solving the Schr\"odinger equation with orthogonal basis vectors. Such an orthogonal scheme gives all the orthogonal physical eigenstates for the time-independent two-anyon Schr\"odinger equation, while the conventional (non-orthogonal) method produces a lot of non-physical redundant eigen-solutions whose components violate the anyonic relations. The dynamical property of the two-anyon states in a sufficiently large lattice has been investigated and compared in both the orthogonal and conventional schemes, which proves to depend crucially on the initial states. When the initial states with two anyons on the same site or (next-)neighboring sites are suitably chosen to be in accordance with the anyonic coefficient relation, we observe exactly the same dynamical behavior in the two schemes, including the revival probability, the probability density function, and the two-body correlation, otherwise, the conventional scheme will produce erroneous results which not any more describe anyons. The period of the Bloch oscillation in the pseudo-fermionic limit is found to be twice that in the bosonic limit, while the oscillations disappear for statistical parameters in between. Our findings are vital for quantum simulations of few-body physics with anyons in the lattice.</description>

      <title>Feynman Paradox about the Josephson effect and a sawtooth current in the double junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the Feynman approach to the Josephson effect, which employs a pair of linear coupling equations for its modeling. It is found that while the exact solutions can account for the AC Josephson effect when the coupling strength is significantly less than the voltage, they fail to produce the DC Josephson effect in any practical scenario. To address this fundamental discrepancy, we derive the coupled Ginzburg-Landau (GL) equations for two interconnected superconductors based on BCS theory. These equations reveal that the nonlinear coupling, which is overlooked in the Feynman method, is crucial in describing the spontaneous symmetry breaking in superconductors, a critical factor for achieving the DC Josephson effect. When the coupled GL equations are applied to a double junction, a sawtooth current pattern emerges, a result unattainable via the Feynman approach.</description>

      <title>Laser-painted cavity-mediated interactions in a quantum gas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental platforms based on ultracold atomic gases have significantly advanced the quantum simulation of complex systems, yet the exploration of phenomena driven by long-range interactions remains a formidable challenge. Currently available methods utilizing dipolar quantum gases or multi-mode cavities allow to implement long-range interactions with a $1/r^3$ character or with a spatial profile fixed by the mode-structure of the vacuum electromagnetic field surrounding the atoms, respectively. Here we propose an experimental scheme employing laser-painted cavity-mediated interactions, which enables the realization of atom-atom interactions that are fully tunable in range, shape, and sign. Our approach combines the versatility of cavity quantum electrodynamics with the precision of laser manipulation, thus providing a highly flexible platform for simulating and understanding long-range interactions in quantum many-body systems. Our analytical predictions are supported by numerical simulations describing the full dynamics of atoms, laser, and cavity. The latter demonstrate that there is a wide and experimentally accessible parameter regime where our protocol optimally works. The methodology not only paves the way for exploring new territories in quantum simulation but also enhances the understanding of fundamental physics, potentially leading to the discovery of novel quantum states and phases.</description>

      <title>InAs on Insulator: A New Platform for Cryogenic Hybrid Superconducting Electronics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting circuits based on hybrid InAs Josephson Junctions (JJs) play a starring role in the design of fast and ultra-low power consumption solid-state quantum electronics and exploring novel physical phenomena. Conventionally, 3D substrates, 2D quantum wells (QWs), and 1D nanowires (NWs) made of InAs are employed to create superconductive circuits with hybrid JJs. Each platform has its advantages and disadvantages. Here, we proposed the InAs-on-insulator (InAsOI) as a groundbreaking platform for developing superconducting electronics. An epilayer of semiconductive InAs with different electron densities was grown onto an InAlAs metamorphic buffer layer, efficiently used as a cryogenic insulator to decouple adjacent devices electrically. JJs with various lengths and widths were fabricated employing Al as a superconductor and InAs with different electron densities. We achieved a switching current density of 7.3 uA/um, a critical voltage of 50-to-80 uV, and a critical temperature equal to that of the superconductor used. For all the JJs, the switching current follows a characteristic Fraunhofer pattern with an out-of-plane magnetic field. These achievements enable the use of InAsOI to design and fabricate surface-exposed Josephson Field Effect Transistors with high critical current densities and superior gating properties.</description>

Abstract: In recent years, the systems comprising of bosonic atoms confined to optical lattices at ultra-cold temperatures have demonstrated tremendous potential to unveil novel quantum mechanical effects appearing in lattice boson models with various kinds of interactions. In this progress report, we aim to provide an exposition to recent advancements in quantum simulations of such systems, modeled by different "non-standard" Bose-Hubbard models, focusing primarily on long-range systems with dipole-dipole or cavity-mediated interactions. Through a carefully curated selection of topics, which includes the emergence of quantum criticality beyond Landau paradigm, bond-order wave insulators, the role of interaction-induced tunneling, the influence of transverse confinement on observed phases, or the effect of cavity-mediated all-to-all interactions, we report both theoretical and experimental developments from the last few years. Additionally, we discuss the real-time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, where sufficiently strong interactions render the dynamics non-ergodic. And finally to cap our discussions off, we survey recent experimental achievements in this rapidly evolving field, underscoring its interdisciplinary significance and potential for groundbreaking discoveries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent work has exposed the idea that interesting quantum-like probability laws, including interference effects, can be manifest in classical systems. Here we propose a model for quantum-like (QL) states and QL bits. We suggest a way that huge, complex systems can host robust states that can process information in a QL fashion. Axioms that such states should satisfy are proposed. Specifically, it is shown that building blocks suited for QL states are networks, possibly very complex, that we defined based on $k$-regular random graphs. These networks can dynamically encode a lot of information that is distilled into the emergent states we can use for QL like processing. Although the emergent states are classical, they have properties analogous to quantum states. Concrete examples of how QL functions are possible are given. The possibility of a `QL advantage' for computing-type operations and the potential relevance for new kinds of function in the brain are discussed and left as open questions.</description>

      <title>Revisiting dynamics of quantum causal structures -- when can causal order evolve?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2008.12757v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, there has been substantial interest in studying the dynamics of quantum theory beyond that of states, in particular, the dynamics of channels, measurements, and higher-order transformations. Ref. [Phys.~Rev.~X 8(1), 011047 (2018)] pursues this using the process matrix formalism, together with a definition of the possible dynamics of such process matrices, and focusing especially on the question of evolution of causal structures. One of its major conclusions is a strong theorem saying that, within the formalism, under continuous and reversible transformations, the causal order between operations must be preserved. Here we find a surprising result: if one is to take into account a full picture of the physical evolution of operations within the standard quantum-mechanical formalism, then one can actually draw the opposite conclusion. That is, we show that under certain continuous and reversible dynamics the causal order between operations is not necessarily preserved. We moreover identify and analyse the root of this apparent contradiction, specifically, that the commonly accepted and widely applied framework of higher-order processes, whilst mathematically sound, is not always appropriate for drawing conclusions on the fundamentals of physical dynamics. Finally we show how to reconcile the elements of the whole picture following the intuition based on entanglement processing by local operations and classical communication.</description>

Abstract: The study of recurrences and revivals in quantum systems has attracted a great deal of interest because of its importance in the control of quantum systems and its potential use in developing new technologies. In this work, we introduce a protocol to induce full-state revivals in a huge class of quantum walks on a $d$-dimensional lattice governed by a $c$-dimensional coin system. The protocol requires two repeated interventions in the coin degree of freedom. We also present a characterization of the walks that admits such a protocol. Moreover, we modify the quantity known as P\'olya number, typically used in the study of recurrences in classical random walks and quantum walks, to create a witness of the first revival of the walk.</description>

Abstract: A set of orthogonal product states is strongly nonlocal if it is locally irreducible in every bipartition, which shows the phenomenon of strong quantum nonlocality without entanglement. Although such a phenomenon has been shown to any three-, four-, and five-partite systems, the existence of strongly nonlocal orthogonal product sets in multipartite systems remains unknown. In this paper, by using a general decomposition of the $N$-dimensional hypercubes, we present strongly nonlocal orthogonal product sets in $N$-partite systems for all odd $N\geq 3$. Based on this decomposition, we give explicit constructions of unextendible product bases in $N$-partite systems for odd $N\geq 3$. Furthermore, we apply our results to quantum secret sharing, uncompletable product bases, and PPT entangled states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.08566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum neural network architectures that have little-to-no inductive biases are known to face trainability and generalization issues. Inspired by a similar problem, recent breakthroughs in machine learning address this challenge by creating models encoding the symmetries of the learning task. This is materialized through the usage of equivariant neural networks whose action commutes with that of the symmetry. In this work, we import these ideas to the quantum realm by presenting a comprehensive theoretical framework to design equivariant quantum neural networks (EQNN) for essentially any relevant symmetry group. We develop multiple methods to construct equivariant layers for EQNNs and analyze their advantages and drawbacks. Our methods can find unitary or general equivariant quantum channels efficiently even when the symmetry group is exponentially large or continuous. As a special implementation, we show how standard quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN) can be generalized to group-equivariant QCNNs where both the convolution and pooling layers are equivariant to the symmetry group. We then numerically demonstrate the effectiveness of a SU(2)-equivariant QCNN over symmetry-agnostic QCNN on a classification task of phases of matter in the bond-alternating Heisenberg model. Our framework can be readily applied to virtually all areas of quantum machine learning. Lastly, we discuss about how symmetry-informed models such as EQNNs provide hopes to alleviate central challenges such as barren plateaus, poor local minima, and sample complexity.</description>

      <title>Certified Everlasting Secure Collusion-Resistant Functional Encryption, and More</title>

      <description>arXiv:2302.10354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study certified everlasting secure functional encryption (FE) and many other cryptographic primitives in this work. Certified everlasting security roughly means the following. A receiver possessing a quantum cryptographic object can issue a certificate showing that the receiver has deleted the cryptographic object and information included in the object was lost. If the certificate is valid, the security is guaranteed even if the receiver becomes computationally unbounded after the deletion. Many cryptographic primitives are known to be impossible (or unlikely) to have information-theoretical security even in the quantum world. Hence, certified everlasting security is a nice compromise (intrinsic to quantum).
  In this work, we define certified everlasting secure versions of FE, compute-and-compare obfuscation, predicate encryption (PE), secret-key encryption (SKE), public-key encryption (PKE), receiver non-committing encryption (RNCE), and garbled circuits. We also present the following constructions:
  - Adaptively certified everlasting secure collusion-resistant public-key FE for all polynomial-size circuits from indistinguishability obfuscation and one-way functions.

      <title>Quantum dichotomies and coherent thermodynamics beyond first-order asymptotics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.05524v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the problem of exact and approximate transformation of quantum dichotomies in the asymptotic regime, i.e., the existence of a quantum channel $\mathcal E$ mapping $\rho_1^{\otimes n}$ into $\rho_2^{\otimes R_nn}$ with an error $\epsilon_n$ (measured by trace distance) and $\sigma_1^{\otimes n}$ into $\sigma_2^{\otimes R_n n}$ exactly, for a large number $n$. We derive second-order asymptotic expressions for the optimal transformation rate $R_n$ in the small, moderate, and large deviation error regimes, as well as the zero-error regime, for an arbitrary pair $(\rho_1,\sigma_1)$ of initial states and a commuting pair $(\rho_2,\sigma_2)$ of final states. We also prove that for $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ given by thermal Gibbs states, the derived optimal transformation rates in the first three regimes can be attained by thermal operations. This allows us, for the first time, to study the second-order asymptotics of thermodynamic state interconversion with fully general initial states that may have coherence between different energy eigenspaces. Thus, we discuss the optimal performance of thermodynamic protocols with coherent inputs and describe three novel resonance phenomena allowing one to significantly reduce transformation errors induced by finite-size effects. What is more, our result on quantum dichotomies can also be used to obtain, up to second-order asymptotic terms, optimal conversion rates between pure bipartite entangled states under local operations and classical communication.</description>

Abstract: Generalization is the ability of machine learning models to make accurate predictions on new data by learning from training data. However, understanding generalization of quantum machine learning models has been a major challenge. Here, we introduce the data quantum Fisher information metric (DQFIM). It describes the capacity of variational quantum algorithms depending on variational ansatz, training data and their symmetries. We apply the DQFIM to quantify circuit parameters and training data needed to successfully train and generalize. Using the dynamical Lie algebra, we explain how to generalize using a low number of training states. Counter-intuitively, breaking symmetries of the training data can help to improve generalization. Finally, we find that out-of-distribution generalization, where training and testing data are drawn from different data distributions, can be better than using the same distribution. Our work provides a useful framework to explore the power of quantum machine learning models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stabilizer entropies (SEs) are measures of nonstabilizerness or `magic' that quantify the degree to which a state is described by stabilizers. SEs are especially interesting due to their connections to scrambling, localization and property testing. However, applications have been limited so far as previously known measurement protocols for SEs scale exponentially with the number of qubits. Here, we efficiently measure SEs for integer R\'enyi index $n&gt;1$ via Bell measurements. The SE of $N$-qubit quantum states can be measured with $O(n)$ copies and $O(nN)$ classical computational time, where for even $n$ we additionally require the complex conjugate of the state. We provide efficient bounds of various nonstabilizerness monotones which are intractable to compute beyond a few qubits. Using the IonQ quantum computer, we measure SEs of random Clifford circuits doped with non-Clifford gates and give bounds for the stabilizer fidelity, stabilizer extent and robustness of magic. We provide efficient algorithms to measure Clifford-averaged $4n$-point out-of-time-order correlators and multifractal flatness. With these measures we study the scrambling time of doped Clifford circuits and random Hamiltonian evolution depending on nonstabilizerness. Counter-intuitively, random Hamiltonian evolution becomes less scrambled at long times which we reveal with the multifractal flatness. Our results open up the exploration of nonstabilizerness with quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Search for Multiple Adjacent Marked Vertices on the Hypercube by a Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19614v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a strong interest in quantum search algorithms, particularly in problems with multiple adjacent solutions. In the hypercube, part of the energy of the quantum system is retained in states adjacent to the target states, decreasing the chances of the target states being observed. This paper applies the Multiself-loop Lackadaisical Quantum Walk with Partial Phase Inversion to search for multiple adjacent marked vertices on the hypercube. Aspects like the type of marked vertices are considered in addition to using multiple self-loops and weight compositions. Two scenarios are analyzed. Firstly, the relative position of non-adjacent marked vertices together with adjacent marked vertices. Secondly, only adjacent marked vertices are analyzed. Here, we show experimentally that, with partial phase inversion, a quantum walk can amplify the probability amplitudes of the target states, reaching success probabilities of values close to $1$. We also show that the relative position of non-adjacent marked vertices does not significantly influence the search results. Our results demonstrate that the partial phase inversion of target states is a promising alternative to search adjacent solutions with quantum walks, which is a key capacity for real search applications.</description>

      <title>Transition Role of Entangled Data in Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entanglement serves as the resource to empower quantum computing. Recent progress has highlighted its positive impact on learning quantum dynamics, wherein the integration of entanglement into quantum operations or measurements of quantum machine learning (QML) models leads to substantial reductions in training data size, surpassing a specified prediction error threshold. However, an analytical understanding of how the entanglement degree in data affects model performance remains elusive. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by establishing a quantum no-free-lunch (NFL) theorem for learning quantum dynamics using entangled data. Contrary to previous findings, we prove that the impact of entangled data on prediction error exhibits a dual effect, depending on the number of permitted measurements. With a sufficient number of measurements, increasing the entanglement of training data consistently reduces the prediction error or decreases the required size of the training data to achieve the same prediction error. Conversely, when few measurements are allowed, employing highly entangled data could lead to an increased prediction error. The achieved results provide critical guidance for designing advanced QML protocols, especially for those tailored for execution on early-stage quantum computers with limited access to quantum resources.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04398v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The correlation function in quantum systems plays a vital role in decoding their properties and gaining insights into physical phenomena. Its interpretation corresponds to the propagation of particle excitations between space-time, similar in spirit to the idea of quantum weak measurement in terms of recording the system information by interaction. By defining weak-valued correlation function, we propose the basic insights and the universal methods for recording them on the apparatus through weak measurement. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we perform numerical experiments of perturbed quantum harmonic oscillators, addressing the intricate interplay between the coupling strength and the number of ensemble copies. Additionally, we extend our protocol to the domain of quantum field theory, where joint weak values encode crucial information about the correlation function. Hopefully, this comprehensive investigation can advance our understanding of the fundamental nature of the correlation function and weak measurement in quantum theories.</description>

Abstract: We first show that the standard deviation error of quantum amplitude estimation is asymptotically lower bounded by approximately $1.28 L^{-1}$, where $L$ is the number of queries. Then we propose a generalized qubitization that can block-encode several polynomial functions simultaneously, and show how it can help estimating quantum amplitude to achieve the optimal asymptotic accuracy, so the bound is tight.</description>

Abstract: This study delves into the validity of quantum mechanical operators in the context of quantum gravity, recognizing the potential need for their generalization. A primary objective is to investigate the repercussions of these generalizations on the inherent non-locality within quantum mechanics, as exemplified by Bell's inequality. Additionally, the study scrutinizes the consequences of introducing a non-zero minimal length into the established framework of Bell's inequality. The findings contribute significantly to our theoretical comprehension of the intricate interplay between quantum mechanics and gravity. Moreover, this research explores the impact of quantum gravity on Bell's inequality and its practical applications within quantum technologies, notably in the realms of device-independent protocols, quantum key distribution, and quantum randomness generation.</description>

      <title>Entangling interactions between artificial atoms mediated by a multimode left-handed superconducting ring resonator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting metamaterial transmission lines implemented with lumped circuit elements can exhibit left-handed dispersion, where the group and phase velocity have opposite sign, in a frequency range relevant for superconducting artificial atoms. Forming such a metamaterial transmission line into a ring and coupling it to qubits at different points around the ring results in a multimode bus resonator with a compact footprint. Using flux-tunable qubits, we characterize and theoretically model the variation in the coupling strength between the two qubits and each of the ring resonator modes. Although the qubits have negligible direct coupling between them, their interactions with the multimode ring resonator result in both a transverse exchange coupling and a higher order $ZZ$ interaction between the qubits. As we vary the detuning between the qubits and their frequency relative to the ring resonator modes, we observe significant variations in both of these inter-qubit interactions, including zero crossings and changes of sign. The ability to modulate interaction terms such as the $ZZ$ scale between zero and large values for small changes in qubit frequency provides a promising pathway for implementing entangling gates in a system capable of hosting many qubits.</description>

      <title>Note on the Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit for arbitrary fidelity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For vanishing fidelity between initial and final states two important quantum speed limits, the Mandelstam-Tamm limit (involving energy dispersion) and Margolus-Levitin one (involving excitation energy expectation value) have been derived. While the generalization of the former limit to the case of arbitrary fidelity is straightforward, the relevant generalization of the latter, given in the seminal paper by Giovanetti et al (Phys. Rev. A67 (2003), 052109) was based on the conjectured equality of lower and upper bounds on the right hand side of generalized Margolus-Levitin inequality, verified numerically up to seven digits. Only recently there appear two proofs of the conjecture. We provide below a very elementary new proof, based on the simplest tools from differential calculus. Thus the generalized Margolus-Levitin speed limit can be derived much in the spirit of the original one valid for vanishing fidelity.</description>

Abstract: Grover adaptive search (GAS) is a quantum exhaustive search algorithm designed to solve binary optimization problems. In this paper, we propose higher-order binary formulations that can simultaneously reduce the numbers of qubits and gates required for GAS. Specifically, we consider two novel strategies: one that reduces the number of gates through polynomial factorization, and the other that halves the order of the objective function, subsequently decreasing circuit runtime and implementation cost. Our analysis demonstrates that the proposed higher-order formulations improve the convergence performance of GAS by both reducing the search space size and the number of quantum gates. Our strategies are also beneficial for general combinatorial optimization problems using one-hot encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02655v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The performance of various superconducting devices operating at ultra-low temperatures is impaired by the presence of non-equilibrium quasiparticles. Inelastic quasiparticle (QP) tunneling across Josephson junctions in superconducting qubits results in decoherence and spurious excitations and, notably, can trigger correlated errors that severely impede quantum error correction. In this work, we use "gap engineering" to suppress the tunneling of low-energy quasiparticles in Al-based transmon qubits, a leading building block for superconducting quantum processors. By implementing potential barriers for QP, we strongly suppress QP tunneling across the junction and preserve charge parity for over $10^3$ seconds. The suppression of QP tunneling also results in a reduction in the qubit energy relaxation rates. The demonstrated approach to gap engineering can be easily implemented in all Al-based circuits with Josephson junctions.</description>

Abstract: Colour centres in silicon carbide emerge as a promising semiconductor quantum technology platform with excellent spin-optical coherences.However, recent efforts towards maximising the photonic efficiency via integration into nanophotonic structures proved to be challenging due to reduced spectral stabilities. Here, we provide a large-scale systematic investigation on silicon vacancy centres in thin silicon carbide membranes with thicknesses down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$. Our membrane fabrication process involves a combination of chemical mechanical polishing, reactive ion etching, and subsequent annealing. This leads to highly reproducible membranes with roughness values of $3-4\,\rm\r{A}$, as well as negligible surface fluorescence. We find that silicon vacancy centres show close-to lifetime limited optical linewidths with almost no signs of spectral wandering down to membrane thicknesses of $0.7 \,\rm\mu m$. For silicon vacancy centres in thinner membranes down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$, we observe spectral wandering, however, optical linewidths remain below $200\,\rm MHz$, which is compatible with spin-selective excitation schemes. Our work clearly shows that silicon vacancy centres can be integrated into sub-micron silicon carbide membranes, which opens the avenue towards obtaining the necessary improvements in photon extraction efficiency based on nanophotonic structuring.</description>

      <title>Invalidation of the Bloch-Redfield Equation in Sub-Ohmic Regime via a Practical Time-Convolutionless Fourth-Order Master Equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15089v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in quantum sciences, a quantum master equation that accurately and simply characterizes open quantum dynamics across extremely long timescales and in dispersive environments is still needed. In this study, we optimize the computation of the fourth-order time-convolutionless master equation to meet this need. Early versions of this master equation required computing a multidimensional integral, limiting its use. Our master equation accounts for simultaneous relaxation and dephasing, resulting in coefficients proportional to the system's spectral density over frequency derivative. In sub-Ohmic environments, this derivative induces infrared divergence in the master equation, invalidating the second-order Bloch-Redfield master equation findings. We analyze the approach to a ground state in a generic open quantum system and demonstrate that it is not reliably computed by the Bloch-Redfield equation alone. The optimized fourth-order equation shows that the ground-state approach is accurate to second order in bath coupling regardless of the dispersion, even though it can diverge in the fourth order at zero temperature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unitary t-designs are distributions on the unitary group whose first t moments appear maximally random. Previous work has established several upper bounds on the depths at which certain specific random quantum circuit ensembles approximate t-designs. Here we show that these bounds can be extended to any fixed architecture of Haar-random two-site gates. This is accomplished by relating the spectral gaps of such architectures to those of 1D brickwork architectures. Our bound depends on the details of the architecture only via the typical number of layers needed for a block of the circuit to form a connected graph over the sites. When this quantity is independent of width, the circuit forms an approximate t-design in linear depth. We also give an implicit bound for nondeterministic architectures in terms of properties of the corresponding distribution over fixed architectures.</description>

      <title>Security Proof for Variable-Length Quantum Key Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01600v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a security proof for variable-length QKD in the Renner framework against IID collective attacks. Our proof can be lifted to coherent attacks using the postselection technique. Our first main result is a theorem to convert a series of security proofs for fixed-length protocols satisfying certain conditions to a security proof for a variable-length protocol. This conversion requires no new calculations, does not require any changes to the final key lengths or the amount of error-correction information, and at most doubles the security parameter. Our second main result is the description and security proof of a more general class of variable-length QKD protocols, which does not require characterizing the honest behaviour of the channel connecting the users before the execution of the QKD protocol. Instead, these protocols adaptively determine the length of the final key, and the amount of information to be used for error-correction, based upon the observations made during the protocol. We apply these results to the qubit BB84 protocol, and show that variable-length implementations lead to higher expected key rates than the fixed-length implementations.</description>

Abstract: We consider the discrimination of bipartite quantum states and establish a relation between nonlocal quantum state ensemble and quantum data hiding processing. Using a bound on optimal local discrimination of bipartite quantum states, we provide a sufficient condition for a bipartite quantum state ensemble to be used to construct a quantum data-hiding scheme. Our results are illustrated by examples in multidimensional bipartite quantum systems.</description>

      <title>One Gate Scheme to Rule Them All: Introducing a Complex Yet Reduced Instruction Set for Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The design and architecture of a quantum instruction set are paramount to the performance of a quantum computer. This work introduces a gate scheme for qubits with $XX+YY$ coupling that directly and efficiently realizes any two-qubit gate up to single-qubit gates. First, this scheme enables high-fidelity execution of quantum operations and achieves minimum possible gate times. Second, since the scheme spans the entire $\textbf{SU}(4)$ group of two-qubit gates, we can use it to attain the optimal two-qubit gate count for algorithm implementation. These two advantages in synergy give rise to a quantum Complex yet Reduced Instruction Set Computer (CRISC). Though the gate scheme is compact, it supports a comprehensive array of quantum operations. This may seem paradoxical but is realizable due to the fundamental differences between quantum and classical computer architectures.
  Using our gate scheme, we observe marked improvements across various applications, including generic $n$-qubit gate synthesis, quantum volume, and qubit routing. Furthermore, the proposed scheme also realizes a gate locally equivalent to the commonly used CNOT gate with a gate time of $\frac{\pi}{2g}$, where $g$ is the two-qubit coupling. The AshN scheme is also completely impervious to $ZZ$ error, the main coherent error in transversely coupled systems, as the control parameters implementing the gates can be easily adjusted to take the $ZZ$ term into account.</description>

      <title>The inverse Mpemba effect demonstrated on a single trapped ion qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mpemba effect is a counter-intuitive phenomena in which a hot system reaches a cold temperature faster than a colder system, under otherwise identical conditions. Here we propose a quantum analog of the Mpemba effect, on the simplest quantum system, a qubit. Specifically, we show it exhibits an inverse effect, in which a cold qubit reaches a hot temperature faster than a hot qubit. Furthermore, in our system a cold qubit can heat up exponentially faster, manifesting the strong version of the effect. This occurs only for sufficiently coherent systems, making this effect quantum mechanical, i.e. due to interference effects. We experimentally demonstrate our findings on a single $^{88}\text{Sr}^+$ trapped ion qubit. The existence of this anomalous relaxation effect in simple quantum systems reveals its fundamentality, and may have a role in designing and operating quantum information processing devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.07887v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a scheme to enhance the sensitivity in detecting weak variations in a parameter of an optoelectromechanical system by detecting the system response at radio-frequencies. We consider a setup, where either one or two mechanical modes mediate the interaction between an optical cavity and an rf-resonator. This system can be operated in a regime of impedance matching where thermal fluctuations are redistributed among the system elements, and, in particular, rf output noise can be reduced to the quantum vacuum noise level. We show that this effect can be used to boost the sensitivity in detecting parameter variations also in regimes of high thermal noise. We characterize the performance of this protocol in detecting variations in the capacitance of the rf resonator.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Efficacious quantum information processing relies on extended coherence and precise control. Investigating the limitations surrounding quantum processors is vital for their advancement. In their operation, one challenge is inadvertent wave function collapse. Decoherence-free subspaces, theoretically capable of mitigating specific non unitary dynamics, present a promising avenue. However, our study unveils their inability to safeguard against spontaneous wave function collapse. Thus, the spontaneous-collapse rate becomes a critical limiting factor for quantum systems' physical coherence, restricting the options for maintaining coherence to active error correction.</description>

      <title>State-dependent and state-independent uncertainty relations for skew information and standard deviation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we derive state-dependent uncertainty relations (uncertainty equalities) in which commutators of incompatible operators (not necessarily Hermitian) are explicitly present and state-independent uncertainty relations based on the Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information. We derive uncertainty equality based on standard deviation for incompatible operators with mixed states, a gereralization of previous works in which only pure state was considered. We show that for pure states, the Wigner-Yanase skew information based state-independent uncertainty relations become standard deviation based state-independent uncertainty relations which turn out to be tighter uncertainty relations than the ones given in the work of Giorda \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. A 99, 052121 (2019)] for some cases, and we generalize the work of Giorda \emph{et al.} for arbitrary operators. We show that if the coherence of a density operator is measured with respect to a collection of different channels, then there exists a state-independent uncertainty relation for the coherence measures of the density operator with respect to that collection of different channels. We show that state-dependent and state-independent uncertainty relations based on a more general version of skew information called generalized skew information appeared in Yang \emph{et al.} [Phys. Rev. A 106, 052401 (2022)] which includes the Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information and the Fisher information as special cases hold. In a qubit, we derive tighter state-independent uncertainty inequalities and equalities for different form of generalized skew informations and standard deviations, and discuss in detail. Finally, we provide a scheme to determine the Wigner-Yanase (-Dyson) skew information of an unknown observable which can be performed in experiment using the notion of weak values.</description>

Abstract: We design variational pulse sequences tailored for neutral atom quantum simulators and show that we can engineer layers of single-qubit and multi-qubit gates. As an application, we discuss how the proposed method can be used to perform refocusing algorithms, SWAP networks, and ultimately quantum chemistry simulations. While the theoretical protocol we develop still has experimental limitations, it paves the way, with some further optimisation, for the use of analog quantum processors for variational quantum algorithms, including those not previously considered compatible with analog mode.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the non-Markovian mechanisms is a key importance to know how the quantum resources are transferred and so to be able to design noise-resilient quantum technologies. In this work, we show how a quantum resource propagates from the main system to a discrete environment and the information dynamics among the environment qubits. We also characterize the propagation of information leaving the main qubit and going through the environment, as well as its return. Finally, we connect the conditions for the emergence of this dynamic to the existence of quantum Darwinism.</description>

      <title>Self-testing of genuine multipartite non-local and non-maximally entangled states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00010v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-testing enables the characterization of quantum systems with minimal assumptions on their internal working as such it represents the strongest form of certification for quantum systems. In the existing self-testing literature, self-testing states that are not maximally entangled, but exhibit genuine multipartite nonlocality, have remained an open problem. This is particularly important because, for many-body systems, genuine multipartite nonlocality has been recognized as the strongest form of multipartite quantum correlation. In this work, we present a Cabello-like paradox for scenarios involving an arbitrary number of parties. This paradox is a tool for detecting genuine multipartite nonlocality, allowing for the specific identification and self-testing of states that defy the paradox's limits the most, which turn out to be non-maximally multipartite entangled states. While recent results [\textit{\v{S}upi\'c et al., Nature Physics, 2023}] suggest network self-testing as a means to self-test all quantum states, here we operate within the standard self-testing framework to self-test genuine multipartite non-local and non-maximally entangled states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00182v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum Annealers are basically quantum computers that with high probability can optimize certain quadratic functions on Boolean variables in constant time. These functions are basically the Hamiltonian of Ising models that reach the ground energy state, with a high probability, after an annealing process. They have been proposed as a way to solve SAT.
  These Hamiltonians can be seen as Max2XOR problems, i.e. as the problem of finding an assignment that maximizes the number of XOR clauses of at most 2 variables that are satisfied. In this paper, we present several gadgets to reduce SAT to Max2XOR. We show how they can be used to translate SAT instances to initial configurations of a quantum annealer.</description>

      <title>Successive quasienergy collapse and breakdown of photon blockade in the few-emitter limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emergent behavior that arises in many-body systems of increasing size follows universal laws that become apparent in order-to-disorder transitions. While this behavior has been traditionally studied for large numbers of emitters, recent progress allows for the exploration of the few-emitter limit, where correlations can be measured and connected to microscopic models to gain further insight into order-to-disorder transitions. We explore this few-body limit in the driven and damped Tavis--Cummings model, which describes a collection of atoms interacting with a driven and damped cavity mode. Our exploration revolves around the dressed states of the atomic ensemble and field, whose energies are shown to collapse as the driving field is increased to mark the onset of a dissipative quantum phase transition. The collapse occurs in stages and is an effect of light-matter correlations that are overlooked for single atoms and neglected in mean-field models. The implications of these correlations over the macroscopic observables of the system are presented. We encounter a shift in the expected transition point and an increased number of parity-broken states to choose from once the ordered phase is reached.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02937v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computers are expected to revolutionize our ability to process information. The advancement from classical to quantum computing is a product of our advancement from classical to quantum physics -- the more our understanding of the universe grows, so does our ability to use it for computation. A natural question that arises is, what will physics allow in the future? Can more advanced theories of physics increase our computational power, beyond quantum computing?
  An active field of research in physics studies theoretical phenomena outside the scope of explainable quantum mechanics, that form when attempting to combine Quantum Mechanics (QM) with General Relativity (GR) into a unified theory of Quantum Gravity (QG). QG is known to present the possibility of a quantum superposition of causal structure and event orderings. In the literature of quantum information theory, this translates to a superposition of unitary evolution orders.
  In this work we show a first example of a natural computational model based on QG, that provides an exponential speedup over standard quantum computation (under standard hardness assumptions). We define a model and complexity measure for a quantum computer that has the ability to generate a superposition of unitary evolution orders, and show that such computer is able to solve in polynomial time two of the fundamental problems in computer science: The Graph Isomorphism Problem ($\mathsf{GI}$) and the Gap Closest Vector Problem ($\mathsf{GapCVP}$), with gap $O\left( n \sqrt{n} \right)$. These problems are believed by experts to be hard to solve for a regular quantum computer. Interestingly, our model does not seem overpowered, and we found no obvious way to solve entire complexity classes that are considered hard in computer science, like the classes $\mathbf{NP}$ and $\mathbf{SZK}$.</description>

      <title>Activation of entanglement in generalized entanglement swapping</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study entanglement activation in a generalized entanglement swapping process involving two Bell pairs and generalized measurements. The conventional understanding posits entangled measurements as both necessary and sufficient for establishing entanglement between distant parties. In this study, we reassess the role of measurement operators in entanglement generation within a generalized entanglement swapping process. We focus on maximally entangled two-qubit initial states and generalized measurements, investigating the necessity and sufficiency conditions for entangled measurement operators. By utilizing two Bell pairs, (1, 2) shared between Alice and Bob, and (3, 4) shared between Bob and Charlie, we demonstrate that while entangled measurements are sufficient, they are not indispensable for establishing entanglement between spatially separated observers. Through a sequential approach, if Bob performs an initial measurement which is not able to establish entanglement then followed by another measurement after post-processing the first measurement it is possible to establish entanglement. We identify specific criteria for different measurement operators that enable the potential for performing a second measurement to establish entanglement. Our findings highlight the feasibility of generating entanglement between distant parties through a combination of measurements, shedding new light on entanglement distribution in quantum networks. Additionally, we showcase through illustrative examples how successive measurements enhance entanglement compared to single measurements, underscoring the practical benefits of our approach in enhancing entanglement. Moreover, our protocol extends beyond bipartite qubit states to higher-dimensional maximally entangled states, emphasizing its versatility and applicability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multi-qubit quantum gates intrinsic to an array of semiconductor quantum dots and investigate how they can be implemented in a scalable way. The intrinsic quantum gates refer to the class of natural-forming transformations in the qubit rotating-frame under direct exchange coupling, and can be recognized as an instruction set of spin-qubit chips. Adopting perturbative treatment, we can model the intrinsic gates by first-order dynamics in the coupling strength and develop a general formalism for identifying the multi-qubit intrinsic gates under arbitrary array connectivity. The advantageous applications of the intrinsic gates in quantum computing and quantum error correction are explored. Factors influencing the fidelities of the multi-qubit intrinsic gates are also discussed. To overcome the problem of inhomogeneous coupling, we propose a theoretical scheme in which single-qubit pulses are applied to dynamically calibrate the connecting bonds. This scheme can be further combined with periodic dynamical decoupling for robust implementations of multi-qubit gates in large-scale quantum computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10032v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising avenue for achieving significant speedup, particularly in large-scale PDE simulations, compared to classical computing. One of the main quantum approaches involves utilizing Hamiltonian simulation, which is directly applicable only to Schr\"odinger-type equations. To address this limitation, Schr\"odingerisation techniques have been developed, employing the warped transformation to convert general linear PDEs into Schr\"odinger-type equations. However, despite the development of Schr\"odingerisation techniques, the explicit implementation of the corresponding quantum circuit for solving general PDEs remains to be designed. In this paper, we present detailed implementation of a quantum algorithm for general PDEs using Schr\"odingerisation techniques. We provide examples of the heat equation, and the advection equation approximated by the upwind scheme, to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Complexity analysis is also carried out to demonstrate the quantum advantages of these algorithms in high dimensions over their classical counterparts.</description>

      <title>Effectiveness of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum hardware</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale quantum circuits are required to exploit the advantages of quantum computers. Present-day quantum computers have become less reliable with increasing depths of quantum circuits. To overcome this limitation, quantum error-correction codes have been introduced. Although the success of quantum error correction codes has been announced in Google[1, 2] and neutral atom[3] quantum computers, there have been no reports on IBM quantum computers showing error suppression owing to its unique heavy-hexagon structure. This structure restricts connectivity, and quantum error-correction codes on IBM quantum computers require flag qubits. Here, we report the successful implementation of a syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on IBM quantum computers. Moreover, we demonstrate its effectiveness by considering the repetition code as a test code among the quantum error-correcting codes. Even though the data qubit is not adjacent to the syndrome qubit, logical error rates diminish exponentially as the distance of the repetition code increases from three to nine. Even when two flag qubits exist between the data and syndrome qubits, the logical error rates decrease as the distance increases similarly. This confirms the successful implementation of the syndrome extraction circuit with flag qubits on the IBM quantum computer.</description>

Abstract: A conserved photon current is derived from the commutation relations satisfied by the electromagnetic four-potential and field tensor operators. The density is found to be a sum over positive and negative frequency terms, both of which contribute a positive number density and propagate in a common direction. Discrete positive and negative frequency excitations are both identified as photons. Photon number, equal to the spatial integral of photon density, is conserved in the absence of sources and sinks.</description>

Abstract: Electronic ground states are of central importance in chemical simulations, but have remained beyond the reach of efficient classical algorithms except in cases of weak electron correlation or one-dimensional spatial geometry. We introduce a hybrid quantum-classical eigenvalue solver that constructs a wavefunction ansatz from a linear combination of matrix product states in rotated orbital bases, enabling the characterization of strongly correlated ground states with arbitrary spatial geometry. The energy is converged via a gradient-free generalized sweep algorithm based on quantum subspace diagonalization, with a potentially exponential speedup in the off-diagonal matrix element contractions upon translation into compact quantum circuits of linear depth in the number of qubits. Chemical accuracy is attained in numerical experiments for both a stretched water molecule and an octahedral arrangement of hydrogen atoms, achieving substantially better correlation energies compared to a unitary coupled-cluster benchmark, with orders of magnitude reductions in quantum resource estimates and a surprisingly high tolerance to shot noise. This proof-of-concept study suggests a promising new avenue for scaling up simulations of strongly correlated chemical systems on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

Abstract: I show that frequentism, as an explanation of probability in classical statistical mechanics, can be extended in a natural way to a decoherent quantum history space, the analogue of a classical phase space. The result is a form of finite frequentism, in which the Gibbs concept of an infinite ensemble of gases is replaced by the quantum state expressed as a superposition of a finite number of decohering microstates. It is a form of finite and actual (as opposed to hypothetical) frequentism insofar as all the microstates exist, even though they may differ macroscopically, in keeping with the decoherence-based Everett interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.13928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In previous work with Ken Wharton, it was proposed that Bell correlations are a special sort of selection artefact, explained by a combination of (i) collider bias and (ii) a boundary constraint on the collider variable. This requires no direct causal influence outside lightcones, and may hence offer a new way to reconcile Bell nonlocality and relativity. This piece outlines a new argument for the proposal. It explains how it is valid for a special class of ('W-shaped') Bell experiments involving delayed-choice entanglement swapping, and argues that it can be extended to the general ('V-shaped') case.</description>

Abstract: Strongly correlated electron systems are a cornerstone of modern physics, being responsible for groundbreaking phenomena from superconducting magnets to quantum computing. In most cases, correlations in electrons arise exclusively due to Coulomb interactions. In this work, we reveal that free electrons interacting simultaneously with a light field can become highly correlated via mechanisms beyond Coulomb interactions. In the case of two electrons, the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) for the joint probability distribution of the output electron energies is enhanced over 13 orders of magnitude compared to that of electrons interacting with the light field in succession (one after another). These highly correlated electrons are the result of momentum and energy exchange between the participating electrons via the external quantum light field. Our findings pave the way to the creation and control of highly correlated free electrons for applications including quantum information and ultra-fast imaging.</description>

Abstract: The efficiency of a quantum metrology protocol can be considerably reduced by the interaction of a quantum system with its environment, resulting in a loss of purity and, consequently, a mixed state for the probing system. In this paper we examine the potential of mixed spin-$j$ states to achieve sensitivity comparable, and even equal, to that of pure states in the measurement of infinitesimal rotations about arbitrary axes. We introduce the concept of mixed optimal quantum rotosensors based on a maximization of the Fisher quantum information and show that it is related to the notion of anticoherence of spin states and its generalization to subspaces. We present several examples of anticoherent subspaces and their associated mixed optimal quantum rotosensors. We also show that the latter maximize negativity for specific bipartitions, reaching the same maximum value as pure states. These results elucidate the interplay between quantum metrology of rotations, anticoherence and entanglement in the framework of mixed spin states.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Inferior Solutions For Superior Outcomes: Obtaining Robust Solutions From Quantum Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly advancing domain of quantum optimization, the confluence of quantum algorithms such as Quantum Annealing (QA) and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with robust optimization methodologies presents a cutting-edge frontier. Although it seems natural to apply quantum algorithms when facing uncertainty, this has barely been approached.
  In this paper we adapt the aforementioned quantum optimization techniques to tackle robust optimization problems. By leveraging the inherent stochasticity of quantum annealing and adjusting the parameters and evaluation functions within QAOA, we present two innovative methods for obtaining robust optimal solutions. These heuristics are applied on two use cases within the energy sector: the unit commitment problem, which is central to the scheduling of power plant operations, and the optimization of charging electric vehicles (EVs) including electricity from photovoltaic (PV) to minimize costs. These examples highlight not only the potential of quantum optimization methods to enhance decision-making in energy management but also the practical relevance of the young field of quantum computing in general. Through careful adaptation of quantum algorithms, we lay the foundation for exploring ways to achieve more reliable and efficient solutions in complex optimization scenarios that occur in the real-world.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17879v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a method to trap polar molecules with the electrical force induced by the surface acoustic wave (SAW) on piezoelectric materials. In this approach, the electrical force is perpendicular to the moving direction of the polar molecules, and is used to control the positions of trapped polar molecules in the direction orthogonal to the acoustic transmission. By virtue of an external electrical force, the SAW-induced electrical field can trap the polar molecules into single-layer or multi-layer lattices. The arrangement of molecules can affect the binding energy and localization of the molecule array. Then the one- or two-dimensional trapped polar molecule arrays can be used to construct the Bose-Hubbard (BH) model, whose energy and dynamics are affected by the localizations of the trapped molecules. We find that the phase transitions between the superfluid and Mott insulator based on trapped polar molecule BH model can be modulated by the SAW induced electrical potential.</description>

      <title>On-demand shaped photon emission based on a parametrically modulated qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.01464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the circuit quantum electrodynamics architectures, to realize a long-range quantum network mediated by flying photon, it is necessary to shape the temporal profile of emitted photons to achieve high transfer efficiency between two quantum nodes. In this work, we demonstrate a new single-rail and dual-rail time-bin shaped photon generator without additional flux-tunable elements, which can act as a quantum interface of a point-to-point quantum network. In our approach, we adopt a qubit-resonator-transmission line configuration, and the effective coupling strength between the qubit and the resonator can be varied by parametrically modulating the qubit frequency. In this way, the coupling is directly proportional to the parametric modulation amplitude and covers a broad tunable range beyond 20 MHz for the sample we used. Additionally, when emitting shaped photons, we find that the spurious frequency shift (-0.4 MHz) due to parametric modulation is small and can be readily calibrated through chirping. We develop an efficient photon field measurement setup based on the data stream processing of GPU. Utilizing this system, we perform photon temporal profile measurement, quantum state tomography of photon field, and quantum process tomography of single-rail quantum state transfer based on a heterodyne measurement scheme. The single-rail encoding state transfer fidelity of shaped photon emission is 90.32%, and that for unshaped photon is 97.20%, respectively. We believe that the fidelity of shaped photon emission is mainly limited by the qubit coherence time. The results demonstrate that our method is hardware efficient, simple to implement, and scalable. It could become a viable tool in a high-quality quantum network utilizing both single-rail and dual-rail time-bin encoding.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02102v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a chaotic particle-conserving kinetically constrained model, with a single parameter which allows us to break reflection symmetry. Through extensive numerical simulations we find that the domain wall state shows a variety of dynamical behaviors from localization all the way to ballistic transport, depending on the value of the reflection breaking parameter. Surprisingly, such anomalous behavior is not mirrored in infinite-temperature dynamics, which appear to scale diffusively, in line with expectations for generic interacting models. However, studying the particle density gradient, we show that the lack of reflection symmetry affects infinite-temperature dynamics, resulting in an asymmetric dynamical structure factor. This is in disagreement with normal diffusion and suggests that the model may also exhibit anomalous dynamics at infinite temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Finally, we observe low-entangled eigenstates in the spectrum of the model, a telltale sign of quantum many body scars.</description>

      <title>Mitigating photon loss in linear optical quantum circuits: classical postprocessing methods outperforming postselection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02278v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photon loss rates set an effective upper limit on the size of computations that can be run on current linear optical quantum devices. We present a family of techniques to mitigate the effects of photon loss on both output probabilities and expectation values derived from noisy linear optical circuits composed of an input of $n$ photons, an $m$-mode interferometer, and $m$ single photon detectors. Central to these techniques is the construction of objects called recycled probabilities. Recycled probabilities are constructed from output statistics affected by loss, and are designed to amplify the signal of the ideal (lossless) probabilities. Classical postprocessing techniques then take recycled probabilities as input and output a set of loss-mitigated probabilities, or expectation values. We provide analytical and numerical evidence that these methods can be applied, up to large sample sizes, to produce more accurate outputs than those obtained from postselection - which is currently the standard method of coping with photon loss when sampling from discrete variable linear optical quantum circuits. In contrast, we provide strong evidence that the popular zero noise extrapolation technique cannot improve on on the performance of postselection for any photon loss rate.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an innovative design for topological quantum batteries that involves coupling two atoms to a one-dimensional lattice with topological features. Employing the resolvent method, we analytically explore the thermodynamic performances of quantum batteries (QBs). First, we demonstrate that only coherent bound states significantly contribute to the stored energy of QBs. We observe near-perfect energy transfer from the quantum charger to the quantum battery (QB) in the topologically nontrivial phase. Conversely, in the topologically trivial phase, we reveal that under the Markov limit, the charging process of the QB is almost completely prohibited due to the emergence of degenerate zero-energy bound states. Moreover, we discover that the maximum energy storage exhibits singular behavior at the phase boundaries. Second, we find that direct coupling between the QB and quantum charger renders the ergotropy immune to sublattice dissipation, facilitated by the presence of a dark state and vacancy-like dressed bound state. Further, we show that as dissipation intensifies along with the emergence of the quantum Zeno effect, the charging power of QBs is transiently enhanced. Our findings provide insightful guidelines for practically enhancing the performance of QBs through structured reservoir engineering.</description>

Abstract: An m-uniform quantum state on n qubits is an entangled state in which every m-qubit subsystem is maximally mixed. Such a state spans a pure [[n,0,m+1]] quantum error correcting code (QECC). Starting with an m-uniform state realized as the graph state associated with an m-regular graph, and a classical [n,k,d \ge m+1] binary linear code with certain additional properties, we construct codeword stabilized (CWS) codes that are pure [[n,k,m+1]] QECCs. We propose measurement-based protocols for encoding into code states and recovery of logical qubits from code states. Our proposed protocols support sequential encoding and partial recovery of logical qubits, which can be useful for quantum memory applications.</description>

Abstract: In the field of chemistry, where nuclear motion has traditionally been a focal point, we now explore the ultra-rapid electronic motion spanning attoseconds to femtoseconds, demonstrating that it is equally integral and relevant to the discipline. The advent of ultrashort attosecond pulse technology has revolutionized our ability to directly observe electronic rearrangements in atoms and molecules, offering a time-resolved insight into these swift processes. Prominent examples include Auger-Meitner decay and Interparticle Coulombic Decay (ICD). However, the real challenge lies in interpreting these observations, where theoretical models are indispensable.
  Building upon the analytical framework introduced in Phys. Rev. A 101, 043414 (2020), which analyzed the spectra of electrons emitted during electronic decay processes from a purely electronic perspective, our paper represents a significant advancement. We extend this theoretical base to include nuclear dynamics, utilizing the Born-Oppenheimer approximation to deepen our understanding of the intricate interaction between electronic and nuclear motion in these processes.
  We illustrate the impact of incorporating nuclear degrees of freedom in several theoretical cases characterized by different numbers of vibrational bound states in both the electronic resonance and the electronic final state. This approach not only clarifies complex spectral features and unusual peak shapes but also demonstrates a method for extracting the energy differences between multiple vibrational resonance states through their distinctive interference patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.00963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the fundamental question whether a random discrete structure with the minimal number of restrictions can converge to continuous metric space. We study the geometrical properties such as the dimensionality and the curvature emerging out of the connectivity properties of uniform random graphs. In addition we introduce a simple evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time from an initially complete graph. We show an exponential growth of the radius of the graph, that ends up in a random structure with emergent average spatial dimension $D=3$ and zero curvature $K=0$, resembling a flat 3D manifold, that could describe the observed space in our universe and some of its geometrical properties. In addition, we introduce a generalized action for graphs based on physical quantities on different subgraph structures that helps to recover the well known properties of spacetime as described in general relativity, like time dilation due to gravity. Also, we show how various quantum mechanical concepts such as generalized uncertainty principles based on the statistical fluctuations can emerge from random discrete models. Moreover, our approach leads to a unification of space and matter-energy, for which we propose a mass-energy-space equivalence that leads to a way to transform between empty space and matter-energy via the cosmological constant.</description>

Abstract: Modern condensed matter physics relies on the concept of topology to classify matter, from quantum Hall systems to topological insulators. Engineered systems, benefiting from synthetic dimensions, can potentially give access to novel topological states predicted in dimensions $D &gt; 3$. We report the realization of an atomic quantum Hall system evolving in four dimensions (4D), with two spatial dimensions and two synthetic ones encoded in the large spin of dysprosium atoms. The non-trivial topology is evidenced by measuring a quantized electromagnetic non-linear response and observing anisotropic hyperedge modes. We also excite non-planar cyclotron motion, contrasting with its circular equivalents in $D\leq3$. Our work opens to the investigation of strongly-correlated topological liquids in 4D generalizing fractional quantum Hall states.</description>

Abstract: A quantum integrable system slightly perturbed away from integrability is typically expected to thermalize on timescales of order $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2}$, where $\lambda$ is the perturbation strength. We here study classes of perturbations that violate this scaling, and exhibit much longer thermalization times $\tau\sim \lambda^{-2\ell}$ where $\ell&gt;1$ is an integer. Systems with these "weak integrability breaking" perturbations have an extensive number of quasi-conserved quantities that commute with the perturbed Hamiltonian up to corrections of order $\lambda^\ell$. We demonstrate a systematic construction to obtain families of such weak perturbations of a generic integrable model for arbitrary $\ell$. We then apply the construction to various models, including the Heisenberg, XXZ, and XYZ chains, the Hubbard model, models of spinless free fermions, and the quantum Ising chain. Our analytical framework explains the previously observed evidence of weak integrability breaking in the Heisenberg and XXZ chains under certain perturbations.</description>

      <title>Angular spectrum of quantum fluctuations in causal structure</title>

Abstract: Scaling arguments are used to constrain the angular spectrum of distortions on boundaries of macroscopic causal diamonds, produced by Planck-scale vacuum fluctuations of causally-coherent quantum gravity. The small-angle spectrum of displacement is derived from a form of scale invariance: the variance and fluctuation rate of distortions normal to the surface of a causal diamond of radius $R$ at transverse physical separation $c\tau\ll R$ should depend only on $\tau$, with a normalization set by the Planck time $t_P$, and should not depend on $R$. For measurements on scale $R$, the principle leads to universal scaling for variance on angular scale $\Theta$, $\langle\delta\tau^2\rangle_\Theta\simeq\tau\:\!t_p\sim\Theta R\:\!t_P/c$, and angular power spectrum $C_\ell\sim (R\:\!l_P)/\ell^3$ at $\ell\gg1$. This spectrum is consistent with a relational model of holographic noise based on causally coherent virtual null gravitational shocks, a general picture conjectured for all $\ell$. The high $\ell$ scaling is contrasted with that predicted in some other quantum models, which differ by one power of angular wavenumber $\ell$ and are shown to predict excessive blurring of images from distant sources.</description>

      <title>Influence of higher order electron-phonon interaction on the electron-related lattice thermal properties of 2d Dirac crystal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18369v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To understand the essential properties of Dirac crystals, such as their thermal conductivity, we require models that consider the interaction between Dirac electrons and dispersive acoustic phonons. The exceptionally high thermal conductivity in 2D Dirac crystals is attributed to near-ideal phonon quantum gases, while undesired limitations arise from electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions which have been shown to limit the thermal conductivity up to several microns away. The e-ph thermal conductivity is directly linked to the phonon scattering rate. Conventional calculations overlook phonons with short-dispersive wavelengths, rendering them inadequate for analyzing 2D Dirac crystals. The phonon scattering rate is typically calculated up to the first-order magnitude, considering 3-particle interactions involving the decay of an electron and phonon (EP-E*) to create a new electron. However, processes involving the decay of an electron and the creation of a new electron and phonon (E-E*P*) are neglected. In this study, we present an accurate expression for the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity in 2D Dirac crystals, accounting for short-dispersive wavelength phonons. We demonstrate the significance of the E-E*P* process even at room temperature in calculating the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity, particularly for first-order e-ph interactions. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of incorporating second-order e-ph interactions, specifically the EP-E*P* interaction involving the decay of an electron and phonon and the creation of a new electron-phonon pair, to accurately determine the phonon scattering rate and e-ph thermal conductivity at high temperatures and low Fermi energies. This 4-particle interaction process plays a crucial role in characterizing these properties effectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05761v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces and develops the algebraic framework of moment polynomials, which are polynomial expressions in commuting variables and their formal mixed moments. Their positivity and optimization over probability measures supported on semialgebraic sets and subject to moment polynomial constraints is investigated. A positive solution to Hilbert's 17th problem for pseudo-moments is given. On the other hand, moment polynomials positive on actual measures are shown to be sums of squares and formal moments of squares up to arbitrarily small perturbation of their coefficients. When only measures supported on a bounded semialgebraic set are considered, a stronger algebraic certificate for moment polynomial positivity is derived. This result gives rise to a converging hierarchy of semidefinite programs for moment polynomial optimization. Finally, as an application, two open nonlinear Bell inequalities from quantum physics are settled.</description>

      <title>Robustness and eventual slow decay of bound states of interacting microwave photons in the Google Quantum AI experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.11164v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable models are characterized by the existence of stable excitations that can propagate indefinitely without decaying. This includes multi-magnon bound states in the celebrated XXZ spin chain model and its integrable Floquet counterpart. A recent Google Quantum AI experiment [A. Morvan et al., Nature 612, 240 (2022)] realizing the Floquet model demonstrated the persistence of such collective excitations even when the integrability is broken: this observation is at odds with the expectation of ergodic dynamics in generic non-integrable systems. We here study the spectrum of the model realized in the experiment using exact diagonalization and physical arguments. We find that isolated bands corresponding to the descendants of the exact bound states of the integrable model are clearly observable in the spectrum for a large range of system sizes. However, our numerical analysis of the localization properties of the eigenstates suggests that the bound states become unstable in the thermodynamic limit. A perturbative estimate of the decay rate agrees with the prediction of an eventual instability for large system sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02992v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the excitation of a one-electron quantum cyclotron by gravitational waves. The electron in such as a penning trap is prepared to be at the lowest Landau level, which has an infinite degeneracy parameterized by the size of the wave function. We find that the excitation rate from the ground state to the first excited state is enhanced by the size of the electron wave function: an electron with a larger wave function feels gravitational waves more. As a consequence, we derive a good sensitivity to gravitational waves at a macroscopic one-electron quantum cyclotron.</description>

      <title>Wolfes model aka $G_2/I_6$-rational integrable model: $g^{(2)}, g^{(3)}$ hidden algebras and quartic polynomial algebra of integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20481v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional 3-body Wolfes model with 2- and 3-body interactions also known as $G_2/I_6$-rational integrable model of the Hamiltonian reduction is exactly-solvable and superintegrable. Its Hamiltonian $H$ and two integrals ${\cal I}_{1}, {\cal I}_{2}$, which can be written as algebraic differential operators in two variables (with polynomial coefficients) of the 2nd and 6th orders, respectively, are represented as non-linear combinations of $g^{(2)}$ or $g^{(3)}$ (hidden) algebra generators in a minimal manner. By using a specially designed MAPLE-18 code to deal with algebraic operators it is found that $(H, {\cal I}_1, {\cal I}_2, {\cal I}_{12} \equiv [{\cal I}_1, {\cal I}_2])$ are the four generating elements of the {\it quartic} polynomial algebra of integrals. This algebra is embedded into the universal enveloping algebra $g^{(3)}$. In turn, 3-body/$A_2$-rational Calogero model is characterized by cubic polynomial algebra of integrals, it is mentioned briefly.</description>

      <title>Quench dynamics in higher-dimensional Holstein models: Insights from Truncated Wigner Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12291v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-density wave phases in quantum materials stem from the complex interplay of electronic and lattice degrees of freedom. Nowadays, various time-resolved spectroscopy techniques allow to actively manipulate such phases and monitor their dynamics in real time. Modeling such nonequilibrium dynamics theoretically is a great challenge and exact methods can usually only treat a small number of atoms and finitely many phonons. We approach the melting of charge-density waves in a Holstein model after a sudden switch-on of the electronic hopping from two perspectives: We prove that in the non-interacting and in the strong-coupling limit, the CDW order parameter on high-dimensional hypercubic lattices obeys a factorization relation for long times, such that its dynamics can be reduced to the one-dimensional case. Secondly, we present numerical results from semiclassical techniques based on the Truncated Wigner Approximation for two spatial dimensions. A comparison with exact data obtained for a Holstein chain shows that a semiclassical treatment of both the electrons and phonons is required in order to correctly describe the phononic dynamics. This is confirmed, in addition, for a quench in the electron-phonon coupling strength.</description>

      <title>Order-by-disorder in the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ transverse-field Ising model on the ruby lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase diagram of the $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ antiferromagnetic transverse-field Ising model on the ruby lattice. In the low-field limit we derive an effective quantum dimer model, analyzing how the extensive ground-state degeneracy at zero field is lifted by an order-by-disorder scenario. We support our analysis by studying the gap-closing of the high-field phase using series expansions. For $J_2&gt;J_3$, we find a columnar phase at low fields, followed by a clock-ordered phase stabilized by resonating plaquettes at intermediate field values, and an emergent 3d-XY quantum phase transition to the polarized high-field phase. For $J_3&gt;J_2$, an order-by-disorder mechanism stabilizes a distinct $k=(0,0)$ order and a quantum phase transition in the 3d-Ising universality class is observed. Further, we discuss the possible implementation of the columnar- and clock-ordered phase in existing Rydberg atom quantum simulators. When taking into account the full algebraically decaying long-range interactions on the ruby lattice, we find that long-range interactions favor the same ground state as the quantum fluctuations induced by a transverse field, which could make the ruby lattice a promising candidate for the realization of a clock-ordered phase.</description>

Abstract: Gate-defined quantum dots are a promising candidate system to realize scalable, coupled qubit systems and serve as a fundamental building block for quantum computers. However, present-day quantum dot devices suffer from imperfections that must be accounted for, which hinders the characterization, tuning, and operation process. Moreover, with an increasing number of quantum dot qubits, the relevant parameter space grows sufficiently to make heuristic control infeasible. Thus, it is imperative that reliable and scalable autonomous tuning approaches are developed. In this report, we outline current challenges in automating quantum dot device tuning and operation with a particular focus on datasets, benchmarking, and standardization. We also present ideas put forward by the quantum dot community on how to overcome them.</description>

Abstract: The interaction between Unruh-De Witt spin $1/2$ detectors and a real scalar field is scrutinized by making use of the Tomita-Takesaki modular theory as applied to the Von Neumann algebra of the Weyl operators. The use of the modular theory enables to evaluate in an exact way the trace over the quantum field degrees of freedom. The resulting density matrix is employed to the study of the Bell-CHSH correlator. It turns out that, as a consequence of the interaction with the quantum field, the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality exhibits a decreasing as compared to the case in which the scalar field is absent.</description>

      <title>CompactifAI: Extreme Compression of Large Language Models using Quantum-Inspired Tensor Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and LlaMA are advancing rapidly in generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), but their immense size poses significant challenges, such as huge training and inference costs, substantial energy demands, and limitations for on-site deployment. Traditional compression methods such as pruning, distillation, and low-rank approximation focus on reducing the effective number of neurons in the network, while quantization focuses on reducing the numerical precision of individual weights to reduce the model size while keeping the number of neurons fixed. While these compression methods have been relatively successful in practice, there is no compelling reason to believe that truncating the number of neurons is an optimal strategy. In this context, this paper introduces CompactifAI, an innovative LLM compression approach using quantum-inspired Tensor Networks that focuses on the model's correlation space instead, allowing for a more controlled, refined and interpretable model compression. Our method is versatile and can be implemented with - or on top of - other compression techniques. As a benchmark, we demonstrate that a combination of CompactifAI with quantization allows to reduce a 93% the memory size of LlaMA 7B, reducing also 70% the number of parameters, accelerating 50% the training and 25% the inference times of the model, and just with a small accuracy drop of 2% - 3%, going much beyond of what is achievable today by other compression techniques. Our methods also allow to perform a refined layer sensitivity profiling, showing that deeper layers tend to be more suitable for tensor network compression, which is compatible with recent observations on the ineffectiveness of those layers for LLM performance. Our results imply that standard LLMs are, in fact, heavily overparametrized, and do not need to be large at all.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17336v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article explores challenges presented by revelations in physics and the questions they provoke concerning reality. It sheds light on the disparity between the indefinite nature of quantum reality and our perception of classical reality. The necessity for transition from the quantum to classical reality is underscored, alongside difficulties of observer intervention and the complexities introduced by the objective collapse theory. The work introduces a pioneering approach of decoherence within the framework of universal wave function density matrices. It deploys entanglement among three primary quantum subsystems: mass particles, massless particles, and the human body system. This gives rise to a Von Neumann chain of correlated systems, wherein neglecting one system renders the other two in mixed states. Here the cohered massless system and the animate being constitute subjects of our perceptions. Within the body, the distributions of quantum particle wave packets are highly localized due to entanglement and chemical potential, satisfying the Ehrenfest condition, wherein the thermal deBroglie wavelength scale is considerably smaller than their domain in the body. Thus, each microstate of the body quantum particle ensemble can be analogously represented as a statistical mechanics particle ensemble or likened to microstates in the Debye statistical model. In the statistical mechanics perspective, life represents a macrostate characterized by thermodynamics parameters, and chemical potential. The life macrostate autonomously processes an environment corresponding to a mixed state alternative of its entangled quantum world counterpart, which appears in the stream of consciousness. The quantum universe persists, evolving deterministically, and the classical (macroscopic) universe is its realization statistical by the fundamental predicate of life discerned by the brain; our elusive world.</description>

Abstract: We fill some of existed gaps in the correspondence between Supersymmetric Quantum Mechanics and the Inverse Scattering Transform by extending the consideration to the case of paired stationary and non-stationary Hamiltonians. We formulate the corresponding to the case Goursat problem and explicitly construct the kernel of the non-local Inverse Scattering Transform, which solves it. As a result, we find the way of constructing non-hermitian Hamiltonians from the initially hermitian ones, that leads, in the case of real-valued spectra of both potentials, to pairing of ${\cal CPT/PT}$-invariant Hamiltonians. The relevance of our proposal to Quantum Optics and optical waveguides technology, as well as to non-linear dynamics and Black Hole Physics is briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>Semi-vortex solitons and their excited states in spin-orbit-coupled binary bosonic condensates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that two-dimensional two-component fundamental solitons of the semi-vortex (SV) type, with vorticities $(s_{+},s_{-})=(0,1)$ in their components, are stable ground states (GSs) in the spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) binary Bose-Einstein condensate with the contact self-attraction acting in both components, in spite of the possibility of the critical collapse in the system. However, excited states(ESs) of the SV solitons, with the vorticity set $(s_{+},s_{-})=( S_{+},S_{+}+1)$ and $S_{+}=1,2,3,...$, are unstable in the same system. We construct ESs of SV solitons in the SOC system with opposite signs of the self-interaction in the two components. The main finding is stability of the ES-SV solitons, with the extra vorticity (at least) up to $S_{+}=6$. The threshold value of the norm for the onset of the critical collapse, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$, in these excited states is higher than the commonly known critical value, $N_{c}\approx 5.85$,associated with the single-component Townes solitons, $N_{\mathrm{thr}}$ increasing with the growth of $S_{+}$. A velocity interval for stable motion of the GS-SV solitons is found too. The results suggest a solution for the challenging problem of the creation of stable vortex solitons with high topological charges.</description>

      <title>The energy spectrum of a quantum vortex loop moving in a long pipe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, the problem of the energy spectrum of a quantum vortex loop moving in a thin long pipe is solved for the first time. The vortex filament is described in the Local Induction Approximation. We quantize this dynamic system using a new method, which leads to non-trivial results for circulation $\Gamma$ and energy values $E$. In the final form, we present the spectrum of the vortex loop in the form of a ''Regge trajectory'' $E = E(\Gamma)$. The vortex quantization problem is considered outside of two-fluid hydrodynamics and other conventional approaches.</description>

      <title>Highly sensitive and efficient 1550 nm photodetector for room temperature operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic quantum technologies such as effective quantum communication require room temperature (RT) operating single- or few- photon sensors with high external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 1550 nm wavelength. The leading class of devices in this segment is avalanche photodetectors operating particularly in the Geiger mode. Often the requirements for RT operation and for a high EQE are in conflict, resulting in a compromised solution. We have developed a device which employs a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor material on a co-optimized dielectric photonic crystal substrate to simultaneously decrease the dark current by three orders of magnitude at RT and maintain an EQE of &gt;99%. The device is amenable to avalanching and form a basis for single photon detection with ultra-low dark current and high photodetection efficiency. Harnessing the high carrier mobility of 2D materials, the device has ~ps jitter time and can be integrated into a large 2D array camera.</description>

      <title>Spin Hamiltonians in the Modulated Momenta of Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photonic solvers that are able to find the ground states of different spin Hamiltonians can be used to study many interactive physical systems and combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we establish a real-and-momentum space correspondence of spin Hamiltonians by spatial light transport. The real-space spin interaction is determined by modulating the momentum-space flow of light. This principle is formulated as a generalized Plancherel theorem, allowing us to implement a simple optical simulator that can find the ground states for any displacement-dependent spin interactions. Particularly, we use this principle to reveal the exotic magnetic phase diagram from a J1-J2-J3 model, and we also observe the vortex-mediated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dynamics from the XY model. These experiments exhibit high calculation precision by subtly controlling spin interactions from the momentum space of light, offering a promising scheme to explore novel physical effects.</description>

      <title>Learning parameter dependence for Fourier-based option pricing with tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00701v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A long-standing issue in mathematical finance is the speed-up of pricing options, especially multi-asset options. A recent study has proposed to use tensor train learning algorithms to speed up Fourier transform (FT)-based option pricing, utilizing the ability of tensor networks to compress high-dimensional tensors. Another usage of the tensor network is to compress functions, including their parameter dependence. In this study, we propose a pricing method, where, by a tensor learning algorithm, we build tensor trains that approximate functions appearing in FT-based option pricing with their parameter dependence and efficiently calculate the option price for the varying input parameters. As a benchmark test, we run the proposed method to price a multi-asset option for the various values of volatilities and present asset prices. We show that, in the tested cases involving up to 11 assets, the proposed method is comparable to or outperforms Monte Carlo simulation with $10^5$ paths in terms of computational complexity, keeping the comparable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Intermediate spectral statistics of rational triangular quantum billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Triangular billiards whose angles are rational multiples of $\pi$ are one of the simplest examples of pseudo-integrable models with intriguing classical and quantum properties. We perform an extensive numerical study of spectral statistics of eight quantized rational triangles, six belonging to the family of right-angled Veech triangles and two obtuse rational triangles. Large spectral samples of up to one million energy levels were calculated for each triangle which permits to determine their spectral statistics with great accuracy. It is demonstrated that they are of the intermediate type, sharing some features with chaotic systems, like level repulsion and some with integrable systems, like exponential tails of the level spacing distributions. Another distinctive feature of intermediate spectral statistics is a finite value of the level compressibility.
  The short range statistics such as the level spacing distributions, and long-range statistics such as the number variance and spectral form factors were analyzed in detail. An excellent agreement between the numerical data and the model of gamma distributions is revealed.</description>
