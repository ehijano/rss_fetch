      <title>GPU-accelerated Higher Representations of Wilson Fermions with HiRep</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are improving one of the available lattice software packages HiRep by adding GPU acceleration supporting highly-optimized simulations on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. HiRep allows lattice simulations of theories with fermions in higher representations and a variable number of colors in the gauge group. The development is accompanied by an overall software quality improvement in the build system, testing, and documentation, adding features for both CPUs and GPUs. The software is available under https://github.com/claudiopica/HiRep</description>

      <title>Ab-initio electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays and their impact on $V_{ud}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections are essential for an accurate determination of $V_{ud}$ from superallowed $\beta$ decays. In view of recent progress in the single-nucleon sector, the uncertainty is dominated by the theoretical description of nucleus-dependent effects, limiting the precision that can currently be achieved for $V_{ud}$. In this work, we provide a detailed account of the electroweak corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory (EFT), including the power counting, potential and ultrasoft contributions, and factorization in the decay rate. We present a first numerical evaluation of the dominant corrections in light nuclei based on Quantum Monte Carlo methods, confirming the expectations from the EFT power counting. Finally, we discuss strategies how to extract from data the low-energy constants that parameterize short-distance contributions and whose values are not predicted by the EFT. Combined with advances in ab-initio nuclear-structure calculations, this EFT framework allows one to systematically address the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$, as illustrated in detail for the $^{14}$O $\to$ $^{14}$N transition.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to superallowed $\beta$ decays in effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of $V_{ud}$ determinations from superallowed $\beta$ decays critically hinges on control over radiative corrections. Recently, substantial progress has been made on the single-nucleon, universal corrections, while nucleus-dependent effects, typically parameterized by a quantity $\delta_\text{NS}$, are much less well constrained. Here, we lay out a program to evaluate this correction from effective field theory (EFT), highlighting the dominant terms as predicted by the EFT power counting. Moreover, we compare the results to a dispersive representation of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and show that the expected momentum scaling applies even in the case of low-lying intermediate states. Our EFT framework paves the way towards ab-initio calculations of $\delta_\text{NS}$ and thereby addresses the dominant uncertainty in $V_{ud}$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-protection Zeno phase transition in monitored lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements profoundly influence system dynamics. They lead to complex nonequilibrium phenomena like the quantum Zeno effect, and they can be used for mitigating errors in quantum simulations.
  Such an ability is particularly valuable for lattice gauge theories (LGTs), which require the challenging preservation of an extensive number of local conservation laws.
  While it is known that tailored quantum measurements can soften violations of gauge symmetry, the nature of this protection, and in particular the possibility of a threshold behavior, is still unexplored.
  Here, we demonstrate the existence of a sharp transition, triggered by the measurement rate, between a protected gauge-theory regime resistant to simulation errors and an irregular regime.
  Our results are based on the paradigmatic example of a 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT. We study in detail the protection through projective measurements of ancillary qubits coupled to the local symmetry generators, and compare this approach with analog (weak) measurement protocols.
  We show that, while the resulting ensemble averages in the continuous-time limit share the same Liouvillian dynamics, different physical implementations of the stochastic gauge protection protocol yield trajectory unravelings with vastly different statistics.
  Additionally, we design an on-chip feedback mechanism that corrects bit-flip errors and significantly enhances the discrete-time scheme. Our results shed light on the dissipative criticality of strongly-interacting, highly-constrained quantum systems, and they offer valuable insights into error mitigation and correction of gauge-theory quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Heavy baryons in the relativized quark model with chromodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Following the work of Capstick and Isgur [\href{https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.34.2809}{Phys.~Rev.~D~34,~2809~(1986)}], we systematically study the mass spectrum of the heavy baryons in the relativized quark potential model with chromodynamics. Besides the original Godfrey-Isgur (GI) model, we also adopt a modified GI model which replaces the linear confinement by a screened one. The two models give similar results in our work. All heavy baryons observed so far can be explained as three-quark states. In particular, we identify the $\Omega_{c}(3000)$/$\Omega_{b}(6316)$, $\Omega_{c}(3050)$/$\Omega_{b}(6330)$, $\Omega_{c}(3065)$/$\Omega_{b}(6340)$ and $\Omega_{c}(3090)$/$\Omega_{b}(6350)$ states as the $p_{\lambda}$ excitations with quantum numbers $1/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$, $3/2^{-}$ and $5/2^{-}$. The $\Omega_{c}(3120)$ is a $3/2^{-}$ state with the $p_{\rho}$ excitation, whose bottom partner is predicted to be $\Omega_{b}(6446/6457,3/2^{-})$. The higher state $\Omega_{c}(3188)$ is the $2s_{\lambda}$ excitation with quantum numbers $1/2^{+}$, and $\Omega_{c}(3327)$ is a $d_{\lambda}$ excitation with quantum numbers $3/2^{+}$ or $5/2^{+}$. In addition, the $\Lambda_{c}(2940)$ with quantum numbers $J^{P}=3/2^{-}$ could be explained as the $p_{\rho}$ excitation.</description>
