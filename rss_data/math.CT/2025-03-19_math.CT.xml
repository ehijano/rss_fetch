      <title>A convenient category of cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We claim that the cube category whose morphisms are the interval-preserving monotone functions between finite Boolean lattices is a convenient general-purpose site for cubical sets. This category is the largest possible concrete Eilenberg-Zilber variant excluding the reversals and diagonals. The category admits as monoidal generators all functions between the singleton and two-element ordinals and all monotone surjections from finite Boolean lattices to the two-element ordinal. Consequently, morphisms in the minimal symmetric monoidal variant of the cube category containing coconnections of one kind can be characterized as the interval-preserving semilattice homomorphisms between finite Boolean lattices. There exists a model structure on our variant of cubical sets that is at once Quillen equivalent to and left induced from the classical model structure on simplicial sets along triangulation. This model structure is proper and hence its fibrations interpret Martin-Lof dependent types.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem in category theory and aims to detail the universal framework underlying self-reference and recursive structures. First, we rigorously define fundamental concepts - such as terminal objects, products, Cartesian Closed Categories, exponential objects, evaluation maps, currying, and point-surjective morphisms - and explain their intuitive meanings through concrete examples and commutative diagrams. Based on these foundational notions, we derive key lemmas (the universality of currying, the diagonal lemma, and the fixed-point construction lemma) and integrate them to develop a proof of Lawvere's Fixed-Point Theorem. Furthermore, we discuss the impact of this theorem on fixed-point combinators in programming languages, type theory, and homotopy type theory, as well as current research trends and open problems. In doing so, we clarify how the abstract principle of self-reference contributes to a wide range of applications in both mathematics and computational theory.</description>

      <title>EGGs are adhesive!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The use of rewriting-based visual formalisms is on the rise. In the formal methods community, this is due also to the introduction of adhesive categories, where most properties of classical approaches to graph transformation, such as those on parallelism and confluence, can be rephrased and proved in a general and uniform way.E-graphs (EGGs) are a formalism for program optimisation via an efficient implementation of equality saturation. In short, EGGs can be defined as (acyclic) term graphs with an additional notion of equivalence on nodes that is closed under the operators of the signature. Instead of replacing the components of a program, the optimisation step is performed by adding new components and linking them to the existing ones via an equivalence relation, until an optimal program is reached. This work describes EGGs via adhesive categories. Besides the benefits in itself of a formal presentation, which renders the properties of the data structure precise, the description of the addition of equivalent program components using standard graph transformation tools offers the advantages of the adhesive framework in modelling, for example, concurrent updates.</description>

      <title>On abstract and concrete minions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13692v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis is expository in nature. We analyze the connection between abstract minions, which can be described as functors from the category of finite ordinals to sets, and concrete minions, which are sets $\mathrm{Pol}(A, B)$ of polymorphisms $A^k \to B$ between relational structures $A$ and $B$. The functorial structure arises because a function $\alpha\colon n \to k$ transforms an $n$-ary polymorphism $f\colon A^n \to B$ to the polymorphism $(x_0, \ldots, x_{k-1}) \mapsto f(x_{\alpha (0)}, \ldots, x_{\alpha (n-1)})$. This data is relevant to the constraint satisfaction problems over finite domain, because minion homomorphisms $\mathrm{Pol}(A, B) \to \mathrm{Pol}(A', B')$ give rise to log-space reductions from the promise constraint satisfaction problem $\mathrm{PCSP}(A', B')$ to $\mathrm{PCSP}(A, B)$. Thus, they are valuable to understand the homomorphism order of polymorphism minions over finite-domain structures, especially since it is unknown whether the P vs. NP complexity dichotomy of constraint satisfaction problems extends to the more generalized promise setting.
  Crucially, although implicitly used in some papers to solve nontrivial problems, the concept of an abstract minion has not been exposed on so far, even though much is known about functor categories. The aim of this thesis is to start closing this gap, and to apply well-known constructions from category theory to minions. Furthermore, we identify a condition under which an abstract minion can arise as a concrete one over a finite domain, and deduce that many constructions remain stable under some of these concreteness assumptions. We will conclude that some of the homomorphism orders in question are uncountable distributive bounded lattices, and moreover (bi-) Heyting algebras. Along the way, we collect open questions related to abstract and concrete minions.</description>

      <title>Hochschild cohomology and extensions of triangulated categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a notion of categorical first order deformations for (enhanced) triangulated categories. For a category $\mathcal{T}$, we show that there is a bijection between $\operatorname{HH}^2(\mathcal{T})$ and the set of categorical deformations of $\mathcal{T}$. We show that in the case of curved deformations of dg algebras considered in arXiv:2406.04945, the $1$-derived category of the deformation (introduced in arXiv:24020.8660) is a categorical deformation of the derived category of the base; the Hochschild class identified by this deformation is shown to restrict to the class defining the deformation of the algebra. As an application, we give a conceptual proof of the fact that (for a smooth base) the filtered derived category of a dg deformation yields a categorical resolution of the classical derived category.</description>

      <title>Quasi-coherent sheaves and D-modules in Derived Differential Supergeometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Derived geometry provides powerful tools to handle non-transverse intersections and singular moduli problems arising in geometry and theoretical physics. While derived algebraic geometry has been extensively developed, classical field theories -- formulated as variational problems involving sections of smooth fiber bundles over manifolds -- naturally require the language of differential geometry, infinite-dimensional analysis (e.g., Fr\'echet manifolds), and additional geometric structures on spacetime, such as smooth metrics. Moreover, field theories incorporating fermionic matter fields necessitate extending the framework to include supermanifolds. This article is the first in a sequence aimed at rigorously modeling the derived space of solutions to the field equations of Lagrangian gauge theories as derived $\Ci$-stacks.
  While this article does not explicitly discuss physics or field theory, it develops foundational aspects of derived differential geometry which are useful in their own right and contribute to the further development of the field. Moreover, these results provide essential groundwork for subsequent papers rigorously constructing derived spaces of solutions to Euler-Lagrange equations. We establish foundational results extending existing work on derived manifolds into supergeometric and infinite-dimensional contexts, and explicitly relate these constructions to differential operators and PDE theory. This paper an excerpt from a larger manuscript currently in preparation and is made available now to disseminate key foundational developments.</description>

      <title>Internal higher topos theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06437</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of topoi internal to an arbitrary $\infty$-topos $\mathcal B$. We provide several characterisations of these, including an internal analogue of Lurie's characterisation of $\infty$-topoi, but also a description in terms of the underlying sheaves of $\infty$-categories, and we prove a number of structural results about these objects. Furthermore, we show that the $\infty$-category of topoi internal to $\mathcal B$ is equivalent to the $\infty$-category of $\infty$-topoi over $\mathcal B$, and use this result to derive a formula for the pullback of $\infty$-topoi. Lastly, we use our theory to relate smooth geometric morphisms of $\infty$-topoi to internal locally contractible topoi.</description>
