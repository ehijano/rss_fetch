      <title>Quantitative measurement of magnetic dichroic signals at sub-nanometer to atomic scale resolution conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When aiming for atomic resolution electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in STEM mode, the high convergence angle of the electron probe can lead to unforeseen artefacts and strong reductions of the signal to noise ratio (SNR) in the measurement of magnetic magnitudes. In this work, the EMCD signal is measured in STEM mode at semi-convergence angles ranging from \alpha=\ 2-10\ mrad\ using iron samples with high structural perfection. We observe that the relative EMCD signal remains very similar for all convergence angles, which is in good agreement with simulations. The improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio as compared to earlier works is due to better crystalline quality of the Fe sample, high control of the sample orientation, better control over sample thickness, and factors such as higher beam current and the use of a fast and sensitive hybrid-pixel electron detector. One of the key factors to remove experimental ambivalences is the use of an acquisition geometry where the two conjugate EMCD spectra are acquired simultaneously. Furthermore the high crystalline quality Fe sample enables the acquisition of statistical entities of spectra at the same sample orientation, which in turn results in high SNR EMCD signals. We obtain high SNR EMCD signals for all semi convergence angles and could measure the orbital to spin magnetic moment ratio ml/ms with high precision. We observed that at high convergence angles, the ml/ms ratio gets sensitive to minute changes in sample orientation.</description>

      <title>Laser fabrication of Ti stent and facile MEMS flow sensor integration for implantable respiration monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Animal experiments play a vital role in drug discovery and development by providing essential data on a drug's efficacy, safety, and physiological effects before advancing to human clinical trials. In this study, we propose a stent-based flow sensor designed to measure airflow in the airways of laboratory animals. The stent was fabricated from biocompatible Ti using a combination of fiber laser digital processing and an origami-inspired folding technique. The sensing structure was developed through standard micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) microfabrication technology. To integrate the sensing structure with the metallic stent, a facile insertion process was employed, where the sensor film was positioned at the stent's center using its natural buckling mechanism. Once fabricated, the stent implant was expanded and installed within an airway-mimicking tube to validate its functionality. A proof-of-concept trial using an artificial ventilator successfully demonstrated real-time respiration monitoring, confirming the feasibility of the proposed system for airflow measurement in preclinical studies. This stent-based sensor offers a promising approach for enhancing respiratory assessments in laboratory animals, potentially improving the accuracy of drug evaluations and respiratory disease research.</description>

      <title>Afterpulse prediction for SUBMET experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The SUB-Millicharge ExperimenT (SUBMET) investigates an unexplored parameter space of millicharged particles with mass $m_\chi &lt; $ 1.6 GeV/c$^2$ and charge $Q_\chi &lt; 10^{-3}e$. The detector consists of an Eljen-200 plastic scintillator coupled to a Hamamatsu Photonics R7725 photomultiplier tube (PMT). PMT afterpulses, delayed pulses produced after an energetic pulse, have been observed in the SUBMET readout system, especially following primary pulses with a large area. We present a prediction method for afterpulse rates based on measurable parameters, which reproduces the observed rate with approximately 20\% precision. This approach enables a better understanding of afterpulse contributions and, consequently, improves the reliability of background predictions.</description>

      <title>Advances in detector response and background modelling in the ANAIS-112 experiment for annual modulation and other rare event searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous astronomical and cosmological observations point to the existence of dark matter, which constitutes about 27% of the Universe. Despite extensive efforts, only the DAMA/LIBRA experiment, using NaI(Tl) detectors at Gran Sasso National Laboratory, has reported a positive dark matter signal. To independently verify this result, using the same NaI target is essential. This is the goal of ANAIS-112, operating with 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) scintillators since 2017 at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory (LSC). This thesis presents work within ANAIS-112, focusing on data analysis and the development of Geant4-based simulations to reduce systematics and increase sensitivity. Efforts have focused on understanding the ANAIS-112 crystals' response to nuclear recoils. Systematic uncertainties related to the scintillation quenching factors (QFs) of sodium and iodine recoiling in NaI(Tl) must be addressed to ensure reliable comparisons with DAMA/LIBRA and other experiments. For that purpose, onsite neutron calibrations in ANAIS-112 have been performed since 2021 at LSC using 252Cf sources. This work has compared calibration data with Geant4-based neutron simulations, which has revealed Geant4 deficiencies in certain decay processes and cross sections in some versions. The simulations have proven highly sensitive to the QF used, favouring models in which the QF increases with energy and disfavouring DAMA values. In parallel, this thesis has contributed to improving the ANAIS-112 background model through a multiparametric fit of its background components. New physics searches have been conducted using ANAIS-112 data, including a reanalysis of the annual modulation signal and a search for solar axions using six years of exposure. Finally, this thesis also includes work within the COSINUS experiment, focused on background modelling and the impact of internal backgrounds on the experiment's sensitivity.</description>

      <title>The CCube reconstruction algorithm for the SoLid experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03580v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The SoLid experiment is a very-short-baseline experiment aimed at searching for nuclear reactor-produced active to sterile antineutrino oscillations. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$LiF:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented (the basic detection unit is a 5 cm side cube). High segmentation provides numerous advantages, including the precise location of Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of the considerate antineutrino energy estimator, and a powerful background reduction tool based on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of wavelength-shifting fibres coupled to a photodetector (MPPC). This paper describes the design of the reconstruction algorithm that allows maximum use of the granularity of the detector. The goal of the algorithm is to convert the output of the optical-fibre readout to the list of the detection units from which it originated. This paper provides a performance comparison for three methods and concludes with a choice of the baseline approach for the experiment.</description>

      <title>Simulation studies of the isovector reorientation effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15738v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The isovector reorientation (IVR) effect of deuteron scattering on heavy target provides a novel means to probe the nuclear isovector potential, which gives rise to the nuclear symmetry energy. The simulation studies on the experimental measurement of IVR effect using the SAMURAI terminal at RIKEN Nishina center have been performed to demonstrate the feasibility of the experiment. By introducing a well-designed polarimeter to detect the $\mathrm{p}(\vec{\mathrm{d}}, \mathrm{d})\mathrm{p}$ elastic scattering, monitoring of the tensor polarization of the deuteron beam can be implemented. The protons and neutrons produced by the breakup of polarized deuterons scattering off heavy targets are designed to be measured by proton drift chamber (PDC) combined with the SAMURAI magnet and NEBULA detector, respectively. The detector responses are simulated using Geant4 framework, where the events of the deuteron elastic breakup are generated by an Improved Quantum Molecular Dynamics model. The results of reconstructing the deuteron breakup events demonstrate the feasibility of detecting the IVR effect at SAMURAI with both longitudinal and transverse tensor polarized deuteron beams with a polarization degree of approximately 80\%.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic energy calibration of the SoLid detector with horizontal muons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05180v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: SoLid is a neutrino experiment at very-short baseline searching for active-to-sterile oscillations of reactor antineutrinos. The detection principle is based on the pairing of two types of solid scintillators: polyvinyl toluene and $^6$Li:ZnS(Ag), which is a new technology used in this field of Physics. In addition to good neutron-gamma discrimination, this setup allows the detector to be highly segmented; the basic detection unit is a 5 cm cube. High segmentation provides numerous advantages including precise localisation of the Inverse Beta Decay (IBD) products, the derivation of an antineutrino energy estimator based on the isolated positron energy, and a powerful background reduction tool that relies on the topological signature of the signal. Finally, the system is read out by a network of WLS fibres coupled to photosensors. A relative electromagnetic calibration is performed with horizontal cosmic muons. This source poses the simplest calibration problem in which a single detection unit is involved. In addition, large muon energy deposits allow us to perform a calibration at the most detailed level (i.e. per fibre) and to accurately define the fraction of energy escaping to neighbouring detection cells. A statistical precision at the sub-percent level is reached. The paper also discusses two methods to calibrate the absolute energy scale. The first method relies on horizontal muons, though the precision is limited to around 10\% because of the uncertainty in the energy distribution of such muons. A novel, alternative method based on the radioactive AmBe source is proposed. It takes advantage of the electron-positron pair-production process and provides a calibration point at 3.4 MeV (i.e. in the core of the IBD positron spectrum). The paper is concluded with various cross-check including a determination of the energy spectrum of the standard cosmogenic background candle: $^{12}$B.</description>

      <title>A mobile high spatial-resolution Muography instrument based on large-area Micromegas detectors</title>

Abstract: Muon radiography is an imaging technique based on muon absorption in matter that allows measurement of internal details in hidden objects or structures. This technique relies on measuring cosmic-ray muons tracks accurately, which reflects the incoming muon flux from both the target object and the open sky. In this paper, we report on the construction of a high spatial resolution muography instrument based on Micromegas detectors. Using four layers of 400 mm ${\times}$ 400 mm Micromegas detectors, channel multiplexing circuits, and the versatile readout system, a moveable muography instrument named $\mu$STC-R400 was designed and constructed. Results show that the channel multiplexing circuits can resolve hit positions correctly, and the spatial resolution of the detector is approximately 190 ${\mu}$m. Experiments were conducted at an under-construction subway tunnel and outdoors near a mountain, demonstrating the ${\mu}$STC-R400's ability to maintain high spatial resolution outside the laboratory and its robustness in harsh environments.</description>

      <title>Low-temperature Performance of $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga, Al)_5O_{12}}$:Ce Scintillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last years have seen the first cryogenic detectors to be proposed for usage on balloon-borne missions. In such missions, the instrument will be exposed to the high radiation environment of the upper atmosphere. This radiation can induce a significant background to the measurements, something which can be mitigated through the use of an anti-coincidence shield. For hard X-ray and gamma-ray detectors such a shield typically consists photomultiplier tubes or, more recently, silicon photomultipliers coupled to scintillators placed around the detector. When using cryogenic detectors, the shield can be placed around the entire cryostat which will make it large, heavy and expensive. For the ASCENT (A SuperConducting ENergetic x-ray Telescope) mission, which uses Transition Edge Detectors, it was therefore considered to instead place the shield inside. This comes with the challenge of operating it at cryogenic temperatures. For this purpose, we tested the performance of 2 different types of GAGG:Ce scintillators down to 15 mK for the first time. Although significant variations of both the decay time and the light yield were found when varying the temperature, at 4 K its performance was found to be similar to that at room temperature. Furthermore, unexpected behavior around 2 K was found for both types of GAGG:Ce, leading to more in depth studies around these temperatures. Overall, the studies show that the combination of materials will allow to produce a functional anti-coincidence shield at several Kelvin.</description>

Abstract: We report results of optical characterizations of new wavelength-shifting and scintillating-wavelength-shifting fibers EJ-182 and EJ-160 from Eljen Technology and compare them to the wavelength-shifting fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain. The wavelength-dependence of attenuation was derived from spectral measurements confirming that the long attenuation length increases with wavelength, while short attenuation effects become less significant at longer wavelengths. The impact of environmental refractive index was measured by immersing a fiber in water. Immersing the fibers in water reduced the light yield and led to a suppression of the short attenuation length, consistent with the expected decrease in the refractive index contrast.</description>

Abstract: We report results of characterizing the response and light transport of wavelength-shifting (WLS) and scintillating-wavelength-shifting (Sci-WLS) fibers under irradiation by radioactive $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ sources. Light yield and light transmission were measured for the WLS fiber BCF-91A from Saint-Gobain and for a new Sci-WLS fiber EJ-160 from Eljen Technology.
  The two variants with different fluor mixtures, EJ-160I and EJ-160II, exhibited approximately five and seven times higher light yield than BCF-91A, respectively, while their attenuation lengths were 3.80\,m for BCF-91A, 4.00\,m for EJ-160I, and 2.50\,m for EJ-160II.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17280v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The HL-LHC will challenge the detectors with a nearly 10-fold increase in integrated luminosity compared to the previous LHC runs combined, thus the CMS detector will be upgraded to face the higher levels of radiation and the larger amounts of collision data to be collected. The High-Granularity Calorimeter will replace the current endcap calorimeters of the CMS detector. It will facilitate the use of particle-flow calorimetry with its unprecedented transverse and longitudinal readout/trigger segmentation, with more than 6M readout channels. The electromagnetic section as well as the high-radiation regions of the hadronic section of the HGCAL (fluences above $10^{14}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$) will be equipped with silicon pad sensors, covering a total area of 620 m$^2$. Fluences up to $10^{16}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$ and doses up to 1.5 MGy are expected. The sensors are processed on novel 8" p-type wafers with an active thickness of 300 $\mu{}m$, 200 $\mu{}m$ and 120 $\mu{}m$ and cut into hexagonal shapes for optimal use of the wafer area and tiling. Each sensor contains several hundred individually read out cells of two sizes (around 0.6 cm$^2$ or 1.2 cm$^2$). To investigate the radiation-induced bulk damage, the sensors have been irradiated with neutrons at RINSC to fluences between $6.5 \times 10^{14}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$ and $1.4 \times 10^{16}~n_{eq.}/cm^{2}$. Electrical characterization results are presented for full sensors, as well as for partial sensors cut from multi-geometry wafers with internal dicing lines on the HV potential within the active sensor area. Leakage current behaviour is investigated for various sensor types and fluence levels, including its temperature dependence. Finally, methods to limit the annealing time of the sensors during irradiation are investigated by analysing the impact of splitting high-fluence irradiations.</description>
