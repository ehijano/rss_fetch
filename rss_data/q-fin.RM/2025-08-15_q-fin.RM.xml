      <title>On data-driven robust distortion risk measures for non-negative risks with partial information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, by proposing two new kinds of distributional uncertainty sets, we explore robustness of distortion risk measures against distributional uncertainty. To be precise, we first consider a distributional uncertainty set which is characterized solely by a ball determined by general Wasserstein distance centered at certain empirical distribution function, and then further consider additional constraints of known first moment and any other higher moment of the underlying loss distribution function. Under the assumption that the distortion function is strictly concave and twice differentiable, and that the underlying loss random variable is non-negative and bounded, we derive closed-form expressions for the distribution functions which maximize a given distortion risk measure over the distributional uncertainty sets respectively. Moreover, we continue to study the general case of a concave distortion function and unbounded loss random variables. Comparisons with existing studies are also made. Finally, we provide a numerical study to illustrate the proposed models and results. Our work provides a novel generalization of several known achievements in the literature.</description>

      <title>CATNet: A geometric deep learning approach for CAT bond spread prediction in the primary market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional models for pricing catastrophe (CAT) bonds struggle to capture the complex, relational data inherent in these instruments. This paper introduces CATNet, a novel framework that applies a geometric deep learning architecture, the Relational Graph Convolutional Network (R-GCN), to model the CAT bond primary market as a graph, leveraging its underlying network structure for spread prediction. Our analysis reveals that the CAT bond market exhibits the characteristics of a scale-free network, a structure dominated by a few highly connected and influential hubs. CATNet demonstrates high predictive performance, significantly outperforming a strong Random Forest benchmark. The inclusion of topological centrality measures as features provides a further, significant boost in accuracy. Interpretability analysis confirms that these network features are not mere statistical artifacts; they are quantitative proxies for long-held industry intuition regarding issuer reputation, underwriter influence, and peril concentration. This research provides evidence that network connectivity is a key determinant of price, offering a new paradigm for risk assessment and proving that graph-based models can deliver both state-of-the-art accuracy and deeper, quantifiable market insights.</description>
