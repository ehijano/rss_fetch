      <title>HOLISMOKES XV. Search for strong gravitational lenses combining ground-based and space-based imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past, researchers have mostly relied on single-resolution images from individual telescopes to detect gravitational lenses. We propose a search for galaxy-scale lenses that, for the first time, combines high-resolution single-band images (in our case the Hubble Space Telescope, HST) with lower-resolution multi-band images (in our case Legacy survey, LS) using machine learning. This methodology aims to simulate the operational strategies that will be employed by future missions, such as combining the images of Euclid and the Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). To compensate for the scarcity of lensed galaxy images for network training, we have generated mock lenses by superimposing arc features onto HST images, saved the lens parameters, and replicated the lens system in the LS images. We test four architectures based on ResNet-18: (1) using single-band HST images, (2) using three bands of LS images, (3) stacking these images after interpolating the LS images to HST pixel scale for simultaneous processing, and (4) merging a ResNet branch of HST with a ResNet branch of LS before the fully connected layer. We compare these architecture performances by creating Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for each model and comparing their output scores. At a false-positive rate of $10^{-4}$, the true-positive rate is $\sim$0.41, $\sim$0.45, $\sim$0.51 and $\sim$0.55, for HST, LS, stacked images and merged branches, respectively. Our results demonstrate that models integrating images from both the HST and LS significantly enhance the detection of galaxy-scale lenses compared to models relying on data from a single instrument. These results show the potential benefits of using both Euclid and LSST images, as wide-field imaging surveys are expected to discover approximately 100,000 lenses.</description>

      <title>Polarization Calibration of the FAST L-band 19-beam Receiver: I. On-axis Mueller Matrix Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the polarization calibration of the 19-beam receiver at 1420 MHz within the full illumination of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope from October 2018 to March 2023. We perform spider observations to characterize the on-axis Mueller matrix of the central beam. The calibrated polarization percentage and polarization angle of a source with strong linear polarization emission are about 0.2\% and 0.5$^{\circ}$. Several parameters of the central-beam Mueller matrix show time variability from months to years, suggesting relatively frequent polarization calibrations are needed. We obtain the Mueller matrix parameters of the 18 off-center beams with the combination of on-the-fly observations and spider observations. The polarization calibration provides consistent fractional Stokes parameters of the 19 beams, although the Mueller matrix parameters of the off-center beams are not as accurate as those of the central beam. The Mueller matrix parameters of the central beam do not show a strong dependence on the reflector surface. However, we notice different off-center Mueller matrix parameters between the eastern and western sides of the reflector surface. We provide average parameters of the 19-beam Mueller matrices which should be applicable to observations from 2020 to 2022 with several caveats. After applying the average parameters, on-axis fractional linear polarization measurements $\gtrsim$ 10\% and on-axis fractional circular polarization measurements $\gtrsim$ 1.5\% can be considered high-confidence detections. For sources with weak polarization, timely polarization calibrations using spider observations are required.</description>

      <title>DeepDISC-photoz: Deep Learning-Based Photometric Redshift Estimation for Rubin LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photometric redshifts will be a key data product for the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) as well as for future ground and space-based surveys. The need for photometric redshifts, or photo-zs, arises from sparse spectroscopic coverage of observed galaxies. LSST is expected to observe billions of objects, making it crucial to have a photo-z estimator that is accurate and efficient. To that end, we present DeepDISC photo-z, a photo-z estimator that is an extension of the DeepDISC framework. The base DeepDISC network simultaneously detects, segments, and classifies objects in multi-band coadded images. We introduce photo-z capabilities to DeepDISC by adding a redshift estimation Region of Interest head, which produces a photo-z probability distribution function for each detected object. On simulated LSST images, DeepDISC photo-z outperforms traditional catalog-based estimators, in both point estimate and probabilistic metrics. We validate DeepDISC by examining dependencies on systematics including galactic extinction, blending and PSF effects. We also examine the impact of the data quality and the size of the training set and model. We find that the biggest factor in DeepDISC photo-z quality is the signal-to-noise of the imaging data, and see a reduction in photo-z scatter approximately proportional to the image data signal-to-noise. Our code is fully public and integrated in the RAIL photo-z package for ease of use and comparison to other codes at https://github.com/LSSTDESC/rail_deepdisc</description>

      <title>SynthPop: A New Framework for Synthetic Milky Way Population Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present SynthPop, a new open source, modular population synthesis Galactic modeling software to simulate catalogs of Milky Way stars along any sightline outward from the Sun. Motivated by a lack flexibility in existing Galactic models, SynthPop is coded entirely in python, can be run standalone or as an imported module, and is configured by json files that allow different model components to be switched out as desired. We describe the modular code structure, how the population generation process runs, and how to use the code. We also present model validation testing and known inaccuracies, and present an example of the code use, comparing Gaia data and the Gaia Universe Model Snapshot to a SynthPop implementation. The code is available now via GitHub with ReadTheDocs documentation and can be installed via pip.</description>

      <title>Polarization Calibration of the FAST L-band 19-beam Receiver: II. Beam Measurements of Full Stokes Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST) has been fully operational since 11 January 2020. We present a comprehensive analysis of the beam structure for each of the 19 feed horns on FAST's L-band receiver across the Stokes I, Q, U, and V parameters. Using an on-the-fly mapping pattern, we conducted simultaneous sky mapping using all 19 beams directed towards polarization calibrators J1407+2827 and J0854+2006 from 2020 to 2022. Electromagnetic simulations were also performed to model the telescope's beam patterns in all Stokes parameters. Our findings reveal a symmetrical Gaussian pattern in the Stokes I parameter of the central beam without strong sidelobes, while the off-center beams exhibit significant asymmetrical shapes that can be fitted using a combination of log-normal and Gaussian distributions. The inner beams have higher relative beam efficiencies and smaller beam sizes compared to those of the outer beams. The sidelobes of the inner beams contribute approximately 2% of the total flux in the main lobe, increasing to 5% for outer beams, with a peak at 6.8%. In Stokes U, a distinct four-lobed cloverleaf beam squash structure is observed, with similar intensity levels in both inner and outer beams. In Stokes V, a two-lobed beam squint structure is observed in the central beam, along with a secondary eight-lobed structure. The highest squint peak in Stokes V is about 0.3% of the Stokes I in the outer beams. These results align closely with the simulations, providing valuable insights for the design of radio multi-beam observations.</description>

      <title>Detecting cosmological recombination lines with a non-ideal antenna -- a first step to practical realization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photons emitted during the formation of primordial hydrogen and helium atoms over the Epoch of Recombination are expected to be preserved as additive distortions to the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) spectrum. The 'ripple' like spectral features from Cosmological Recombination Radiation (CRR) have never been detected, and are expected to be 9 orders of magnitude fainter than the CMB. Array of Precision Spectrometers for the Epoch of Recombination - APSERa - is an upcoming ground-based experiment to detect the CRR signal over 2-6 GHz. While astrophysical foregrounds may be theoretically separated from the CRR signal using their inherently different spectral characteristics, instrument generated systematics present a practical problem. We present a first ever study to detect the CRR lines in the presence of a non-ideal antenna adopting a toy model for antenna beam chromaticity. Using Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation coefficient as metrics to distinguish between CRR signal presence and absence in a simulation pipeline, we demonstrate that it is indeed possible to detect the signal using a chromatic antenna. Furthermore, we show that there are different tolerances to the antenna non-ideality based on the type of chromaticity, observing location, and LST. These can inform antenna and experiment design for a practical detection.</description>

      <title>Ground electron calibration of the Gamma-ray Transient Monitor onboard DRO-A Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Gamma-Ray Transient Monitor (GTM) is an all-sky monitor onboard the Distant Retrograde Orbit-A (DRO-A) satellite, with the scientific objective of detecting gamma-ray bursts in the energy range of 20 keV to 1 MeV. The GTM is equipped with five Gamma-Ray Transient Probes (GTPs), utilizing silicon photomultiplier (SiPM) arrays coupled with NaI(Tl) scintillators for signal readout. To test the performance of the GTP in detecting electrons, we independently developed a continuous-energy-tunable, low-current, quasi-single-electron accelerator, and used this facility for ground-based electron calibration of the GTP. This paper provides a detailed description of the operational principles of the unique electron accelerator and comprehensively presents the process and results of electron calibration for the GTP. The calibration results indicate that the dead time for normal signals is less than 4 $\mu$s, while for overflow signals, it is approximately 70 $\mu$s, consistent with the design specifications. The GTP's time-recording capability is working correctly, accurately recording overflow events. The GTP responds normally to electrons in the 0.4-1.4 MeV energy range. The ground-based electron calibration validates the design of the GTP and enhances the probe's mass model, laying the foundation for payload development, in-orbit observation strategies, and scientific data analysis.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Deconvolution of Astronomical Images with Diffusion Models: Quantifying Prior-Driven Features in Reconstructions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deconvolution of astronomical images is a key aspect of recovering the intrinsic properties of celestial objects, especially when considering ground-based observations. This paper explores the use of diffusion models (DMs) and the Diffusion Posterior Sampling (DPS) algorithm to solve this inverse problem task. We apply score-based DMs trained on high-resolution cosmological simulations, through a Bayesian setting to compute a posterior distribution given the observations available. By considering the redshift and the pixel scale as parameters of our inverse problem, the tool can be easily adapted to any dataset. We test our model on Hyper Supreme Camera (HSC) data and show that we reach resolutions comparable to those obtained by Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. Most importantly, we quantify the uncertainty of reconstructions and propose a metric to identify prior-driven features in the reconstructed images, which is key in view of applying these methods for scientific purposes.</description>

      <title>Experimental tests of the calibration of high precision differential astrometry for exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High precision differential Astrometry is the branch of astronomy that evaluates the relative position, distance and motion of celestial objects with respect to the stars present in the field of view. A mission called Theia has been submitted in 2022 for ESA's M7 call for missions, using a diffraction-limited telescope about 1m in diameter and with a field of view of 0.5 degrees, capable of achieving sub-micro-arcsecond angular accuracy, corresponding to 1e-5 pixel on the detector. Such precision makes it possible to study the nature of dark matter in our galaxy and to reveal the architecture of exoplanetary systems close to the Sun, down to the mass of the Earth. The aim of the experimental tests presented in this poster is to improve the TRL of 2 specific aspects: the calibration of new CMOS detectors with very large number of pixels and the calibration of the telescope aberrations.First, a key element of such a space telescope is the focal plane, which must be calibrated spatially with an extreme precision down to the 1e-5 pixel level. Previous work has shown that this is possible with small detector matrices (80x80 px) [1]. The goal is now to check the performances and validate this method with the new very large detectors. Pyxalis, a company based near Grenoble, is developing very large detectors (8000x5000 px) that have a low noise level and high sensitivity. The aim is to characterize and validate this type of detectors in a laboratory demonstration (see poster Pancher et al.), to ensure that the performance achieved meets the required specifications. We present the results of these characterization in this contribution.The telescope stability is also a sensitive issue. Recent work [2] has shown that the reference stars in the field of the telescope can be used as actual metrology sources in order to compute the field distortion function. Our simulations allow to model the optical aberrations with bivariate polynoms. The effects on the calibration accuracy of the degrees of the polynoms, the number of reference stars and the tilt perturbation of the M2 mirror are investigated. This poster will present the latest results obtained on a test bed developed to experimentally study the performances of this new field calibration method.</description>

      <title>Conducting High Frequency Radio SETI using ALMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Atacama Millimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA) remains unparalleled in sensitivity at radio frequencies above 35 GHz. In this paper, we explore ALMA's potential for narrowband technosignature detection, considering factors such as the interferometer's undistorted field of view, signal dilution due to significant drift rates at high frequencies and the possibility of spectral confusion. We present the first technosignature survey using archival ALMA data in Band 3, focusing on two spectral windows centred on 90.642 GHz and 93.151 GHz. Our survey places new limits at these frequencies on the prevalence of extraterrestrial transmitters for 28 galactic stars, selected from the Gaia DR3 catalogue. We employ a stellar 'bycatch' method to sample these objects within the undistorted field of view of four ALMA calibrators. For the closest star in our sample, we find no evidence of transmitters with EIRP_min &gt; 7 x 10^17 W. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first technosignature search conducted using ALMA data.</description>

      <title>Using the chi-square test to compare asteroid and laboratory reflectance spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study uses the Pearson's chi-square test to analyze the VNIR reflectance spectra of seven asteroids and look for spectral matches among approximately 11,000 laboratory spectra of meteoritic, terrestrial, synthetic, Apollo, and Luna samples. First, we use the chi-square method to analyze three well-studied asteroids - (4) Vesta, (6) Hebe, and (19) Fortuna - to establish the technique's reliability by attempting to confirm previously predicted spectral matches. The chi-square test is then applied to four other asteroids: the Mars trojans (5261) Eureka, (101429) 1998 VF31, (311999) 2007 NS2, and (385250) 2001 DH47. This study focuses on Mars trojans because of their undetermined origin and possible relationship to Mars. For asteroids that may have undergone space weathering, reddening effects are removed from the spectra to allow for a more accurate chi-square analysis. The top chi-square matches among the Mars trojans reveal significant spectral similarities with Martian meteorites and minerals found on Mars, supporting the hypothesis of a Martian origin for the analyzed Mars trojans. However, the possibility that these Mars trojans could be fragments of a disrupted differentiated body or bodies cannot be ruled out. We find that using the chi-square test with a large number of laboratory spectra is a very useful initial technique for identifying spectral analogs to asteroids.</description>

      <title>Stellar atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of about 5 million stars from S-PLUS multi-band photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Spectroscopic surveys like APOGEE, GALAH, and LAMOST have significantly advanced our understanding of the Milky Way by providing extensive stellar parameters and chemical abundances. Complementing these, photometric surveys with narrow/medium-band filters, such as the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS), offer the potential to estimate stellar parameters and abundances for a much larger number of stars.
  Aims. This work develops methodologies to extract stellar atmospheric parameters and selected chemical abundances from S-PLUS photometric data, which spans ~3000 square degrees using seven narrowband and five broadband filters.
  Methods. Using 66 S-PLUS colors, we estimated parameters based on training samples from LAMOST, APOGEE, and GALAH, applying Cost-Sensitive Neural Networks (NN) and Random Forests (RF). We tested for spurious correlations by including abundances not covered by the S-PLUS filters and evaluated NN and RF performance, with NN consistently outperforming RF. Including Teff and log g as features improved accuracy by ~3%. We retained only parameters with a goodness-of-fit above 50%.
  Results. Our approach provides reliable estimates of fundamental parameters (Teff, log g, [Fe/H]) and abundance ratios such as [{\alpha}/Fe], [Al/Fe], [C/Fe], [Li/Fe], and [Mg/Fe] for ~5 million stars, with goodness-of-fit &gt;60%. Additional ratios like [Cu/Fe], [O/Fe], and [Si/Fe] were derived but are less accurate. Validation using star clusters, TESS, and J-PLUS data confirmed the robustness of our methodology.
  Conclusions. By leveraging S-PLUS photometry and machine learning, we present a cost-effective alternative to high-resolution spectroscopy for deriving stellar parameters and abundances, enabling insights into Milky Way stellar populations and supporting future classification efforts.</description>

      <title>Unified schemes for directive-based GPU offloading</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GPU is the dominant accelerator device due to its high performance and energy efficiency. Directive-based GPU offloading using OpenACC or OpenMP target is a convenient way to port existing codes originally developed for multicore CPUs. Although OpenACC and OpenMP target provide similar features, both methods have pros and cons. OpenACC has better functions and an abundance of documents, but it is virtually for NVIDIA GPUs. OpenMP target supports NVIDIA/AMD/Intel GPUs but has fewer functions than OpenACC. Here, we have developed a header-only library, Solomon (Simple Off-LOading Macros Orchestrating multiple Notations), to unify the interface for GPU offloading with the support of both OpenACC and OpenMP target. Solomon provides three types of notations to reduce users' implementation and learning costs: intuitive notation for beginners and OpenACC/OpenMP-like notations for experienced developers. This manuscript denotes Solomon's implementation and usage and demonstrates the GPU-offloading in $N$-body simulation and the three-dimensional diffusion equation. The library and sample codes are provided as open-source software and publicly and freely available at \url{https://github.com/ymiki-repo/solomon}.</description>

      <title>Lateral Distribution Function of Extensive Air Showers Cherenkov Light and Stable Laws: Fast Modelling Method for the CORSIKA Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper proposes a new approach for approximating the lateral distribution functions (LDF) of Cherenkov light emitted by the electromagnetic component of extensive air showers (EAS) in the Earth's atmosphere. The information basis of the study is a series of simulations with the CORSIKA code. To approximate the LDF atmospheric Cherenkov light the probability density functions of one-dimensional fractional stable distributions were used. The results obtained in the work allow us to propose a fast modeling method for the CORSIKA code using a procedure similar to the Nishimura-Kamata-Greisen (NKG) for calculating the LDF of the EAS electromagnetic component.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamical simulations with strong indirect terms in Fargo-like codes: Numerical aspects of non-inertial frame and artificial viscosity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Binary star systems allow us to study the planet formation process under extreme conditions. In the early stages, these systems contain a circumbinary disk and a disk around each star. To model the interactions between these disks in the frame of one of the stars, strong fictitious forces must be included in the simulations. The original Fargo and the Fargo3D codes fail to correctly simulate such systems if the indirect term becomes too strong.
  Aims. We present a different way to compute the indirect term which, together with a tensor artificial viscosity prescription, allows the Fargo code to simulate the circumbinary disks in a non-inertial frame of reference. In this way, the Fargo code can be used to study interactions between circumstellar and circumbinary disks.
  Results. We find that updating the indirect term becomes relevant when the indirect term becomes stronger than the direct gravitational forces, which occurs for mass ratios of $q &gt; 5\%$. The default artificial viscosity used in the Fargo code inherently produces artificial pressure in a non-inertial frame of reference even in the absence of shocks. This leads to artificial mass ejection from the Hill sphere, starting at brown dwarf masses ($q &gt; 1\%$). These problems can be mitigated by using a tensor artificial viscosity formulation. For high mass ratios, $q &gt; 1\%$, it is also becomes important to initialize the disk in the center-of-mass frame. We expect our proposed changes to be relevant for other grid-based hydrodynamic codes where strong indirect terms occur, or for codes that use artificial viscosity.</description>

      <title>Wavelet Scattering Transform for Gravitational Waves Analysis. An Application to Glitch Characterization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19122v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves, first predicted by Albert Einstein within the framework of general relativity, were confirmed in 2015 by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration, marking a pivotal breakthrough in astrophysics. Despite this achievement, a key challenge remains in distinguishing true gravitational wave signals from noise artifacts, or "glitches," which can distort data and affect the quality of observations. Current state-of-the-art methods, such as the Q-transform, are widely used for signal processing, but face limitations when addressing certain types of signals. In this study, we investigate the Wavelet Scattering Transform (WST), a recent signal analysis method, as a complementary approach. Theoretical motivation for WST arises from its stability under signal deformations and its equivariance properties, which make it particularly suited for the complex nature of gravitational wave data. Our experiments on the LIGO O1a dataset show that WST simplifies classification tasks and enables the use of more efficient architectures compared to traditional methods. Furthermore, we explore the potential benefits of integrating WST with the Q-transform, demonstrating that ensemble methods exploiting both techniques can capture complementary features of the signal and improve overall performance. This work contributes to advancing machine learning applications in gravitational wave analysis, introducing refined preprocessing techniques that improve signal detection and classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present and explore a new shock-capturing particle hydrodynamics approach. We enhance a commonly used SPH discretization with Roe's approximate Riemann solver where we use slope-limited linear reconstruction in the dissipative terms of the solver. All gradients of the method are calculated with linearly reproducing kernels that are constructed to enforce the two lowest order consistency relations so that constant and linear functions can be recovered to machine precision. We scrutinize the method with a set of challenging 3D benchmark problems ranging from shocks over instabilities to Schulz-Rinne-type vorticity creating shocks. In all of them we find excellent agreement with analytic/reference solutions.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning Approach to Anomaly Detection in Gravitational Wave Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves (GW), predicted by Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, provide a powerful probe of astrophysical phenomena and fundamental physics. In this work, we propose an unsupervised anomaly detection method using variational autoencoders (VAEs) to analyze GW time-series data. By training on noise-only data, the VAE accurately reconstructs noise inputs while failing to reconstruct anomalies, such as GW signals, which results in measurable spikes in the reconstruction error. The method was applied to data from the LIGO H1 and L1 detectors. Evaluation on testing datasets containing both noise and GW events demonstrated reliable detection, achieving an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.89. This study introduces VAEs as a robust, unsupervised approach for identifying anomalies in GW data, which offers a scalable framework for detecting known and potentially new phenomena in physics.</description>

      <title>A Statistical Study of Lopsided Galaxies using Random Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lopsided galaxies are late-type galaxies with a non-axisymmetric disc due to an uneven distribution of their stellar mass. Despite being a relatively common perturbation, several questions regarding its origin and the information that can be extracted from them about the evolutionary history of late-type galaxies. The advent of several large multi-band photometric surveys will allow us to statistically analyze this perturbation, with information that was not previously available. Given the strong correlation between lopsidedness and the structural properties of the galaxies, this paper aims to develop a method to automatically classify late-type galaxies between lopsided and symmetric. We seek to explore if an accurate classification can be obtain by only considering their internal properties, without additional information about the environment. We select 8000 late-type galaxies from TNG50. A Fourier decomposition of their stellar mass surface density is used to label galaxies as lopsided and symmetric. We trained a Random Forest classifier to rapidly and automatically identify this type of perturbations, exclusively using galaxies internal properties. We test different algorithms to deal with the imbalance of our data and select the most suitable approach based on the considered metrics. We show that our trained algorithm can provide a very accurate and rapid classification of lopsided galaxies. The excellent results obtained by our classifier strongly supports the hypothesis that lopsidedness is mainly a tracer of galaxies internal structures. We show that similar results can be obtained using observable quantities, readily obtainable from multi-bad photometric surveys. Our results show it allows a rapid and accurate classification of lopsided galaxies, allowing us to explore whether lopsidedness in present-day disc galaxies is connected to galaxies specific evolutionary histories.</description>

      <title>Tuning the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) Observing Strategy for Solar System Science: Incremental Templates in Year 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vera C. Rubin Observatory is due to commence the 10-year Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) at the end of 2025. To detect transient/variable sources and identify solar system objects (SSOs), the processing pipelines require templates of the static sky to perform difference imaging. During the first year of the LSST, templates must be generated as the survey progresses, otherwise SSOs cannot be discovered nightly. The incremental template generation strategy has not been finalized; therefore, we use the Metric Analysis Framework (MAF) and a simulation of the survey cadence (one_snap_v4.0_10yrs}) to explore template generation in Year 1. We have assessed the effects of generating templates over timescales of days-weeks, when at least four images of sufficient quality are available for $\geq90\%$ of the visit. We predict that SSO discoveries will begin $\sim$2-3 months after the start of the survey. We find that the ability of the LSST to discover SSOs in real-time is reduced in Year 1. This is especially true for detections in areas of the sky that receive fewer visits, such as the North Ecliptic Spur (NES), and in less commonly used filters, such as the $u$ and $g$-bands. The lack of templates in the NES dominates the loss of real-time SSO discoveries; across the whole sky the MAF Main-Belt asteroid (MBA) discovery metric decreases by up to $63\%$ compared to the baseline observing strategy, whereas the metric decreases by up to $79\%$ for MBAs in the NES alone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The next generation of wide-field deep astronomical surveys will deliver unprecedented amounts of images through the 2020s and beyond. As both the sensitivity and depth of observations increase, more blended sources will be detected. This reality can lead to measurement biases that contaminate key astronomical inferences. We implement new deep learning models available through Facebook AI Research's Detectron2 repository to perform the simultaneous tasks of object identification, deblending, and classification on large multi-band coadds from the Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). We use existing detection/deblending codes and classification methods to train a suite of deep neural networks, including state-of-the-art transformers. Once trained, we find that transformers outperform traditional convolutional neural networks and are more robust to different contrast scalings. Transformers are able to detect and deblend objects closely matching the ground truth, achieving a median bounding box Intersection over Union of 0.99. Using high quality class labels from the Hubble Space Telescope, we find that the best-performing networks can classify galaxies with near 100% completeness and purity across the whole test sample and classify stars above 60% completeness and 80% purity out to HSC i-band magnitudes of 25 mag. This framework can be extended to other upcoming deep surveys such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time and those with the Roman Space Telescope to enable fast source detection and measurement. Our code, DeepDISC is publicly available at https://github.com/grantmerz/deepdisc.</description>

      <title>Transient Classifiers for Fink: Benchmarks for LSST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08798v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to detect a few million transients per night, which will generate a live alert stream during the entire ten years of the survey. This stream will be distributed via community brokers whose task is to select subsets of the stream and direct them to scientific communities. Given the volume and complexity of the anticipated data, machine learning algorithms will be paramount for this task. We present the infrastructure tests and classification methods developed within the Fink broker in preparation for LSST. This work aims to provide detailed information regarding the underlying assumptions and methods behind each classifier and enable users to make informed follow-up decisions from Fink photometric classifications. Using simulated data from ELAsTiCC, we showcase the performance of binary and multi-class ML classifiers available in Fink. These include tree-based classifiers coupled with tailored feature extraction strategies as well as deep learning algorithms. Moreover, we introduce CATS, a deep learning architecture specifically designed for this task. Our results show that Fink classifiers are able to handle the extra complexity that is expected from LSST data. CATS achieved $\geq 93\%$ precision for all classes except `long' (for which it achieved $\sim 83\%$), while our best performing binary classifier achieves $\geq 98\%$ precision and $\geq 99\%$ completeness when classifying the periodic class. ELAsTiCC was an important milestone in preparing the Fink infrastructure to deal with LSST-like data. Our results demonstrate that Fink classifiers are well prepared for the arrival of the new stream, but this work also highlights that transitioning from the current infrastructures to Rubin will require significant adaptation of the currently available tools. This work was the first step in the right direction.</description>

      <title>ANNZ+: an enhanced photometric redshift estimation algorithm with applications on the PAU Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09981v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: ANNZ is a fast and simple algorithm which utilises artificial neural networks (ANNs), it was known as one of the pioneers of machine learning approaches to photometric redshift estimation decades ago. We enhanced the algorithm by introducing new activation functions like tanh, softplus, SiLU, Mish and ReLU variants; its new performance is then vigorously tested on legacy samples like the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) and Stripe-82 samples from SDSS, as well as modern galaxy samples like the Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS). This work focuses on testing the robustness of activation functions with respect to the choice of ANN architectures, particularly on its depth and width, in the context of galaxy photometric redshift estimation. Our upgraded algorithm, which we named ANNZ+, shows that the tanh and Leaky ReLU activation functions provide more consistent and stable results across deeper and wider architectures with &gt; 1 per cent improvement in root-mean-square error ($\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$) and 68th percentile error ($\sigma_{68}$) when tested on SDSS data sets. While assessing its capabilities in handling high dimensional inputs, we achieved an improvement of 11 per cent in $\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$ and 6 per cent in $\sigma_{68}$ with the tanh activation function when tested on the 40-narrowband PAUS dataset; it even outperformed ANNZ2, its supposed successor, by 44 per cent in $\sigma_{\textrm{RMS}}$. This justifies the effort to upgrade the 20-year-old ANNZ, allowing it to remain viable and competitive within the photo-z community today. The updated algorithm ANNZ+ is publicly available at https://github.com/imdadmpt/ANNzPlus.</description>

      <title>The James Webb Space Telescope Absolute Flux Calibration. II. Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The absolute flux calibration of the Mid-Infrared Instrument Imaging and Coronagraphy is based on observations of multiple stars taken during the first 2.5 years of JWST operations. The observations were designed to ensure that the flux calibration is valid for a range of flux densities, different subarrays, and different types of stars. The flux calibration was measured by combining observed aperture photometry corrected to infinite aperture with predictions based on previous observations and models of stellar atmospheres. A subset of these observations were combined with model point-spread-functions to measure the corrections to infinite aperture. Variations in the calibration factor with time, flux density, background level, type of star, subarray, integration time, rate, and well depth were investigated, and the only significant variations were with time and subarray. Observations of the same star taken approximately every month revealed a modest time-dependent response loss seen mainly at the longest wavelengths. This loss is well characterized by a decaying exponential with a time constant of ~200 days. After correcting for the response loss, the band-dependent scatter around the corrected average (aka repeatability) was found to range from 0.1 to 1.2%. Signals in observations taken with different subarrays can be lower by up to 3.4% compared to FULL frame. After correcting for the time and subarray dependencies, the scatter in the calibration factors measured for individual stars ranges from 1 to 4% depending on the band. The formal uncertainties on the flux calibration averaged for all observations are 0.3 to 1.0%, with longer-wavelength bands generally having larger uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Logistic regression to boost exoplanet detection performances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11571</link>

Abstract: Direct imaging of exoplanets requires to separate the background noise from the exoplanet signals. Statistical methods have been recently proposed to avoid subtracting any signal of interest as opposed to initial self-subtracting methods based on Angular Differential Imaging (ADI). However, unless conservative thresholds are chosen to claim for a detection, such approaches tend to produce a list of candidates that include many false positives. Choosing high, conservative, thresholds leads to miss the faintest planets. We extend a statistical framework with a logistic regression to filter the list of candidates. Features with physical/optical meaning (in two wavelengths) are used, leading to a very fast and pragmatic approach. The overall method requires a simple edge detection (image processing) and clustering algorithm to work with sub-images. To estimate its efficiency, we apply our approach to targets observed with the ESO/SPHERE high contrast imager, that were previously used as tests for blind surveys. Experimental results with injected signals show that either the number of false detections is considerably reduced or faint exoplanets that would otherwise not be detected can be sometimes found. Typically, on the blind tests performed, we are now able to detect around 50% more of the injected planets with an SNR below 5, and with a very low number of additional candidates.</description>

      <title>Fast likelihood-free inference in the LSS Stage IV era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Forthcoming large-scale structure (LSS) Stage IV surveys will provide us with unprecedented data to probe the nature of dark matter and dark energy. However, analysing these data with conventional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods will be challenging, due to the increase in the number of nuisance parameters and the presence of intractable likelihoods. In light of this, we present the first application of Marginal Neural Ratio Estimation (MNRE) (a recent approach in simulation-based inference) to LSS photometric probes: weak lensing, galaxy clustering and the cross-correlation power spectra. In order to analyse the hundreds of spectra simultaneously, we find that a pre-compression of data using principal component analysis, as well as parameter-specific data summaries lead to highly accurate results. Using expected Stage IV experimental noise, we are able to recover the posterior distribution for the cosmological parameters with a speedup factor of $\sim 10-60$ compared to classical MCMC methods. To illustrate that the performance of MNRE is not impeded when posteriors are highly non-Gaussian, we test a scenario of two-body decaying dark matter, finding that Stage IV surveys can improve current bounds on the model by up to one order of magnitude. This result supports that MNRE is a powerful framework to constrain the standard cosmological model and its extensions with next-generation LSS surveys.</description>

      <title>An accurate solar axions ray-tracing response of BabyIAXO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: BabyIAXO is the intermediate stage of the International Axion Observatory (IAXO) to be hosted at DESY. Its primary goal is the detection of solar axions following the axion helioscope technique. Axions are converted into photons in a large magnet that is pointing to the sun. The resulting X-rays are focused by appropriate X-ray optics and detected by sensitive low-background detectors placed at the focal spot. The aim of this article is to provide an accurate quantitative description of the different components (such as the magnet, optics, and X-ray detectors) involved in the detection of axions. Our efforts have focused on developing robust and integrated software tools to model these helioscope components, enabling future assessments of modifications or upgrades to any part of the IAXO axion helioscope and evaluating the potential impact on the experiment's sensitivity. In this manuscript, we demonstrate the application of these tools by presenting a precise signal calculation and response analysis of BabyIAXO's sensitivity to the axion-photon coupling. Though focusing on the Primakoff solar flux component, our virtual helioscope model can be used to test different production mechanisms, allowing for direct comparisons within a unified framework.</description>

      <title>A new potential method for the $X_{\rm max}$ measurement of extensive air showers based on backtracking radio signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: {Measurements of cosmic-ray composition based on air-shower measurements rely mostly on the determination of the position of the shower maximum ($X_\mathrm{max}$). One efficient technique is to image the development of the air shower using fluorescence telescopes. An alternative technique that has made significant advances in the recent years is to measure the radio emission from air shower. Common methods for $X_\mathrm{max}$ determination in the radio detection technique include fitting a two-dimensional radio intensity footprint at the ground with Monte-Carlo simulated showers which is computationally quite expensive, and others that are based on parameterizations obtained from simulations. In this paper, we present a new method which is computationally extremely efficient and has the potential to reconstruct $X_{\rm max}$ with minimal input from simulations. The method involves geometrical reconstruction of radio emission profile of air showers along the shower axis by backtracking radio signals recorded by an array of antennas at the ground. On implementing the method on simulated cosmic-ray proton and iron showers in the energy range of $\rm 10^{17}-10^{18}\,eV$, we find a strong correlation between the radio emission profile obtained with the method in the $20-80$~MHz frequency range and the shower longitudinal profile, implying a new potential way of measuring $X_\mathrm{max}$ using radio signals.}</description>
