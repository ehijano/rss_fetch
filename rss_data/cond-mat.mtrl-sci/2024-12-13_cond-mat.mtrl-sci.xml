      <title>Contact Resistance Optimization in MoS${_2}$ Field-Effect Transistors through Reverse Sputtering-Induced Structural Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional material (2DM)-based field-effect transistors (FETs), such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS${_2}$)-FETs, have gained significant attention for their potential for ultra-short channels, thereby extending Moore's law. However, MoS${_2}$-FETs are prone to the formation of Schottky barriers at the metal-MoS${_2}$ interface, resulting in high contact resistance (R${_c}$) and, consequently, reduced transistor currents in the ON-state. Our study explores the modification of MoS${_2}$ to induce the formation of conductive 1T-MoS${_2}$ at the metal-MoS${_2}$ interface via reverse sputtering. MoS${_2}$-FETs exposed to optimized reverse sputtering conditions in the contact area show R${_c}$ values reduced to less than 50% of their untreated counterparts. This reduction translates into improvements in other electrical characteristics, such as higher ON-state currents. Since reverse sputtering is a standard semiconductor process that enhances the electrical performance of MoS${_2}$-FETs, it has great potential for broader application scenarios in 2DM-based microelectronic devices and circuits.</description>

      <title>Thermal-noise Limits to the Frequency Stability of Burned Spectral Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Techniques in frequency stabilization of lasers to fixed-spacer optical cavities have advanced to the point where the ultimate frequency stabilities are limited by thermal noise in the cavity materials for standard cavity configurations at room temperature. The use of spectral-hole burning (SHB) in laser stabilization has produced promising results in early experiments. In this letter we explore the thermal-noise limits to frequency stability in burned spectral holes. We compile known material parameters for a typical system used in SHB experiments (Eu 3+ doped Y 2 SiO 5 ) to make numerical estimates for the fundamental thermal-noise induced frequency instability in spectral-holes for the liquid-helium temperature and dilution temperature cases. These efforts can guide the design of future SHB experiments and clarify which important material parameters remain to be measured.</description>

      <title>Heat Transport in Ionic Liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heat transfer in liquids is a very challenging problem as it combines the competing effect of high frequency oscillations, which dominate liquid heat capacity, and diffusive motion, which enables transport macroscopic flow. This issue is compounded by the relatively junior state of dynamical theories of liquid thermodynamics. Nevertheless, molten salts are playing an increasingly important role in industrial and energy applications and there is a pressing need to understand the mechanisms behind their irreversible transport processes. Here we use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the heat transport of three different molten salts: LiCl, KCl, and the eutectic point of their mixture. While all simulations consider the properties of the liquid within the frame of its centre of mass, we calculate different susceptibilities which implicitly include and explicitly exclude the heat carried by partial mass currents within this frame. We find that, while the heat advected by partial mass currents in the mixture increases with increasing temperature, the heat transferred by collective vibrational motion (phonons) decreases with increasing temperature. This causes a maximum in the heat conductance with temperature in the mixtures only - in pure salts each contribution decreases monotonically with temperature. We attribute this anomaly to the extra freedom afforded to ionic motion in mixtures - in pure salts the motion of cations and anions is bound due to conservation of linear momentum. In mixtures, a coherent but diffusive collective motion is enabled by the release of Li ions from this condition by the introduction of a third species. We tentatively ascribe this coherent collective motion to the ``diffusive" phonons that have been used to explain a similar anomaly in the thermal conductivity of solids.</description>

      <title>Anomalous hardening of spin waves in cobalt/molecular-semiconductor heterostructures reveals strongly anisotropic spinterface magnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interface between a ferromagnetic metal and an organic molecular semiconductor, commonly referred to as a spinterface, is an important component for advancing spintronic technologies. Hybridization of the ferromagnetic-metal surface d orbitals with the molecular-semiconductor p orbitals induces profound modifications not only in the interfacial molecular layer, but also in the surface ferromagnetic-metal atomic layer. These effects are particularly pronounced at low temperatures, manifesting as substantial modifications in the magnetic properties of thin-film magnetic-metal/organic heterostructures. Despite extensive research and interest, the magnetic-ordering and magnetic-properties of the spinterface remain poorly understood. Using ultrafast time-resolved magneto-optical spectroscopy, to investigate the magnetic dynamics in such heterostructures, we unveil the unique spinterface-magnetism and its universality for a broad variety of cobalt/molecular-semiconductor interfaces. In particular, our findings demonstrate the presence of highly anisotropic low-temperature superparamagnetism at the cobalt/molecular-semiconductor spinterface. This anisotropic interfacial superparamagnetism is likely driven by strong chemical modifications in the cobalt interfacial layer caused by the chemisorbed molecular layer. These results highlight the pivotal role of molecular chemisorption in tuning the magnetic properties at spinterfaces, paving the way for future spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Designing flexible hard magnetic materials for zero-magnetic-field operation of the anomalous Nernst effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global shift towards a carbon-neutral society has accelerated the demand for green energy, driving research into efficient technologies for harvesting energy from low-grade waste heat. Recently, transverse thermoelectrics based on the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) has gained attention due to their simple device structure, scalability, and manufacturing-friendly nature. While topological single crystals and epitaxial films have been focused for enhancing the ANE-driven thermoelectric performance, further improvements in material design are necessary for practical applications. Here, we report an easy-to-implement strategy for designing mechanically flexible and magnetically hard transverse thermoelectric materials by creating amorphous-crystalline heterogeneous composites. We fabricated and optimized the heterogeneous composites through controlled heat treatment, achieving significant enhancements in the coercivity and anomalous Nernst coefficient, while maintaining flexibility. Additionally, using the developed material, we constructed a single-material-based coiled device and demonstrated the zero-field operation of the ANE-based energy harvesting from curved heat sources. These results validate the feasibility of using the ANE-based flexible materials for energy harvesting applications.</description>

      <title>First-principles theory of direct-gap optical emission in hexagonal Ge and its enhancement via strain engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of hexagonal Ge (2H-Ge) as a candidate direct-gap group-IV semiconductor for Si photonics mandates rigorous understanding of its optoelectronic properties. Theoretical predictions of a "pseudo-direct" band gap, characterized by weak oscillator strength, contrast with a claimed high radiative recombination coefficient $B$ comparable to conventional (cubic) InAs. We compute $B$ in 2H-Ge from first principles and quantify its dependence on temperature, carrier density and strain. For unstrained 2H-Ge, our calculated spontaneous emission spectra corroborate that measured photoluminescence corresponds to direct-gap emission, but with $B$ being approximately three orders of magnitude lower than in InAs. We confirm a pseudo-direct- to direct-gap transition under $\sim 2$\% [0001] uniaxial tension, which can enhance $B$ by up to three orders of magnitude, making it comparable to that of InAs. Beyond quantifying strong enhancement of $B$ via strain engineering, our analysis suggests the dominance of additional, as-yet unquantified recombination mechanisms in this nascent material.</description>

      <title>M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes family materials with Dirac nodal loop, strong light-harvesting ability, long carrier lifetime and conduction-band valley spin splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes, as emerging MXenes-like materials, also have wide structural spaces and various chemical and physical properties. Using first-principles and high-throughput calculations, we have built an online library (\url{https://moenes.online}) for M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes family materials from basic summaries, mechanical, phonon and electron aspects, based on their structural diversities from 2 stoichiometric ratios, 11 early-transition metals, 4 typical functional groups and 4 oxygen group elements. Compared to MXenes, the main advantage of M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes at present is that we have discovered 14 direct semiconductors, which greatly increases the number of direct semiconductors and the range of band gap values in the MXenes family. Among them, 1T-Ti$_{2}$\textit{\textbf{O}}F$_{2}$ (\textbf{\textit{O}}=O, S, Se) reveal tunable semiconducting features and strong light-harvesting ability ranging from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared region. Besides, 2H- and 1T-Y$_{2}$TeO$_{2}$ have a long carrier lifetime of 2.38 and 1.24 ns, originating from their spatially distinguished VBM and CBM states and long dephasing times. In addition, 2H-Zr$_{2}$O(O)$_{2}$ shows spin-valley coupling phenomena, and the valley spin splitting is apparent and robust in its conduction band ($\sim$85 meV). Therefore, M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes have a wealth of physical properties, not limited to those reported here, and future studies of these emerging M\textbf{\textit{O}}enes are appealing.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Construction of Hyperuniform, Nonhyperuniform and Antihyperuniform Random Media via Spectral Density Functions and Their Transport Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rigorous theories connecting physical properties of a heterogeneous material to its microstructure offer a promising avenue to guide the computational material design and optimization. We present here an efficient Fourier-space based computational framework and employ a variety of analytical ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions that satisfy all known necessary conditions to construct 3D disordered stealthy hyperuniform, standard hyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, and antihyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous material systems at varying phase volume fractions. We show that a rich spectrum of distinct structures within each of the above classes of materials can be generated by tuning correlations in the system across length scales. We present the first realization of antihyperuniform two-phase heterogeneous materials in 3D, which are characterized by a power-law autocovariance function $\chi_{_V}(r)$ and contain clusters of dramatically different sizes and morphologies. We also determine the diffusion spreadability ${\cal S}(t)$ and estimate the fluid permeability $k$ associated with all of the constructed materials directly from the corresponding ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions. We find that varying the length-scale parameter within each class of ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ functions can also lead to orders of magnitude variation of ${\cal S}(t)$ at intermediate and long time scales. Moreover, we find that increasing solid volume fraction $\phi_1$ and correlation length $a$ in the constructed media generally leads to a decrease in the dimensionless fluid permeability $k/a^2$. These results indicate the feasibility of employing parameterized ${\tilde \chi}_{_V}({k})$ for designing composites with targeted transport properties.</description>

      <title>Dependence of rate on complex GB migration by ramped-ECO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GB migration plays a central role in microstructural evolution. Many experiments and simulations have been conducted to clarify the relationships between GB velocity and various parameters to tailor GB networks. However, the complexity of GB migration has surpassed initial expectations. In this study, the ramped Energy Conserving Orientational (r-ECO) Driving Force (DF) in Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations was utilized to investigate grain boundary (GB) motion for $\Sigma$3(110), $\Sigma$15(211), and $\Sigma$11(311). My findings indicate that the rate of the driving force determines the velocity of GB migration. Furthermore, a reverse shear coupling behavior during GB migration was observed when the rate was decreased in $\Sigma$15(211). In addition to the change in the direction of shear coupling, a linear relationship between the rate and the transition point during shear coupling migration was discovered. Specifically, a larger rate leads to a forward shift in the transition point. Moreover, GB transition from coupled to only normal migration states in the presence of dislocations nucleated in the GB was observed. These findings contribute to a deeper understanding of microstructural evolution and have implications for designing materials with enhanced properties.</description>

      <title>Detrimental 2$p$-3$d$ Hybridisation in Ni Nanosheets Supported on Strontium Dioxide for Catalytic H$_2$ Production, Necessitating Thickness Optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We employ accurate density functional theory calculations to examine the electronic structure of three Ni/SrO$_2$ nanostructures containing single-layer, bilayer and four-layer Ni nanosheets. The single Ni layer interacts strongly with the topmost oxygen layer at the Ni/SrO$_2$ interface, resulting in significant surface reconstruction and strong hybridisation between the O $2p$ and Ni $3d$ states. For the bilayer Ni, the layer facing the interface also strongly interacts with the O. However, the second layer retains its geometry. For the four-layer system, none of the Ni layers interacted strongly with O. According to the electronic population analysis, in the thinnest nanosheets, the strong hybridisation with oxygen pulls Ni's $3d$ states away from the Fermi level deeper into the valence band. In these cases, Ni's electronic population that is labile for catalysis in the vicinity of the Fermi level was as little as half of the bilayer nanosheet. Such reduction in the labile $3d$ population has a detrimental effect on Ni's catalytic performance in de-hydrogenating formic acid. Our results demonstrate that there is an optimum dimension for Ni nanoparticles below or above which the catalytic performance deteriorates. Consequently, reducing the Ni dimension to maximise the surface in the hope of better catalytic yield might not be the best strategy as detrimental $p$-$d$ hybridisation takes hold. Smaller might not always be better after all!</description>

      <title>Evidence for Local Symmetry Breaking in the Skyrmion-Hosting Ni2In-type Hexagonal Compounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09158v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays a crucial role to stabilize the exotic topologically stable skyrmion spin-textures in the noncentrosymmetric crystals. The recent discovery of biskyrmions and skyrmions in the globally centrosymmetric crystals has raised debate about the role of the DMI in causing the spin textures, since DMI vanishes in such crystal structures. Theoretical studies, on the other hand, suggest non-vanishing DMI even if there is local inversion symmetry breaking in an otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystal structure. Motivated by such theoretical predictions, we present here the results of a systematic crystal structure study of two skyrmion-hosting Ni2In-type centrosymmetric hexagonal compounds, MnNiGa and MnPtGa, using the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) technique. Our result provides information about structural correlations in the short-range (SR), medium-range (MR) and long-range (LR) regimes simultaneously. The analysis of the experimental PDFs, obtained from high flux, high energy and high-Q synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction patterns, reveal that the local SR structure of both MnNiGa and MnPtGa compounds corresponds to the noncentrosymmetric trigonal space group P3m1, while the structure in the MR+LR regimes remains hexagonal in the centrosymmetric P63/mmc space group. These findings are also supported by theoretical DFT calculations. Our results in conjunction with the previous theoretical predictions, provide a rationale for the genesis of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials in terms of non-vanishing DMI due to local inversion symmetry breaking. We believe that our findings would encourage a systematic search of skyrmionic textures and other topological phenomena in a vast family of centrosymmetric materials.</description>

      <title>Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid parameters in Multi-wall Nanotubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) theory is a canonical formalism used to describe one-dimensional (1D) metals, where the low energy physics is determined by collective bosonic excitations. In this work, we present a theoretical model to compute the parameters of Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) in multi-wall nanotubes (MWNTs). MWNTs introduce additional complexity to the usual fermionic chains due to interactions and hybridization between their multiple coaxial shells. We consider a model in which conducting paths along the length of the MWNTs are randomly distributed among the shells. Since the valley degree of freedom remains a good quantum number, the TLL description in addition to spin and charge, contains also valley degree of freedom, hence four mode description applies. The values of all four TLL parameters are obtained for this model. A surprising outcome is that the compressibility of the holon mode becomes a universal quantity, while the parameters of neutral modes will depend on the details of inter-shell coupling. Finally, we propose experiments where our predictions can be tested.</description>

Abstract: Momentum-resolved spin-polarized bands are a key ingredient in many proposed spintronic devices, but their existence often relies on lattice commensurability or strong spin-orbit coupling. By a large-scale DFT calculation (up to 4212 atoms), we propose a way to realize strongly spin-polarized bands in the absence of these ingredients by twisting monolayers of van der Waals magnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Furthermore, due to the highly anisotropic electronic transport in this material, the twist-induced electronic transport becomes strongly coupled to the spin transport. We show that an in-plane electric field induces a transverse spin current, manifesting a twist-tunable spin-Hall effect in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Using highthroughput computations, we also identify 231 other material candidates out of a set of 6000 magnetic two-dimensional materials, which satisfy the necessary conditions to realize this behavior, paving the way to widespread application of twist-tunable spin transport.</description>

      <title>Crystal Symmetry Selected Pure Spin Photocurrent in Altermagnetic Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generation of time-reversal-odd spin-current in metallic altermagnets has attracted considerable interest in spintronics. However, producing pure spin-current in insulating materials remains both challenging and desirable, as insulating states are frequently found in antiferromagnets. Nonlinear photogalvanic effects offer a promising method for generating spin-current in insulators. We here revealed that spin and charge photocurrents in altermagnets are protected by spin point group symmetry. Unlike the photocurrents in parity-time symmetric materials, where spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induces a significant charge current, the spin-current in altermagnets can exist as a pure spin current along specific crystal directions regardless of SOC. We applied our predictions using first-principles calculations to several distinct materials, including wurtzite MnTe and multiferroic BiFeO3. Additionally, we elucidated the previously overlooked linear-inject-current mechanism in BiFeO3 induced by SOC, which may account for the enhanced bulk photovotaic effect in multiferroics.</description>

      <title>Molten salt ion source using glass capillaries as emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a proof of concept of an ion source using a molten salt mixture to produce a beam of desired alkali ions like Cs$^+$ when polarized positively or oxygen complexes like NO$_3^-$ when polarized negatively. Similar to liquid metal ion sources, the ions of the salt are emitted by field evaporation from a Taylor cone formed under the influence of an intense electric field, but unlike liquid metal sources, the meniscus of the Taylor cone is not anchored on the tip of a tungsten needle but rather on the tip of a conical glass capillary containing the molten salt. We succeeded in producing a stable ion beam emission of several $\mu$A for about 50 min. We also discuss the behavior of the molten salt mixture in vacuum conditions, as to our knowledge, molten salts in vacuum conditions are not well documented in the literature, while their properties are essential to the design of the presented ion source.</description>

      <title>First-principles theory of nonlinear long-range electron-phonon interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electron-phonon interactions in solids are crucial for understanding many interesting phenomena, such as conventional superconductivity, temperature-dependent band-gap renormalization, and polarons. For harmonic materials, the linear interaction of one electron with one phonon is sufficient to quantitatively describe these properties. However, in anharmonic materials such as quantum paraelectrics, halide perovskites, and high-pressure hydrides, the nonlinear electron-phonon interactions may play an important role. Currently, the only available Hamiltonians for nonlinear electron-phonon interaction are model Hamiltonians, written in terms of phenomenological parameters. Here, we present a microscopic theory for long-range nonlinear electron-phonon interactions, which can be combined with first-principles calculations. We provide a semi-analytical expression for the long-range part of the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element. We show that in contrast to the long-range 1-electron-1-phonon interaction, the continuum approximation is not sufficient and the entire phonon dispersion must be taken into account. Additionally, we show that the quasiparticle energies can be written in terms of a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function. To demonstrate the method, we calculate the 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function for LiF and KTaO$_3$ from first principles. Our framework is a step forward toward complete first-principles calculations of nonlinear electron-phonon interactions in solids.</description>

      <title>Anharmonic long-range electron-phonon interaction: analytic formalism</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Describing electron-phonon interactions in a solid requires knowledge of the electron-phonon matrix elements in the Hamiltonian. State-of-the-art first-principles calculations for the electron-phonon interaction are limited to the 1-electron-1-phonon matrix element, which is suitable for harmonic materials. However, there is no first-principles theory for 1-electron-2-phonon interactions, which occur in anharmonic materials with significant electron-phonon interaction such as halide perovskites and quantum paraelectrics. Here, we derive an analytical expression for the long-range part of the 1-electron-2-phonon matrix element, written in terms of microscopic quantities that can be calculated from first principles. We show that the long-range 1-electron-2-phonon interaction is described by the derivative of the phonon dynamical matrix with respect to an external electric field. We calculate the quasiparticle energy of a large polaron including 1-electron-2-phonon interaction, and show that it can be written in terms of a 1-electron-2-phonon spectral function $\mathcal{T}_{\alpha \beta}(\omega)$. We demonstrate how to calculate this spectral function for the benchmark material LiF. The first-principles framework developed in this article is general, paving the way for future calculations of 1-electron-2-phonon interactions from first principles.</description>

      <title>Defect density of states of tin oxide and copper oxide p-type thin-film transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09533v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The complete subgap defect density of states (DoS) is measured using the ultrabroadband (0.15 to 3.5 eV) photoconduction response from p-type thin-film transistors (TFTs) of tin oxide, SnO, and copper oxide, Cu$_2$O. The TFT photoconduction spectra clearly resolve all bandgaps that further show the presence of interfacial and oxidized minority phases. In tin oxide, the SnO majority phase has a small 0.68 eV bandgap enabling ambipolar or p-mode TFT operation. By contrast, in copper oxide TFTs, an oxidized minority phase with a 1.4 eV bandgap corresponding to CuO greatly reduces the channel hole mobility at the charge accumulation region. Three distinct subgap DoS peaks are resolved for the copper oxide TFT and are best ascribed to copper vacancies, oxygen-on-copper antisites, and oxygen interstitials. For tin oxide TFTs, five subgap DoS peaks are observed and are similarly linked to tin vacancies, oxygen vacancies, and oxygen interstitials. Unipolar p-type TFT is achieved in tin oxide only when the conduction band-edge defect density peak ascribed to oxygen interstitials is large enough to suppress any n-mode conduction. Near the valence band edge in both active channel materials, the metal vacancy peak densities determine the hole concentrations, which further simulate the observed TFT threshold voltages.</description>

      <title>Foundational Large Language Models for Materials Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials discovery and development are critical for addressing global challenges. Yet, the exponential growth in materials science literature comprising vast amounts of textual data has created significant bottlenecks in knowledge extraction, synthesis, and scientific reasoning. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate materials research through automated analysis and prediction. Still, their effective deployment requires domain-specific adaptation for understanding and solving domain-relevant tasks. Here, we present LLaMat, a family of foundational models for materials science developed through continued pretraining of LLaMA models on an extensive corpus of materials literature and crystallographic data. Through systematic evaluation, we demonstrate that LLaMat excels in materials-specific NLP and structured information extraction while maintaining general linguistic capabilities. The specialized LLaMat-CIF variant demonstrates unprecedented capabilities in crystal structure generation, predicting stable crystals with high coverage across the periodic table. Intriguingly, despite LLaMA-3's superior performance in comparison to LLaMA-2, we observe that LLaMat-2 demonstrates unexpectedly enhanced domain-specific performance across diverse materials science tasks, including structured information extraction from text and tables, more particularly in crystal structure generation, a potential adaptation rigidity in overtrained LLMs. Altogether, the present work demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation towards developing practically deployable LLM copilots for materials research. Beyond materials science, our findings reveal important considerations for domain adaptation of LLMs, such as model selection, training methodology, and domain-specific performance, which may influence the development of specialized scientific AI systems.</description>

      <title>On the effect of isotropic and anisotropic dissipative response functions with associated and non-associated flow on the inelastic behaviour of polymeric composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08656v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article investigates the effect of using isotropic and anisotropic plastic response functions in the analysis of the elastic-plastic response of unidirectional fibre composites on the meso-scale. Three model problems that use a Drucker-Prager-type pressure-dependent yield function are considered to simulate the non-linearities exhibited by a composite material. A further core ingredient is the analysis of a canonical and non-conventional constitutive structure, with respect to associated and non-associated flow response, where the use of latter is motivated by the physical inconsistencies induced by the former under shear dominated loads. These models are evaluated quantitatively by comparison to experimental data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polymers play a crucial role in the development of engineering materials, with applications ranging from mechanical to biomedical fields. However, the limited polymerization processes constrain the variety of organic building blocks that can be experimentally tested. We propose an open-source computational generative pipeline that integrates neural-network-based discriminators, generators, and query-based filtration mechanisms to overcome this limitation and generate hypothetical polymers. The pipeline targets properties, such as ionization potential (IP), by aligning various representational formats to generate hypothetical polymer candidates. The discriminators demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art models due to optimized architecture, while the generators produce novel polymers tailored to the desired property range. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the generative performance of the pipeline components, focusing on the polymers' ionization potential (IP). The developed pipeline is integrated into the DeepChem framework, enhancing its accessibility and compatibility for various polymer generation studies.</description>

      <title>Energy and momentum relaxation through the Curie temperature in an itinerant ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we combine conventional linear response time-domain THz spectroscopy with non-linear THz-pump THz-probe techniques to study metallic strained thin films of $\mathrm{Ca}_2\mathrm{RuO}_4$, which undergo a transition into a ferromagnetic state at 10 K. Such measurements allowing us to independently measure momentum and energy relaxation rates. We find that while the momentum relaxation rate decreases significantly at the ferromagnetic transition, the energy relaxation rate remains unaffected by the emergence of magnetic order. This shows that the dominant changes to scattering across the transition correspond to scatterings that relax momentum without relaxing energy. It is consistent with a scenario where energy is not carried off by coupling to collective magnetic degrees of freedom. Instead, the principal channel for energy relaxation remains the conventional one e.g. coupling to acoustic phonons. This observation validates the approximation used in the conventional understanding of resistive anomalies of ferromagnets across the Curie temperature, which due to critical slowing down, spin fluctuations can be treated as effectively static and scattering off of them elastic. This scenario can likely be extended to resistive anomalies at other phase transitions to charge- and spin-density wave states in kagome metals or pnictide system</description>

      <title>Predicting Performance of Microfluidic-Based Alginate Microfibers with Feature-Supplemented Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Selection of solution concentrations and flow rates for the fabrication of microfibers using a microfluidic device is a largely empirical endeavor of trial-and-error, largely due to the difficulty of modeling such a multiphysics process. Machine learning, including deep neural networks, provides the potential for allowing the determination of flow rates and solution characteristics by using past fabrication data to train and validate a model. Unfortunately, microfluidics suffers from low amounts of data, which can lead to inaccuracies and overtraining. To reduce the errors inherent with developing predictive and design models using a deep neural network, two approaches are investigated: dataset expansion using the statistical properties of available samples and model enhancement through introduction of physics-related parameters, specifically dimensionless numbers such as the Reynolds, capillary, Weber, and Peclet numbers. Results show that introduction of these parameters provides enhanced predictive capability leading to increased accuracy, while no such improvements are yet observed for design parameter selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08888v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic-ferroic ordering and magnetic-toroidal moments are essential concepts in molecular electronics and magnetics. The magnetic toroidal moment is critical in understanding new electronic states and their possible uses. This paper discusses the notion of toroidicity waves. In particular, we present a one-dimensional model of interconnected toroidicity leading to an organization principle around an emergent quantum particle, a carrier of toroidicity waves, dubbed the toroidon. We illustrate some functionalities that could be achieved once control over the toroidon is acquired. We show that a 1D dimerized and antiferromagnetic-like spin chain can display ferrotoroidicity and propose its description in terms of an effective quasi-1D spin chain, marking a crucial step towards further research on the phenomena and potential applications of ferrotoroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological metals possess various types of symmetry-protected degenerate band crossings. When a topological metal becomes superconducting, the low-energy electronic excitations stemming from the band crossings located close to the Fermi level may contribute to highly unusual pairing symmetry and superconducting states. In this work, we study the electronic band structure of the time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductor LaNiGa$_2$ by means of quantum oscillation measurements. A comprehensive investigation combining angle-resolved high-field de Haas-van Alphen (dHvA) spectroscopy and first-principles calculations reveals the fermiology of LaNiGa$_2$ and verifies its nonsymmorphic $Cmcm$ lattice symmetry, which promises nodal band crossings pinned at the Fermi level with fourfold degeneracies. Moreover, such nodal structures, proposed to play a crucial role giving rise to the interorbital triplet pairing, are indeed captured by our dHvA analysis. Our results identify LaNiGa$_2$ as a prototypical topological crystalline superconductor and highlight the putative contribution of low-energy nodal quasiparticles to unconventional superconducting pairing.</description>

      <title>Size-Dependent Charging Energy Determines the Charge Transport in ZnO Quantum Dot Solids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09275v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building up a solid-state material from quantum dots (QD), which are often referred to as artificial atoms, offers the potential to create new materials with unprecedented macroscopic properties. The investigation of the electronic properties of such QD assemblies has attracted attention due to the increasing applications of QD solids in both electronics and optoelectronics. In the past, charge transport in QD assemblies has been explained by a variety of mutually exclusive theories, with the Mott and Efros-Shklovskii variable range hopping models being most common. However, these theories fall short in explaining the anomalous exponents of the temperature-dependent conductivity observed in various QD materials. Here, we measure the temperature-dependent conductivity of semiconducting ZnO QDs under different UV illumination intensity. Regulating the UV intensity allows us to systematically change the effective diameter of the ZnO QDs without having to rely on cumbersome size control by synthesis. Instead, the UV level controls the width of the QD depletion shell and therefore the size distribution in the overall material. We observe exponents that systematically increase from {\alpha}=0.25 to {\alpha}=0.62 with increasing illumination intensity, which we interpret in terms of a charge transport being limited by the (size-dependent) charging energy of the QDs.</description>

Abstract: We report a sequential two-step vapor deposition process for growing mixed-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials, specifically Te nanowires (1D) and MoS$_2$ (2D), on a single SiO$_2$ wafer. Our growth technique offers a unique potential pathway to create large scale, high-quality, defect-free interfaces. The assembly of samples serves a twofold application: first, the as-prepared heterostructures (Te NW/MoS$_2$) provide insights into the atomically thin depletion region of a 1D/2D vdW diode, as revealed by electrical transport measurements and density functional theory-based quantum transport calculations. The charge transfer at the heterointerface is confirmed using Raman spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM). We also observe modulation of the rectification ratio with varying applied gate voltage. Second, the non-hybrid regions on the substrate, consisting of the as-grown individual Te nanowires and MoS$_2$ microstructures, are utilized to fabricate separate p- and n-FETs, respectively. Furthermore, the ionic liquid gating helps to realize low-power CMOS inverter and all basic logic gate operations using a pair of n- and p- field-effect transistors (FETs) on Si/SiO$_2$ platform. This approach also demonstrates the potential for unifying diode and CMOS circuits on a single platform, opening opportunities for integrated analog and digital electronics.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Hall Effect in Two-dimensional Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Symmetry is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics, fundamentally shaping the behavior of electronic systems and inducing the emergence of novel phenomena. The Hall effect, a key concept in this field, demonstrates how symmetry breaking, particularly of time-reversal symmetry, influences electronic transport properties. Recently, the nonlinear Hall effect has extended this understanding by generating a transverse voltage that modulates at twice the frequency of the driving alternating current without breaking time-reversal symmetry. This effect is closely tied to the symmetry and quantum geometric properties of materials, offering a new approach to probing the Berry curvature and quantum metric. Here, we provide a review of the theoretical insights and experimental advancements in the nonlinear Hall effect, particularly focusing on its realization in two-dimensional materials. We discuss the challenges still ahead, look at potential applications for devices, and explore how these ideas might apply to other nonlinear transport phenomena. By elucidating these aspects, this review aims to advance the understanding of nonlinear transport effects and their broader implications for future technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection and classification of exfoliated two-dimensional (2D) material flakes from optical microscope images can be automated using computer vision algorithms. This has the potential to increase the accuracy and objectivity of classification and the efficiency of sample fabrication, and it allows for large-scale data collection. Existing algorithms often exhibit challenges in identifying low-contrast materials and typically require large amounts of training data. Here, we present a deep learning model, called MaskTerial, that uses an instance segmentation network to reliably identify 2D material flakes. The model is extensively pre-trained using a synthetic data generator, that generates realistic microscopy images from unlabeled data. This results in a model that can to quickly adapt to new materials with as little as 5 to 10 images. Furthermore, an uncertainty estimation model is used to finally classify the predictions based on optical contrast. We evaluate our method on eight different datasets comprising five different 2D materials and demonstrate significant improvements over existing techniques in the detection of low-contrast materials such as hexagonal boron nitride.</description>

      <title>Quasi-symmetry Constrained Spin Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry and their spin-orbit coupling (SOC) allow for an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that depends on the direction of the N\'eel ordering vector. The AHE and the ferromagnetic spin moment share the same symmetry and hence are usually proportional. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations find that the AHE exists with negligible ferromagnetic spin moment for some compounds, whereas it reaches sizable values for other altermagnets. By examining realistic minimal models for altermagnetism in which the DFT phenomenology is captured, we uncover a general SOC-enabled quasi-symmetry that provides a natural explanation for the amplitude of the ferromagnetic spin moment across the vast range of different altermagnetic materials. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the magnetic anisotropy energy, providing a simple means to identify the preferred N\'eel vector orientation for altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in barium hydrides via light element incorporation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09340v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Barium hydrides are of interest for their potential in both ionic conductivity and superconductivity. Recently, a superconducting hydride BaH12 containing H$_2$ and H${_3}^{-1}$ molecular units was experimentally reported with a critical temperature $T_\text{c}$ of 20 K at 140 GPa. Herein, we combine ab initio methods with a rapid calculator of $T_\text{c}$ based on the networking value model to predict that the introduction of light elements, such as Be, can effectively expand the structure diversity and structure space of barium hydrides. Although molecular hydrogen units are still widely present in thermodynamically stable and metastable crystal structures, we find that a metastable phase of BeBaH8 shows a higher $T_\text{c}$ of 49 K than BaH12 at a reduced pressure of 100 GPa. This BeBaH8 remains dynamically stable at 15 GPa. Furthermore, our study shows that increasing pressure can further elevate $T_\text{c}$ beyond 100 K by enhancing the electron-phonon coupling constant. Our study proposes a feasible method for broadening the structural landscape in the exploration of superconducting phases of barium hydrides.</description>

Abstract: We investigate mixed (50/50) clusters of parahydrogen and orthodeuterium at low temperature, by means of Quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results provide evidence of liquid-like behavior and partial isotopic separation in a cluster of 640 molecules, at temperature T=10 K. As the temperature is lowered below ~6 K, crystallization occurs, with no indication that the liquid phase is more resilient at low temperature in a mixed cluster. Isotopic separation is therefore predicted to take place at low temperature only through the slow process of molecular self-diffusion in a crystalline matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interface-induced superconductivity has recently been achieved by stacking a magnetic topological insulator layer on an antiferromagnetic FeTe layer. However, the mechanism driving this emergent superconductivity remains unclear. Here, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to grow a 1T-CrTe2 layer, a two-dimensional ferromagnet with Curie temperature up to room temperature, on a FeTe layer. These 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures show superconductivity with a critical temperature of ~12 K. Through magnetic force microscopy measurements, we observe the Meissner effect on the surface of the 1T-CrTe2 layer. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures exhibit nonreciprocal charge transport behavior, characterized by a large magneto-chiral anisotropy coefficient. The enhanced nonreciprocal charge transport in 1T-CrTe2/FeTe heterostructures provides a promising platform for exploring the magnetically controllable superconducting diode effect.</description>

      <title>Influence of Nb Alloying on Nb Recrystallization and the Upper Critical Field of Nb3Sn</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nb3Sn conductors are important candidates for high-field magnets for particle accelerators, and they continue to be widely used for many laboratory and NMR magnets. However, the critical current density, Jc, of present Nb3Sn conductors declines swiftly above 12-15T. State-of-the-art Ta- and Ti-doped strands exhibit upper critical field, Hc2, values of 24-26.5T (4.2K) and do not reach the FCC target Jc, which serves as the present stretch target for Nb3Sn development. As recently demonstrated, to meet this goal requires enhanced vortex pinning but an independent and supplementary approach is to significantly enhance Hc2. In this study, we have arc-melted multiple Nb alloys with added Hf, Zr, Ta and Ti and drawn them successfully into monofilament wires to investigate the possibilities of Hc2 enhancement through alloying. Hc2(T) was measured for all samples in fields up to 16T and some up to 31T. We have found that all alloys show good agreement with the standard Werthamer, Helfand, and Hohenberg (WHH) fitting procedure without the need to adjust the paramagnetic limitation parameter (alpha) and spin-orbit scattering parameter (lambda_so). The evaluation of dHc2/dT near Tc, which is proportional to the electronic specific heat coefficient (gamma) and the normal state resistivity (rho_n), allows a better understanding of the induced disorder introduced by alloying in the A15 phase. So far, we have observed that Hf alloying of pure Nb can enhance Hc2(0) by 3-4T to 28T, while adding just 1 at. %Hf or Zr into a Nb4Ta base alloy can raise Hc2(0) to 31T. Very importantly we find that Hf and Zr raise the alloy recrystallization temperature above the usual A15 reaction temperature range of 650{\deg}C-750{\deg}C, thus ensuring denser A15 phase nucleation in the Nb alloy grain boundaries, possibly leading to a more homogeneous A15 phase Sn content and refined A15 grain size.

      <title>Ferromagnetic ordering in mazelike stripe liquid of a dipolar six-state clock model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical study of a six-state clock model with a long-range dipolar type interaction. This model is motivated by the ferroelectric orders in the multiferroic hexagonal manganites. At low temperatures, trimerization of local atomic structures leads to six distinct but energetically degenerate structural distortion, which can be modeled by a six-state clock model. Moreover, the atomic displacements in the trimerized state further produce a local electric polarization whose sign depends on whether the clock variable is even or odd. These induced electric dipoles, which can be modeled by emergent Ising degrees of freedom, interact with each other via long-range dipolar interactions. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations are carried out to investigate low temperature phases resulting from the competing interactions. Upon lowering temperature, the system undergoes two Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transitions, characteristic of the standard six-state clock model in two dimensions. The dipolar interaction between emergent Ising spins induces a first-order transition into a ground state characterized by a three-fold degenerate stripe order. The intermediate phase between the discontinuous and the second BKT transition corresponds to a maze-like hexagonal liquid with short-range stripe ordering. Moreover, this intermediate phase also exhibits an unusual ferromagnetic order with two adjacent clock variables occupying the two types of stripes of the labyrinthine pattern.</description>

      <title>Periodic splay Fr\'eedericksz transitions in a ferroelectric nematic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric field-induced splay of molecular orientation, called the Fr\'eedericksz transition, is a fundamental electro-optic phenomenon in nonpolar nematic liquid crystals. In a ferroelectric nematic NF with a spontaneous electric polarization P, the splay is suppressed since it produces bound electric charges. Here, we demonstrate that an alternating current (ac) electric field causes three patterns of NF polarization. At low voltages, P oscillates around the field-free orientation with no stationary deformations. As the voltage increases, the polarization acquires stationary distortions, first splay and twist in a stripe pattern and then splay and bend in a square lattice of +1 and -1 defects. In all patterns, P oscillates around the stationary orientations. The stationary bound charge is reduced by a geometrical splay cancellation mechanism that does not require free ions: the charge created by splay in one plane is reduced by splay of an opposite sign in the orthogonal plane.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Obstructed atomic phases, with their realizations in systems of diverse dimensionality, have recently arisen as one of the topological states with greatest potential to show higher-order phenomena. In this work we report a special type of obstruction, known as orbital-mediated atomic obstruction, in monolayers of materials with spatial symmetry described by the space group P-3m1. By means of a minimal tight-binding model and first-principles calculations, we show that this obstructed phase is related to the mismatch of the charge centers coming from the atomic limit with respect to the centers that are obtained from the reciprocal space description. Although we find atomic limits that correspond with occupied atomic sites, orbital-mediated atomic obstruction requires the presence of orbitals that have no support in real space. In order to demonstrate the nontrivial character of the obstruction, we confirm the presence of a filling anomaly for finite geometries that is directly associated with the bulk configuration, and discuss the role of the boundary states and their underlying mechanism. Several material examples are presented to illustrate the ubiquity of these nontrivial responses and, in turn, to discuss the differences related to the particular ground state configuration. In addition, we perform a survey of materials and elaborate a list of candidate systems which will host this obstructed phase in monolayer form.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.02846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic band structures is a cornerstone of condensed matter physics and materials science. Conventional methods like Wannier interpolation (WI), which are commonly used to interpolate band structures onto dense k-point grids, often encounter difficulties with complex systems, such as those involving entangled bands or topological obstructions. In this work, we introduce the Hamiltonian transformation (HT) method, a novel framework that directly enhances interpolation accuracy by localizing the Hamiltonian. Using a pre-optimized transformation, HT produces a far more localized Hamiltonian than WI, achieving up to two orders of magnitude greater accuracy for entangled bands. Although HT utilizes a slightly larger, nonlocal numerical basis set, its construction is rapid and requires no optimization, resulting in significant computational speedups. These features make HT a more precise, efficient, and robust alternative to WI for band structure interpolation, as further verified by high-throughput calculations.</description>

      <title>Critical analyses of RVE concepts in local and peridynamic micromechanics of composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.13908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.13908v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A static peridynamic (proposed by Silling, see J. Mech. Phys. Solids 2000; 48:175--209) composite materials (CMs) of the random and periodic structures are considered. In the framework of the second background of micromechanics (also called computational analytical micromechanics, CAM), one proved that local micromechanics (LM) and peridynamic micromechanics (PM) are formally similar to each other for CM of both random and periodic structures. It allows for the straightforward generalization of LM methods to their PM counterparts. The representative volume element (RVE) playing a central role in the LM is generalized to PM. For the inhomogeneous body force with compact support, CAM is developed for the estimation of the effective behavior of CM which is used as a new compressed dataset. The preparation of these datasets is selected by the use of a fundamentally new RVE concept that directly depends on neither constitutive laws of phases nor the form of the predicted effective (surrogate) operator. The mentioned datasets with intrinsically incorporated new RVE concept as a necessary ingredient can be implemented into any known machine learning (ML) and neural network (NN) technique used for the prediction of nonlocal surrogate operators. Exploitation of the new RVE concept eliminates any potential incorrectness related to both size scale, boundary layer, and edge effects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.08353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Materials with flat bands can serve as a promising platform to investigate strongly interacting phenomena. However, experimental realization of ideal flat bands is mostly limited to artificial lattices or moir\'e systems. Here we report a general way to construct one-dimensional (1D) flat bands in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) with pentagonal nature: penta-hexa-PNRs and penta-dodeca-PNRs, wherein the corresponding 1D flat bands are directly verified by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We confirm that the observed 1D flat bands originate from the electronic 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, respectively, as revealed by the combination of bond-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, tight-binding models, and first-principles calculations. Our study demonstrates a general way to construct 1D flat bands in 1D solid materials system, which provides a robust platform to explore strongly interacting phases of matter.</description>

Abstract: Disordered forms of carbon are an important class of materials for applications such as thermal management. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the structural dependence of thermal transport and the underlying microscopic mechanisms is lacking. Here we study the structure-dependent thermal conductivity of disordered carbon by employing molecular dynamics (MD) simulations driven by a machine-learned interatomic potential based on the efficient neuroevolution potential approach. Using large-scale MD simulations, we generate realistic nanoporous carbon (NP-C) samples with density varying from $0.3$ to $1.5$ g cm$^{-3}$ dominated by sp$^2$ motifs, and amorphous carbon (a-C) samples with density varying from $1.5$ to $3.5$ g cm$^{-3}$ exhibiting mixed sp$^2$ and sp$^3$ motifs. Structural properties including short- and medium-range order are characterized by atomic coordination, pair correlation function, angular distribution function and structure factor. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium MD method and the associated quantum-statistical correction scheme, we predict a linear and a superlinear density dependence of thermal conductivity for NP-C and a-C, respectively, in good agreement with relevant experiments. The distinct density dependences are attributed to the different impacts of the sp$^2$ and sp$^3$ motifs on the spectral heat capacity, vibrational mean free paths and group velocity. We additionally highlight the significant role of structural order in regulating the thermal conductivity of disordered carbon.</description>

      <title>Correlated Structural and Optical Characterization of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14408</link>

Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) plays a central role in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. Moreover, hBN hosts room-temperature quantum emitters and optically addressable spins, making it promising for quantum sensing and quantum photonics. Despite many investigations of their optical properties, however, the emitters' chemical structure remains unclear, as does the role of contamination at surfaces and interfaces in forming the emitters or modifying their properties. We prepare hBN samples that are compatible with confocal photoluminescence (PL) microscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic-force microscopy (AFM), and we use those techniques to quantitatively investigate correlations between fluorescent emission, flake morphology, and surface residue. We find that the microscopy techniques themselves induce changes in hBN's optical activity and residue morphology: PL measurements induce photobleaching, whereas TEM measurements alter surface residue and emission characteristics. We also study the effects of common treatments $\unicode{x2014}$ annealing and oxygen plasma cleaning $\unicode{x2014}$ on the structure and optical activity of hBN. The methods can be broadly applied to study two-dimensional materials, and the results illustrate the importance of correlative studies to elucidate structural factors that influence hBN's functionality as a host for quantum emitters and spin defects.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Microscopic Properties as Predictors of Large-Scale Quantities of Interest: Validation through Grain Boundary Energy Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlations between fundamental microscopic properties computable from first principles, which we term canonical properties, and complex large-scale quantities of interest (QoIs) provide an avenue to predictive materials discovery. We propose that such correlations can be efficiently discovered through simulations utilizing approximate interatomic potentials (IPs), which serve as an ensemble of "synthetic materials." As a proof of principle we build a regression model relating canonical properties to the symmetric tilt grain boundary (GB) energy curves in face-centered cubic crystals, characterized by the scaling factor in the universal lattice matching model of Runnels et al. (2016), which we take to be our QoI. Our analysis recovers known correlations of GB energy to other properties and discovers new ones. We also demonstrate, using available density functional theory (DFT) GB energy data, that the regression model constructed from IP data is consistent with DFT results, confirming the assumption that the IPs and DFT belong to same statistical pool and thereby validating the approach. Regression models constructed in this fashion can be used to predict large-scale QoIs based on first-principles data and provide a general method for training IPs for QoIs beyond the scope of first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast dynamic Coulomb screening of X-ray core excitons in photoexcited semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01945v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrafast X-ray spectroscopy has been revolutionized in recent years due to the advent of fourth-generation X-ray facilities. In solid-state materials, core excitons determine the energy and line shape of absorption features in core-level spectroscopies such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy. The screening of core excitons is an inherent many-body process that can reveal insight into charge-transfer excitations and electronic correlations. Under non-equilibrium conditions such as after photoexcitation, however, core-exciton screening is still not fully understood. Here we demonstrate the dynamic Coulomb screening of core excitons induced by photoexcited carriers by employing X-ray transient absorption (XTA) spectroscopy with picosecond time resolution. Our interpretation is supported by state-of-the-art ab initio theory, combining constrained and real-time time-dependent density functional theory with many-body perturbation theory. Using ZnO as an archetypal wide band-gap semiconductor, we show that the Coulomb screening by photoexcited carriers at the Zn K-edge leads to a decrease in the core-exciton binding energy, which depends nonlinearly on both the excitation density and the distribution of photoexcited carriers in reciprocal space. The effect of Coulomb screening dominates over Pauli blocking in the XTA spectra. We show that dynamic core-exciton screening is also observed at other X-ray absorption edges and theoretically predict the effect of core-exciton screening on the femtosecond time scale for the case of ZnO, a major step towards hard X-ray excitonics. The results have implications for the interpretation of ultrafast X-ray spectra in general and their use in tracking charge carrier dynamics in complex materials on atomic length scales.</description>

      <title>Interlayer Exchange Coupling-Induced Critical-Metal-to-Insulator Phase Transition in Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Interlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between two magnetic layers sandwiched by a nonmagnetic spacer layer plays a critical role in shaping the magnetic properties of such heterostructures. The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect has been realized in a structure composed of two magnetically doped topological insulator (TI) layers separated by an undoped TI layer. In this work, we employ molecular beam epitaxy to synthesize a series of magnetic TI sandwiches with varying thicknesses of the middle TI spacer layer. The well-quantized QAH effect is observed in all these samples, and the IEC modulates its critical behavior between the top and bottom magnetic TI layers. Near the plateau phase transition (PPT), thinner QAH samples exhibit a two-dimensional critical metal behavior with nearly temperature-independent longitudinal resistance. In contrast, thicker QAH samples behave as a three-dimensional insulator with reduced longitudinal resistance at higher temperatures. We employ a magnetic TI Hamiltonian with random magnetic domains to understand the IEC-induced critical-metal-to-insulator transition observed near QAH PPT.</description>

      <title>Elastic softness of low-symmetry frustrated $A$Ti$_2$O$_5$ ($A$ = Co, Fe)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Orthorhombic pseudobrookites CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ have a low-symmetry crystal structure comprising magnetic Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions and nonmagnetic Ti$^{4+}$ ions, where the orbital-nondegenerate Co$^{2+}$/Fe$^{2+}$ ions form one-dimensional chains running along the orthorhombic $a$ axis. These compounds undergo an antiferromagnetic phase transition at $T_N \sim$ 26 K for CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and $T_N \sim$ 40 K for FeTi$_2$O$_5$. Ultrasound velocity measurements on single crystals of CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ reveal that CoTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits unusual elastic softness above $T_N$ in the symmetry-lowering elastic mode of $ac$-plane shear elastic modulus, inconsistent with the structural symmetry breaking caused by antiferromagnetic ordering at $T_N$. This suggests the presence of two distinct types of magnetostructural fluctuations above $T_N$ that should be a precursor to the symmetry-lowering lattice distortion at $T_N$. In contrast, FeTi$_2$O$_5$ exhibits either negligible or smaller elastic softness, indicating weaker spin-lattice coupling. These findings highlight CoTi$_2$O$_5$ and FeTi$_2$O$_5$ as unique spin-latticed-coupled frustrated systems with low crystal symmetry, where, while the exchange interactions are quasi-one-dimensional in nature, the frustration is released by further lowering the crystal symmetry through three-dimensional spin-lattice coupling, which is stronger in CoTi$_2$O$_5$ than in FeTi$_2$O$_5$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-Constrained Generation of Diverse Low-Bandgap Molecules with Monte Carlo Tree Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08833v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Organic optoelectronic materials are a promising avenue for next-generation electronic devices due to their solution processability, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electronic properties. In particular, near-infrared (NIR) sensitive molecules have unique applications in night-vision equipment and biomedical imaging. Molecular engineering has played a crucial role in developing non-fullerene acceptors (NFAs) such as the Y-series molecules, which have significantly improved the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of solar cells and enhanced spectral coverage in the NIR region. However, systematically designing molecules with targeted optoelectronic properties while ensuring synthetic accessibility remains a challenge. To address this, we leverage structural priors from domain-focused, patent-mined datasets of organic electronic molecules using a symmetry-aware fragment decomposition algorithm and a fragment-constrained Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) generator. Our approach generates candidates that retain symmetry constraints from the patent dataset, while also exhibiting red-shifted absorption, as validated by TD-DFT calculations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic, multiband, and strong-coupling superconductivity of the Pb0.64Bi0.36 alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits one of the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.</description>
