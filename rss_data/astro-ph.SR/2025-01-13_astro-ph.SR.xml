      <title>Phase-resolved Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 Spectroscopy of Weakly-Irradiated Brown Dwarf GD 1400 and Energy Redistribution-Irradiation Trends in Six WD$-$BD Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Irradiated brown dwarfs offer a unique opportunity to bridge the gap between stellar and planetary atmospheres. We present high-quality $\mathit{HST}$/WFC3/G141 phase-resolved spectra of the white dwarf + brown dwarf binary GD 1400, covering more than one full rotation of the brown dwarf. Accounting for brightness variations caused by ZZ Ceti pulsations, we revealed weak ($\sim$1\%) phase curve amplitude modulations originating from the brown dwarf. Sub-band light curve exploration in various bands showed no significant wavelength dependence on amplitude or phase shift. Extracted day- and night-side spectra indicated chemically similar hemispheres, with slightly higher day-side temperatures, suggesting efficient heat redistribution or dominance of radiative escape over atmospheric circulation. A simple radiative and energy redistribution model reproduced observed temperatures well. Cloud-inclusive models fit the day and night spectra better than cloudless models, indicating global cloud coverage. We also begin qualitatively exploring atmospheric trends across six irradiated brown dwarfs, from the now complete "Dancing with Dwarfs" WD$-$BD sample. The trend we find in the day-side/night-side temperature and irradiation levels is consistent with efficient heat redistribution for irradiation levels less than $\sim$10$^9$ ergs/s/cm$^2$ and decreasing efficiency above that level.</description>

      <title>The Emerging Class of Double-Faced White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report our findings on a spectroscopic survey of seven unresolved DA+DB binary white dwarf candidates. We have discovered extreme spectroscopic variations in one of these candidates, SDSS J084716.21+484220.40. Previous analysis failed to reproduce the optical spectrum using a single object with a homogeneous atmosphere. Our time-resolved spectroscopy reveals a double-faced white dwarf that switches between a DBA and DA spectral type over 6.5 or 8.9 hours due to varying surface abundances. We also provide time-series spectroscopy of the magnetic DBA, SDSS J085618.94+161103.6 (LB 8915), and confirm an inhomogeneous atmosphere. We employ an atmosphere model with hydrogen caps and a helium belt that yields excellent fits to our time-resolved spectra. We use the oblique rotator model to derive the system geometry for both targets. With the addition of these two objects, the emerging class of double-faced white dwarfs now consists of seven members. We summarize the properties of this new class of objects, and discuss how magnetism impacts the convective processes and leads to the formation of double-faced white dwarfs. We identify cooler versions of white dwarfs with inhomogeneous atmospheres among the cool magnetic DA white dwarf sample, where the H$\alpha$ line is shallower than expected based on pure hydrogen atmosphere models.</description>

      <title>The elderly among the oldest: new evidence for extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a detailed spectroscopic analysis of three extremely metal-poor RR Lyrae stars, exploring uncharted territories at these low metallicities for this class of stars. Using high-resolution spectra acquired with HARPS-N at TNG, UVES at VLT, and PEPSI at LBT, and employing Non-Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (NLTE) spectral synthesis calculations, we provide abundance measurements for Fe, Al, Mg, Ca, Ti, Mn, and Sr. Our findings indicate that the stars have metallicities of [Fe/H] = -3.40 \pm 0.05, -3.28 \pm 0.02, and -2.77 \pm 0.05 for HD 331986, DO Hya, and BPS CS 30317-056, respectively. Additionally, we derived their kinematic and dynamical properties to gain insights into their origins. Interestingly, the kinematics of one star (HD 331986) is consistent with the Galactic disc, while the others exhibit Galactic halo kinematics, albeit with distinct chemical signatures. We compared the [Al/Fe] and [Mg/Mn] ratios of the current targets with recent literature estimates to determine whether these stars were either accreted or formed in situ, finding that the adopted chemical diagnostics are ineffective at low metallicities ([Fe/H] $\lesssim -$1.5). Finally, the established horizontal branch evolutionary models, indicating that these stars arrive at hotter temperatures on the Zero-Age Horizontal Branch (ZAHB) and then transition into RR Lyrae stars as they evolve, fully support the existence of such low-metallicity RR Lyrae stars. As a consequence, we can anticipate detecting more of them when larger samples of spectra become available from upcoming extensive observational campaigns.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of H$\beta$ spectra from EXO 051910+3737.7 X-rays binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral characteristics of the Be/X-ray binary system, EXO 051910+3737.7, in which Be/X-ray systems are the largest sub-class of high-mass X-ray binaries. Spectroscopic observations are taken by the Thai National Telescope (TNT) with a Medium-RESolution spectrograph (MRES) instrument for seven nights spanning from 2020 to 2021. Our primary focus is directed towards the analysis of two Balmer lines, namely H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$, given that Be stars typically exhibit emission features in at least one of these hydrogen Balmer lines during certain phases. Our observations reveal split Balmer emission lines throughout the entire duration of our monitoring. Double Gaussian profiles were employed for line fitting to characterize these lines. The presence of double peaks in the Balmer lines indicates the presence of asymmetries within the circumstellar disc. We then analyze V/R variations and the changes in H$\beta$ spectra. Our analysis of V/R variation which Violet (V) and Red (R) peak intensity components, revealed rapid fluctuations occurring within a single day, although determining the precise periodicity was constrained by instrumental limitations and the duration of observability. Furthermore, employing observed the wavelength differences ($\Delta\lambda$) in conjunction with typical Be star parameters allowed us to estimate the radius ($r_{\beta}$) of the H$\beta$ emitting envelope. The average value was calculated to be 2.585$r_*$, with a standard deviation of 0.050$r_*$.</description>

      <title>Periodic Variability of the Central Stars of Planetary Nebulae Surveyed through the Zwicky Transient Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A consensus has been reached in recent years that binarity plays an important role in the formation and evolution of a significant fraction of planetary nebulae (PNe). Utilizing the archived photometric data from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey, we conducted a comprehensive data mining in search for brightness variations in a large sample of Galactic PNe. This effort leads to identification of 39 PNe, whose central stars exhibit periodic variation in light curves. Among these objects, 20 are known binary central stars of PNe, while the remaining 19 are new discoveries. Additionally, we identified 14 PNe with central stars displaying anomalous variation in light curves, as well as eight variables based on the high-cadence photometric data. Among the new discoveries of periodicity, we found compelling evidence of binary systems at the centres of two archetypal quadrupolar PNe. We also report on very peculiar brightness variation observed in the central core of the compact PN NGC6833. Several PNe in our sample deserve follow-up observations, both high-dispersion spectroscopy and high-precision photometry, to reveal the true nature of their central binarity or even multiplicity.</description>

      <title>The Radiowave Hunt for Young Stellar Object Emission and Demographics (RADIOHEAD): A Radio Luminosity${-}$Spectral Type Dependence in Taurus${-}$Auriga YSOs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure the radio continuum fluxes at the locations of all Gaia${-}$confirmed members of Taurus${-}$Auriga using Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array Sky Survey data (VLASS; 2${-}$4 GHz, $\sigma_{\rm{VLASS}}{\sim}110{-}140 \mu$Jy, $2.5''$ resolution) spanning 3 VLASS epochs (2019, 2021, and 2023). We present 35 detections coincident with young Taurus${-}$Auriga stars (29 in individual VLASS images, 6 via stacking). We find a strong dependence on spectral type, wherein the fractional detection rate of radio emission coincident with early-type young stellar objects (YSOs) is systematically higher than late-type YSOs, ranging from 25% $\pm$ 13% for B${-}$F YSOs, 21% $\pm$ 11% for G YSOs, 18.4% $\pm$ 6.3% for K0${-}$K4 YSOs, 15.5% $\pm$ 5.4% for K5${-}$K9 YSOs, 7.0% $\pm$ 2.7% for M0${-}$M2 YSOs, 2.3% $\pm$ 0.9% for M3${-}$M6 YSOs, and 1.9% $\pm$ 1.9% for YSOs with SpTs later than M7. We present cumulative density distributions of radio luminosity densities that demonstrate a significant luminosity enhancement for early- versus late-type YSOs. We find 25% of the detected sources to be significantly variable. We discuss possible interpretations of this dependence, which may reflect stellar magnetic activity, binary interactions, or stellar flaring. We find that mid-infrared YSO class is a strong indicator of radio detectability consistent with higher frequency Taurus-Auriga VLA surveys, with class III stars detected at a rate of 8.8% $\pm$ 1.6%, class IIs at 2.0% $\pm$ 1.2%, and combined class 0s, Is and Fs at 8.0% $\pm$ 5.4%.</description>

      <title>Planet formation and long-term stability in a very eccentric stellar binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets orbiting one of the two stars in a binary are vulnerable to gravitational perturbations from the other star. Particularly, highly eccentric companion stars risk disrupting planetary orbits, such as in the extreme system TOI 4633 where close encounters between the companion and a gas giant planet in the habitable zone make it one of the most fragile systems discovered so far. Here, we report that TOI 4633's planet likely survived these encounters throughout the system's age by orbiting retrograde relative to the binary, stabilised by the Coriolis force. Using direct $N$-body simulations, we show it otherwise tends to collide with the binary stars or becomes free-floating after getting ejected. A retrograde planetary orbit has profound implications for TOI 4633's formation and evolution, suggesting an extraordinary history where its eccentric companion was likely randomly captured after planet formation in a single-star system. Alternatively, if stars and planet are born in situ from the same gas clump, we show the planet must have formed at sub-snow-line distances, contrary to the conventional core-accretion model. Our study highlights the importance of considering the long-term stability ($\gtrsim\rm Gyr$) of planets in eccentric binaries and demonstrates that the mere existence in such dynamically hostile environments places strong constraints on their orbital configuration and formation.</description>

      <title>PSR J1947-1120: A New Huntsman Millisecond Pulsar Binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the discovery of PSR J1947-1120, a new huntsman millisecond pulsar with a red giant companion star in a 10.3 d orbit. This pulsar was found via optical, X-ray, and radio follow-up of the previously unassociated gamma-ray source 4FGL J1947.6-1121. PSR J1947-1120 is the second confirmed pulsar in the huntsman class and establishes this as a bona fide subclass of millisecond pulsar. We use MESA models to show that huntsman pulsars can be naturally explained as neutron star binaries whose secondaries are currently in the "red bump" region of the red giant branch, temporarily underfilling their Roche lobes and hence halting mass transfer. Huntsman pulsars offer a new view of the formation of typical millisecond pulsars, allowing novel constraints on the efficiency of mass transfer and recycling at an intermediate stage in the process.</description>

      <title>The 2D pressure structure of the HD 163296 protoplanetary disk as probed by multi-molecular kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: [Abridged] Gas kinematics is a new, unique way to study planet-forming environments by an accurate characterization of disk velocity fields. High angular resolution ALMA observations allow deep kinematical analysis of disks, by observing molecular line emission at high spectral resolution. In particular, rotation curves are key tools to study the disk pressure structure and estimate fundamental disk parameters, as mass and radius. In this work, we explore the potential of a multi-molecular approach to gas kinematics to provide a 2D characterization of the HD 163296 disk. From the high quality data of the MAPS Large Program we extract the rotation curves of rotational lines from seven distinct molecular species, spanning a wide range in the disk radial and vertical extents. To obtain reliable rotation curves for hyperfine lines, we extend standard methodologies to fit multiple-component line profiles. We then sample the likelihood of a thermally stratified model that reproduces all the rotation curves simultaneously, taking into account the molecular emitting layers and disk thermal structure. We obtain dynamical estimates of the stellar mass $M_\star=1.89$ M$_\odot$, the disk mass $M_\text{d}=0.12$ M$_\odot$ and scale radius $ R_\text{c}=143$ au. We also explore how rotation curves and the parameter estimates depend on the adopted emitting layers: the disk mass proves to be the most affected by these systematics, yet the main trends we find do not depend on the adopted parametrization. Finally, we investigate the impact of thermal structure on gas kinematics, showing that the thermal stratification can efficiently explain the measured rotation velocity discrepancies between tracers at different heights. Our results show that such a multi-molecular approach, tracing a large range of emission layers, can provide unique constraints on the ($R,z$) pressure structure of protoplanetary disks.</description>

      <title>The $\texttt{MSG}$ model for cloudy substellar atmospheres: A grid of self-consistent substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art JWST observations are unveiling unprecedented views into the atmospheres of substellar objects in the infrared, further highlighting the importance of clouds. Current forward models struggle to fit the silicate clouds absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m observed in substellar atmospheres. In the MSG model, we aim to couple the MARCS 1D radiative-convective equilibrium atmosphere model with the 1D kinetic, stationary, non-equilibrium, cloud formation model DRIFT, to create a new grid of self-consistent cloudy substellar atmosphere models with microphysical cloud formation. We aim to test if this new grid is able to reproduce the silicate cloud absorption feature at ~$10\,\mu$m. We model substellar atmospheres with effective temperatures in the range 1200-2500 K and with $\log(g)=4.0$. We compute atmospheric structures that self-consistently account for condensate cloud opacities based on microphysical properties. We present an algorithm based on control theory to help converge such self-consistent models. Synthetic atmosphere spectra are computed for each model to explore the observable impact of the cloud microphysics. We additionally explore the impact of choosing different nucleation species (TiO$_2$ or SiO) and the effect of less efficient atmospheric mixing on these spectra. The new MSG cloudy grid using TiO$_2$ nucleation shows spectra which are redder in the near-infrared compared to the currently known population of substellar atmospheres. We find the models with SiO nucleation, and models with reduced mixing efficiency are less red in the near-infrared. The grid is unable to reproduce the silicate features similar to those found in recent JWST observations and Spitzer archival data. We thoroughly discuss further work that may better approximate the impact of convection in cloud-forming regions and steps that may help resolve the silicate cloud feature.</description>

      <title>Stellar X-ray variability and planetary evolution in the DS Tucanae system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of four Chandra observations of the 45 Myr old DS Tuc binary system. We observed X-ray variability of both stars on timescales from hours to months, including two strong X-ray flares from star A. The implied flaring rates are in agreement with past observations made with XMM-Newton, though these rates remain imprecise due to the relatively short total observation time. We find a clear, monotonic decline in the quiescent level of the star by a factor 1.8 across eight months, suggesting stellar variability that might be due to an activity cycle. If proven through future observations, DS Tuc A would be the youngest star for which a coronal activity cycle has been confirmed. The variation in our flux measurements across the four visits is also consistent with the scatter in empirical stellar X-ray relationships with Rossby number. In simulations of the possible evolution of the currently super-Neptune-sized planet DS Tuc Ab, we find a range of scenarios for the planet once it reaches a typical field age of 5 Gyr, from Neptune-size down to a completely stripped super-Earth. Improved constraints on the planet's mass in the future would significantly narrow these possibilities. We advocate for further Chandra observations to better constrain the variability of this important system.</description>

Abstract: Stable $^{205}$Tl ions have the lowest known energy threshold for capturing electron neutrinos ($\nu_e$) of ${ E}_{\nu_e}\ge50.6$\,keV. The Lorandite Experiment (LOREX), proposed in the 1980s, aims at obtaining the longtime averaged solar neutrino flux by utilizing natural deposits of Tl-bearing lorandite ores. To determine the $\nu_e$ capture cross section, it is required to know the strength of the weak transition connecting the ground state of $^{205}$Tl and the 2.3 keV first excited state in $^{205}$Pb. The only way to experimentally address this transition is to measure the bound-state beta decay ($\beta_{b}$) of fully ionized $\mathrm{^{205}Tl^{81+}}$ ions. After three decades of meticulous preparation, the half-life of the $\beta_{b}$ decay of $\mathrm{^{205}Tl^{81+}}$ has been measured to be $291_{-27}^{+33}$ days using the Experimental Storage Ring (ESR) at GSI, Darmstadt. The longer measured half-life compared to theoretical estimates reduces the expected signal-to-noise ratio in the LOREX, thus challenging its feasibility.</description>

Abstract: The role of memory time fluctuations for instabilities in random media is considered. It is shown that fluctuations can result in infinitely fast growth of statistical moments. The effect is demonstrated in the framework of light propagation in the Universe, which contains curvature fluctuations while remaining homogeneous and isotropic on average.</description>

      <title>Variation of the low-mass end of the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the stellar mass functions obtained from 20 radiation hydrodynamical simulations of star cluster formation in 500 M$_\odot$ molecular clouds with metallicities of 3, 1, 1/10 and 1/100 of the solar value, with the clouds subjected to levels of the cosmic microwave background radiation that are appropriate for star formation at redshifts z=0, 3, 5, 7, and 10. The calculations include a thermochemical model of the diffuse interstellar medium and treat dust and gas temperatures separately. We find that the stellar mass distributions obtained become increasingly bottom light as the redshift and/or metallicity are increased. Mass functions that are similar to a typical Galactic initial mass function are obtained for present-day star formation (z=0) independent of metallicity, and also for the lowest-metallicity (1/100 solar) at all redshifts up to z=10, but for higher metallicities there is a larger deficit of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars as the metallicity and redshift are increased. These effects are a result of metal-rich gas being unable to cool to as lower temperatures at higher redshift due to the warmer cosmic microwave background radiation. Based on the numerical results we provide a parameterisation that may be used to vary the stellar initial mass function with redshift and metallicity; this could be used in simulations of galaxy formation. For example, a bottom-light mass function reduces the mass-to-light ratio compared to a typical Galactic stellar initial mass function, which may reduce the estimated masses of high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>The GALAH survey: Improving chemical abundances using star clusters</title>

Abstract: Large spectroscopic surveys aim to consistently compute stellar parameters of very diverse stars while minimizing systematic errors. We explore the use of stellar clusters as benchmarks to verify the precision of spectroscopic parameters in the fourth data release (DR4) of the GALAH survey. We examine 58 open and globular clusters and associations to validate measurements of temperature, gravity, chemical abundances, and stellar ages. We focus on identifying systematic errors and understanding trends between stellar parameters, particularly temperature and chemical abundances. We identify trends by stacking measurements of chemical abundances against effective temperature and modelling them with splines. We also refitted spectra in three clusters with the Spectroscopy Made Easy and Korg packages to reproduce the trends in DR4 and to search for their origin by varying temperature and gravity priors, linelists, and spectral continuum. Trends are consistent between clusters of different ages and metallicities, can reach amplitudes of ~0.5 dex and differ for dwarfs and giants. We use the derived trends to correct the DR4 abundances of 24 and 31 chemical elements for dwarfs and giants, respectively, and publish a detrended catalogue. While we couldn't pinpoint the trends' origins, we found that: i) photometric priors affect derived abundances, ii) temperature, metallicity, and continuum levels are degenerate in spectral fitting, and it is hard to break the degeneracy even by using independent measurements, iii) the extent of the linelist used in spectral synthesis is essential for cool stars, and iv) different spectral fitting codes produce significantly different iron abundances for stars of all temperatures. We conclude that clusters can be used to characterise the systematic errors of parameters produced in large surveys, but further research is needed to explain the origin of the trends.</description>

      <title>Modeling the Impact of Moderate External UV Irradiation on Disk Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The chemistry within a protoplanetary disk is greatly affected by external radiation from the local stellar environment. Previous work has focused on extreme radiation fields, representative of the center of something like the Orion Nebula Cluster. However, even in such environments, many disks exist at the edges of a cluster where the lower stellar density leads to radiation fields weaker by orders of magnitude compared to the center. We present new chemical models of a T-Tauri disk in the presence of a moderately increased interstellar radiation field (ISRF). Such an environment has a background UV strength of 10 to 100 times higher than the galactic average ISRF. Moderate radiation fields are among the most prevalent disk-harboring environments and have interesting implications for the chemistry of the outer disk radii. We find that the external UV radiation creates an outer ionization front that impacts the cold disk chemistry to varying degrees, depending on outer disk structure. Certain molecules like C$^+$, N$_2$H$^+$, C, and CS are more strongly impacted by the ISRF in their abundance, column density, and observable emission. Other abundant species like HCO$^+$ and CO are less affected by the external UV flux in the outer disk under such moderate UV conditions. Further, we demonstrate that the chemistry occurring in the inner tens of au is relatively unchanged, which suggests that even in moderately externally irradiated disks, the inner disk chemistry may be more similar to isolated disks like those in, e.g., the Taurus and Lupus star-forming regions.</description>

      <title>Doppler velocity of $m=1$ high-latitude inertial mode over the last five sunspot cycles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06896v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Among the identified solar inertial modes, the high-latitude mode with azimuthal order $m=1$ (HL1) has the largest amplitude and plays a role in shaping the Sun's differential rotation profile. We aim to study the evolution of the HL1 mode parameters, utilizing Dopplergrams from the Mount Wilson Observatory (MWO), GONG, and HMI, covering together five solar cycles since 1967. We calculated the averages of line-of-sight Doppler signals over longitude, weighted by the sine of longitude with respect to the central meridian, as a proxy for zonal velocity at the surface. We measured the mode's power and frequency from these zonal velocities at high latitudes in sliding time windows of three years. We find that the amplitude of the HL1 mode undergoes very large variations, taking maximum values at the start of solar cycles 21, 22 and 25, and during the rising phases of cycles 23 and 24. The mode amplitude is anticorrelated with the sunspot number (corr=$-0.50$) but not correlated with the polar field strength. Over the period 1983-2022 the mode amplitude is strongly anticorrelated with the rotation rate at latitude $60^\circ$ (corr=$-0.82$), i.e., with the rotation rate near the mode's critical latitude. The mode frequency variations are small and display no clear solar cycle periodicity above the noise level ($\sim \pm 3$ nHz). Since about 1990, the mode frequency follows an overall decrease of $\sim 0.25$ nHz/year, consistent with the long-term decrease of the angular velocity at $60^\circ$ latitude. We expect that these very long time series of the mode properties will be key to understand the dynamical interactions between the high-latitude modes, differential rotation, and (possibly) magnetic activity.</description>

Abstract: The Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) is an instrument on the Aditya-L1 mission of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched on September 02, 2023. SUIT continuously provides, near-simultaneous full-disk and region-of-interest images of the Sun, slicing through the photosphere and chromosphere and covering a field of view up to 1.5 solar radii. For this purpose, SUIT uses 11 filters tuned at different wavelengths in the 200{--}400~nm range, including the Mg~{\sc ii} h~and~k and Ca~{\sc ii}~H spectral lines. The observations made by SUIT help us understand the magnetic coupling of the lower and middle solar atmosphere. In addition, for the first time, it allows the measurements of spatially resolved solar broad-band radiation in the near and mid ultraviolet, which will help constrain the variability of the solar ultraviolet irradiance in a wavelength range that is central for the chemistry of the Earth's atmosphere. This paper discusses the details of the instrument and data products.</description>

      <title>NGTS-EB-7, an eccentric, long-period, low-mass eclipsing binary</title>

Abstract: Despite being the most common types of stars in the Galaxy, the physical properties of late M dwarfs are often poorly constrained. A trend of radius inflation compared to evolutionary models has been observed for earlier type M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries, possibly caused by magnetic activity. It is currently unclear whether this trend also extends to later type M dwarfs below the convective boundary. This makes the discovery of lower-mass, fully convective, M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries valuable for testing evolutionary models especially in longer-period binaries where tidal interaction between the primary and secondary is negligible. With this context, we present the discovery of the NGTS-EB-7 AB system, an eclipsing binary containing a late M dwarf secondary and an evolved G-type primary star. The secondary star has a radius of $0.125 \pm 0.006 R_\odot$ , a mass of $0.096 \pm 0.004 M_\odot$ and follows a highly eccentric $(e=0.71436 \pm 0.00085)$ orbit every $193.35875 \pm 0.00034$ days. This makes NGTS-EB-7 AB the third longest-period eclipsing binary system with a secondary smaller than $200 M_J$ with the mass and radius constrained to better than $5 \%$. In addition, NGTS-EB-7 is situated near the centre of the proposed LOPS2 southern field of the upcoming PLATO mission, allowing for detection of the secondary eclipse and measurement of the companion`s temperature. With its long-period and well-constrained physical properties - NGTS-EB-7 B will make a valuable addition to the sample of M dwarfs in eclipsing binaries and help in determining accurate empirical mass/radius relations for later M dwarf stars.</description>

      <title>Moving-mesh non-ideal magnetohydrodynamical simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars</title>

Abstract: Magnetic fields have been shown both observationally and through theoretical work to be an important factor in the formation of protostars and their accretion disks. Accurate modelling of the evolution of the magnetic field in low-ionization molecular cloud cores requires the inclusion of non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) processes, specifically Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion and the Hall effect. These have a profound influence on the efficiency of magnetic removal of angular momentum from protostellar disks and simulations that include them can avoid the `magnetic-braking catastrophe' in which disks are not able to form. However, the impact of the Hall effect, in particular, is complex and remains poorly studied. In this work, we perform a large suite of simulations of the collapse of cloud cores to protostars with several non-ideal MHD chemistry models and initial core geometries using the moving-mesh code {\small AREPO}. We find that the efficiency of angular momentum removal is significantly reduced with respect to ideal MHD, in line with previous results. The Hall effect has a varied influence on the evolution of the disk which depends on the initial orientation of the magnetic field. This extends to the outflows seen in a subset of the models, where this effect can act to enhance or suppress them and open up new outflow channels. We conclude, in agreement with a subset of the previous literature, that the Hall effect is the dominant non-ideal MHD process in some collapse scenarios and thus should be included in simulations of protostellar disk formation.</description>

      <title>Constraining a relativistic mean field model using neutron star mass-radius measurements II: Hyperonic models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14572v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether measurements of the neutron star mass and radius or the tidal deformability can provide information about the presence of hyperons inside a neutron star. This is achieved by considering two inference models, with and without hyperons, based on a field-theoretical approach. While current observations do not distinguish between the two scenarios, we have shown that data simulating expected observations from future large area X-ray timing telescopes could provide some information through Bayes factors. Inference using simulated data generated from an EOS containing hyperons decisively favours the hyperonic model over the nucleonic model. However, a 2\% uncertainty in the mass and radius determination may not be sufficient to constrain the parameters of the model when only six neutron star mass-radius measurements are considered.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Impact of the Si/O Interface in CCSN Explosions Using the Force Explosion Condition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova is a complex interplay between neutrino heating and cooling (including the effects of neutrino-driven convection), the gravitational potential, and the ram pressure of the infalling material. To analyze the post-bounce phase of a supernova, one can use the generalized Force Explosion Condition (FEC+), which succinctly formalizes the interplay among these four phenomena in an analytical condition, consistent with realistic simulations. In this paper, we use the FEC+ to study the post-bounce phase of 341 spherically symmetric simulations, where convection is included through a time-dependent mixing length approach. We find that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the expanding shock can significantly change the outcome of the supernova by driving the FEC+ above the explosion threshold. We systematically explore this by (i) artificially smoothing the pre-supernova density profile, and (ii) artificially varying the mixing length. In both cases, we find that large-enough density contrasts at the Si/O interface lead to successful shock revival only if the FEC+ is already close to the explosion threshold. Furthermore, we find that the accretion of the Si/O interface has a substantial effect on the critical condition for supernova explosions, contributing between 5\% and 15\%, depending on how pronounced the density contrast at the interface is. Earlier studies showed that convection affects the critical condition by 25--30\%, which demonstrates that the accretion of the Si/O interface through the shock can play a nearly comparable role in influencing shock dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21046v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a novel deep learning framework based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict galactic cosmic-ray spectra on a one-day-ahead basis by leveraging historical solar activity data, overcoming limitations inherent in traditional transport models. By flexibly incorporating multiple solar parameters, such as the heliospheric magnetic field, solar wind speed, and sunspot numbers, our model achieves accurate short-term and long-term predictions of cosmic-ray flux. The addition of historical cosmic-ray flux data significantly enhances prediction accuracy, allowing the model to capture complex dependencies between past and future flux variations. Additionally, the model reliably predicts full cosmic-ray spectra for different particle species, enhancing its utility for comprehensive space weather forecasting. Our approach offers a scalable, data-driven alternative to traditional physics-based methods, ensuring robust daily and long-term forecasts. This work opens avenues for advanced models that can integrate broader observational data, with significant implications for space weather monitoring and mission planning.</description>

      <title>JWST Imaging of Edge-on Protoplanetary Disks. IV. Mid-infrared Dust Scattering in the HH 30 disk</title>

Abstract: We present near- and mid-infrared (IR) broadband imaging observations of the edge-on protoplanetary disk around HH 30 with the James Webb Space Telescope/Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) and the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI). We combine these observations with archival optical/near-IR scattered light images obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and a millimeter-wavelength dust continuum image obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) with the highest spatial resolution ever obtained for this target. Our multiwavelength images clearly reveal the vertical and radial segregation of micron-sized and sub-mm-sized grains in the disk. In the near- and mid-IR, the images capture not only bi-reflection nebulae separated by a dark lane but also diverse dynamical processes occurring in the HH 30 disk, such as spiral- and tail-like structures, a conical outflow, and a collimated jet. In contrast, the ALMA image reveals a flat dust disk in the disk midplane. By performing radiative transfer simulations, we show that grains of about 3 $\mu$m in radius or larger are fully vertically mixed to explain the observed mid-IR scattered light flux and its morphology, whereas millimeter-sized grains are settled into a layer with a scale height of $\gtrsim1$ au at $100$ au from the central star. We also find a tension in the disk inclination angle inferred from optical/near-IR and mm observations with the latter being closer to an exactly edge-on. Finally, we report the first detection of the proper motion of an emission knot associated with the mid-IR collimated jet detected by combining two epochs of our MIRI 12.8-$\mu$m observations.</description>

      <title>Equation of State Independent Determination on the Radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ Neutron Star Using Mass-Radius Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10242v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional methods for determining the radius of a 1.4 $M_{\odot}$ neutron star ($R_{1.4}$) rely on specific equations of state (EOS) models that describe various types of dense nuclear matter. This dependence on EOS models can introduce substantial systematic uncertainties, which may exceed the measurement uncertainties when constraining $R_{1.4}$. In this study, we explore a novel approach to constraining $R_{1.4}$ using data from NICER observations of PSR J0030+0451 (J0030) and PSR J0437-4715 (J0437). However, this work presents a more data-driven analysis framework, substantially decreasing the need for EOS assumptions. By analyzing the Mass-Radius measurements of these two neutron stars, we infer $R_{1.4}$ using statistical methods based mostly on observational data. We examine various hotspot configurations for J0030, along with new J0437 observations, and their effects on the inferred radius. Our results are consistent with X-ray timing, gravitational wave, and nuclear physics constraints, while avoiding EOS-related biases. The same method has also been applied to a simulated mass-radius dataset, based on our knowledge of future X-ray telescopes, demonstrating the model's ability to recover the injected $R_{1.4}$ value in certain cases. This method provides a data-driven pathway for extracting neutron star properties and offers a new approach for future observational efforts in neutron star astrophysics.</description>

      <title>The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02717v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.</description>
