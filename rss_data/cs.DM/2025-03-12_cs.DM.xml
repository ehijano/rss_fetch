      <title>Permanent of bipartite graphs in terms of determinants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computing the permanent of a $(0,1)$-matrix is a well-known $\#P$-complete problem. In this paper, we present an expression for the permanent of a bipartite graph in terms of the determinant of the graph and its subgraphs, obtained by successively removing rows and columns corresponding to vertices involved in vertex-disjoint $4k$-cycles. Our formula establishes a general relationship between the permanent and the determinant for any bipartite graph. Since computing the permanent of a biadjacency matrix is equivalent to counting the number of its perfect matchings, this approach also provides a more efficient method for counting perfect matchings in certain types of bipartite graphs. s in certain types of bipartite graphs.</description>

      <title>Sorting permutations using a pop stack with a bypass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new sorting device for permutations which makes use of a pop stack augmented with a bypass operation. This results in a sorting machine, which is more powerful than the usual Popstacksort algorithm and seems to have never been investigated previously. In the present paper, we give a characterization of sortable permutations in terms of forbidden patterns and reinterpret the resulting enumerating sequence using a class of restricted Motzkin paths. Moreover, we describe an algorithm to compute the set of all preimages of a given permutation, thanks to which we characterize permutations having a small number of preimages. Finally, we provide a full description of the preimages of principal classes of permutations, and we discuss the device consisting of two pop stacks in parallel, again with a bypass operation.</description>

      <title>The Computational Complexity of Positive Non-Clashing Teaching in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classical and parameterized complexity of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension of a set of concepts, that is, the smallest number of examples per concept required to successfully teach an intelligent learner under the considered, previously established model. For any class of concepts, it is known that this problem can be effortlessly transferred to the setting of balls in a graph G. We establish (1) the NP-hardness of the problem even when restricted to instances with positive non-clashing teaching dimension k=2 and where all balls in the graph are present, (2) near-tight running time upper and lower bounds for the problem on general graphs, (3) fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the vertex integrity of G, and (4) a lower bound excluding fixed-parameter tractability when parameterized by the feedback vertex number and pathwidth of G, even when combined with k. Our results provide a nearly complete understanding of the complexity landscape of computing the positive non-clashing teaching dimension and answer open questions from the literature.</description>

      <title>Secure domination in $P_5$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A dominating set of a graph $G$ is a set $S \subseteq V(G)$ such that every vertex in $V(G) \setminus S$ has a neighbor in $S$, where two vertices are neighbors if they are adjacent. A secure dominating set of $G$ is a dominating set $S$ of $G$ with the additional property that for every vertex $v \in V(G) \setminus S$, there exists a neighbor $u$ of $v$ in $S$ such that $(S \setminus \{u\}) \cup \{v\}$ is a dominating set of $G$. The secure domination number of $G$, denoted by $\gamma_s(G)$, is the minimum cardinality of a secure dominating set of $G$. We prove that if $G$ is a $P_5$-free graph, then $\gamma_s(G) \le \frac{3}{2}\alpha(G)$, where $\alpha(G)$ denotes the independence number of $G$. We further show that if $G$ is a connected $(P_5, H)$-free graph for some $H \in \{ P_3 \cup P_1, K_2 \cup 2K_1, ~\text{paw},~ C_4\}$, then $\gamma_s(G)\le \max\{3,\alpha(G)\}$. We also show that if $G$ is a $(P_3 \cup P_2)$-free graph, then $\gamma_s(G)\le \alpha(G)+1$.</description>

      <title>Induced Minor Models. I. Structural Properties and Algorithmic Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.08332v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is said to be an induced minor of a graph $G$ if $H$ can be obtained from $G$ by a sequence of vertex deletions and edge contractions. Equivalently, $H$ is an induced minor of $G$ if there exists an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, that is, a collection of pairwise disjoint subsets of vertices of $G$ labeled by the vertices of $H$, each inducing a connected subgraph in $G$, such that two vertices of $H$ are adjacent if and only if there is an edge in $G$ between the corresponding subsets.
  In this paper, we investigate structural properties of induced minor models, including bounds on treewidth and chromatic number of the subgraphs induced by minimal induced minor models. It is known that for some graphs $H$, testing a given graph $G$ contains $H$ as an induced minor is an NP-complete problem. Nevertheless, as algorithmic applications of our structural results, we make use of recent developments regarding tree-independence number to show that if $H$ is the $4$-wheel, the $5$-vertex complete graph minus an edge, or a complete bipartite graph $K_{2,q}$, then there is a polynomial-time algorithm to find in a given graph $G$ an induced minor model of $H$ in $G$, if there is one. We also develop an alternative polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs that do not contain $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, which revolves around the idea of detecting the induced subgraphs whose presence is forced when the input graph contains $K_{2,3}$ as an induced minor, using the so-called shortest path detector. It turns out that all these induced subgraphs are Truemper configurations.</description>

      <title>Digital Convexity and Combinatorics on Words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An upward (resp. downward) digitally convex word is a binary word that best approximates from below (resp. from above) an upward (resp. downward) convex curve in the plane. We study these words from the combinatorial point of view, formalizing their geometric properties and highlighting connections with Christoffel words and finite Sturmian words. In particular, we study from the combinatorial perspective the operations of inflation and deflation on digitally convex words.</description>

      <title>Positionality of Dumont--Thomas numeration systems for integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04487v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Introduced in 2001 by Lecomte and Rigo, abstract numeration systems provide a way of expressing natural numbers with words from a language $L$ accepted by a finite automaton. As it turns out, these numeration systems are not necessarily positional, i.e., we cannot always find a sequence $U=(U_i)_{i\ge 0}$ of integers such that the value of every word in the language $L$ is determined by the position of its letters and the first few values of $U$. Finding the conditions under which an abstract numeration system is positional seems difficult in general. In this paper, we thus consider this question for a particular sub-family of abstract numeration systems called Dumont--Thomas numeration systems. They are derived from substitutions and were introduced in 1989 by Dumont and Thomas. We exhibit conditions on the underlying substitution so that the corresponding Dumont--Thomas numeration is positional. We first work in the most general setting, then particularize our results to some practical cases. Finally, we link our numeration systems to existing literature, notably properties studied by R\'{e}nyi in 1957, Parry in 1960, Bertrand-Mathis in 1989, and Fabre in 1995.</description>
