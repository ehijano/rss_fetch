      <title>Passage times of fast inhomogeneous immigration processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many biophysical systems, key events are triggered when the fastest of many random searchers find a target. Most mathematical models of such systems assume that all searchers are initially present in the search domain, which permits the use of classical extreme value theory. In this paper, we explore $k$th passage times of inhomogeneous immigration processes where searchers are added to the domain over time either through time inhomogeneous rates or a Yule (pure birth) process. We rigorously prove convergence in distribution and convergence of moments of the $k$th passage times for both processes as immigration rates grow. In particular, we relate immigration with time inhomogeneous rates to previous work where all searchers are initially present through a coupling argument and demonstrate how immigration through a Yule process can be viewed as a time inhomogeneous immigration process with a random time shift. For Yule immigration, we find that the extreme distributions depart from the classical family of Frechet, Gumbel, and Weibull, and we compare our results to classical theorems on branching Brownian motion. This work offers one of the few examples where extreme value distributions can be obtained exactly for random variables which are neither independent nor identically distributed.</description>

      <title>Deep BSDE Solver on Bounded Domains Part I: General Loss Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a ramification of the deep BSDE loss functional designed to apply for BSDEs on bounded domains, i.e. with random (unbounded) time horizons. We derive a general convergence rate of the loss functional; precisely for a class of (randomly) weighted modifications of the functional. The rate is expressed in terms of the underlying discrete-time stepsize and a universal approximation distance.</description>

      <title>The It{\^o}-F\"ollmer formula -- nonstandard cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this note is to prove the It{\^o}-F\"ollmer formula for the c\`adl\`ag paths possessing quadratic variation in a possibly ``weakest'' sense along some sequence of partitions. By this we mean, for example, that we do not require the jumps of the quadratic variation to occur exactly at the times when the path itself jumps or that the quadratic variation exists at all time instances. Moreover, we deal with more general partitions than partitions with vanishing mesh used by F\"ollmer, also relaxing restrictions imposed on a sequence of partitions in other related literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main purpose of the paper is to study ruin probabilities in two discrete time risk models under rates of interest, where the premiums and claims are two independent sequences of m-dependent random variables, and the rate of interest is a sequence of identically distributed random variables. Our results extend the corresponding ones for independent random sequences.</description>

      <title>Twisted Dirac operators and fractional correlations of the massless sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14806v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the massless sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point, in infinite volume, we define the fractional (charge or vertex operator) correlation functions from the probabilistic path integral and prove that they are given by renormalized determinants of massive twisted Dirac operators. The fractional correlation functions are the moments of the imaginary multiplicative chaos, a random generalized function that we construct with respect to the infinite-volume massless sine-Gordon measure. The renormalized determinants are the tau functions of Sato--Miwa--Jimbo as identified by Palmer.
  The construction and a priori control of the imaginary multiplicative chaos combines methods from stochastic analysis (of singular SPDE flavor) for short-scale regularity with qualitative input from integrability for large-scale control. The exact identification of the correlation functions with the renormalized determinants relies on finite-volume approximation, regularity estimates for the mass perturbation, and analytic continuation in the coupling constant.
  The combination of existing results for tau functions with our identification implies various predictions for the sine-Gordon model such as that the fractional two-point functions are expressed as Fredholm determinants and satisfy certain PDEs as predicted by Bernard--LeClair. Using asymptotics of Fredholm determinants of Basor--Tracy and mixing of the massless sine-Gordon model at the free fermion point, which we prove, we further derive the exact formula for the one-point function predicted by Lukyanov--Zamolodchikov (at the free fermion point).</description>

      <title>L\'{e}vy processes as weak limits of rough Heston models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show weak convergence of the marginals for a re-scaled rough Heston model to a Normal Inverse Gaussian (NIG) L\'{e}vy process. This shows we can obtain such a limit without having to impose that the true Hurst exponent $H$ for the model is $\frac{1}{2}$ as in [Abi Jaber, &amp; De Carvalho, 2024], or that $H\searrow -\frac{1}{2}$ as in [Abi Jaber, Attal, &amp; Rosenbaum, 2025], so the result potentially has increased financial relevance. We later extend to the case when $V$ has jumps, where we show weak convergence of the finite-dimensional distributions of the integrated variance to a deterministic time-change of the first passage time process to lower barriers for a more general class of spectrally positive L\'{e}vy processes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Subspace Embeddings: Resolving Nelson-Nguyen Conjecture Up to Sub-Polylogarithmic Factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14234v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a proof of the conjecture of Nelson and Nguyen [FOCS 2013] on the optimal dimension and sparsity of oblivious subspace embeddings, up to sub-polylogarithmic factors: For any $n\geq d$ and $\epsilon\geq d^{-O(1)}$, there is a random $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)\times n$ matrix $\Pi$ with $\tilde O(\log(d)/\epsilon)$ non-zeros per column such that for any $A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}$, with high probability, $(1-\epsilon)\|Ax\|\leq\|\Pi Ax\|\leq(1+\epsilon)\|Ax\|$ for all $x\in\mathbb{R}^d$, where $\tilde O(\cdot)$ hides only sub-polylogarithmic factors in $d$. Our result in particular implies a new fastest sub-current matrix multiplication time reduction of size $\tilde O(d/\epsilon^2)$ for a broad class of $n\times d$ linear regression tasks.
  A key novelty in our analysis is a matrix concentration technique we call iterative decoupling, which we use to fine-tune the higher-order trace moment bounds attainable via existing random matrix universality tools [Brailovskaya and van Handel, GAFA 2024].</description>

      <title>On the "second" Kahn--Kalai Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14269v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We make progress on a conjecture of Kahn and Kalai, the original (stronger but less general) version of what became known as the ``Kahn-Kalai Conjecture" (KKC; now a theorem of Park and Pham). This ``second" KKC concerns the threshold, $p_c(H)$, for $G_{n,p}$ to contain a copy of a given graph $H$, predicting $p_c(H) = O(p_{\mathbb E}(H)\log n)$, where $p_{\mathbb E}$ is an easy lower bound on $p_c$. What we actually show is $p_{\mathbb E}^*(H)=O(p_{\mathbb E}(H)\log ^2n)$, where $p_{\mathbb E}^*$, the fractional expectation threshold, is a larger lower bound suggested by Talagrand. When combined with Talagrand's fractional relaxation of the KKC (now a theorem of Frankston, Kahn, Narayanan and Park), this gives $p_c(H)=O(p_{\mathbb E}(H)\log^3 n)$. (The second KKC would follow similarly if one could remove the log factors from the above bound on $p_{\mathbb E}^*$.)</description>

      <title>Singular Perturbations of Hamilton-Jacobi Equations in the Wasserstein Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a singular perturbation problem for second-order Hamilton-Jacobi equations in the Wasserstein space. Specifically, we characterize the behavior of the solutions as the perturbation parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero. The notion of solution we adopt is that of viscosity solutions in the sense of test functions on the Wasserstein space. Our proof utilizes the perturbed test function method, appropriately adapted to this setting. Finally, we highlight a connection with the homogenization of conditional slow-fast McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <title>Hilbert geometry of the symmetric positive-definite bicone: Application to the geometry of the extended Gaussian family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14369v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extended Gaussian family is the closure of the Gaussian family obtained by completing the Gaussian family with the counterpart elements induced by degenerate covariance or degenerate precision matrices, or a mix of both degeneracies. The parameter space of the extended Gaussian family forms a symmetric positive semi-definite matrix bicone, i.e. two partial symmetric positive semi-definite matrix cones joined at their bases. In this paper, we study the Hilbert geometry of such an open bounded convex symmetric positive-definite bicone. We report the closed-form formula for the corresponding Hilbert metric distance and study exhaustively its invariance properties. We also touch upon potential applications of this geometry for dealing with extended Gaussian distributions.</description>

      <title>Pricing Options on Forwards in Function-Valued Affine Stochastic Volatility Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pricing of European-style options written on forward contracts within function-valued infinite-dimensional affine stochastic volatility models. The dynamics of the underlying forward price curves are modeled within the Heath-Jarrow-Morton-Musiela framework as solution to a stochastic partial differential equation modulated by a stochastic volatility process. We analyze two classes of affine stochastic volatility models: (i) a Gaussian model governed by a finite-rank Wishart process, and (ii) a pure-jump affine model extending the Barndorff--Nielsen--Shephard framework with state-dependent jumps in the covariance component. For both models, we derive conditions for the existence of exponential moments and develop semi-closed Fourier-based pricing formulas for vanilla call and put options written on forward price curves. Our approach allows for tractable pricing in models with infinitely many risk factors, thereby capturing maturity-specific and term structure risk essential in forward markets.</description>

      <title>Spectral gap with polynomial rate for Weil-Petersson random surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that there is a constant $c&gt;0$ such that a genus $g$ closed hyperbolic surface, sampled at random from the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_{g}$ with respect to the Weil-Petersson probability measure, has Laplacian spectral gap at least $\frac{1}{4}-O\left(\frac{1}{g^{c}}\right)$ with probability tending to $1$ as $g\to\infty$. This extends and gives a new proof of a recent result of Anantharaman and Monk proved in the series of works [2,3,5,4,6].
  Our approach adapts the polynomial method for the strong convergence of random matrices, introduced by Chen, Garza-Vargas, Tropp and van Handel [19], and its generalization to the strong convergence of surface groups by Magee, Puder and van Handel [41], to the Laplacian on Weil-Petersson random hyperbolic surfaces.</description>

      <title>Exact threshold for approximate ellipsoid fitting of random points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05787v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem $(\rm P)$ of exactly fitting an ellipsoid (centered at $0$) to $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n / d^2 \to \alpha &gt; 0$. This problem is conjectured to undergo a sharp transition: with high probability, $(\rm P)$ has a solution if $\alpha &lt; 1/4$, while $(\rm P)$ has no solutions if $\alpha &gt; 1/4$. So far, only a trivial bound $\alpha &gt; 1/2$ is known to imply the absence of solutions, while the sharpest results on the positive side assume $\alpha \leq \eta$ (for $\eta &gt; 0$ a small constant) to prove that $(\rm P)$ is solvable. In this work we show a universality property for the minimal fitting error achievable by ellipsoids: we show that, to leading order, it coincides with the minimal error in a so-called "Gaussian equivalent" problem, for which the satisfiability transition can be rigorously analyzed. Our main results follow from this finding, and they are twofold. On the positive side, we prove that if $\alpha &lt; 1/4$, there exists an ellipsoid fitting all the points up to a small error, and that the lengths of its principal axes are bounded above and below. On the other hand, for $\alpha &gt; 1/4$, we show that achieving small fitting error is not possible if the length of the ellipsoid's shortest axis does not approach $0$ as $d \to \infty$ (and in particular there does not exist any ellipsoid fit whose shortest axis length is bounded away from $0$ as $d \to \infty$). To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first rigorous result characterizing the expected phase transition in ellipsoid fitting at $\alpha = 1/4$. In a companion non-rigorous work, the second author and D. Kunisky give a general analysis of ellipsoid fitting using the replica method of statistical physics, which inspired the present work.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17390v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain a precise estimate of the probability that the sparse binomial random graph contains a large number of vertices in a triangle. The estimate of log of this probability is correct up to second order, and enables us to propose an exponential random graph model based on the number of vertices in a triangle. Specifically, by tuning a single parameter, we can with high probability induce any given fraction of vertices in a triangle. Moreover, in the proposed exponential random graph model we derive the large deviation principle for the number of edges. As a byproduct, we propose a consistent estimator of the tuning parameter.</description>

      <title>Surface sums for lattice Yang-Mills in the large-$N$ limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a sum over weighted planar surfaces formula for Wilson loop expectations in the large-$N$ limit of strongly coupled lattice Yang-Mills theory, in any dimension. The weights of each surface are simple and expressed in terms of products of signed Catalan numbers.
  In establishing our results, the main novelty is to convert a recursive relation for Wilson loop expectations, known as the master loop equation, into a new peeling exploration of the planar surfaces. This exploration reveals hidden cancellations within the sums, enabling a deeper understanding of the structure of the planar surfaces.
  We view our results as a continuation of the program initiated in [CPS23] to understand Yang-Mills theories via surfaces and as a refinement of the string trajectories point-of-view developed in [Cha19a].</description>

      <title>Optimal bound for survival time of the SIRS process on star graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21138v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SIRS) process, a continuous-time Markov chain frequently employed in epidemiology to model the spread of infections on networks. In this framework, infections spread as infected vertices recover at rate 1, infect susceptible neighbors independently at rate $\lambda$, and recovered vertices become susceptible again at rate $\alpha$. This model presents a significantly greater analytical challenge compared to the SIS model, which has consequently inspired a much more extensive and rich body of mathematical literature for the latter. Understanding the survival time, the duration before the infection dies out completely, is a fundamental question in this context. On general graphs, survival time heavily depends on the infection's persistence around high-degree vertices (known as hubs or stars), as long persistence enables transmission between hubs and prolongs the process. In contrast, short persistence leads to rapid extinction, making the dynamics on star graphs, which serve as key representatives of hubs, particularly important to study.
  In the 2016 paper by Ferreira, Sander, and Pastor-Satorras, it was conjectured, based on intuitive arguments, that the survival time for SIRS on a star graph with $n$ leaves is bounded above by $(\lambda^2 n)^\alpha$ for large $n$. Later, in one of a few mathematically rigorous results for SIRS, Friedrich, G{\"o}bel, Klodt, Krejca, and Pappik provided an upper bound of $n^\alpha \log n$, with contains an additional $\log n$ and no dependence on $\lambda$.
  We resolve this conjecture by proving that the survival time is indeed of order $(\lambda^2 n)^\alpha$, with matching upper and lower bounds. Additionally, we show that this holds even in the case where only the root undergoes immunization, while the leaves revert to susceptibility immediately after recovery.</description>

      <title>On the extremal eigenvalues of Jacobi ensembles at zero temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.01369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For the $\beta$-Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi ensembles of dimension $N$ there exist central limit theorems for the freezing case $\beta\to\infty$ such that the associated means and covariances can be expressed in terms of the associated Hermite, Laguerre, and Jacobi polynomials of order $N$ respectively as well as via the associated dual polynomials in the sense of de Boor and Saff. In this paper we derive limits for $N\to\infty$ for the covariances of the $r\in\mathbb N$ largest (and smallest) eigenvalues for these frozen Jacobi ensembles in terms of Bessel functions. These results correspond to the hard edge analysis in the frozen Laguerre cases by Andraus and Lerner-Brecher and to known results for finite $\beta$.</description>

Abstract: We define the Wigner distribution of a tempered generalized stochastic process that is complex-valued symmetric Gaussian. This gives a time-frequency generalized stochastic process defined on the phase space. We study its covariance and our main result is a formula for the Weyl symbol of the covariance operator, expressed in terms of the Weyl symbol of the covariance operator of the original generalized stochastic process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.05447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit, in a self contained way, the Markov property on planar maps and decorated planar maps from three perspectives. First, we characterize the laws on these planar maps that satisfy both the Markov property and rerooting invariance, showing that they are Boltzmann-type maps. Second, we provide a comprehensive characterization of random submaps, that we call stopping maps, satisfying the Markov property, demonstrating that they are not restricted to those obtained through a peeling procedure. Third, we introduce decorated metric planar maps in which edges are replaced by copies of random length intervals $[0,w_e]$, and the decorations are given by continuous functions on the edges. We define a probability measure on them that is the analogue of the Boltzmann map and show that it satisfies the Markov property even for sets that halt exploration mid-edge.</description>

      <title>Convergence to equilibrium for density dependent Markov jump processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12926v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence to (quasi--)equilibrium of a density dependent Markov chain in~${\mathbb Z}^d$, whose drift satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations having an attractive fixed point. For a sequence of such processes~${\mathbb X}^N$, indexed by a size parameter~$N$, the time taken until the distribution of~${\mathbb X}^N$, started in some given state, approaches its equilibrium distribution~$\pi^N$ typically increases with~$N$. To first order, it corresponds to the time~$t_N$ at which the solution to the drift equations reaches a distance of~$\sqrt N$ from their fixed point. However, the length of the time interval over which the total variation distance between ${\mathcal L} ({\mathbb X}^N(t))$ and its equilibrium distribution~$\pi^N$ changes from being close to~$1$ to being close to zero is asymptotically of smaller order than~$t_N$. In this sense, the chains exhibit `cut--off', and we are able to prove that the cut-off window is of (optimal) constant size.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18448v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study particle systems interacting via hitting times on sparsely connected graphs, following the framework of Lacker, Ramanan and Wu (2023). We provide general robustness conditions that guarantee the well-posedness of physical solutions to the dynamics, and demonstrate their connections to the dynamic percolation theory. We then study the limiting behavior of the particle systems, establishing the continuous dependence of the joint law of the physical solution on the underlying graph structure with respect to local convergence and showing the convergence of the global empirical measure, which extends the general results by Lacker et al. to systems with singular interaction. The model proposed provides a general framework for analyzing systemic risks in large sparsely connected financial networks with a focus on local interactions, featuring instantaneous default cascades.</description>

      <title>Well-posedness of Fractional Stochastic p-Laplace Equations Driven by Superlinear Transport Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06766v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the fractional p-Laplace equation with a polynomial drift of arbitrary order driven by superlinear transport noise. By the monotone argument, we first prove the existence and uniqueness of solutions of an abstract stochastic differential equation satisfying a fully local monotonicity condition. We then apply the abstract result to the fractional stochastic p-Laplace equation defined in a bounded domain. The main difficulty is to establish the tightness as well as the uniform integrability of a sequence of approximate solutions defined by the Galerkin method. To obtain the necessary uniform estimates, we employ the Skorokhod-Jakubowski representation theorem on a topological space instead of a metric space. Since the strong Skorokhod representation theorem is incorrect even in a complete separable metric space, we pass to the limit of stochastic integrals with respect to a sequence of Wiener processes by a weak convergence argument.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07614v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from strongly log-concave distributions over $\mathbb{R}^d$ using the Poisson midpoint discretization (a variant of the randomized midpoint method) for overdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics. We prove its convergence in the 2-Wasserstein distance ($W_2$), achieving a cubic speedup in dependence on the target accuracy ($\epsilon$) over the Euler-Maruyama discretization, surpassing existing bounds for randomized midpoint methods. Notably, in the case of underdamped Langevin dynamics, we demonstrate the complexity of $W_2$ convergence is much smaller than the complexity lower bounds for convergence in $L^2$ strong error established in the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15072v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the large deviation probabilities of first passage times (FPT) of discrete-time supercritical non-lattice branching random walks (BRWs) in $\mathbb{R}^d$ where $d\geq 1$. The FPT refers to the first time the BRW enters a ball of radius one with a distance $x$ from the origin, conditioned upon the process's survival. Furthermore, we apply the spine decomposition technique to construct an asymptotically optimal polynomial-time algorithm for computing the lower large deviation probabilities of the FPT. The accuracy of our algorithm is also verified numerically. Our analysis not only provides a deeper theoretical understanding of these stochastic processes but also offers new insights into the microstructural features that are key to characterizing the strength of polymers.</description>

Abstract: We consider the microscopic statistics of a Coulomb gas in $\mathbb{R}^2$ at intermediate temperatures. In particular, we show that the microscopic point process associated to the Coulomb gas converges to a homogeneous Poisson point process at intermediate temperature regimes $\beta N \rightarrow \infty$ and $\beta \sqrt{N} \log N \rightarrow 0$, extending previous results. Our approach relies on a novel quantitative asymptotic description of correlation functions, which is of its own interest.</description>

      <title>Time multidimensional Markov Renewal chains -- An algebraic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01891v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, a new extension of the Markov Renewal theory is introduced by allowing time to evolve in multiple dimensions. The resulting chains are referred to as multi-time Markov Renewal chains and since this extension is new, the state space is assumed to be finite to cover the theoretical framework of applications, where the possible number of states of a physical system is finite. The flexibility of Markov renewal theory is still present in multiple time dimensions by allowing the sojourn times in the different states of the system to be arbitrarily selected from a multidimensional distribution. The convolution product of multidimensional matrix sequences plays a particular role in the development of the theory and some of its algebraic properties are given and explored, paying particular attention to the existence, the representation and the computation of the convolutional inverse. Some basic definitions and properties of this new class are given as well as the multi-time Markov renewal equations associated to the resulting processes. The practical implementation is achieved very efficiently through a novel adaptation of the Gauss-Jordan algorithm for multidimensional matrix sequences.</description>

Abstract: We prove that the truncated correlation functions of the charge and gradient fields associated with the massless sine-Gordon model on $\mathbb{R}^2$ with $\beta=4\pi$ exist for all coupling constants and are equal to those of the chiral densities and vector current of free massive Dirac fermions. This is an instance of Coleman's prediction that the massless sine-Gordon model and the massive Thirring model are equivalent (in the above sense of correlation functions). Our main novelty is that we prove this correspondence starting from the Euclidean path integral in the non-perturative regime of the infinite volume models. We use this correspondence to show that the correlation functions of the massless sine-Gordon model with $\beta=4\pi$ decay exponentially and that the corresponding probabilistic field is localized.</description>

Abstract: We establish the existence of a full spectrum of Lyapunov exponents for memoryless random dynamical systems with absorption. To this end, we crucially embed the process conditioned to never being absorbed, the $Q$-process, into the framework of random dynamical systems, allowing us to study multiplicative ergodic properties. We show that the finite-time Lyapunov exponents converge in conditioned probability and apply our results to iterated function systems and stochastic differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) represent a recent advance in generative modelling that has delivered state-of-the-art results across many domains of applications. Despite their success, a rigorous theoretical understanding of the error within DDPMs, particularly the non-asymptotic bounds required for the comparison of their efficiency, remain scarce. Making minimal assumptions on the initial data distribution, allowing for example the manifold hypothesis, this paper presents explicit non-asymptotic bounds on the forward diffusion error in total variation (TV), expressed as a function of the terminal time $T$.
  We parametrise multi-modal data distributions in terms of the distance $R$ to their furthest modes and consider forward diffusions with additive and multiplicative noise. Our analysis rigorously proves that, under mild assumptions, the canonical choice of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process cannot be significantly improved in terms of reducing the terminal time $T$ as a function of $R$ and error tolerance $\varepsilon&gt;0$. Motivated by data distributions arising in generative modelling, we also establish a cut-off like phenomenon (as $R\to\infty$) for the convergence to its invariant measure in TV of an OU process, initialized at a multi-modal distribution with maximal mode distance $R$.</description>

      <title>Regularized e-processes: anytime valid inference with knowledge-based efficiency gains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01427v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Classical statistical methods have theoretical justification when the sample size is predetermined. In applications, however, it's often the case that sample sizes are data-dependent rather than predetermined. The aforementioned methods aren't reliable in this latter case, hence the recent interest in e-processes and methods that are anytime valid, i.e., reliable for any dynamic data-collection plan. But if the investigator has relevant-yet-incomplete prior information about the quantity of interest, then there's an opportunity for efficiency gain. This paper proposes a regularized e-process framework featuring a knowledge-based, imprecise-probabilistic regularization with improved efficiency. A generalized version of Ville's inequality is established, ensuring that inference based on the regularized e-process are anytime valid in a novel, knowledge-dependent sense. Regularized e-processes also facilitate possibility-theoretic uncertainty quantification with strong frequentist-like calibration properties and other Bayesian-like properties: satisfies the likelihood principle, avoids sure-loss, and offers formal decision-making with reliability guarantees.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Temporal Point Process Modeling of Aggressive Behavior Onset in Psychiatric Inpatient Youth with Autism for Branching Factor Estimation</title>

Abstract: Aggressive behavior in autistic inpatient youth often arises in temporally clustered bursts complicating efforts to distinguish external triggers from internal escalation. The sample population branching factor-the expected number of new onsets triggered by a given event-is a key summary of self-excitation in behavior dynamics. Prior pooled models overestimate this quantity by ignoring patient-specific variability. We addressed this using a hierarchical Hawkes process with an exponential kernel and edge-effect correction allowing partial pooling across patients. This approach reduces bias from high-frequency individuals and stabilizes estimates for those with sparse data. Bayesian inference was performed using the No U-Turn Sampler with model evaluation via convergence diagnostics, power-scaling sensitivity analysis, and multiple Goodness-of-Fit (GOF) metrics: PSIS-LOO the Lewis test with Durbin's modification and residual analysis based on the Random Time Change Theorem (RTCT). The hierarchical model yielded a significantly lower and more precise branching factor estimate mean (0.742 +- 0.026) than the pooled model (0.899 +- 0.015) and narrower intervals than the unpooled model (0.717 +- 0.139). This led to a threefold smaller cascade of events per onset under the hierarchical model. Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness to prior and likelihood perturbations while the unpooled model showed instability for sparse individuals. GOF measures consistently favored or on par to the hierarchical model. Hierarchical Hawkes modeling with edge-effect correction provides robust estimation of branching dynamics by capturing both within- and between-patient variability. This enables clearer separation of endogenous from exogenous events supports linkage to physiological signals and enhances early warning systems individualized treatment and resource allocation in inpatient care.</description>

      <title>The spectra of graph substitutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21733v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,E_X)$ and $(V,E_V)$ be finite connected graphs without loops. We assume that $V$ has two distinguished vertices $a,b$ and an automorphism $\gamma$ which exchanges $a$ and~$b$. The $V$-edge substitution of $X$ is the graph $X[V]$ where each edge $[x,y] \in E_X$ is replaced by a copy of $V$, identifying $x$ with $a$ and $y$ with $b$ or vice versa. (The latter choice does not matter; it yields isomorphic graphs.) The aim is to describe the spectrum of $X[V]$ in terms of the spectra of $X$ and $V$. Instead of the spectra of the adjacency matrices, we consider the versions which are normalised by dividing each row by the row sum (the vertex degree). These are stochastic, reversible matrices, and our approach applies more generally to reversible transition matrices corresponding to arbitrary positive edge weights invariant under $\gamma$. We write $P$ for the transition matrix over $X$ and $Q$ for the one over $V$. Together, they induce the matrix $P_*$ over $X[V]$.
  The main part of the spectrum of $P_*$ is the response of the natural frequencies of $X$ to substituting $V$, given by a functional equation coming from a rational function induced by~$Q$. A second part comes from specific eigenvalues of $Q$, if present. Finally, there is the part of $\mathsf{spec}(P_*)$ whose eigenfunctions have $X$ as a nodal set. The results depend on issues like whether $X$ has circles of even length and on the eigenvalues of the restriction of $Q$ to $V \setminus \{ a,b\}$, which are classified into 4 possible types. Quite subtle is the issue of determining the multiplicities of the latter as eigenvalues of $P_*$ in terms of the input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a construction of the finite-volume massive sine-Gordon model in the UV subcritical regime using a renormalization group method. The resulting measure has Gaussian tails, respects toroidal symmetries and is reflection-positive.</description>
