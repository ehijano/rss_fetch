      <title>Matrix Rationalization via Partial Orders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A preference matrix $M$ has an entry for each pair of candidates in an election whose value $p_{ij}$ represents the proportion of voters that prefer candidate $i$ over candidate $j$. The matrix is rationalizable if it is consistent with a set of voters whose preferences are total orders. A celebrated open problem asks for a concise characterization of rationalizable preference matrices. In this paper, we generalize this matrix rationalizability question and study when a preference matrix is consistent with a set of voters whose preferences are partial orders of width $\alpha$. The width (the maximum cardinality of an antichain) of the partial order is a natural measure of the rationality of a voter; indeed, a partial order of width $1$ is a total order. Our primary focus concerns the rationality number, the minimum width required to rationalize a preference matrix. We present two main results. The first concerns the class of half-integral preference matrices, where we show the key parameter required in evaluating the rationality number is the chromatic number of the undirected unanimity graph associated with the preference matrix $M$. The second concerns the class of integral preference matrices, where we show the key parameter now is the dichromatic number of the directed voting graph associated with $M$.</description>

      <title>Euclidean Maximum Matchings in the Plane---Local to Global</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a perfect matching on a set of points in the plane where every edge is a line segment between two points. We say that $M$ is globally maximum if it is a maximum-length matching on all points. We say that $M$ is $k$-local maximum if for any subset $M'=\{a_1b_1,\dots,a_kb_k\}$ of $k$ edges of $M$ it holds that $M'$ is a maximum-length matching on points $\{a_1,b_1,\dots,a_k,b_k\}$. We show that local maximum matchings are good approximations of global ones.
  Let $\mu_k$ be the infimum ratio of the length of any $k$-local maximum matching to the length of any global maximum matching, over all finite point sets in the Euclidean plane. It is known that $\mu_k\geqslant \frac{k-1}{k}$ for any $k\geqslant 2$. We show the following improved bounds for $k\in\{2,3\}$: $\sqrt{3/7}\leqslant\mu_2&lt; 0.93 $ and $\sqrt{3}/2\leqslant\mu_3&lt; 0.98$. We also show that every pairwise crossing matching is unique and it is globally maximum.
  Towards our proof of the lower bound for $\mu_2$ we show the following result which is of independent interest: If we increase the radii of pairwise intersecting disks by factor $2/\sqrt{3}$, then the resulting disks have a common intersection.</description>

      <title>Practical implementation of geometric quasi-cyclic LDPC codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We detail for the first time a complete explicit description of the quasi-cyclic structure of all classical finite generalized quadrangles. Using these descriptions we construct families of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes derived from the point-line incidence matrix of the quadrangles by explicitly calculating quasi-cyclic generator and parity check matrices for these codes. This allows us to construct parity check and generator matrices of all such codes of length up to 400000. These codes cover a wide range of transmission rates, are easy and fast to implement and perform close to Shannon's limit with no visible error floors. We also include some performance data for these codes. Furthermore, we include a complete explicit description of the quasi-cyclic structure of the point-line and point-hyperplane incidences of the finite projective and affine spaces.</description>

      <title>Comparing Quantum Annealing and Spiking Neuromorphic Computing for Sampling Binary Sparse Coding QUBO Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20525v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of computing a sparse binary representation of an image. To be precise, given an image and an overcomplete, non-orthonormal basis, we aim to find a sparse binary vector indicating the minimal set of basis vectors that when added together best reconstruct the given input. We formulate this problem with an $L_2$ loss on the reconstruction error, and an $L_0$ (or, equivalently, an $L_1$) loss on the binary vector enforcing sparsity. This yields a quadratic binary optimization problem (QUBO), whose optimal solution(s) in general is NP-hard to find. The method of unsupervised and unnormalized dictionary feature learning for a desired sparsity level to best match the data is presented. Next, we solve the sparse representation QUBO by implementing it both on a D-Wave quantum annealer with Pegasus chip connectivity via minor embedding, as well as on the Intel Loihi 2 spiking neuromorphic processor. On the quantum annealer, we sample from the sparse representation QUBO using parallel quantum annealing combined with quantum evolution Monte Carlo, also known as iterated reverse annealing. On Loihi 2, we use a stochastic winner take all network of neurons. The solutions are benchmarked against simulated annealing, a classical heuristic, and the optimal solutions are computed using CPLEX. Iterated reverse quantum annealing performs similarly to simulated annealing, although simulated annealing is always able to sample the optimal solution whereas quantum annealing was not always able to. The Loihi 2 solutions that are sampled are on average more sparse than the solutions from any of the other methods. Loihi 2 outperforms a D-Wave quantum annealer standard linear-schedule anneal, while iterated reverse quantum annealing performs much better than both unmodified linear-schedule quantum annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2.</description>

      <title>Towards a General GNN Framework for Combinatorial Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved great success for a variety of tasks such as node classification, graph classification, and link prediction. However, the use of GNNs (and machine learning more generally) to solve combinatorial optimization (CO) problems is much less explored. Here, we introduce a novel GNN architecture which leverages a complex filter bank and localized attention mechanisms designed to solve CO problems on graphs. We show how our method differentiates itself from prior GNN-based CO solvers and how it can be effectively applied to the maximum clique, minimum dominating set, and maximum cut problems in a self-supervised learning setting. In addition to demonstrating competitive overall performance across all tasks, we establish state-of-the-art results for the max cut problem.</description>

      <title>Finding Diverse Solutions Parameterized by Cliquewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding a few solutions for a given problem that are diverse, as opposed to finding a single best solution to solve the problem, has recently become a notable topic in theoretical computer science. Recently, Baste, Fellows, Jaffke, Masa\v{r}\'ik, Oliveira, Philip, and Rosamond showed that under a standard structural parameterization by treewidth, one can find a set of diverse solutions for many problems with only a very small additional cost [Artificial Intelligence 2022]. In this paper, we investigate a much stronger graph parameter, the cliquewidth, which can additionally describe some dense graph classes. Broadly speaking, it describes graphs that can be recursively constructed by a few operations defined on graphs whose vertices are divided into a bounded number of groups while each such group behaves uniformly with respect to any operation.
  We show that for any vertex problem, if we are given a dynamic program solving that problem on cliquewidth decomposition, we can modify it to produce a few solutions that are as diverse as possible with as little overhead as in the above-mentioned treewidth paper. As a consequence, we prove that a diverse version of any MSO$_1$ expressible problem can be solved in FPT time parameterized by cliquewidth, the number of sought solutions, and the number of quantifiers in the formula. That was an important missing piece in the complexity landscape of structural graph parameters and logic. We prove our results allowing for a more general natural collection of diversity functions compared to only two mostly studied diversity functions previously. That might be of independent interest as a larger pool of different diversity functions can highlight various aspects of different solutions to a problem.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Complexity of Path Set Packing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.08757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.08757v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Path Set Packing, the input is an undirected graph $G$, a collection $\calp$ of simple paths in $G$, and a positive integer $k$. The problem is to decide whether there exist $k$ edge-disjoint paths in $\calp$. We study the parameterized complexity of Path Set Packing with respect to both natural and structural parameters. We show that the problem is $W[1]$-hard with respect to vertex cover number, and $W[1]$-hard respect to pathwidth plus maximum degree plus solution size. These results answer an open question raised in COCOON 2018. On the positive side, we present an FPT algorithm parameterized by feedback vertex number plus maximum degree, and present an FPT algorithm parameterized by treewidth plus maximum degree plus maximum length of a path in $\calp$. These positive results complement the hardness of Path Set Packing with respect to any subset of the parameters used in the FPT algorithms. We also give a $4$-approximation algorithm for maximum path set packing problem which runs in FPT time when parameterized by feedback edge number.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Conversion Relations for Prefixed Units of Measure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.11580v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Units of measure with prefixes and conversion rules are given a formal semantic model in terms of categorial group theory. Basic structures and both natural and contingent semantic operations are defined. Conversion rules are represented as a class of ternary relations with both group-like and category-like properties. A hierarchy of subclasses is explored, each satisfying stronger useful algebraic properties than the preceding, culminating in a direct efficient conversion-by-rewriting algorithm.</description>

      <title>New and improved bounds on the contextuality degree of multi-qubit configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10225v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present algorithms and a C code to reveal quantum contextuality and evaluate the contextuality degree (a way to quantify contextuality) for a variety of point-line geometries located in binary symplectic polar spaces of small rank. With this code we were not only able to recover, in a more efficient way, all the results of a recent paper by de Boutray et al [(2022). Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical 55 475301], but also arrived at a bunch of new noteworthy results. The paper first describes the algorithms and the C code. Then it illustrates its power on a number of subspaces of symplectic polar spaces whose rank ranges from 2 to 7. The most interesting new results include: (i) non-contextuality of configurations whose contexts are subspaces of dimension 2 and higher, (ii) non-existence of negative subspaces of dimension 3 and higher, (iii) considerably improved bounds for the contextuality degree of both elliptic and hyperbolic quadrics for rank 4, as well as for a particular subgeometry of the three-qubit space whose contexts are the lines of this space, (iv) proof for the non-contextuality of perpsets and, last but not least, (v) contextual nature of a distinguished subgeometry of a multi-qubit doily, called a two-spread, and computation of its contextuality degree. Finally, in the three-qubit polar space we correct and improve the contextuality degree of the full configuration and also describe finite geometric configurations formed by unsatisfiable/invalid constraints for both types of quadrics as well as for the geometry whose contexts are all 315 lines of the space.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonicity of Schrijver graphs and stable Kneser graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For integers $k\geq 1$ and $n\geq 2k+1$, the Schrijver graph $S(n,k)$ has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of $[n]:=\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$ that contain no two cyclically adjacent elements, and an edge between any two disjoint sets. More generally, for integers $k\geq 1$, $s\geq 2$, and $n \geq sk+1$, the $s$-stable Kneser graph $S(n,k,s)$ has as vertices all $k$-element subsets of $[n]$ in which any two elements are in cyclical distance at least $s$. We prove that all the graphs $S(n,k,s)$, in particular Schrijver graphs $S(n,k)=S(n,k,2)$, admit a Hamilton cycle that can be computed in time $\mathcal{O}(n)$ per generated vertex.</description>
