      <title>Glow in a stream of charged particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The results of an experiment with a generator of a stream of charged drops are reported. The glow of subjects placed in the stream is observed. The volume of the glowing region reaches 20 cm3 at a current less than 20 {\mu}A through the object. Ideas are expressed concerning the connection between St.Elmo fire and the observed glow.</description>

      <title>Heavy-flavored meson spectrum under the action of external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, the Schr{\"o}dinger equation in a magnetic field is utilized to study the effect of the magnetic field on $B$ mesons. The mass spetrum of $B$ mesons are numerically calculated for different magnetic field strengths by solving the Schr{\"o}dinger equation under the non-relativistic Cornell potential model, incorporating the Zeeman effect and the harmonic oscillator basis vector expansion method. The external magnetic field is assumed to be sufficiently strong in the calculations, so that the spin-orbit interaction energies can be omitted in comparison with the energies induced by the field. The Zeeman term in the Schr{\"o}dinger equation is taken to be $ \frac{eB_s}{2m_ec}(m\pm1)$ where $m=0, \pm1$. The results demonstrate Zeeman splitting of energy levels in the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Physical uniqueness of the definitions of the Cartesian photon position operator leading to electric and magnetic strings eigenstates of the photon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12125v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper provides three main definitions of the Cartesian photon position operator based on: boost generator, the transversality condition and the helicity operator. In each case, the correctness of the definition and Hermitianness of the operator in the domain of physical states are proven. All considered definitions lead to the same form of the Cartesian position operator in the domain of physical states. Radial photon position operators were also defined, but they turned out to be non-equivalent. Nevertheless, the most useful two radial operators turned out to be twin counterparts in the sense of the transformation to the helical representation, which is an alternative positional representation. The components of the photon position operator do not commute, but in analogy to the problem of eigenangular momentum, its eigenstates do exist.
  The eigenstates of the two components of the position operator (including the radial component) are called photon strings. Photon strings on a straight line and on a circle have been studied. The usual, previously known photon string states were named electric strings, but new magnetic strings were also introduced. Exact helical photon strings on a straight line, as well as hybrid helical photon strings on a circle, were also considered. On the other hand, infinitely short photon magnetic strings turned out to be flat photon vortices on planes with a normalization formula looks like as point-localized particles.</description>

      <title>Causality in the maximally extended Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m spacetime with identifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03786v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The maximally extended Reissner--Nordstr\"{o}m (RN) spacetime with $e^2 &lt; m^2$ can be interpreted either as an infinite chain of asymptotically flat regions connected by tunnels between timelike singularities or as a set of just one pair of asymptotically flat regions and one tunnel; the repetitions of this set in the infinite chain being identified. The second interpretation gives rise to the suspicion of acausality, i.e. the possibility of sending messages to one's own past. A numerical investigation of this problem was carried out in this paper and gave the following result. Let E be the initial point of a radial timelike future-directed ingoing geodesic G, lying halfway between the outer horizon and the image of the null infinity in the maximally extended RN spacetime. Let E$'$ be the first future copy of E. It was verified whether the turning point of G lies outside or inside the past light cone (PLC) of E$'$. In the second case the breach of causality does occur. It turned out that the acausality is present when $V_E$, the timelike coordinate of E, is negative with a sufficiently large $|V_E|$, and is absent with a sufficiently large $V_E &gt; 0$. In between these values there exists a $\widetilde{V}_E$, dependent on the initial data for the geodesic, for which the turning point lies on the PLC. So, the identification does lead to acausality. Nonradial timelike and null geodesics were also investigated, and a few hitherto unknown properties of the maximal extension were revealed. For example, the singularity arc at $r = 0$ may be convex or concave, depending on the values of $m$ and $e$.</description>

      <title>Covariance in Fractional Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18150v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on the requirement of covariance, we propose a new approach for generalizing fractional calculus in multi-dimensional space. As a first application we calculate an approximation for the ground state energy of the fractional 2-dimensional harmonic oscillator using the Ritz variational principle.</description>
