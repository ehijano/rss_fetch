      <title>On Merton's Optimal Portfolio Problem under Sporadic Bankruptcy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a stock market following a geometric Brownian motion and a riskless asset continuously compounded at a constant rate. Assuming the stock can go bankrupt, i.e., lose all of its value, at some exogenous random time (independent of the stock price) modeled as the first arrival time of a homogeneous Poisson process, we study the Merton's optimal portfolio problem consisting of maximizing the expected logarithmic utility of the total wealth at a preselected finite maturity time. First, we present a heuristic derivation based on a new type of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. Then, we formally reduce the problem to a classical controlled Markovian diffusion with a new type of terminal and running costs. A new version of Merton's ratio is rigorously derived using Bellman's dynamic programming principle and validated with a suitable type of verification theorem. A real-world example comparing the latter ratio to the classical Merton's ratio is given.</description>

      <title>Rank-Dependent Predictable Forward Performance Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictable forward performance processes (PFPPs) are stochastic optimal control frameworks for an agent who controls a randomly evolving system but can only prescribe the system dynamics for a short period ahead. This is a common scenario in which a controlling agent frequently re-calibrates her model. We introduce a new class of PFPPs based on rank-dependent utility, generalizing existing models that are based on expected utility theory (EUT). We establish existence of rank-dependent PFPPs under a conditionally complete market and exogenous probability distortion functions which are updated periodically. We show that their construction reduces to solving an integral equation that generalizes the integral equation obtained under EUT in previous studies. We then propose a new approach for solving the integral equation via theory of Volterra equations. We illustrate our result in the special case of conditionally complete Black-Scholes model.</description>

      <title>Markovian projections for It\^o semimartingales with jumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a general It\^o semimartingale, its Markovian projection is an It\^o process, with Markovian differential characteristics, that matches the one-dimensional marginal laws of the original process. We construct Markovian projections for It\^o semimartingales with jumps, whose flows of one-dimensional marginal laws are solutions to non-local Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equations (FPKEs). As an application, we show how Markovian projections appear in building calibrated diffusion/jump models with both local and stochastic features.</description>

      <title>Crypto Inverse-Power Options and Fractional Stochastic Volatility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent empirical evidence has highlighted the crucial role of jumps in both price and volatility within the cryptocurrency market. In this paper, we introduce an analytical model framework featuring fractional stochastic volatility, accommodating price--volatility co-jumps and volatility short-term dependency concurrently. We particularly focus on inverse options, including the emerging Quanto inverse options and their power-type generalizations, aimed at mitigating cryptocurrency exchange rate risk and adjusting inherent risk exposure. Characteristic function-based pricing--hedging formulas are derived for these inverse options. The general model framework is then applied to asymmetric Laplace jump-diffusions and Gaussian-mixed tempered stable-type processes, employing three types of fractional kernels, for an extensive empirical analysis involving model calibration on two independent Bitcoin options data sets, during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Key insights from our theoretical analysis and empirical findings include: (1) the superior performance of fractional stochastic-volatility models compared to various benchmark models, including those incorporating jumps and stochastic volatility, (2) the practical necessity of jumps in both price and volatility, along with their co-jumps and rough volatility, in the cryptocurrency market, (3) stability of calibrated parameter values in line with stylized facts, and (4) the suggestion that a piecewise kernel offers much higher computational efficiency relative to the commonly used Riemann--Liouville kernel in constructing fractional models, yet maintaining the same accuracy level, thanks to its potential for obtaining explicit model characteristic functions.</description>

      <title>Analytical valuation of vulnerable derivative claims with bilateral cash flows under credit, funding and wrong-way risk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.10568v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of valuing and hedging a vulnerable derivative claim with bilateral cash flows between two counterparties in the presence of asymmetric funding costs, defaults and wrong way risk (WWR). We characterize the pre-default claim value as the solution to a non-linear Cauchy problem. We show an explicit stochastic representation of the solution exists under a funding policy which linearises the Cauchy PDE. We apply this framework to the valuation of a vulnerable equity forward and show it can be represented as a portfolio of European options. Despite the complexity of the model, we prove the forward's value admits an analytical formula involving only elementary functions and Gaussian integrals. Based on this explicit formula, numerical analysis demonstrates WWR has a significant impact even under benign assumptions: with a parameter configuration less punitive than that representative of Archegos AM default, we find WWR can shift values for vulnerable forwards by 100bps of notional, while peak exposures increase by 25% of notional. This framework is the first to apply to contracts with bilateral cash flows in the presence of credit, funding and WWR, resulting in a non-linear valuation formula which admits a closed-form solution under a suitable funding policy.</description>
