      <title>Measurement-induced phase transition in periodically driven free-fermionic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that continuous monitoring of a free-fermionic system leads to a steady state entanglement transition from a logarithmically entangled critical to the area law phase. While unitary evolution tends to grow the entanglement, continuous monitoring opposes this growth and results in the pinning of the wavefunction trajectories to the eigenstate of the measurement operators. In this work, we study the fate of this measurement-induced phase transition in a periodically driven free-fermionic quantum system, where the hopping amplitude is varied periodically in time. We show, in the high-frequency limit, that a renormalization group analysis of the non-Hermitian quantum sine-Gordon model [as proposed in (Phys. Rev. X 11, 041004 (2021))] reveals a gapless critical phase with logarithmic entanglement entropy growth and a gapped area-law phase, separated by a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, which is in excellent agreement with our numerical results. Further, the numerical evidence suggests that such BKT transition also prevails in the low-frequency regime, and decreasing frequency tends to favor the critical phase. Strikingly, we also find that if the hopping amplitude is varied completely symmetrically around zero in the form of square-pulse and sinusoidal drive, the BKT transition is absent in the thermodynamic limit, and the system always favors the area-law phase, independent of the frequency regime.</description>

      <title>Structure of Quantum Mean Force Gibbs States for Coupled Harmonic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An open quantum system interacting with a heat bath at given temperature is expected to reach the mean force Gibbs (MFG) state as a steady state. The MFG state is given by tracing out the bath degrees of freedom from the equilibrium Gibbs state of the total system plus bath. When the interaction between the system and the bath is not negligible, it is different from the usual system Gibbs state obtained from the system Hamiltonian only. Using the path integral method, we present the exact MFG state for a coupled system of quantum harmonic oscillators in contact with multiple thermal baths at the same temperature. We develop a nonperturbative method to calculate the covariances with respect to the MFG state. By comparing them with those obtained from the system Gibbs state, we find that the effect of coupling to the bath decays exponentially as a function of the distance from the system-bath boundary. This is similar to the skin effect found recently for a quantum spin chain interacting with an environment. Using the exact results, we also investigate the ultrastrong coupling limit where the coupling between the system and the bath gets arbitrarily large and make a connection with the recent result found for a general quantum system.</description>

      <title>Dynamical renormalization group analysis of $O(n)$ model in steady shear flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of the $O(n)$ model under steady shear flow using a dynamical renormalization group (RG) method. Incorporating the strong anisotropy in scaling ansatz, which has been neglected in earlier RG analyses, we identify a new stable Gaussian fixed point. This fixed point reproduces the anisotropic scaling of static and dynamical critical exponents for both non-conserved (Model A) and conserved (Model B) order parameters. Notably, the upper critical dimensions are $d_{\text{up}} = 2$ for the non-conserved order parameter (Model A) and $d_{\text{up}} = 0$ for the conserved order parameter (Model B), implying that the mean-field critical exponents are observed even in both $d=2$ and $3$ dimensions. Furthermore, the scaling exponent of the order parameter is negative for all dimensions $d \geq 2$, indicating that shear flow stabilizes the long-range order associated with continuous symmetry breaking even in $d = 2$. In other words, the lower critical dimensions are $d_{\rm low} &lt; 2$ for both types of order parameters. This contrasts with equilibrium systems, where the Hohenberg -- Mermin -- Wagner theorem prohibits continuous symmetry breaking in $d = 2$.</description>

      <title>Large Deviations Principle for the Fluctuating Boltzmann Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Boltzmann equation is one of the most famous equations and has vast applications in modern science. In the current study, we take the randomness of binary collisions into consideration and generalize the classical Boltzmann equation into a stochastic framework. The corresponding Kolmogorov forward equations and Liouville equation in either discrete or continuous time and state space are derived respectively, whose characteristic line gives the Boltzmann equation as a consequence of the law of large numbers. Then the large deviations principle for these equations is established, which not only explains the probabilistic origin of the H-theorem in the Boltzmann equation, but also provides a natural way to incorporate the Boltzmann equation into a broader Hamiltonian structure. The so-called Hamilton-Boltzmann equation enjoys many significant merits, like time reversibility, the conservation laws of mass, momentum and energy, Maxwellian-Boltzmann distribution as the equilibrium solution, etc. We also present results under the diffusive limit in parallel. Finally, the macroscopic hydrodynamic models including 13 moments are derived with respect to our Hamilton-Boltzmann equation under the BGK approximation. We expect our study can inspire new insights into the classical Boltzmann equation from either the stochastic aspect or a Hamiltonian view.</description>

      <title>Susceptibility of entanglement entropy: a universal indicator of quantum criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A measure of how sensitive the entanglement entropy is in a quantum system, has been proposed and its information geometric origin is discussed. It has been demonstrated for two exactly solvable spin systems, that thermodynamic criticality is directly \textit{indicated} by finite size scaling of the global maxima and turning points of the susceptibility of entanglement entropy through numerical analysis - obtaining power laws. Analytically we have proved those power laws for $| \ \lambda_c(N)-\lambda_c^{\infty}|$ as $N\to \infty$ in the cases of finite 1D transverse field ising model (TFIM) ($\lambda=h$) and XY chain ($\lambda=\gamma$). The integer power law appearing for XY model has been verified using perturbation theory in $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{N})$ and the fractional power law appearing in the case of TFIM, is verified by an exact approach involving Chebyshev polynomials, hypergeometric functions and complete elliptic integrals. Furthermore a set of potential applications of this quantity under quantum dynamics and also for non-integrable systems, are briefly discussed. The simplicity of this setup for understanding quantum criticality is emphasized as it takes in only the reduced density matrix of appropriate rank.</description>

      <title>Dynamical large deviations of the fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fractional Ornstein-Uhleneck (fOU) process is described by the overdamped Langevin equation $\dot{x}(t)+\gamma x=\sqrt{2 D}\xi(t)$, where $\xi(t)$ is the fractional Gaussian noise with the Hurst exponent $0&lt;H&lt;1$. For $H\neq 1/2$ the fOU process is non-Markovian but Gaussian, and it has either vanishing (for $H&lt;1/2$), or divergent (for $H&gt;1/2$) spectral density at zero frequency. For $H&gt;1/2$, the fOU is long-correlated. Here we study dynamical large deviations of the fOU process and focus on the area $A_n=\int_{-T}^{T} x^n(t) dt$, $n=1,2,\ldots$ over a long time window $2T$. Employing the optimal fluctuation method, we determine the optimal path of the conditioned process, which dominates the large-$A_n$ tail of the probability distribution of the area, $\mathcal{P}(A_n,T)\sim \exp[-S(A_n,T)]$. We uncover a nontrivial phase diagram of scaling behaviors of the optimal paths and of the action $S(A_n\equiv 2 a_n T,T)\sim T^{\alpha(H,n)} a^{2/n}_n$ on the $(H,n)$ plane. The phase diagram includes three regions: (i) $H&gt;1-1/n$, where $\alpha(H,n)=2-2H$, and the optimal paths are delocalized, (ii) $n=2$ and $H\leq \frac{1}{2}$, where $\alpha(H,n)=1$, and the optimal paths oscillate with an $H$-dependent frequency, and (iii) $H\leq 1-1/n$ and $n&gt;2$, where $\alpha(H,n)=2/n$, and the optimal paths are strongly localized. We verify our theoretical predictions in large-deviation simulations of the fOU process. By combining the Wang-Landau Monte-Carlo algorithm with the circulant embedding method of generation of stationary Gaussian fields, we were able to measure probability densities as small as $10^{-170}$. We also generalize our findings to other stationary Gaussian processes with either diverging, or vanishing spectral density at zero frequency.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior and phases of nonlinear sigma model on real Stiefel manifolds near two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a quasi-two-dimensional nonlinear sigma model on the real Stiefel manifolds with a generalized (anisotropic) metric, the equations of a two-charge renormalization group (RG) for the homothety and anisotropy of the metric as effective couplings are obtained in one-loop approximation. Normal coordinates and the curvature tensor are exploited for the renormalization of the metric. The RG trajectories are investigated and the presence of a fixed point common to four critical lines or four phases (tetracritical point) in the general case, or its absence in the case of Abelian structure 8group, is established.</description>

      <title>Emergent complex phases in a discrete flocking model with reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have undertaken a comprehensive study of the two-species active Ising model (TSAIM), a discrete-symmetry counterpart of the continuous-symmetry two-species Vicsek model [Phys. Rev. E 107, 024607 (2023)], motivated by recent interest in the impact of complex and heterogeneous interactions on active matter systems. In the TSAIM, two species of self-propelled particles undergo biased diffusion in two dimensions, interacting via local alignment/anti-alignment. Our investigation explores both reciprocal and non-reciprocal interactions between the two species, along with the possibility of species interconversion. In the reciprocal TSAIM, we observe a liquid-gas phase transition, exhibiting macrophase-separated bands, and the emergence of a high-density parallel flocking state, a feature not seen in previous flocking models. With species interconversion (species-flip dynamics), the TSAIM corresponds to an active extension of the Ashkin-Teller model and exhibits a broader range of steady-state phases, including microphase-separated bands that further enrich the coexistence region. In the non-reciprocal TSAIM, a novel run-and-chase dynamics emerges. We also find that the system is metastable due to droplet excitation and exhibits spontaneous motility-induced interface pinning, preventing the system from reaching long-range order at sufficiently low noise. A hydrodynamic theory complements our computer simulations of the microscopic model and confirms the reported phase diagrams.</description>

      <title>General Resetting Theory for Group Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a general theoretical framework for group resetting dynamics in multi-agent systems in a drift potential. This setup contrasts with a typical resetting problem that involves a single searcher looking for a target, with resetting traditionally studied to optimize the search time to a target. More recently, resetting has also been used as a regulatory mechanism to avoid adverse outcomes, such as preventing critically high water levels in dams or deleveraging financial portfolios. Here, we extend current resetting theories to group dynamics, with applications ranging from bacterial evolution under antibiotic pressure to multiple-searcher optimization algorithms. Our framework incorporates extreme value statistics and renewal theory, from which we derive a master equation for the center of mass distribution of a group of searchers. This master equation allows us to calculate essential observables analytically. For example, how the group's average position depends on group size, resetting rates, drift potential strength, and diffusion constants. This theoretical approach offers a new perspective on optimizing group search and regulatory mechanisms through resetting.</description>

      <title>Perspective: Time irreversibility in systems observed at coarse resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A broken time-reversal symmetry, i.e. broken detailed balance, is central to non-equilibrium physics and is a prerequisite for life. However, it turns out to be quite challenging to unambiguously define and quantify time-reversal symmetry (and violations thereof) in practice, that is, from observations. Measurements on complex systems have a finite resolution and generally probe low-dimensional projections of the underlying dynamics, which are well known to introduce memory. In situations where many microscopic states become "lumped" onto the same observable "state" or when introducing "reaction coordinates" to reduce the dimensionality of data, signatures of a broken time-reversal symmetry in the microscopic dynamics become distorted or masked. In this perspective we highlight why in defining and discussing time-reversal symmetry, and quantifying its violations, the precise underlying assumptions on the microscopic dynamics, the coarse graining, and further reductions, are not a technical detail. These assumptions decide whether the conclusions that are drawn are physically sound or inconsistent. We summarize recent findings in the field and reflect upon key challenges.</description>

      <title>Anomalous enhancement of Neel order in the $S = 1/2$ square lattice Heisenberg model under fictitious magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fictitious magnetic fields can be introduced in quantum magnets by the strain engineering and the Aharonov-Casher effect. Here, we study impacts of a uniform fictitious magnetic field and corresponding Landau quantization on the Neel order in the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice as a prototypical system of quantum magnets. We first analyze the system by using the spin-wave approximation. It is found that the staggered magnetization is enhanced by the fictitious magnetic field and it shows a simple scaling behavior with respect to the magnetic length, in contrast to a naive expectation based on the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We also perform density matrix renormalization group calculations to fully take quantum effects into account and obtain quantitatively more accurate results. The enhancement is found to be anomalously strong and it shows a non-trivial scaling behavior or a fluctuation induced discontinuity. These results are beyond the well known understanding of correlated systems under magnetic fields called the magnetic catalysis.</description>

      <title>The connection between non-normality and trophic coherence in directed graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trophic coherence and non-normality are both ways of describing the overall directionality of directed graphs, or networks. Trophic coherence can be regarded as a measure of how neatly a graph can be divided into distinct layers, whereas non-normality is a measure of how unlike a matrix is with its transpose. We explore the relationship between trophic coherence and non-normality by first considering the connections that exist in the literature and calculating the trophic coherence and non-normality for some toy networks. We then explore how persistence of an epidemic in an SIS model depends on coherence, and how this relates to the non-normality. A similar effect on dynamics governed by a linear operator suggests that it may be useful to extend the concept of trophic coherence to matrices which do not necessarily represent graphs.</description>

      <title>Contractive Unitary and Classical Shadow Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid development of quantum technology demands efficient characterization of complex quantum many-body states. However, full quantum state tomography requires an exponential number of measurements in system size, preventing its practical use in large-scale quantum devices. A major recent breakthrough in this direction, called classical shadow tomography, significantly reduces the sample complexity, the number of samples needed to estimate properties of a state, by implementing random Clifford rotations before measurements. Despite many recent efforts, reducing the sample complexity below $\mathbf{2^k}$ for extracting any non-successive local operators with a size $\sim \mathbf{k}$ remains a challenge. In this work, we achieve a significantly smaller sample complexity of $\mathbf{\sim 1.8^k}$ using a protocol that hybridizes locally random and globally deterministic unitary operations. The key insight is the discovery of a deterministic global unitary, termed as \textit{contractive unitary}, which is more efficient in reducing the operator size to enhance tomography efficiency. The contractive unitary perfectly matches the advantages of the atom array quantum computation platform and is readily realized in the atom array quantum processor. More importantly, it highlights a new strategy in classical shadow tomography, demonstrating that a random-deterministic hybridized protocol can be more efficient than fully random measurements.</description>

      <title>Generalized Loschmidt echo and information scrambling in open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information scrambling, typically explored in closed quantum systems, describes the spread of initially localized information throughout a system and can be quantified by measures such as the Loschmidt echo (LE) and out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). In this paper, we explore information scrambling in the presence of dissipation by generalizing the concepts of LE and OTOC to open quantum systems governed by Lindblad dynamics. We investigate the universal dynamics of the generalized LE across regimes of weak and strong dissipation. In the weak dissipation regime, we identify a universal structure, while in the strong dissipation regime, we observe a distinctive two-local-minima structure, which we interpret through an analysis of the Lindblad spectrum. Furthermore, we establish connections between the thermal averages of LE and OTOC and prove a general relation between OTOC and R\'enyi entropy in open systems. Finally, we propose an experimental protocol for measuring OTOC in open systems. These findings provide deeper insights into information scrambling under dissipation and pave the way for experimental studies in open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Matchgate circuits deeply thermalize</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the ensemble of states generated by performing projective measurements on the output of a random matchgate (or free-fermionic) quantum circuit. We rigorously show that this `projected ensemble' exhibits deep thermalization: For large system sizes, it converges towards a universal ensemble that is uniform over the manifold of Gaussian fermionic states. As well as proving moment-wise convergence of these ensembles, we demonstrate that the full distribution of any physical observable in the projected ensemble is close to its universal form in Wasserstein-1 distance, which we argue is an appropriate and efficiently computable measure of convergence when studying deep thermalization. Using this metric, we also numerically find that local matchgate circuits deeply thermalize after a timescale $t \sim L^2$ set by the diffusive spreading of quantum information. Our work opens up new avenues to experimentally accessible protocols to probe the emergence of quantum statistical mechanics and benchmark quantum simulators.</description>

      <title>Accuracy of time-dependent GGE under weak dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unitary integrable models typically relax to a stationary Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), but in experimental realizations dissipation often breaks integrability. In this work, we use the recently introduced time-dependent GGE (t-GGE) approach to describe the open dynamics of a gas of bosons subject to atom losses and gains. We employ tensor network methods to provide numerical evidence of the exactness of the t-GGE in the limit of adiabatic dissipation, and of its accuracy in the regime of weak but finite dissipation. That accuracy is tested for two-point functions via the rapidity distribution, and for more complicated correlations through a non-Gaussianity measure. We combine this description with Generalized Hydrodynamics and we show that it correctly captures transport at the Euler scale. Our results demonstrate that the t-GGE approach is robust in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous settings.</description>

      <title>Iterative variational learning of committor-consistent transition pathways using artificial neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This contribution introduces a neural-network-based approach to discover meaningful transition pathways underlying complex biomolecular transformations in coherence with the committor function. The proposed path-committor-consistent artificial neural network (PCCANN) iteratively refines the transition pathway by aligning it to the gradient of the committor. This method addresses the challenges of sampling in molecular dynamics simulations rare events in high-dimensional spaces, which is often limited computationally. Applied to various benchmark potentials and biological processes such as peptide isomerization and protein-model folding, PCCANN successfully reproduces established dynamics and rate constants, while revealing bifurcations and alternate pathways. By enabling precise estimation of transition states and free-energy barriers, this approach provides a robust framework for enhanced-sampling simulations of rare events in complex biomolecular systems.</description>

      <title>A unified framework of unitarily residual measures for quantifying dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open quantum systems are governed by both unitary and non-unitary dynamics, with dissipation arising from the latter. Traditional quantum divergence measures, such as quantum relative entropy, fail to account for the non-unitary oriented dissipation as the divergence is positive even between unitarily connected states. We introduce a framework for quantifying the dissipation by isolating the non-unitary components of quantum dynamics. We define equivalence relations among hermitian operators through unitary transformations and characterize the resulting quotient set. By establishing an isomorphism between this quotient set and a set of real vectors with ordered components, we induce divergence measures that are invariant under unitary evolution, which we refer to as the unitarily residual measures. These unitarily residual measures inherit properties such as monotonicity and convexity and, in certain cases, correspond to classical information divergences between sorted eigenvalue distributions. Our results provide a powerful tool for quantifying dissipation in open quantum systems, advancing the understanding of quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Heat differentiated by projection from particles' trajectories onto the particle number-density field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03983v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many particles suspended in a solution have two analogous but distinct stochastic descriptions based on particle-tracking or on the number-density field. This article investigates the spatiotemporally discrete or continuous stochastic models, where we focus on differences in heat naturally defined between the particle-tracking and the number-density field. Both of the discrete and continuous descriptions are found to generally make the heat differences by the ideal-gas-like entropic term as a function of the number density though spatial projection from the particles' position onto the number-density field. The transformation from the Langevin to Dean--Kawasaki eqs. is considered as the projection in the continuous descriptions, which generally finds the heat differences formulated by the entropic term, but the emergent differences undergoes little temporal variations due to the sparse distributions of the point-particles. On the other hand, the analogous formalisms constructed in the discrete models may exhibit the explicit temporal evolutions of the entropic term. Notably, spatiotemporal resolutions are not altered in all the above projections. Furthermore, we develop arguments about the interpretation and applicability of the heat differences as well as the perspectives to many-polymer system.</description>

      <title>Solitary cluster waves in periodic potentials: Formation, propagation, and soliton-mediated particle transport</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17469v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transport processes in crowded periodic structures are often mediated by cooperative movements of particles forming clusters. Recent theoretical and experimental studies of driven Brownian motion of hard spheres showed that cluster-mediated transport in one-dimensional periodic potentials can proceed in form of solitary waves. We here give a comprehensive description of these solitons. Fundamental for our analysis is a static presoliton state, which is formed by a periodic arrangement of basic stable clusters. Their size follows from a geometric principle of minimum free space. Adding one particle to the presoliton state gives rise to solitons. We derive the minimal number of particles needed for soliton formation, number of solitons at larger particle numbers, soliton velocities and soliton-mediated particle currents. Incomplete relaxations of the basic clusters are responsible for an effective repulsive soliton-soliton interaction seen in measurements. A dynamical phase transition is predicted to occur in current-density relations at low temperatures. Our results provide a theoretical basis for describing experiments on cluster-mediated particle transport in periodic potentials.</description>

      <title>Current fluctuations in the symmetric zero-range process below and at critical density</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01346v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Characterizing current fluctuations in a steady state is of fundamental interest and has attracted considerable attention in the recent past. However, the bulk of the studies are limited to systems that either do not exhibit a phase transition or are far from criticality. Here we consider a symmetric zero-range process on a ring that is known to show a phase transition in the steady state. We analytically calculate two density-dependent transport coefficients, namely, the bulk-diffusion coefficient and the particle mobility, that characterize the first two cumulants of the time-integrated current. We show that on the hydrodynamic scale, away from the critical point, the variance of the time-integrated current in the steady state grows with time $t$ as $\sqrt{t}$ and $t$ at short and long times, respectively. Moreover, we find an expression of the full scaling function for the variance of the time-integrated current and thereby the amplitude of the temporal growth of the current fluctuations. At the critical point, using a scaling theory, we find that, while the above-mentioned long-time scaling of the variance of the cumulative current continues to hold, the short-time behavior is anomalous in that the growth exponent is larger than one-half and varies continuously with the model parameters.</description>

      <title>Neural Thermodynamic Integration: Free Energies from Energy-based Diffusion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02313v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Thermodynamic integration (TI) offers a rigorous method for estimating free-energy differences by integrating over a sequence of interpolating conformational ensembles. However, TI calculations are computationally expensive and typically limited to coupling a small number of degrees of freedom due to the need to sample numerous intermediate ensembles with sufficient conformational-space overlap. In this work, we propose to perform TI along an alchemical pathway represented by a trainable neural network, which we term Neural TI. Critically, we parametrize a time-dependent Hamiltonian interpolating between the interacting and non-interacting systems, and optimize its gradient using a score matching objective. The ability of the resulting energy-based diffusion model to sample all intermediate ensembles allows us to perform TI from a single reference calculation. We apply our method to Lennard-Jones fluids, where we report accurate calculations of the excess chemical potential, demonstrating that Neural TI reproduces the underlying changes in free energy without the need for simulations at interpolating Hamiltonians.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.05507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many physical, biological, and even social systems are faced with the problem of how to efficiently harvest free energy from an environment that can have many possible states, yet only have a limited number of harvesting protocols to choose among. We investigate this scenario by extending earlier work on using feedback control to extract work from nonequilibirum systems. Specifically, in contrast to that previous work on the thermodynamics of feedback control, we analyze the combined and separate effects of noisy measurements, memory limitations, and limitations on the number of possible work extraction protocols. Our analysis provides a general recipe to construct repertoires of allowed harvesting protocols that minimize the expected thermodynamic losses during free energy harvesting, i.e., that minimize expected entropy production. In particular, our results highlight that the benefits of feedback control over uninformed (random) actions extend beyond just the associated information gain, often by many orders of magnitude. Our results also uncover the effects of limitations on the number of possible harvesting protocols when there is uncertainty about the distribution over states of the environment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17041v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Under the widely accepted but unproven assumption that the one-dimensional S=1 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model has a unique gapped ground state, we prove that the model belongs to a nontrivial symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the model has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be precise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic field have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground state of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index. This further implies the presence of a gapless edge excitation in the model on the half-infinite chain and the existence of a topological phase transition in the model that interpolates between the Heisenberg chain and the trivial model.</description>

Abstract: Percolation processes on random networks have been the subject of intense research activity over the last decades: the overall phenomenology of standard percolation on uncorrelated and unclustered topologies is well known. Still some critical properties of the transition, in particular for heterogeneous substrates, have not been fully elucidated and contradictory results appear in the literature. In this paper we present, by means of a generating functions approach, a thorough and complete investigation of percolation critical properties in random networks. We determine all critical exponents, the associated critical amplitude ratios and the form of the cluster size distribution for networks of any level of heterogeneity. We uncover, in particular for highly heterogeneous networks, subtle crossover phenomena, nontrivial scaling forms and violations of hyperscaling. In this way we clarify the origin of inconsistencies in the previous literature.</description>

      <title>Divergence asymmetry and connected components in a general duplication-divergence graph model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16943v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter introduces a generalization of known duplication-divergence models for growing random graphs. This general duplication-divergence model includes a new coupled divergence asymmetry rate, which allows to obtain the structure of random growing networks by duplication-divergence in a continuous range of configurations between two known limit cases (i) complete asymmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect only edges of either the original or the copy vertex, and (ii) symmetric divergence, i.e., divergence rates affect equiprobably both the original and the copy vertex. Multiple connected sub-graphs (of order greater than one) (of order greater than one) emerge as the divergence asymmetry rate slightly moves from the complete asymmetric divergence case. Mean-field results of priorly published models are nicely reproduced by this generalization. In special cases, the connected components size distribution $C_s$ suggests a power-law scaling of the form $C_s \sim s^{-\lambda}$ for $s&gt;1$, e.g., with $\lambda \approx 5/3$ for divergence rate $\delta \approx 0.7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2110.00585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that locally-interacting, periodically-driven (Floquet) Hamiltonian dynamics coupled to a Langevin bath support finite-temperature discrete time crystals (DTC) with an infinite auto-correlation time. By contrast to both prethermal and many-body localized DTCs, the time crystalline order we uncover is stable to arbitrary perturbations, including those that break the time translation symmetry of the underlying drive. Our approach utilizes a general mapping from probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) to open classical Floquet systems undergoing continuous-time Langevin dynamics. Applying this mapping to a variant of the Toom cellular automata, which we dub the ''$\pi$-Toom time crystal'', leads to a 2D Floquet Hamiltonian with a finite-temperature DTC phase transition. We provide numerical evidence for the existence of this transition, and analyze the statistics of the finite temperature fluctuations. Finally, we discuss how general results from the field of probabilistic cellular automata imply the existence of discrete time crystals (with an infinite auto-correlation time) in all dimensions, $d \geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Few-to-many-particle crossover of pair excitations in a superfluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2208.03762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent advances in the creation of few-body atomic Fermi gases with attractive interactions, we study theoretically the few-to-many-particle crossover of pair excitations, which for large particle numbers evolve into a mode that describes amplitude fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter (the "Higgs" mode). Our analysis is based on the hypothesis that salient aspects of the excitation spectrum are captured by interactions between time-reversed pair states in a harmonic oscillator potential. Microscopically, this assumption leads to a Richardson-type pairing model, which is integrable and thus allows a systematic quantitative study of the few-to-many-particle crossover with only minor numerical effort. We first establish a parity effect in the ground-state energy, i.e., a spectral convexity in the energy of open-shell configurations compared to their closed-shell neighbors, which is quantified by a so-called Matveev-Larkin parameter discussed for mesoscopic superconductors, which generalizes the pairing gap to mesoscopic ensembles and which behaves quantitatively differently in a few-body and a many-body regime. The crossover point for this quantity is widely tunable as a function of interaction strength. We then compute the excitation spectrum and demonstrate that the pair excitation energy shows a minimum that deepens with increasing particle number and shifts to smaller interaction strengths, consistent with the finite-size precursor of a quantum phase transition to a superfluid state. We extract a critical finite-size scaling exponent that characterizes the decrease of the gap with increasing particle number.</description>

      <title>A unified-field theory of genome organization and gene regulation</title>

Abstract: Our aim is to predict how often genic and non-genic promoters fire within a cell. We first review a parsimonious pan-genomic model for genome organization and gene regulation, where transcription rate is determined by proximity in 3D space of promoters to clusters containing appropriate factors and RNA polymerases -- structures variously called transcription factories, hubs, and condensates. This model allows reconciliation of conflicting results indicating that regulatory mammalian networks are both simple (as over-expressing just 4 transcription factors switches cell state) and complex (as genome-wide association studies show phenotypes like cell type are determined by thousands of loci rarely encoding such factors). It also yields simple explanations of how mysterious motifs like quantitative trait loci, enhancers, and silencers work. We then present 3D polymer simulations, and a proximity formula based on our biological model that enables prediction of transcriptional activities of all promoters in three human cell types. This simple fitting-free formula contains just one variable (distance on the genetic map to the nearest active promoter), and we suggest it can be applied to any organism.</description>

      <title>Analytic and numerical bootstrap for the long-range Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02742v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We combine perturbation theory with analytic and numerical bootstrap techniques to study the critical point of the long-range Ising (LRI) model in two and three dimensions. This model interpolates between short-range Ising (SRI) and mean-field behaviour. We use the Lorentzian inversion formula to compute infinitely many three-loop corrections in the two-dimensional LRI near the mean-field end. We further exploit the exact OPE relations that follow from bulk locality of the LRI to compute infinitely many two-loop corrections near the mean-field end, as well as some one-loop corrections near SRI. By including such exact OPE relations in the crossing equations for LRI we set up a very constrained bootstrap problem, which we solve numerically using SDPB. We find a family of sharp kinks for two- and three-dimensional theories which compare favourably to perturbative predictions, as well as some Monte Carlo simulations for the two-dimensional LRI.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue and pseudospectrum processes generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices with rank 1 perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on a time-dependent random matrix model called the non-Hermitian matrix-valued Brownian motion, we propose two kinds of dynamical processes of $n \times n$ matrices generated by nonnormal Toeplitz matrices. As a deterministic rank 1 perturbation, $\delta J$ is added at time $m \leq n$, where $\delta \in {\mathbb{C}}$ and $J$ is the all-ones matrix. For each process, first we report the complicated motion of the eigenvalues which are numerically calculated. Then we derive the specific equation which determines the motion of non-zero eigenvalues and clarifies the time-dependence of degeneracy of the zero-eigenvalue. The Catalan numbers play an important role to describe an outlier of non-zero eigenvalues. Comparison with the solutions of this equation, it is concluded that the numerically observed non-zero eigenvalues distributing around the zero-eigenvalue are not the exact eigenvalues of the original system but of the system perturbed by uncontrolled rounding errors of computer. This phenomenon implies the high sensitivity of the degenerated zero-eigenvalue to random dense perturbations. The domain in which the eigenvalues of randomly perturbed system are distributed is identified with the pseudospectrum including the zero-eigenvalue of the original system with $\delta J$. We characterize the pseudospectrum processes using the symbol curves of the corresponding nonnormal Toeplitz operators without $\delta J$. We report new phenomena in our second model such that at each time the outermost closed simple curve cut out from the symbol curve is realized as the exact eigenvalues, but the inner part of symbol curve is reduced in size and embedded in the pseudospectrum including the zero-eigenvalue. The asymptotics of the processes in the infinite-matrix limit $n \to \infty$ are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Scrambling Transition in Free Fermion Systems Induced by a Single Impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum many-body systems, interactions play a crucial role in the emergence of information scrambling. When particles interact throughout the system, the entanglement between them can lead to a rapid and chaotic spreading of quantum information, typically probed by the growth in operator size in the Heisenberg picture. In this study, we explore whether the operator undergoes scrambling when particles interact solely through a single impurity in generic spatial dimensions, focusing on fermion systems with spatial and temporal random hoppings. By connecting the dynamics of the operator to the symmetric exclusion process with a source term, we demonstrate the presence of an escape-to-scrambling transition when tuning the interaction strength for fermions in three dimensions. As a comparison, systems in lower dimensions are proven to scramble at arbitrarily weak interactions unless the hopping becomes sufficiently long-ranged. Our predictions are validated using both a Brownian circuit with a single Majorana fermion per site and a solvable Brownian SYK model with a large local Hilbert space dimension. This suggests the universality of the theoretical picture for free fermion systems with spatial and temporal randomness.</description>

      <title>Approximating many-body quantum states with quantum circuits and measurements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce protocols to prepare many-body quantum states with quantum circuits assisted by local operations and classical communication. We show that by lifting the requirement of exact preparation, one can substantially save resources. In particular, the so-called $W$ and, more generally, Dicke states require a circuit depth and number of ancillas per site that are independent of the system size. As a byproduct of our work, we introduce an efficient scheme to implement certain non-local, non-Clifford unitary operators. We also discuss how similar ideas may be applied in the preparation of eigenstates of well-known spin models, both free and interacting.</description>

      <title>Estimating Non-Stabilizerness Dynamics Without Simulating It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Iterative Clifford Circuit Renormalization (ICCR), a novel technique designed to efficiently handle the dynamics of non-stabilizerness (a.k.a. quantum magic) in generic quantum circuits. ICCR iteratively adjusts the starting circuit, transforming it into a Clifford circuit where all elements that can alter the non-stabilizerness, such as measurements or T gates, have been removed. In the process the initial state is renormalized in such a way that the new circuit outputs the same final state as the original one. This approach embeds the complex dynamics of non-stabilizerness in the flow of an effective initial state, enabling its efficient evaluation while avoiding the need for direct and computationally expensive simulation of the original circuit. The initial state renormalization can be computed explicitly using a matrix-product state approximation that can be systematically improved. We implement the ICCR algorithm to evaluate the non-stabilizerness dynamics for systems of size up to N = 1000. We validate our method by comparing it to tensor networks simulations. Finally, we employ the ICCR technique to study a magic purification circuit, where a measurement-induced transition is observed.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal Synchronization of Active Quantum Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03357v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Active agents are capable of exerting nonreciprocal forces upon one another. For instance, one agent, say $A$, may attract another agent $B$ while $B$ repels $A$. These antagonistic nonreciprocal interactions have been extensively studied in classical systems, revealing a wealth of exciting phenomena such as novel phase transitions and traveling-wave states. Whether these phenomena can originate in quantum many-body systems is an open issue, and proposals for their realization are lacking. In this work, we present a model of two species of quantum spins that interact in an antagonistic nonreciprocal way of the attraction-repulsion type. We propose an implementation based on two atomic ensembles coupled via chiral waveguides featuring both braided and non-braided geometries. The spins are active due to the presence of local gain, which allows them to synchronize. In the thermodynamic limit, we show that nonreciprocal interactions result in a nonreciprocal phase transition to time-crystalline traveling-wave states, associated with spontaneous breaking of parity-time symmetry. We establish how this symmetry emerges from the microscopic quantum model. For a finite number of spins, signatures of the time-crystal phase can still be identified by inspecting equal-time or two-time correlation functions. Remarkably, continuous monitoring of the output field of the waveguides induces a quantum traveling-wave state: a time-crystalline state of a finite-size quantum system, in which parity-time symmetry is spontaneously broken. Our work lays the foundation to explore nonreciprocal interactions in active quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Fundamentals on Dependence of Volume on Pressure and Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The common wisdom that volume decreases with pressure and increases with temperature is analyzed in terms of Hillert nonequilibrium thermodynamics in the present work. It is shown that the derivative of volume to pressure in a stable system is always negative, i.e., volume decreases with the increase of pressure, when all other natural variables of the system are kept constant. This originates from the stability requirement that the conjugate variables, such as volume and negative pressure, must change in the same direction in a stable system. Consequently, since volume and temperature are not conjugate variables, they do not have to change in the same direction and thus do change in opposite directions in both natural and man-made systems. It is shown that the decrease of volume with the increase of temperature, commonly referred as negative thermal expansion (NTE) in the literature, originates from the statistical competitions of configurations in the system when the volumes of metastable configurations are smaller than that of the ground-state configuration. It is demonstrated that the zentropy theory can concisely explain and accurately predict NTE based on the density functional theory without fitting parameters.</description>

      <title>Generalized Eigenspaces and Pseudospectra of Nonnormal and Defective Matrix-Valued Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06472v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider nonnormal matrix-valued dynamical systems with discrete time. For an eigenvalue of matrix, the number of times it appears as a root of the characteristic polynomial is called the algebraic multiplicity. On the other hand, the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the linear space of eigenvectors associated with that eigenvalue. If the former exceeds the latter, then the eigenvalue is said to be defective and the matrix becomes nondiagonalizable by any similarity transformation. The discrete-time of our dynamics is identified with the geometric multiplicity of the zero eigenvalue $\lambda_0=0$. Its algebraic multiplicity takes about half of the matrix size at $t=1$ and increases stepwise in time, which keeps excess to the geometric multiplicity until their coincidence at the final time. Our model exhibits relaxation processes from far-from-normal to near-normal matrices, in which the defectivity of $\lambda_0$ is recovering in time. We show that such processes are realized as size reductions of pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. Here the pseudospectra are the domains on the complex plane which are not necessarily exact spectra but in which the resolvent of matrix takes extremely large values. The defective eigenvalue $\lambda_0$ is sensitive to perturbation and the eigenvalues of the perturbed systems are distributed densely in the pseudospectrum including $\lambda_0$. By constructing generalized eigenspace for $\lambda_0$, we give the Jordan block decomposition for the resolvent of matrix and characterize the pseudospectrum dynamics. Numerical study of the systems perturbed by Gaussian random matrices supports the validity of the present analysis.</description>

      <title>Exact linearity of the macroscopic Hall current response in infinitely extended gapped fermion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider an infinitely extended system of fermions on a $d$-dimensional lattice with (magnetic) translation-invariant short-range interactions. We further assume that the system has a unique gapped ground state. Physically, this is a model for the bulk of a generic topological insulator at zero temperature, and we are interested in the current response of such a system to a constant external electric field. Using the non-equilibrium almost-stationary states (NEASS) approach, we prove that the longitudinal current density induced by a constant electric field of strength $\varepsilon$ is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, i.e. the system is an insulator in the usual sense. For the Hall current density we show instead that it is linear in $\varepsilon$ up to terms of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$. The proportionality factor $\sigma_\mathrm{H}$ is by definition the Hall conductivity, and we show that it is given by a generalization of the well known double commutator formula to interacting systems. As a by-product of our results, we find that the Hall conductivity is constant within gapped phases, and that for $d=2$ the relevant observable that "measures" the Hall conductivity in experiments, the Hall conductance, not only agrees with $\sigma_H$ in expectation up to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^\infty)$, but also has vanishing variance.
  A notable difference to several existing results on the current response in interacting fermion systems is that we consider a macroscopic system exposed to a small constant electric field, rather than to a small voltage drop.</description>

      <title>Bilayer construction for mixed state phenomena with strong, weak symmetries and symmetry breakings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the bilayer construction, as a specific purification scheme for a general mixed state, where each mixed state has a one-to-one correspondence with a bilayer pure state with two constraints: non-negativity of the bilayer wavefunction; and the presence of an anti-unitary layer-exchange symmetry T. Different from the Choi-Jamio{\l}kowski isomorphism, any mixed state can be realized as the monolayer reduced density matrix of a bilayer pure state, and its physical properties can be experimentally realized and detected in non-magnetic bilayer 2D materials with a layer-exchange mirror symmetry. We study a variety of mixed state phenomena in the bilayer construction: (1) strong and weak symmetries, their explicit and spontaneous breakings in mixed states can be understood as usual Landau-type symmetry breakings in the bilayer pure state, and their criteria can be derived accordingly; (2) decoherence of a pure state by local errors can be mapped to quantum quench dynamics of the bilayer pure states; (3) mixed symmetry protected topological (SPT) states and mixed state topological orders can be classified, characterized and realized as pure state SPTs and topological orders in the bilayer. We further study examples of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) and their critical scalings at the SWSSB transition in the bilayer construction.</description>

      <title>Efficient Eigenstate Preparation in an Integrable Model with Hilbert Space Fragmentation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15132v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the preparation of all the eigenstates of spin chains using quantum circuits. It is known that generic eigenstates of free-fermionic spin chains can be prepared with circuits whose depth grows only polynomially with the length of the chain and the number of particles. We show that the polynomial growth is also achievable for selected interacting models where the interaction between the particles is sufficiently simple. Our working example is the folded XXZ model, an integrable spin chain that exhibits Hilbert space fragmentation. We present the explicit quantum circuits that prepare arbitrary eigenstates of this model on an open chain efficiently. We perform error-mitigated noisy simulations with circuits of up to 13 qubits and different connectivities between qubits, achieving a relative error below 5%. As a byproduct, we extend a recent reformulation of the Bethe ansatz as a quantum circuit from closed to open boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Breaking Mechanical Holography in Combinatorial Metamaterials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Combinatorial mechanical metamaterials are made of anisotropic, flexible blocks, such that multiple metamaterials may be constructed using a single block type, and the system's response strongly depends on the mutual orientations of the blocks within the lattice. We study a family of possible block types for the square, honeycomb, and cubic lattices. Blocks that are centrally symmetric induce holographic order, such that mechanical compatibility (meaning that blocks do not impede each other's motion) implies bulk-boundary coupling. With them, one can design a compatible metamaterial that will deform in any desired texture only on part of its boundary. With blocks that break holographic order, we demonstrate how to design the deformation texture on the entire boundary. Correspondingly, the number of compatible holographic metamaterials scales exponentially with the boundary, while in non-holographic cases we show that it scales exponentially with the bulk.</description>
