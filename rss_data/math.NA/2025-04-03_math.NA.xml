      <title>A balancing domain decomposition by constraints preconditioner for a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin discretization of an elliptic optimal control problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin (HDG) method for an elliptic distributed optimal control problem and we propose a balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC) preconditioner to solve the discretized system. We establish an error estimate of the HDG methods with explicit tracking of a regularization parameter $\beta$. We observe that the BDDC preconditioner is robust with respect to $\beta$. Numerical results are shown to support our findings.</description>

      <title>Vectorised Parallel in Time methods for low-order discretizations with application to Porous Media problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High order methods have shown great potential to overcome performance issues of simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) on modern hardware, still many users stick to low-order, matrixbased simulations, in particular in porous media applications. Heterogeneous coefficients and low regularity of the solution are reasons not to employ high order discretizations. We present a new approach for the simulation of instationary PDEs that allows to partially mitigate the performance problems. By reformulating the original problem we derive a parallel in time time integrator that increases the arithmetic intensity and introduces additional structure into the problem. By this it helps accelerate matrix-based simulations on modern hardware architectures. Based on a system for multiple time steps we will formulate a matrix equation that can be solved using vectorised solvers like Block Krylov methods. The structure of this approach makes it applicable for a wide range of linear and nonlinear problems. In our numerical experiments we present some first results for three different PDEs, a linear convection-diffusion equation, a nonlinear diffusion-reaction equation and a realistic example based on the Richards' equation.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of the diffuse domain finite element method for second order parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the diffuse domain finite element method (DDFE) to solve a class of second-order parabolic partial differential equations defined in general irregular domains. The proposed method first applies the diffuse domain method (DDM) with a phase-field function to extend the target parabolic equation to a similar problem defined over a larger rectangular domain that contains the original physical domain. The transformed equation is then discretized by using the finite element method with continuous piecewise multilinear basis functions in space and the BDF2 scheme in time to produce a fully discrete numerical scheme. Based on the weighted Sobolev spaces, we prove the convergence of the DDM solution to the original solution as the interface thickness parameter goes to zero, with the corresponding approximation errors under the $L^2$ and $H^1$ norms. Furthermore, the optimal error estimate for the fully discrete DDFE scheme is also obtained under the $H^1$ norm. Various numerical experiments are finally carried out to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the performance of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Stochastic positivity-preserving symplectic splitting methods for stochastic Lotka--Volterra predator-prey model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present two stochastic positive-preserving symplectic methods for the stochastic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey model driven by a multiplicative noise. To inherit the intrinsic characteristic of the original system, the stochastic Lie--Trotter splitting method and the stochastic Strang splitting method are introduced, which are proved to preserve the positivity of the numerical solution and possess the discrete stochastic symplectic conservation law as well. By deriving the uniform boundedness of the $p$-th moment of the numerical solution, we prove that the strong convergence orders of these two methods are both one in the $L^2(\Omega)$-norm. Finally, we validate the theoretical results through two and four dimensional numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Heat Conduction with Phase Change in Permafrost Modules of Vegetation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of heat conduction with phase change, that is essential for permafrost modeling in Land Surface Models and Dynamic Global Vegetation Models. These models require minimal computational effort and an extremely robust solver for large-scale, long-term simulations. The weak enthalpy formulation of the Stefan problem is used as the mathematical model and a finite element method is employed for the discretization. Leveraging the piecewise affine structure of the nonlinear time-stepping equation system, we demonstrate that this system has a unique solution and provide a solver that is guaranteed to find this solution in a finite number of steps from any initial guess. Comparisons with the Neumann analytical solution and tests in the Lund-Potsdam-Jena managed Land vegetation model reveal that the new method does not introduce significantly higher computational costs than the widely used DECP method while providing greater accuracy. In particular, it avoids a known nonphysical artifact in the solution.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Bivariate Quarklet Tree Approximation via Anisotropic Tensor Quarklets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with near-best approximation of a given bivariate function using elements of quarkonial tensor frames. For that purpose we apply anisotropic tensor products of the univariate B-spline quarklets introduced around 2017 by Dahlke, Keding and Raasch. We introduce the concept of bivariate quarklet trees and develop an adaptive algorithm which allows for generalized hp-approximation of a given bivariate function by selected frame elements. It is proved that this algorithm is near-best, which means that as long as some standard conditions concerning local errors are fulfilled it provides an approximation with an error close to that one of the best possible quarklet tree approximation. For this algorithm the complexity is investigated. Moreover, we use our techniques to approximate a bivariate test function with inverse-exponential rates of convergence. It can be expected that the results presented in this paper serve as important building block for the design of adaptive wavelet-hp-methods for solving PDEs in the bivariate setting with very good convergence properties.</description>

      <title>An efficient and energy-stable IMEX splitting scheme for dispersed multiphase flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volume-averaged Navier--Stokes equations are used in various applications to model systems with two or more interpenetrating phases. Each fluid obeys its own momentum and mass equations, and the phases are typically coupled via drag forces and a shared pressure. Monolithic solvers can therefore be very expensive and difficult to implement. On the other hand, designing robust splitting schemes requires making both pressure and drag forces explicit without sacrificing temporal stability. In this context, we derive a new first-order pressure-correction method based on the incompressibility of the mean velocity field, combined with an explicit treatment of the drag forces. Furthermore, the convective terms are linearised using extrapolated velocities, while the viscous terms are treated semi-implicitly. This gives us an implicit-explicit (IMEX) method that is very robust not only due to its unconditional energy stability, but also because it does not require any type of fixed-point iterations. Each time step involves only linear, scalar transport equations and a single Poisson problem as building blocks, thereby offering both efficiency and simplicity. We rigorously prove temporal stability without any time-step size restrictions, and the theory is confirmed through two-phase numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Certified Model Order Reduction for parametric Hermitian eigenproblems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article deals with the efficient and certified numerical approximation of the smallest eigenvalue and the associated eigenspace of a large-scale parametric Hermitian matrix. For this aim, we rely on projection-based model order reduction (MOR), i.e., we approximate the large-scale problem by projecting it onto a suitable subspace and reducing it to one of a much smaller dimension. Such a subspace is constructed by means of weak greedy-type strategies. After detailing the connections with the reduced basis method for source problems, we introduce a novel error estimate for the approximation error related to the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. Since the difference between the second smallest and the smallest eigenvalue, the so-called spectral gap, is crucial for the reliability of the error estimate, we propose efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for higher eigenvalues and for the spectral gap, which enable the assembly of a subspace for the MOR approximation of the spectral gap. Based on that, a second subspace is then generated for the MOR approximation of the eigenspace associated with the smallest eigenvalue. We also provide efficiently computable conditions to ensure that the multiplicity of the smallest eigenvalue is fully captured in the reduced space. This work is motivated by a specific application: the repeated identifications of the states with minimal energy, the so-called ground states, of parametric quantum spin system models.</description>

      <title>Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations as Electrostatic Equilibria: A Generalized Thomson Problem in Convex Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a variational framework in which Centroidal Voronoi Tessellations (CVTs) arise as local minimizers of a generalized electrostatic energy functional. By modeling interior point distributions in a convex domain as repelling charges balanced against a continuous boundary charge, we show that the resulting equilibrium configurations converge to CVT structures. We prove this by showing that CVTs minimize both the classical centroidal energy and the electrostatic potential, establishing a connection between geometric quantization and potential theory. Finally, we introduce a thermodynamic annealing scheme for global CVT optimization, rooted in Boltzmann statistics and random walk dynamics. By introducing a scheme for varying time steps (faster or slower cooling) we show that the set of minima of the centroid energy functional (and therefore the electrostatic potential) can be recovered. By recovering a set of generator locations corresponding to each minimum we can create a lattice continuation that allows for a customizable framework for individual minimum seeking.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the Markovian iteration for coupled FBSDEs via a differentiation approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Markovian iteration method for solving coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) featuring a fully coupled forward drift, meaning the drift term explicitly depends on both the forward and backward processes. An FBSDE system typically involves three stochastic processes: the forward process $X$, the backward process $Y$ representing the solution, and the $Z$ process corresponding to the scaled derivative of $Y$. Prior research by Bender and Zhang (2008) has established convergence results for iterative schemes dealing with $Y$-coupled FBSDEs. However, extending these results to equations with $Z$ coupling poses significant challenges, especially in uniformly controlling the Lipschitz constant of the decoupling fields across iterations and time steps within a fixed-point framework.
  To overcome this issue, we propose a novel differentiation-based method for handling the $Z$ process. This approach enables improved management of the Lipschitz continuity of decoupling fields, facilitating the well-posedness of the discretized FBSDE system with fully coupled drift. We rigorously prove the convergence of our Markovian iteration method in this more complex setting. Finally, numerical experiments confirm our theoretical insights, showcasing the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed methodology.</description>

Abstract: This article focuses on the measurement and evolution modeling of Standardized Kalman filtering in brain activity estimation when non-invasive electroencephalography measurements are used as the data. Here, we propose new parameter tuning and model utilizing the change rate of brain activity distribution to improve the stability of the otherwise accurate estimation. Namely, we pose a backward differentiation-based measurement model for the change rate that increased the stability of the tracking notably.

      <description>arXiv:2504.02198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the error analysis of two types of sampling algorithms, namely model predictive path integral (MPPI) and an interacting particle system (\IPS) algorithm, that have been proposed in the literature for numerical approximation of the stochastic optimal control. The analysis is presented through the lens of Gibbs variational principle. For an illustrative example of a single-stage stochastic optimal control problem, analytical expressions for approximation error and scaling laws, with respect to the state dimension and sample size, are derived. The analytical results are illustrated with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Traffic Flow Data Completion and Anomaly Diagnosis via Sparse and Low-Rank Tensor Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatiotemporal traffic time series, such as traffic speed data, collected from sensing systems are often incomplete, with considerable corruption and large amounts of missing values. A vast amount of data conceals implicit data structures, which poses significant challenges for data recovery issues, such as mining the potential spatio-temporal correlations of data and identifying abnormal data. In this paper, we propose a Tucker decomposition-based sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model (TSLTO) for data imputation and anomaly diagnosis. We decompose the traffic tensor data into low-rank and sparse tensors, and establish a sparse low-rank high-order tensor optimization model based on Tucker decomposition. By utilizing tools of non-smooth analysis for tensor functions, we explore the optimality conditions of the proposed tensor optimization model and design an ADMM optimization algorithm for solving the model. Finally, numerical experiments are conducted on both synthetic data and a real-world dataset: the urban traffic speed dataset of Guangzhou. Numerical comparisons with several representative existing algorithms demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves higher accuracy and efficiency in traffic flow data recovery and anomaly diagnosis tasks.</description>

      <title>Robust Randomized Low-Rank Approximation with Row-Wise Outlier Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust low-rank approximation under row-wise adversarial corruption can be achieved with a single pass, randomized procedure that detects and removes outlier rows by thresholding their projected norms. We propose a scalable, non-iterative algorithm that efficiently recovers the underlying low-rank structure in the presence of row-wise adversarial corruption. By first compressing the data with a Johnson Lindenstrauss projection, our approach preserves the geometry of clean rows while dramatically reducing dimensionality. Robust statistical techniques based on the median and median absolute deviation then enable precise identification and removal of outlier rows with abnormally high norms. The subsequent rank-k approximation achieves near-optimal error bounds with a one pass procedure that scales linearly with the number of observations. Empirical results confirm that combining random sketches with robust statistics yields efficient, accurate decompositions even in the presence of large fractions of corrupted rows.</description>

      <title>Phase transitions for interacting particle systems on random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02721v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study weakly interacting diffusion processes on random graphs. Our main focus is on the properties of the mean-field limit and, in particular, on the nonuniqueness of stationary states. By extending classical bifurcation analysis to include multichromatic interaction potentials and random graph structures, we explicitly identify bifurcation points and relate them to the eigenvalues of the graphon integral operator. Furthermore, we characterize the resulting McKean-Vlasov PDE as a gradient flow with respect to a suitable metric. We combine these theoretical results with the spectral analysis of the linearized McKean-Vlasov operator and extensive numerical simulations to gain insight into the stability and long-term behaviour of stationary solutions. In addition, we provide strong evidence that (minus) the interaction energy of the interacting particle system serves as a natural order parameter. In particular, beyond the transition point and for multichromatic interactions, we observe an energy cascade that is strongly linked to the dynamical metastability of the system.</description>

Abstract: Rational function approximations provide a simple but flexible alternative to polynomial approximation, allowing one to capture complex non-linearities without oscillatory artifacts. However, there have been few attempts to use rational functions on noisy data due to the likelihood of creating spurious singularities. To avoid the creation of singularities, we use Bernstein polynomials and appropriate conditions on their coefficients to force the denominator to be strictly positive. While this reduces the range of rational polynomials that can be expressed, it keeps all the benefits of rational functions while maintaining the robustness of polynomial approximation in noisy data scenarios.
  Our numerical experiments on noisy data show that existing rational approximation methods continually produce spurious poles inside the approximation domain. This contrasts our method, which cannot create poles in the approximation domain and provides better fits than a polynomial approximation and even penalized splines on functions with multiple variables. Moreover, guaranteeing pole-free in an interval is critical for estimating non-constant coefficients when numerically solving differential equations using spectral methods. This provides a compact representation of the original differential equation, allowing numeric solvers to achieve high accuracy quickly, as seen in our experiments.</description>

      <title>Efficient solution of ill-posed integral equations through averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16250v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper discusses the error and cost aspects of ill-posed integral equations when given discrete noisy point evaluations on a fine grid. Standard solution methods usually employ discretization schemes that are directly induced by the measurement points. Thus, they may scale unfavorably with the number of evaluation points, which can result in computational inefficiency. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm that achieves the same level of accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs. Our approach involves an initial averaging procedure to sparsify the underlying grid. To keep the exposition simple, we focus only on one-dimensional ill-posed integral equations that have sufficient smoothness. However, the approach can be generalized to more complicated two- and three-dimensional problems with appropriate modifications.</description>

      <title>Combining physics-based and data-driven models: advancing the frontiers of research with Scientific Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18708v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) is a recently emerged research field which combines physics-based and data-driven models for the numerical approximation of differential problems. Physics-based models rely on the physical understanding of the problem, subsequent mathematical formulation, and numerical approximation. Data-driven models instead aim to extract relations between input and output data without arguing any causality principle underlining the available data distribution. In recent years, data-driven models have been rapidly developed and popularized. Such a diffusion has been triggered by a huge availability of data, increasingly cheap computing power, and the development of powerful ML algorithms. SciML leverages the physical awareness of physics-based models and the efficiency of data-driven algorithms. With SciML, we can inject physics and mathematical knowledge into ML algorithms. Yet, we can rely on data-driven algorithms' capability to discover complex and nonlinear patterns from data and improve the descriptive capacity of physics-based models. After recalling the mathematical foundations of digital modelling and ML algorithms and presenting the most popular ML architectures, we discuss the great potential of a broad variety of SciML strategies in solving complex problems governed by PDEs. Finally, we illustrate the successful application of SciML to the simulation of the human cardiac function, a field of significant socioeconomic importance that poses numerous challenges on both the mathematical and computational fronts. Despite the robustness and accuracy of physics-based models, certain aspects, such as unveiling constitutive laws for cardiac cells and myocardial material properties, as well as devising efficient reduced order models to dominate the extraordinary computational complexity, have been successfully tackled by leveraging data-driven models.</description>

      <title>The Geometric Refinement Transform: A Novel Uncountably Infinite Transform Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel and general class of continuous transforms based on hierarchical Voronoi based refinement schemes. The resulting transform space generalizes classical approaches such as wavelets and Radon transforms by incorporating parameters of refinement multiplicity, dispersion, and rotation. We rigorously establish key properties of the transform including completeness, uniqueness, invertibility, closure, and stability using frame bounds over functions of bounded variation and define a natural inner product structure emerging in L2. We identify regions of parameter space that recover known transforms, including multiscale wavelet decompositions and the generalized Radon transform. Applications are discussed across a range of disciplines, with particular emphasis on entropy formulations. Notably, the transform remains well behaved on geometrically complex and even non convex domains, where traditional methods may struggle. Despite the complexity of the underlying geometry, the coefficient spectrum reveals structure, offering insight even in highly irregular settings.</description>

      <title>Subordination based approximation of Caputo fractional propagator and related numerical methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00958v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose an exponentially convergent numerical method for the Caputo fractional propagator $S_\alpha(t)$ and the associated mild solution of the Cauchy problem with time-independent sectorial operator coefficient $A$ and Caputo fractional derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,2)$ in time. The proposed methods are constructed by generalizing the earlier developed approximation of $S_\alpha(t)$ with help of the subordination principle. Such technique permits us to eliminate the dependence of the main part of error estimate on $\alpha$, while preserving other computationally relevant properties of the original approximation: native support for multilevel parallelism, the ability to handle initial data with minimal spatial smoothness, and stable exponential convergence for all $t \in [0, T]$. Ultimately, the use of subordination leads to a significant improvement of the method's convergence behavior, particularly for small $\alpha &lt; 0.5$, and opens up further opportunities for efficient data reuse. To validate theoretical results, we consider applications of the developed methods to the direct problem of solution approximation, as well as to the inverse problem of fractional order identification.</description>

      <title>Convex optimization over a probability simplex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09046v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new iteration scheme, the Cauchy-Simplex, to optimize convex problems over the probability simplex $\{w\in\mathbb{R}^n\ |\ \sum_i w_i=1\ \textrm{and}\ w_i\geq0\}$. Specifically, we map the simplex to the positive quadrant of a unit sphere, envisage gradient descent in latent variables, and map the result back in a way that only depends on the simplex variable. Moreover, proving rigorous convergence results in this formulation leads inherently to tools from information theory (e.g., cross-entropy and KL divergence). Each iteration of the Cauchy-Simplex consists of simple operations, making it well-suited for high-dimensional problems. In continuous time, we prove that $f(x_T)-f(x^*) = {O}(1/T)$ for differentiable real-valued convex functions, where $T$ is the number of time steps and $w^*$ is the optimal solution. Numerical experiments of projection onto convex hulls show faster convergence than similar algorithms. Finally, we apply our algorithm to online learning problems and prove the convergence of the average regret for (1) Prediction with expert advice and (2) Universal Portfolios.</description>

      <title>Diffusion at Absolute Zero: Langevin Sampling Using Successive Moreau Envelopes [conference paper]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01358v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we propose a novel method for sampling from Gibbs distributions of the form $\pi(x)\propto\exp(-U(x))$ with a potential $U(x)$. In particular, inspired by diffusion models we propose to consider a sequence $(\pi^{t_k})_k$ of approximations of the target density, for which $\pi^{t_k}\approx \pi$ for $k$ small and, on the other hand, $\pi^{t_k}$ exhibits favorable properties for sampling for $k$ large. This sequence is obtained by replacing parts of the potential $U$ by its Moreau envelopes. Sampling is performed in an Annealed Langevin type procedure, that is, sequentially sampling from $\pi^{t_k}$ for decreasing $k$, effectively guiding the samples from a simple starting density to the more complex target. In addition to a theoretical analysis we show experimental results supporting the efficacy of the method in terms of increased convergence speed and applicability to multi-modal densities $\pi$.</description>
