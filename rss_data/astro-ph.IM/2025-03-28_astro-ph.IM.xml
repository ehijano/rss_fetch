      <title>Unveiling the Power of Uncertainty: A Journey into Bayesian Neural Networks for Stellar dating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21153v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Astronomy and astrophysics demand rigorous handling of uncertainties to ensure the credibility of outcomes. The growing integration of artificial intelligence offers a novel avenue to address this necessity. This convergence presents an opportunity to create advanced models capable of quantifying diverse sources of uncertainty and automating complex data relationship exploration.
  What: We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian architecture whose probabilistic relationships are modeled by neural networks, designed to forecast stellar attributes such as mass, radius, and age (our main target). This architecture handles both observational uncertainties stemming from measurements and epistemic uncertainties inherent in the predictive model itself. As a result, our system generates distributions that encapsulate the potential range of values for our predictions, providing a comprehensive understanding of their variability and robustness.
  Methods: Our focus is on dating main sequence stars using a technique known as Chemical Clocks, which serves as both our primary astronomical challenge and a model prototype. In this work, we use hierarchical architectures to account for correlations between stellar parameters and optimize information extraction from our dataset. We also employ Bayesian neural networks for their versatility and flexibility in capturing complex data relationships.
  Results: By integrating our machine learning algorithm into a Bayesian framework, we have successfully propagated errors consistently and managed uncertainty treatment effectively, resulting in predictions characterized by broader uncertainty margins. This approach facilitates more conservative estimates in stellar dating. Our architecture achieves age predictions with a mean absolute error of less than 1 Ga for the stars in the test dataset.</description>

      <title>1-DREAM: 1D Recovery, Extraction and Analysis of Manifolds in noisy environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filaments are ubiquitous in astronomical data sets. Be it in particle simulations or observations, filaments are always tracers of a perturbation in the equilibrium of the studied system and hold essential information on its history and future evolution. However, the recovery of such structures is often complicated by the presence of a large amount of background and transverse noise in the observation space. While the former is generally detrimental to the analysis, the latter can be attributed to measurement errors and it can hold essential information about the structure. To further complicate the scenario, 1D manifolds (filaments) are generally non-linear and their geometry difficult to extract and model. In order to study hidden manifolds within the dataset, particular care has to be devoted to background noise removal and transverse noise modelling, while still maintaining accuracy in the recovery of their geometrical structure. We propose 1-DREAM: a toolbox composed of five main Machine Learning methodologies whose aim is to facilitate manifold extraction in such cases. Each methodology has been designed to address issues when dealing with complicated low-dimensional structures convoluted with noise and it has been extensively tested in previously published works. In this work all methodologies are presented in detail, joint within a cohesive framework and demonstrated for three interesting astronomical cases: a simulated jellyfish galaxy, a filament extracted from a simulated cosmic web and the stellar stream of Omega-Centauri as observed with the GAIA DR2. Two newly developed visualization techniques are also proposed, that take full advantage of the results obtained with 1-DREAM. The code is made publicly available to benefit the community. The controlled experiments on a purposefully built data set prove the accuracy of the pipeline in recovering the hidden structures.</description>

      <title>Near field imaging of local interference in radio interferometric data: Impact on the redshifted 21-cm power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio-frequency interference (RFI) is a major systematic limitation in radio astronomy, particularly for science cases requiring high sensitivity, such as 21-cm cosmology. Traditionally, RFI is dealt with by identifying its signature in the dynamic spectra of visibility data and flagging strongly affected regions. However, for RFI sources that do not occupy narrow regions in the time-frequency space, such as persistent local RFI, modeling these sources could be essential to mitigating their impact. This paper introduces two methods for detecting and characterizing local RFI sources from radio interferometric visibilities: matched filtering and maximum a posteriori (MAP) imaging. These algorithms use the spherical wave equation to construct three-dimensional near-field image cubes of RFI intensity from the visibilities. The matched filter algorithm can generate normalized maps by cross-correlating the expected contributions from RFI sources with the observed visibilities, while the MAP method performs a regularized inversion of the visibility equation in the near field. We also develop a full polarization simulation framework for RFI and demonstrate the methods on simulated observations of local RFI sources. The stability, speed, and errors introduced by these algorithms are investigated, and, as a demonstration, the algorithms are applied to a subset of NenuFAR observations to perform spatial, spectral, and temporal characterization of two local RFI sources. We assess the impact of local RFI on images, the uv plane, and cylindrical power spectra through simulations and describe these effects qualitatively. We also quantify the level of errors and biases that these algorithms induce and assess their implications for the estimated 21-cm power spectrum with radio interferometers. The near-field imaging and simulation codes are made available publicly in the Python library nfis.</description>

      <title>CETRA: A fast, sensitive exoplanet transit detection algorithm implemented for GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Cambridge Exoplanet Transit Recovery Algorithm (CETRA), a fast and sensitive transit detection algorithm, optimised for GPUs. CETRA separates the task into a search for transit signals across linear time space, followed by a phase-folding of the former to enable a periodic signal search, using a physically motivated transit model to improve detection sensitivity. It outperforms traditional methods like Box Least Squares and Transit Least Squares in both sensitivity and speed. Tests on synthetic light curves demonstrate that CETRA can identify at least 20 per cent more low-SNR transits than Transit Least Squares in the same data, particularly those of long period planets. It is also shown to be up to a few orders of magnitude faster for high cadence light curves, enabling rapid large-scale searches.
  Through application of CETRA to Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite short cadence data, we recover the three planets in the HD 101581 system with improved significance. In particular, the transit signal of the previously unvalidated planet TOI-6276.03 is enhanced from ${\rm SNR}=7.9$ to ${\rm SNR}=16.0$, which means it may now meet the criteria for statistical validation.
  CETRA's speed and sensitivity make it well-suited for current and future exoplanet surveys, particularly in the search for Earth analogues. Our implementation of this algorithm uses NVIDIA's CUDA platform and requires an NVIDIA GPU, it is open-source and available from GitHub and PyPI.</description>

      <title>Size Constraint on Hayabusa2 Extended Mission Rendezvous Target 1998~KY$_{26}$ via VLT/VISIR Non-detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1998~KY$_{26}$ is a tiny near-Earth asteroid ($H=26.1$) discovered in 1998. It has been selected as the target of the Hayabusa2 extended mission, which will rendezvous with 1998 KY$_{26}$ in 2031. However, one of the most basic physical properties, size, remains poorly constrained, posing potential challenges for spacecraft operations. We aimed at constraining the size of 1998 KY$_{26}$ by means of thermal infrared observations. We performed thermal infrared observations of 1998 KY$_{26}$ using the ESO Very Large Telescope/VISIR on three consecutive nights in May 2024. After stacking all frames, we find no apparent detection of 1998 KY$_{26}$ on the resulting images. The upper-limit flux density of 1998 KY$_{26}$ is derived as 2 mJy at 10.64 $\mu$m. From this upper-limit flux density obtained via non-detection, we conclude that the diameter of 1998 KY$_{26}$ is smaller than 17 m with thermophysical modeling. This upper limit size is smaller than the radar-derived 30 ($\pm$ 10)\,m. Our size constraint on 1998 KY$_{26}$ is essential for the operation of the Hayabusa2 spacecraft during proximity operations using remote sensing instruments as well as a possible impact experiment using the remaining projectile.</description>

      <title>Rapid Construction of Joint Pulsar Timing Array Datasets: The Lite Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA)'s second data release (IPTA DR2) combines observations of 65 millisecond pulsars from 7 radio telescopes spanning decades, aiming to detect nanohertz gravitational waves (GWs). IPTA datasets are complex and take years to assemble, often excluding recent data crucial for low-frequency GW searches. To address this, we introduce the ``Lite'' analysis, a framework that informs the full data combination process. Using a Figure of Merit, we first select individual PTA datasets per pulsar, enabling immediate access to new data and providing an early estimate of fully combined dataset results. Applying this method to IPTA DR2, we create an uncombined dataset (DR2 Lite) and an early-combined subset (EDR2) before constructing the final Full DR2 dataset (IPTA DR2). We find that DR2 Lite can detect the common red noise process seen in Full DR2 but overestimates the amplitude as $A = 5.2^{+1.8}_{-1.7} \times 10^{-15}$ at $\gamma = 13/3$, likely due to unmodeled noise. In contrast, the combined datasets improve spectral characterization, with Full DR2 yielding an amplitude of $A = 4.0^{+1.0}_{-0.9} \times 10^{-15}$ at $\gamma = 13/3$. Furthermore, combined datasets yield higher, albeit small, detection statistics for Hellings-Downs correlations. Looking ahead, the Lite method will enable rapid synthesis of the latest PTA data, offering preliminary GW constraints before full dataset combinations are available while also motivating their construction.</description>

      <title>Cometary Observations in Light-Polluted Environments: A case study of Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comets and asteroids have long captured human curiosity, and until recently, all documented examples belonged to our Solar System. That changed with the discovery of the first known interstellar object, 1I/2017 U1 ('Oumuamua), in 2017. Two years later, Gennady Borisov discovered a second interstellar object: 2I/Borisov. From its initial images, the object's diffuse appearance hinted at its cometary nature. To better understand the photometric evolution of comet 2I as it traveled through the inner Solar System, we compiled observations using medium-sized telescopes. This data is crucial for gaining insights into its size and composition, as well as how such objects, after millions of years in interstellar space, behave when exposed to the Sun's radiation. Given that 2I is the first interstellar comet ever observed, constraining its behavior is of great scientific interest. In this paper, we present photometric data gathered from observatories in Crimea and Catalonia, highlighting the importance of systematic photometric studies of interstellar objects using meter-class telescopes. Our observations showed a steady increase in the comet's brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the slow sublimation of ices. Over the pre-perihelion observation period, we did not detect any significant changes in magnitude. The analysis of observations reveals a steady increase in comet brightness as it approached perihelion, likely due to the sublimation of ices, with no observable outbursts during the five-month pre-perihelion period. Additionally, we discuss the challenges in ground-based observation of comets posed by light pollution today, particularly in urban areas, where visual observations are severely limited. Using sample surface brightness measurements, we demonstrate the impact of light pollution and outline the importance of systematic photometric studies for interstellar objects.</description>

      <title>ALMA 2D Super-resolution Imaging Survey of Ophiuchus Class I/Flat Spectrum/II Disks -- I: Discovery of New Disk Substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21060v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on Class I, Flat Spectrum (FS), and Class II disks in the Ophiuchus molecular cloud, a nearby active star-forming region with numerous young stellar objects (YSOs), to unveil signs of substructure formation in these disks. We employ two-dimensional super-resolution imaging based on Sparse Modeling (SpM) for ALMA archival Band 6 continuum data, achieving images with spatial resolutions comparable to a few au (0".02-0".2) for 78 dust disks, all of which are spatially resolved. In our sample, we confirm that approximately 30-40% of the disks exhibit substructures, and we identify new substructures in 15 disks (4 Class I, 7 Class FS, and 4 Class II objects). Compared to the eDisk sample in terms of bolometric temperature, Tbol, our targets are in a relatively later accretion phase. By combining our targets with the eDisk sample, we confirm that substructure detection in available data is restricted to objects where Tbol exceeds 200-300 K and the dust disk radius, Rdust, is larger than ~30 au. Moreover, we find that the distribution of inclination angles for Class II disks has a deficit of high values and is not consistent with being random. Analyzing molecular line emission data around these objects will be crucial to constrain disk evolutionary stages further and understand when and how substructures form.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Different Methods to Determine the Distance to LMC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research paper aims to compare different methods for calculating the distance to the Large Magellanic Cloud (\textit{LMC}). The distance, $d_{LMC}$, is determined using stellar parallax, variable stars (RR Lyrae and Classical Cepheids), redshift, and celestial mechanics, from which the systematic and standard errors are calculated. After analyzing each method, the final distance is obtained as $d_{LMC} = 50.4802 \pm 0.0638_{\text{std}}$ Kpc, differing by $+0.5102$ Kpc from the currently most accepted value of $d_{LMC} = 49.97$ Kpc (Pietrzy\'nski, 2014). In this paper, the value of $d_{LMC}$ was derived by combining the distances determined from RR Lyrae and Classical Cepheid variable stars, celestial mechanics and parallax.</description>

      <title>Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) onboard ADITYA-L1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ADITYA L1, India's first dedicated mission to study Sun and its atmosphere from the Sun-Earth Lagrangian L1 location was successfully launched on September 2, 2023 with seven payloads. Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) is a major payload on ADITYA-L1. VELC has provision to carry out imaging and spectroscopic observations (the latter in three emission lines of the corona), simultaneously. Images of the solar corona in continuum at 5000{\AA}, with the field of view (FoV) from 1.05$R_\odot$ to 3$R_\odot$ can be obtained at variable intervals depending on the data volume that can be downloaded. Spectroscopic observations of solar corona in three emission lines, namely 5303{\AA} [Fe XIV], 7892{\AA} [Fe XI], and 10747{\AA} [Fe XIII] are possible simultaneously, with different exposure times and cadence. Four slits, each of width 50${\mu}$m, separated by 3.75mm helps to simultaneously obtain spectra at four positions in the solar corona at all the aforementioned lines. A Linear Scan Mechanism (LSM) makes it possible to scan the solar corona up to ${\pm}$1.5$R_\odot$ with variable step size. The instrument has the facility to carry out spectropolarimetric observations at 10747{\AA} also in the FoV range 1.05-1.5$R_\odot$. Various components of the instrument were tested interferometrically on the optical bench before installation. The individual components were aligned and performance of the payload was checked in the laboratory using laser source and tungsten lamp. Wavelength calibration of the instrument was verified using Sun as a light source. All the detectors were calibrated for different parameters such as dark current and its variation with exposure time.Here, we discuss the various features of the VELC, alignment, calibration, performance, possible observations, initial data analysis and results of initial tests conducted in-orbit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-baseline atom interferometry is a promising technique for probing various aspects of fundamental physics, astrophysics and cosmology, including searches for ultralight dark matter (ULDM) and for gravitational waves (GWs) in the frequency range around 1~Hz that is not covered by present and planned detectors using laser interferometry. The MAGIS detector is under construction at Fermilab, as is the MIGA detector in France. The PX46 access shaft to the LHC has been identified as a very suitable site for an atom interferometer of height $\sim 100$m, sites at the Boulby mine in the UK and the Canfranc Laboratory are also under investigation, and possible sites for km-class detectors have been suggested. The Terrestrial Very-Long-Baseline Atom Interferometry (TVLBAI) Proto-Collaboration proposes a coordinated programme of interferometers of increasing baselines.</description>

      <title>New beyond-Voigt line-shape profile recommended for the HITRAN database</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parameters associated with the collisional perturbation of spectral lines are essential for modeling the absorption of electromagnetic radiation in gas media. The HITRAN molecular spectroscopic database provides these parameters, although originally they were associated only with the Voigt profile parameterization. However, in the HITRAN2016 and HITRAN2020 editions, Voigt, speed-dependent Voigt and Hartmann-Tran (HT) profiles have been incorporated, thanks to the new relational structure of the database. The HT profile was introduced in HITRAN in 2016 as a recommended profile for the most accurate spectral interpretations and modeling. It was parameterized with a four-temperature-range temperature dependence. Since then, however, some features of the HT profile have been revealed that are problematic from a practical perspective. These are: the singular behavior of the temperature dependencies of the velocity-changing parameters when the shift parameter crosses zero and the difficulty in evaluating the former for mixtures. In this article, we summarize efforts to eliminate the above-mentioned problems that led us to recommend using the quadratic speed-dependent hard-collision (qSDHC) profile with double-power-law (DPL) temperature dependencies. We refer to this profile as a modified Hartmann-Tran (mHT) profile. The computational cost of evaluating it is the same as for the HT profile. We give a detailed description of the mHT profile (also including line mixing) and discuss the representation of its parameters, together with their DPL temperature parametrization adopted in the HITRAN database. We discuss an efficient algorithm for evaluating this profile and provide corresponding computer codes in several programming languages: Fortran, Python, MATLAB, Wolfram Mathematica, and LabVIEW. We also discuss the associated update of the HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI).</description>

      <title>Enabling Robust Exoplanet Atmospheric Retrievals with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Atmospheric retrievals are essential tools for interpreting exoplanet transmission and eclipse spectra, enabling quantitative constraints on the chemical composition, aerosol properties, and thermal structure of planetary atmospheres. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) offers unprecedented spectral precision, resolution, and wavelength coverage, unlocking transformative insights into the formation, evolution, climate, and potential habitability of planetary systems. However, this opportunity is accompanied by challenges: modeling assumptions and unaccounted-for noise or signal sources can bias retrieval outcomes and their interpretation. To address these limitations, we introduce a Gaussian Process (GP)-aided atmospheric retrieval framework that flexibly accounts for unmodeled features in exoplanet spectra, whether global or localized. We validate this method on synthetic JWST observations and show that GP-aided retrievals reduce bias in inferred abundances and better capture model-data mismatches than traditional approaches. We also introduce the concept of mean squared error to quantify the trade-off between bias and variance, arguing that this metric more accurately reflects retrieval performance than bias alone. We then reanalyze the NIRISS/SOSS JWST transmission spectrum of WASP-96 b, finding that GP-aided retrievals yield broader constraints on CO$_2$ and H$_2$O, alleviating tension between previous retrieval results and equilibrium predictions. Our GP framework provides precise and accurate constraints while highlighting regions where models fail to explain the data. As JWST matures and future facilities come online, a deeper understanding of the limitations of both data and models will be essential, and GP-enabled retrievals like the one presented here offer a principled path forward.</description>

      <title>Analytical planar wavefront reconstruction and error estimates for radio detection of extensive air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When performing radio detection of ultra-high energy astroparticles, the planar wavefront model is often used as a first step to evaluate the arrival direction of primary particles. This model estimates the direction by adjusting the wavefront orientation based on the peak timing of the signal traces from individual antennas. However, despite it's simplicity, the usefulness of this approach is limited by the lack of a good assessment of its robustness and the lack of confidence in its performance. To address these limitations, this study presents two analytical methods to solve for the planar wavefront arrival direction. In addition, we provide the corresponding analytical reconstruction uncertainty, offering a more a more detailed evaluation of the reconstruction's reliability.</description>

      <title>Adapting a novel framework for rapid inference of massive black hole binaries for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15542v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) is designed to detect a variety of gravitational-wave events, including mergers of massive black hole binaries, stellar-mass black hole inspirals, and extreme mass-ratio inspirals. LISA's capability to observe signals with high signal-to-noise ratios raises concerns about waveform accuracy. Additionally, its ability to observe long-duration signals will raise the computational cost of Bayesian inference, making it challenging to use costly and novel models with standard stochastic sampling methods without incorporating likelihood and waveform acceleration techniques. In this work, we present our attempt to tackle these issues. We adapt ${\tt RIFT}$ for LISA to take advantage of its embarrassingly parallel architecture, enabling efficient analysis of large datasets with costly gravitational wave models without relying on likelihood or waveform acceleration. We demonstrate that our open-source code can accurately infer parameters of massive black hole binary signals by carrying out a zero-noise injection recovery using the numerical relativity surrogate model ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$. By utilizing all available $m\neq0$ modes in the inference, we study the impact of higher modes on LISA data analysis. We study the impact of multiple massive black hole binary signals in a dataset on the inference of a single signal, showing that the selected source's inference remains largely unaffected. Furthermore, we analyze the LDC-1A and blind LDC-2A datasets from the Radler and Sangria challenge of the LISA data challenges. When eschewing specialized hardware, we find ${\tt NRHybSur3dq8}$ injection-recovery takes approximately $20$ hours to complete, while the analysis of Sangria and Radler datasets takes about $10$ hours to complete.</description>

      <title>Design of the full-sky scanning strategy and systematic effect control in a cosmic microwave background probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quest for primordial $B$-mode polarization signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is a major goal of contemporary cosmology. Detecting these signatures would confirm primordial gravitational waves and allow precise determination of the tensor-to-scalar ratio, $r$, which is crucial for distinguishing between inflationary models. This requires high-precision, full-sky observations from space-based platforms to avoid atmospheric fluctuations and windows. Since $B$-mode signatures are much fainter than CMB temperature anisotropies, their detection requires well-designed calibration and mitigation strategies. Next-generation space observatories such as LiteBIRD, which use Half-Wave Plate (HWP) modulation technology, represent a significant advance. This technology allows single-detector observations, eliminating the need for pair-differential detection and its associated systematic complexities. The study begins with the optimization of scanning strategy parameters for missions with HWP to improve in-flight calibration, suppress systematic effects, and develop robust null-test methods. In addition, we present a method for calculating the impact of systematic effects on the estimation of $r$ using the SBM (Spin-Based Map-making) software framework, which performs fast map-making in spin space. This method allows the decomposition and elimination of systematic effects in terms of spins, and we demonstrate the elimination of several systematic effects.</description>
