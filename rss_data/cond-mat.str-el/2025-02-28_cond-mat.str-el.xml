      <title>'t Hooft anomalies in metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I review some recent results on understanding the physics of metals in an exact non-perturbative way through the powerful field-theoretic concepts of emergent symmetries and 't Hooft anomalies. A 't Hooft anomaly is a discrete topological property that quantum field theories with global symmetries can have. I explain how many of the properties of metals can in fact be viewed as direct consequences of the anomaly. This allows a structural understanding of metals, including non-Fermi liquids, to be obtained even in the absence of any exact solution for the strongly coupled dynamics. I then outline the main limitations and outstanding questions.</description>

      <title>Band Renormalization, Quarter Metals, and Chiral Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Tetralayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, exotic superconductivity emerging from a spin-and-valley-polarized metallic phase has been observed in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene. To explain this finding, we study the role of electron-electron interactions in determining flavor symmetry breaking, using the Hartree Fock (HF) approximation, and also superconductivity driven by repulsive interactions. Though mean field HF correctly predicts the isospin flavors and reproduces the experimental phase diagram, it overestimates the band renormalization near the Fermi energy and suppresses superconducting instabilities. To address this, we introduce a physically motivated scheme that includes internal screening in the HF calculation. Superconductivity arises in the spin-valley polarized phase for a range of electric fields and electron doping. Our findings reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a $p$-wave, finite-momentum, time-reversal symmetry broken superconducting state, encouraging further investigation into exotic phases in graphene multilayers.</description>

      <title>Probing Green's Function Zeros by Co-tunneling through Mott Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum tunneling experiments have provided deep insights into basic excitations occurring as Green's function poles in the realm of complex quantum matter. However, strongly correlated quantum materials also allow for Green's functions zeros (GFZ) that may be seen as an antidote to the familiar poles, and have so far largely eluded direct experimental study. Here, we propose and investigate theoretically how co-tunneling through Mott insulators enables direct access to the shadow band structure of GFZ. In particular, we derive an effective Hamiltonian for the GFZ that is shown to govern the co-tunneling amplitude and reveal fingerprints of many-body correlations clearly distinguishing the GFZ structure from the underlying free Bloch band structure of the system. Our perturbative analytical results are corroborated by numerical data both in the framework of exact diagonalization and matrix product state simulations for a one-dimensional model system consisting of a Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model coupled to two single level quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Theta electromagnetism in quantum spin ice: Microscopic analysis of improper symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $U(1)$ gauge theories, including conventional Maxwell electromagnetism, allow $\theta$-terms when parity and time-reversal symmetry are broken. In condensed matter systems, the physics of $\theta$ as a magnetoelectric response has been explored extensively within the context of topological insulators and multiferroics. We show how $\theta$-terms can arise in the internal dynamics of the emergent electromagnetism in a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid. In its Coulomb phase, the minimal model of pyrochlore quantum spin ice is governed by a six-spin ring exchange Hamiltonian. We identify the next-order contribution to the microscopic Hamiltonian when parity, time-reversal, and all improper spatial symmetries are broken -- a seven-spin term which leads to a two-parameter lattice gauge theory with a $\theta$-electromagnetic phase. We derive how the seven-spin term is generated perturbatively within each of the three symmetry classes of short-range pyrochlore spin ice. Within a complete microscopic symmetry analysis, we find that the most general nearest-neighbor Hamiltonians fail to generate the seven-spin term, and one must include next-nearest-neighbor interactions to obtain an emergent $\theta$. Using gauge mean-field theory we compute additional contributions to the $\theta$-term from the spinon sector. Finally, we determine the conditions required for an internal $\theta$-term to generate a significant external magnetoelectic response.</description>

      <title>Single-band square lattice Hubbard model from twisted bilayer C568</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose twisted homobilayer of a carbon allotrope, C$_{568}$, to be a promising platform to realize controllable square lattice single-band extended Hubbard model. This setup has the advantage of a widely tunable $t'/t$ ratio without adding external fields, and the intermediate temperature $t\ll T\ll U$ regime can be easily achieved. We first analyze the continuum model obtained from symmetry analysis and first-principle calculations, and calculate the band structures. Subsequently, we derive the corresponding tight-binding models and fit the hopping parameters as well as the Coulomb interactions. When displacement field is applied, anisotropic nearest neighbor hoppings can further be achieved. If successfully fabricated, the device could be an important stepping stone towards understanding high-temperature superconductivity.</description>

      <title>An Analysis of First- and Second-Order Optimization Algorithms in Variational Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many quantum many-body wavefunctions, such as Jastrow-Slater, tensor network, and neural quantum states, are studied with the variational Monte Carlo technique, where stochastic optimization is usually performed to obtain a faithful approximation to the ground-state of a given Hamiltonian. While first order gradient descent methods are commonly used for such optimizations, recent second order optimization formulations offer the potential of faster convergence under certain theoretical conditions, but with a similar cost per sample to first order methods. However, the relative performance of first order and second order optimizers is influenced in practice by many factors, including the sampling requirements for a faithful optimization step, the influence of wavefunction quality, as well as the wavefunction parametrization and expressivity. Here we analyze these performance characteristics of first order and second order optimization methods for a variety of Hamiltonians, with the additional context of understanding the scaling of these methods (for good performance) as a function of system size. Our findings help clarify the role of first order and second order methods in variational Monte Carlo calculations and the conditions under which they should respectively be used. In particular, we find that unlike in deterministic optimization, where closeness to the variational minimum determines the suitability of second order methods, in stochastic optimization the main factor is the overall expressivity of the wavefunction: second order methods lead to an overall reduction in cost relative to first order methods when the wavefunction is sufficiently expressive to represent the ground-state, even when starting away from the ground state. This makes second order methods an important technique when used with wavefunctions with arbitrarily improvable accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantitative description of strongly correlated materials by combining downfolding techniques and tensor networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-accuracy procedure for electronic structure calculations of strongly correlated materials. The approach involves downfolding the full Hilbert space into a low-energy subspace that captures the most significant electron correlations, leading to an effective Hubbard model. This generalized model is then solved using tensor network methods. Our work focuses on one-dimensional and quasi-one-dimensional materials, for which we employ the machinery of matrix product states. We apply this framework to the conjugated polymers trans-polyacetylene and polythiophene, as well as the quasi-one-dimensional charge-transfer insulator Sr2CuO3. The predicted band gaps exhibit quantitative agreement with state-of-the-art computational techniques and experimental measurements. Beyond band gaps, tensor networks provide access to a wide range of physically relevant properties, including spin magnetization and various excitation energies. Their flexibility supports the implementation of complex Hamiltonians with longer-range interactions, while the bond dimension enables systematic control over accuracy. Furthermore, the computational cost scales efficiently with system size, demonstrating the framework's scalability.</description>

      <title>Anomalous spin-optical helical effect in Ti-based kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The kagome lattice stands as a rich platform for hosting a wide array of correlated quantum phenomena, ranging from charge density waves and superconductivity to electron nematicity and loop current states. Direct detection of loop currents in kagome systems has remained a formidable challenge due to their intricate spatial arrangements and the weak magnetic field signatures they produce. This has left their existence and underlying mechanisms a topic of intense debate. In this work, we uncover a hallmark reconcilable with loop currents: spin handedness-selective signals that surpass conventional dichroic, spin, and spin-dichroic responses. We observe this phenomenon in the kagome metal CsTi$_3$Bi$_5$ and we call it the anomalous spin-optical helical effect. This effect arises from the coupling of light' s helicity with spin-orbital electron correlations, providing a groundbreaking method to visualize loop currents in quantum materials. Our discovery not only enriches the debate surrounding loop currents but also paves the way for new strategies to exploit the electronic phases of quantum materials via light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous magnon decay in two-dimensional altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that magnons in two-dimensional altermagnets can spontaneously decay at zero temperature. The decay rate is determined by quantum fluctuations and scattering processes involving the decay of a single magnon into three. These processes are kinematically allowed due to the convexity of the altermagnetic magnon dispersion. For small wavevectors $k$ the decay rate is proportional to $k^5$ with a direction-dependent prefactor which is maximal along the diagonals of the Brillouin zone. Moreover, for a given momentum only magnons with one specific chirality can spontaneously decay.</description>

      <title>Optical switching in a layered altermagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnetism defies conventional classifications of collinear magnetic phases, standing apart from ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism with its unique combination of spin-dependent symmetries, net-zero magnetization, and anomalous Hall transport. Although altermagnetic states have been realized experimentally, their integration into functional devices has been hindered by the structural rigidity and poor tunability of existing materials. First, through cobalt intercalation of the superconducting 2H-NbSe$_2$ polymorph, we induce and stabilize a robust altermagnetic phase and using both theory and experiment, we directly observe the lifting of Kramers degeneracy. Then, using ultrafast laser pulses, we demonstrate how the low temperature phase of this system can be quenched, realizing the first example of an optical altermagnetic switch. While shedding light on overlooked aspects of altermagnetism, our findings open pathways to spin-based technologies and lay a foundation for advancing the emerging field of altertronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Weakly and strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, namely semiconductors and Mott insulators, are combined into a layered heterostructure. Via the hierarchy of correlations, we derive and match the propagating quasi-particle solutions in the different regions and calculate the transmission coefficients through these layered structures. As a proof of principle, we find the well known transmission bands of a semiconductor heterostructure. Extending this idea to semiconductor and Mott insulator structures we calculate the transmittance and the resonance energies. Within a phase accumulation model we find analytical expressions for the scattering phase shift. Lastly, we find transmission curves with skewness for structures with applied voltage.</description>

      <title>Simulating Bulk Gap in Chiral Projected Entangled-Pair States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected entangled-pair states (PEPS) have proven effective in capturing chiral spin liquid ground states, yet the presence of long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails raises concerns about their ability to accurately describe bulk gaps. Here, we address this challenge and demonstrate that PEPS can reliably characterize gapped bulk excitations in chiral topological phases. Using a variational principle for excited states within a local mode approximation, we establish that correlation functions decaying faster than $r^{-2}$ are not necessarily related to gapless modes and thus long-range ``gossamer'' correlation tails in chiral PEPS do not contradict the presence of a bulk gap. This framework is validated in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Kitaev model with a chiral term, where PEPS yields excitation gaps that agree well with exact solutions. Extending our approach to the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ Kitaev model, we present compelling evidence for its chiral ground state and accurately resolve its gapped excitations. These findings thus solidify PEPS as a powerful tool for studying both ground and excited states in chiral topological systems, thereby bridging a key gap in the understanding of their bulk properties.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Magnon Decays from Nonrelativistic Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking in Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticles are central to condensed matter physics, but their stability can be undermined by quantum many-body interactions. Magnons, quasiparticles in quantum magnets, are particularly intriguing because their properties are governed by both real and spin space. While crystal symmetries may be low, spin interactions often remain approximately isotropic, limiting spontaneous magnon decay. Textbook wisdom holds that collinear Heisenberg magnets follow a dichotomy: ferromagnets host stable magnons, while antiferromagnetic magnons may decay depending on dispersion curvature. Up to now, relativistic spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear order that connect spin space to real space, were shown to introduce more complex magnon instability mechanisms. Here, we show that even in nonrelativistic isotropic collinear systems, this conventional dichotomy is disrupted in altermagnets. Altermagnets, a newly identified class of collinear magnets, exhibit compensated spin order with nonrelativistic time-reversal symmetry breaking and even-parity band splitting. Using kinematic analysis, nonlinear spin-wave theory, and quantum simulations, we reveal that even weak band splitting opens a decay phase space, driving quasiparticle breakdown. Additionally, d-wave altermagnets form a rare ``island of stability'' at the Brillouin zone center. Our findings establish a quasiparticle stability trichotomy in collinear Heisenberg magnets and position altermagnets as a promising platform for unconventional spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Multipartite Entanglement Structure of Fibered Link States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the patterns of multipartite entanglement in Chern-Simons theory with compact gauge group $G$ and level $k$ for states defined by the path integral on "link complements", i.e., compact manifolds whose boundaries consist of $n$ topologically linked tori. We focus on link complements which can be described topologically as fibrations over a Seifert surface. We show that the entanglement structure of such fibered link complement states is controlled by a topological invariant, the monodromy of the fibration. Thus, the entanglement structure of a Chern-Simons link state is not simply a function of the link, but also of the background manifold in which the link is embedded. In particular, we show that any link possesses an embedding into some background that leads to GHZ-like entanglement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that all fibered links with periodic monodromy have GHZ-like entanglement, i.e., a partial trace on any link component produces a separable state.</description>

Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking, arising from the competition of interactions and quantum fluctuations, is fundamental to understanding ordered electronic phases. Although electrically neutral, optical excitations like excitons can interact through their dipole moment, raising the possibility of optically active ordered phases. The effects of spontaneous ordering on optical properties remain largely unexplored. Recent observations of the excitonic Mott insulating state in semiconducting moir\'e crystals make them promising for addressing this question. Here, we present evidence for an in-plane ferroelectric phase of dipolar moir\'e excitons driven by strong exciton-exciton interactions. We discover a surprising speed-up of photon emission at late times and low densities in excitonic decay. This counterintuitive behavior is attributed to collective radiance, linked to the transition between disordered and symmetry-broken ferroelectric phases of moir\'e excitons. Our findings provide first evidence for strong dipolar inter-site interactions in moir\'e lattices, demonstrate collective photon emission as a probe for moir\'e quantum materials, and pave the way for exploring cooperative optical phenomena in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>Evidence for strongly correlated superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We conduct first-principles simulations of pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, a material in which a recent series of experiments has found signs of high-temperature superconductivity. In the pressure range where superconductivity is observed, we find a significant increase in the Hubbard U parameter (i.e. the strength of on-site repulsion) for the maximally localized Wannier states comprising the density functional theory (DFT) bands crossing the Fermi energy. We attribute this increase in U to reduced screening by the nearby La 5d bands - an effect that is sensitive to the pressure-driven crystal structure. Our results therefore indicate that the superconducting region in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ phase diagram coincides with a region of enhanced electronic correlations. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations extend these trends to finite temperatures, providing insights into the experimentally observed transition lines. Finally, we explore intrinsic chemical pressure using DFT simulations of Ac$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.</description>

      <title>Digital Simulation of Non-Abelian Parafermions in Superconducting Circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20254v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Parafermions, which can be viewed as a fractionalized version of Majorana modes, exhibit non-Abelian statistics and emerge in topologically ordered systems, while their realization in experiment has been challenging. Here we propose an experimental scheme for the digital simulation of parafermions and their non-Abelian braiding in superconducting circuits by realizing the $\mathbb{Z}_d$ plaquette model on a two-dimensional lattice. Two protocols using quantum circuits and non-destructive measurements are introduced to prepare the ground state, on which the parafermion pairs are created by engineering dislocations. We further develop a generalized code deformation approach to realize the fusion and non-Abelian braiding statistics of parafermion modes, in which the concrete example for $d=3$ parafermions is studied in detail. We also examine the real parameter regime to confirm the feasibility in superconducting devices. This work extends previous methods for twist defects in superconducting qubits to qudit systems, and may open up a way for parafermion-based high-dimensional topological quantum computing with experimental feasibility.</description>

      <title>Symmetry defects and gauging for quantum states with matrix product unitary symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we examine the consequences of the existence of a finite group of matrix product unitary (MPU) symmetries for matrix product states (MPS). We generalize the well-understood picture of onsite unitary symmetries, which give rise to virtual symmetry defects given by insertions of operators in the bonds of the MPS. In the MPU case, we can define analogous defect tensors, this time sitting on lattice sites, that can be created, moved, and fused by local unitary operators. We leverage this formalism to study the gauging of MPU symmetries. We introduce a condition, block independence, under which we can gauge the symmetries by promoting the symmetry defects to gauge degrees of freedom, yielding an MPS of the same bond dimension that supports a local version of the symmetry given by commuting gauge constraints. Whenever block independence does not hold (which happens, in particular, whenever the symmetry representation is anomalous), a modification of our method which we call state-level gauging still gives rise to a locally symmetric MPS by promotion of the symmetry defects, at the expense of producing gauge constraints that do not commute on different sites.</description>

      <title>Search for magnetic field expulsion in optically driven K$_3$C$_{60}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20276v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photoexcited K$_3$C$_{60}$ displays several properties reminiscent of equilibrium superconductivity, including transient optical spectra, pressure dependence, and I-V characteristics. However, these observations do not decisively establish non-equilibrium superconductivity, which would be conclusively evidenced by transient Meissner diamagnetism, as shown recently in driven YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$. Here, we search for transient magnetic field expulsion in K$_3$C$_{60}$ by measuring Faraday rotation in a magneto-optic material placed in its vicinity. Unlike in the case of homogeneous, insulating YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6.48}$, inhomogeneous, metallic K$_3$C$_{60}$ powders reduce the size of the effect. With the $\sim50$ nT magnetic field resolution achieved in our experiments, we provide an upper limit for the photo-induced diamagnetic volume susceptibility ($\chi_v&gt;-0.1$). On this basis, we conclude that the photo-induced phase has weaker diamagnetism than superconducting K$_3$C$_{60}$ at zero temperature. Yet, from recent nonlinear transport measurements in this granular material, we expect a light-induced state similar to the equilibrium superconductor near 0.8 T$_c$, for which $\chi_v&gt;-0.1$. A definitive conclusion on the presence or absence of Meissner diamagnetism cannot be made for K$_3$C$_{60}$ with the current resolution.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

Abstract: The chromium spinels MgCr2O4 and ZnCr2O4 are prime examples of the highly frustrated pyrochlore lattice antiferromagnet. Experiment has carefully established that both materials, upon cooling, distort to lower symmetry and order magnetically. We study the nature of this process by a combination of density-functional-theory based energy mapping and classical Monte Carlo simulations. We first computationally establish precise Heisenberg Hamiltonian parameters for the high temperature cubic and the low temperature tetragonal and orthorhombic structures of both spinels. We then investigate the respective ordering temperatures of high symmetry and low symmetry structures. We carefully compare our results with experimental facts and find that our simulations are remarkably consistent with a type of spin-Peierls mechanism, adapted to three dimensions, where the structural distortion is mediated by a magnetic energy gain due to a lower degree of frustration.</description>

      <title>Low-energy critical behavior in two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals driven by fermion-fermion interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07126v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Employing the renormalization group approach, we carefully investigate the critical behavior of two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals induced by the fermion-fermion interactions in the low-energy regime. After incorporating all one-loop corrections, we derive the coupled RG equations of all related parameters and introduce two distinct strategies, named as Strategy I and Strategy II, to describe different scenarios. A detailed numerical analysis yields several interesting behavior in the low-energy limit. At first, we notice that the fermion-fermion interactions either vanish or diverge in the Strategy I, depending on the initial values of the tilting parameter and the fermionic couplings, whereas these interactions in the Strategy II always diverge at a certain critical energy scale, which is associated with the initial conditions. Next, the microstructural parameter $\alpha$ and the fermion velocity $v_F$ in the Strategy I share the similar behavior with their Strategy II counterparts. It is observed that fermion-fermion interactions lead to an increase in $\alpha$ while driving a decrease in $v_F$. Furthermore, the system can either be attracted by the Gaussian fixed point (GFP) or certain relatively fixed point (RFP) in the Strategy I. However, it always flow towards the RFP in the Strategy II at the lowest-energy limit. These results would provide helpful insights into the studies on observable quantities and phase transitions in the two-dimensional tilted semi-Dirac semimetals and the analogous semimetals.</description>

Abstract: We discuss a large class of non-relativistic continuum field theories where the Euclidean spatial symmetry of the classical theory is violated in the quantum theory by an Adler-Bell-Jackiw-like anomaly. In particular, the continuous translation symmetry of the classical theory is broken in the quantum theory to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, that discrete symmetry is extended by an internal symmetry, making it non-Abelian. This presentation streamlines and extends the discussion in [1]. In an Appendix, we present an elementary introduction to 't Hooft and Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomalies using a well-known system.</description>

      <title>Finite-rate quench in disordered Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study quantum quench of finite rate across topological quantum transitions in two-dimensional Chern and $Z_2$ topological insulators. We choose the representative Haldane model and the Kane-Mele model to investigate the behavior of excitation density generated by the quench and the impact of disorder on it. For the Haldane model, as long as the spectral gap is not closed by disorder, we find the excitation density at the end of the quench obeys the power-law decay with decreasing quench rate, consistent with the prediction of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism. By contrast, the anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior of excitation density, namely larger excitation density at slower quench, is observed in disordered Kane-Mele model, which we attribute to the existence of a disorder-induced gapless region. Moreover, we demonstrate that particle's onsite occupation can be used as a local measurable quantity to probe the breakdown of adiabatic evolution. The difference of onsite occupation between the time-evolved state and instantaneous ground state at the end of the quench exhibits similar dependence on the quench rate as the excitation density for both the Haldane and Kane-Mele models. This similarity still holds in the bulk of the system even when we consider realistic open boundary conditions, facilitating the experimental characterization of the dynamic features in these models.</description>

Abstract: We present a functional interpolation approach within the auxiliary master equation framework to efficiently and accurately solve correlated impurity problems in nonequilibrium dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). By leveraging a near-exact auxiliary bath representation, the method estimates corrections via interpolation over a few bath realisations, significantly reducing computational cost and increasing accuracy. We illustrate the approach on the Anderson impurity model and on the Hubbard model within DMFT, capturing equilibrium and long-lived photodoped states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07369v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of topological Hall-like (THE-like) signals in disordered multidomain ferromagnets. Non-monotonic behavior in Hall resistivity, commonly attributed to topological spin textures such as skyrmions, is produced in a random resistor network model without any chirality. It arises from simple mechanisms of the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in combination with the domain wall scattering. By varying domain configurations and domain wall resistances, we explore the conditions under which the non-monotonic resistivity can be enhanced. Our results emphasize the need for careful analysis in distinguishing between true topological Hall effects and artifacts caused by domain disorders.</description>
