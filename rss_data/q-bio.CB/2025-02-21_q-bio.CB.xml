      <title>Active energy harvesting and work transduction by hair-cell bundles in bullfrog's inner ear</title>

Abstract: Hair cells actively drive oscillations of their mechanosensitive organelles -- the hair bundles that enable hearing and balance sensing in vertebrates. Why and how some hair cells expend energy by sustaining this oscillatory motion in order to fulfill their function as signal sensors and others -- as amplifiers, remains unknown. We develop a stochastic thermodynamic theory to describe energy flows in a periodically-driven hair bundle. Our analysis of thermodynamic fluxes associated with hair bundles' motion and external sinusoidal stimulus reveals that these organelles operate as thermodynamic work-to-work machines under different operational modes. One operational mode transduces the signal's power into the cell, whereas another allows the external stimulus to harvest the energy supplied by the cell. These two regimes might represent thermodynamic signatures of signal sensing and amplification respectively. In addition to work transduction and energy harvesting, our model also substantiates the capability of hair-cell bundles to operate as heaters and and active feedback refrigerators at the expense of external driving. We quantify the performance and robustness of the work-to-work operating modes of hair bundles revealing a maximal thermodynamic efficiency of around 80 percent of the transduced work.</description>
