      <title>Deep learning for classifying dynamical states from time series via recurrence plots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) is a widely used method for capturing the dynamical structure embedded in time series data, relying on the analysis of recurrence patterns in the reconstructed phase space via recurrence plots. Although RQA proves effective across a range of applications, it typically requires the computation of multiple quantitative measures, making it both computationally intensive and sensitive to parameter choices. In this study, we adopt an alternative approach that bypasses manual feature selection and extraction by directly using recurrence plot images as input to a deep learning model. We propose a new dual-branch deep learning architecture specifically designed to efficiently capture the complex dynamical features encoded in RPs. We also compare its performance against a baseline ResNet-50 model for classifying the dynamical behavior of time series using recurrence plots. Our dual-branch model, trained exclusively on simulated time series, accurately and efficiently distinguishes among six distinct classes: periodic, quasi-periodic, chaotic, hyperchaotic, white noise, and red noise. To assess its generalizability, we apply the trained model to time series generated from standard Lorenz and R\"ossler systems, neither of which is included in the training set, as well as to experimental datasets from a Chua circuit and observational light curves of the variable stars AC Her, SX Her, and Chi Cygni. In all cases, the model outperforms the baseline and yields predictions that align with the known dynamics of these systems. These results further demonstrate the robustness and versatility of our deep learning framework, underscoring the potential of RP based models as fast, accurate, and scalable tools for classifying dynamical states in both synthetic and real-world time series data.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Transverse Discontinuity Mapping in Filippov Systems: Analysis and Experimental Validation using an Electronic Circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper shows that linearizing the transverse discontinuity mapping (TDM) in Filippov systems can produce inaccurate predictions of the dynamics in impact oscillators operating near a pre-stressed soft barrier. This discrepancy arises from the limitations of the linearized saltation matrix, which inaccurately predicts impacts in the local neighborhood of the discontinuity boundary. To address this issue, a higher-order approximation of the TDM is derived, which accurately captures the onset of impacts and closely matches the results obtained from both numerical simulations and electronic experiments. The proposed higher-order TDM results in a quadratic estimation of flight time for impacts. Geometrically, real-valued impact events are only feasible when the discriminant of this quadratic equation is positive. The differences in the predicted higher-order flight times and mapping estimates become more pronounced for low-velocity impacts close to grazing. Subsequently, a numerical approximation of the higher-order saltation matrix and its consequent Floquet multipliers and Lyapunov exponents for stability analysis is proposed and demonstrated on a pre-stressed, forced, damped, soft impact oscillator. To validate the numerically observed discontinuity-induced bifurcations, an analog electronic circuit is proposed that models a soft mechanical prestressed oscillator. This inductor-less circuit overcomes the limitations of typical LCR-based circuits, which are used to design such oscillators but cannot accommodate low stiffness ratios. The experimentally obtained limit cycles, finger-shaped Poincar\'e sections, and bifurcation diagrams match the predictions of the higher-order TDM, validating that the proposed circuit accurately models the soft-impact oscillator for both low and high stiffness ratios.</description>

      <title>The mechanism of tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new theory on tornadogenesis from the perspective of vortex tubes based on Kelvin-Helmholtz Theorems. When the pressure difference between the lowest pressure line from the wall cloud down to the ground and its surroundings is large enough, the increase of vorticity inside the squeezed vortex tube can reach the tornado level, and thus a tornado is born. When the pressure difference increases, the tornado strength increases. When the pressure difference decreases, the tornado strength decreases. The decay of tornadoes is caused by the decreasing pressure difference. This is our theory of the entire tornado lifespan.</description>

      <title>Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs for Interpretable Learning and Symbolic Discovery of Nonlinear Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding and modeling nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem across scientific and engineering domains. While deep learning has demonstrated remarkable potential for learning complex system behavior, achieving models that are both highly accurate and physically interpretable remains a major challenge. To address this, we propose Structured Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural ODEs (SKANODEs), a novel framework that integrates structured state-space modeling with the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). SKANODE first employs a fully trainable KAN as a universal function approximator within a structured Neural ODE framework to perform virtual sensing, recovering latent states that correspond to physically interpretable quantities such as positions and velocities. Once this structured latent representation is established, we exploit the symbolic regression capability of KAN to extract compact and interpretable expressions for the system's governing dynamics. The resulting symbolic expression is then substituted back into the Neural ODE framework and further calibrated through continued training to refine its coefficients, enhancing both the precision of the discovered equations and the predictive accuracy of system responses. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world systems demonstrate that SKANODE achieves superior performance while offering interpretable, physics-consistent models that uncover the underlying mechanisms of nonlinear dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>External charged debris in a flowing plasma : charge fluctuation induced complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the response of a flowing e-i plasma to embedded external charged debris, focusing on the periodic debris charge fluctuations that can trigger complex phenomena such as chaos and nonlinear Landau damping. We employ both kinetic and fluid simulations to analyse the plasma response to the time-dependent debris charge. Our findings indicate that the nature of the nonlinear response can be considerably different for fluctuating positively charged external debris from negatively charged debris. The simulations show that the debris charge fluctuation causes damping of the ion-acoustic wave as the debris velocity nears the ion-acoustic speed through nonlinear Landau damping and wave-wave interactions. We also present a theoretical framework to support the simulation findings. Our findings provide critical insights into debris-plasma interactions, which may be useful in applications involving space debris management.</description>
