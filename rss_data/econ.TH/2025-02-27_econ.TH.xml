      <title>Locational Energy Storage Bid Bounds for Facilitating Social Welfare Convergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel method to generate bid ceilings for energy storage in electricity markets to facilitate social welfare convergence and regulate potential market power exercises. We derive the bid bounds based on a tractable multi-period economic dispatch chance-constrained formulation that systematically incorporates the uncertainty and risk preference of the system operator. The key analytical results verify that the bounds effectively cap the truthful storage bid across all uncertainty scenarios with a guaranteed confidence level. And the cleared storage bids should be bounded by the risk-aware locational marginal price. We show that bid bonds decrease as the state of charge increases but rise with greater net load uncertainty and risk preference. We test the effectiveness of the proposed pricing mechanism based on the 8-bus ISO-NE test system, including agent-based storage bidding models. Simulation results show that the bid bounds effectively adjust storage bids to align with the social welfare objective. Under 30% renewable capacity and 20% storage capacity, the bid bounds contribute to an average reduction of 0.17% in system cost, while increasing storage profit by an average of 10.16% across various system uncertainty scenarios and bidding strategies. These benefits scale up with increased storage capacity withholding and storage capacity.</description>

      <title>Multidimensional Monotonicity and Economic Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the extreme points of multidimensional monotone functions from $[0,1]^n$ to $[0,1]$, as well as the extreme points of the set of one-dimensional marginals of these functions. These characterizations lead to new results in various mechanism design and information design problems, including public good provision with interdependent values; interim efficient bilateral trade mechanisms; asymmetric reduced form auctions; and optimal private private information structure. As another application, we also present a mechanism anti-equivalence theorem for two-agent, two-alternative social choice problems: A mechanism is payoff-equivalent to a deterministic DIC mechanism if and only if they are ex-post equivalent.</description>

      <title>Cycles and collusion in congestion games under Q-learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of Q-learning in a class of generalized Braess paradox games. These games represent an important class of network routing games where the associated stage-game Nash equilibria do not constitute social optima. We provide a full convergence analysis of Q-learning with varying parameters and learning rates. A wide range of phenomena emerges, broadly either settling into Nash or cycling continuously in ways reminiscent of "Edgeworth cycles" (i.e. jumping suddenly from Nash toward social optimum and then deteriorating gradually back to Nash). Our results reveal an important incentive incompatibility when thinking in terms of a meta-game being played by the designers of the individual Q-learners who set their agents' parameters. Indeed, Nash equilibria of the meta-game are characterized by heterogeneous parameters, and resulting outcomes achieve little to no cooperation beyond Nash. In conclusion, we suggest a novel perspective for thinking about regulation and collusion, and discuss the implications of our results for Bertrand oligopoly pricing games.</description>

      <title>Incomplete Information Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an analyst who models a strategic situation using an incomplete information game. The true game may involve correlated, duplicated belief hierarchies, but the analyst lacks knowledge of the correlation structure and can only approximate each belief hierarchy. To make predictions in this setting, the analyst uses belief-invariant Bayes correlated equilibria (BIBCE) and seeks to determine which one is justifiable. We address this question by introducing the notion of robustness: a BIBCE is robust if, for every nearby incomplete information game, there exists a BIBCE close to it. Our main result provides a sufficient condition for robustness using a generalized potential function. In a supermodular potential game, a robust BIBCE is a Bayes Nash equilibrium, whereas this need not hold in other classes of games.</description>

      <title>Sustainable intensification of small-scale aquaculture systems depends on the local context and characteristics of producers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18488v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aquaculture has been the fastest growing food production sector globally due to its potential to improve food security, stimulate economic growth, and reduce poverty. Its rapid development has been linked to sustainability challenges, many of which are still unresolved and poorly understood. Small-scale producers account for an increasing fraction of aquacultural output. At the same time, many of these producers experience poverty, food insecurity, and rely on unimproved production practices. We develop a stylized mathematical model to explore the effects of ecological, social, and economic factors on the dynamics of a small-scale pond aquaculture system. Using analytical and numerical methods, we explore the stability, asymptotic dynamics, and bifurcations of the model. Depending on the characteristics of the system, the model exhibits one of three distinct configurations: monostability with a global poverty trap in a nutrient-dominated or fish-dominated system; bistability with poverty trap and well-being attractors; multistability with poverty trap and two well-being attractors with different characteristics. The model results show that intensification can be sustainable only if it takes into account the local social-ecological context. In addition, the heterogeneity of small-scale aquaculture producers matters, as the effects of intensification can be unevenly distributed among them. Finally, more is not always better because too high nutrient input or productivity can lead to a suboptimal attractor or system collapse.</description>

      <title>It's Not All Black and White: Degree of Truthfulness for Risk-Avoiding Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The classic notion of truthfulness requires that no agent has a profitable manipulation -- an untruthful report that, for some combination of reports of the other agents, increases her utility. This strong notion implicitly assumes that the manipulating agent either knows what all other agents are going to report, or is willing to take the risk and act as-if she knows their reports.
  Without knowledge of the others' reports, most manipulations are risky -- they might decrease the manipulator's utility for some other combinations of reports by the other agents. Accordingly, a recent paper (Bu, Song and Tao, ``On the existence of truthful fair cake cutting mechanisms'', Artificial Intelligence 319 (2023), 103904) suggests a relaxed notion, which we refer to as risk-avoiding truthfulness (RAT), which requires only that no agent can gain from a safe manipulation -- one that is sometimes beneficial and never harmful.
  Truthfulness and RAT are two extremes: the former considers manipulators with complete knowledge of others, whereas the latter considers manipulators with no knowledge at all. In reality, agents often know about some -- but not all -- of the other agents. This paper introduces the RAT-degree of a mechanism, defined as the smallest number of agents whose reports, if known, may allow another agent to safely manipulate, or $n$ if there is no such number. This notion interpolates between classic truthfulness (degree $n$) and RAT (degree at least $1$): a mechanism with a higher RAT-degree is harder to manipulate safely.
  To illustrate the generality and applicability of this concept, we analyze the RAT-degree of prominent mechanisms across various social choice settings, including auctions, indivisible goods allocations, cake-cutting, voting, and stable matchings.</description>

      <title>Multiplayer War of Attrition with Asymmetric Private Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.09427v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies a war of attrition game in the setting of public good provision that combines three elements: (i) multiple players, (ii) incomplete information, and (iii) ex-ante asymmetry. In the unique equilibrium, asymmetry leads to a stratified behavior pattern where one player provides the public good instantly with a positive probability while each of the other players has a player-specific strict waiting time, before which even his highest type will not provide the good. Comparative statics show that a player with less patience, lower cost of provision, and higher reputation in value (expressed in a form of hazard rate) provides the good type-wise uniformly faster. In large societies, the cost of delay is mainly determined by the highest type of the instant-exit player.</description>

      <title>Motivated Reasoning and the Political Economy of Climate Change Inaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two office-driven politicians compete in an election by proposing policies. There are two possible states of the world: climate change is either mild, with no lasting effect on welfare if addressed properly, or severe, leading to reduced welfare even with appropriate measures. Voters receive signals about the state but may interpret them in a non-Bayesian way, holding motivated beliefs. An equilibrium always exists where voters ignore signals suggesting severe consequences, causing politicians to propose policies for mild climate change--even when they know otherwise. If severe climate change leads to only moderate welfare losses, an efficient equilibrium also exists. In this equilibrium, voters trust politicians to choose the optimal policies, implying voters choose to trust their signals, which in turn encourages optimal policy choices by politicians. The model highlights the role of political rhetoric and trust in government, and a first glance at the data reveals patterns consistent with the models predictions.</description>
