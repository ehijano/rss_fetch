      <title>Dynamics for a viscoelastic beam equation with past history and nonlocal boundary dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article aims to study the long-time dynamics of the linear viscoelastic plate equation $\displaystyle{u_{tt}+\Delta^2 u-\int_{\tau}^tg(t-s)\Delta^2u(s)ds=0}$ subject to nonlinear and nonlocal boundary conditions. This model, with $\tau=0$, was first considered by Cavalcanti (Discrete Contin. Dyn. Syst., 8(3), 675-695, 2002), where results of global existence and uniform decay rates of energy have been established. In this work, by taking $\tau=-\infty$, and considering the autonomous equivalent problem we prove that the dynamical system $(\mathcal{H},S_t)$ generated by the weak solutions has a compact global attractor $\mathfrak{A}$ (in the topology of the weak phase space $\mathcal{H}$), which in subcritical case has finite dimension and smoothness. Furthermore, when the force follows the {\it Hook Law}, we prove that $(\mathcal{H},S_t)$ possesses a (generalized) fractal exponential attractor $\mathfrak{A}_{\exp}$ with finite dimension in a space $\widetilde{\mathcal{H}}\supset\mathcal{H}$.</description>

      <title>Plastic limit of a viscoplastic Burgers equation -- A toy model for sea-ice dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the plastic Burgers equation in one space dimension, i.e., the Burgers equation featuring an additional term formally given by the p-Laplacian with p=1, or rather, by the multivalued subdifferential of the total variation functional. Our study highlights that the interplay of the advection term with the stresses given by the multivalued 1-Laplacian is a crucial feature of this model. Eventhough it is an interesting model in itsef, it can also be regarded as a one-dimensional version of the momentum balance of Hibler's model for sea-ice dynamics. Therein, the stress tensor is given by a term with similar properties as the 1-Laplacian in order to account for plastic effects of the ice. For our analysis we start out from a viscoplastic Burgers equation, i.e., a suitably regularized version of the plastic Burgers equation with a small regularization parameter $\varepsilon&gt;0$. For the viscoplastic Burgers equation, we construct a global BV-solution. In the singular limit $\varepsilon\to0$ we deduce the existence of a BV-solution for the plastic Burgers equation. In addition we show that the term arising as the limit of the regularized stresses is indeed related to an element of the subdifferential of the total variation functional.</description>

      <title>Minimality of free-boundary axial hyperplanes in high dimensional circular cones via calibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider an $(n+1)$-dimensional circular cone. Using a calibration argument, we prove that if $n \geq 4$ and the aperture of the cone is sufficiently large, the intersection of the cone with an axial hyperplane is area-minimizing with respect to free-boundary variations inside the cone.</description>

      <title>Global Well-Posedness of the Vacuum Free Boundary Problem for the Degenerate Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations With Large Data of Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of global-in-time dynamics of vacuum is crucial for understanding viscous flows. However, the corresponding large-data problems for multidimensional spherically symmetric flows have remained open, due to the coordinate singularity at the origin and the strong degeneracy on the moving boundary. In this paper, we analyze the vacuum free boundary problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate density-dependent viscosity coefficients (as in the shallow water equations) in two and three spatial dimensions. We prove that, for a general class of spherically symmetric initial density: $\rho_0^{\beta}\in H^3$ with $\beta\in (\frac{1}{3},\gamma-1]$ ($\gamma$: adiabatic exponent) vanishing on the moving boundary in the form of a distance function, no vacuum forms inside the fluid in finite time, and we establish the global well-posedness of classical solutions with large initial data. Particularly, when $\beta=\gamma-1$, the initial density contains a physical vacuum, but fails to satisfy the condition required for the Bresch-Desjardins (BD) entropy estimate when $\gamma\ge 2$. Our analysis is mainly based on a region-segmentation method: near the origin, we develop an interior BD entropy estimate, thereby obtaining flow-map-weighted estimates for the density; while, near the boundary, we construct $\rho_0$-weighted estimates for the effective velocity, which differ fundamentally from the classical BD entropy estimates and yield novel flow-map-weighted estimates for both the fluid and the effective velocities. These estimates enable us to obtain the uniform upper bound for the density and show that no cavitation occurs inside the fluid. The methodology developed here should also be useful for solving other related nonlinear equations involving similar difficulties.</description>

      <title>Extinction and persistence criteria in non-local Klausmeier model of vegetation dynamics on flat landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamics of vegetation patterns in water-limited ecosystems using a generalized Klausmeier model that incorporates non-local plant dispersal within a finite habitat. We establish the well-posedness of the system and provide a rigorous analysis of the conditions required for vegetation survival. Our results identify a critical patch size governed by the trade-off between local growth and boundary losses; habitats smaller than this threshold lead to inevitable extinction. Furthermore, we derive a critical maximal biomass density below which the population collapses to a desert state, regardless of the domain size. We determine stability criteria for stationary solutions and describe the emergence of stable, non-trivial biomass distributions. Numerical experiments comparing sub-Gaussian and super-Gaussian kernels confirm that non-local dispersal mechanisms, particularly those with fat tails, enhance ecosystem resilience by allowing vegetation to persist in smaller, fragmented habitats than predicted by classical local diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of L\'evy-type operators: operator estimates with correctors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of the paper is to study in $L_2(\R^d)$ a self-adjoint operator ${\mathbb A}_\eps$, $\eps &gt;0$, of the form $$ ({\mathbb A}_\eps u) (\x) = \int_{\R^d} \mu(\x/\eps, \y/\eps) \frac{\left( u(\x) - u(\y) \right)}{|\x - \y|^{d+\alpha}}\,d\y $$ with $1&lt; \alpha &lt; 2$;
  here the function
  $\mu(\x,\y)$ is $\Z^d$-periodic in the both variables, satisfies the symmetry relation $\mu(\x,\y) = \mu(\y,\x)$ and
  the estimates $0&lt; \mu_- \leqslant \mu(\x,\y) \leqslant \mu_+&lt; \infty$. The rigorous definition of the operator ${\mathbb A}_\eps$ is given in terms of the corresponding quadratic form. In the previous work of the authors it was shown that the resolvent $({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1}$ converges, as $\eps\to0$, in the operator norm in $L_2(\mathbb R^d)$ to the resolvent of the effective operator $A^0$, and the estimate $\|({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1} - (\A^0 + I)^{-1} \| = O(\eps^{2-\alpha})$ holds. In the present work we achieve a more accurate approximation of the resolvent of ${\mathbb A}_\eps$ which takes into account the correctors. Namely, for $N\in\mathbb N$ such that $2-1/N &lt; \alpha \le 2-1/(N+1)$, we obtain $$ \bigl\|({\mathbb A}_\eps + I)^{-1} - (\A^0 + I)^{-1} - \sum_{m=1}^N \eps^{m(2-\alpha)} \mathbb{K}_m \bigr\| = O(\eps). $$</description>

      <title>Global regularity and sharp decay to the 2D Hypo-Viscous compressible Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the global regularity and the optimal time decay rate for the 2D isentropic hypo-viscous compressible Navier-Stokes equations. Firstly, we prove that there exists a global strong solution with the small initial data are close to the constant equilibrium state in $H^s$ framework with $s&gt;1$. Furthermore, by virtue of improved Fourier splitting method and the Littlewood-Paley decomposition theory, we then establish the optimal time decay rate for low regularity data.</description>

      <title>Existence results for a non-relativistic Chern-Simons model with purely mutual interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are concerned with a skew-symmetric singular Liouville system arising in non-relativistic Chern-Simons theory. Based on its variational structure, we establish existence and multiplicity results. Since the energy functional is indefinite, standard variational approaches do not apply directly. We overcome this difficulty by introducing a suitable constrained problem and implementing a Morse-theoretical argument</description>

      <title>Asymptotic formulas for phase recovering from phaseless data of biharmonic waves at a fixed frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on phase retrieval from phaseless total-field data in biharmonic scattering problems. We prove that a phased biharmonic wave can be uniquely determined by the modulus of the total biharmonic wave within a nonempty domain. As a direct corollary, the uniqueness for the inverse biharmonic scattering problem with phaseless total-field data is established. Moreover, using the Atkinson-type asymptotic expansion, we derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the problem of phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Lebesgue points of measures and non tangential convergence of Poisson-Hermite integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study differentiability conditions on a complex measure $\nu$ at a point $x_0\in\mathbb{R}^d$, in relation with the boundary convergence at that point of the Poisson-type integral $P_t\nu=e^{-t\sqrt L}\nu$, where $L=-\Delta+|x|^2$ is the Hermite operator. In particular, we show that $x_0$ is a Lebesgue point for $\nu$ iff a slightly stronger notion than non-tangential convergence holds for $P_t\nu$ at $x_0$. We also show non-tangential convergence when $x_0$ is a $\sigma$-point of $\nu$, a weaker notion than Lebesgue point, which for $d=1$ coincides with the classical Fatou condition.</description>

      <title>An Inverse Almost Periodic Problem for a Semilinear Strongly Damped Wave Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07081v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper investigates an inverse boundary value problem for a semilinear strongly damped wave equation with the Dirichlet boundary condition in Sobolev spaces of bounded (in particular, almost periodic and periodic) functions. In addition to finding a weak solution, we also determine a source coefficient in the right-hand side of the differential equation. To make the problem well-posed, an integral-type overdetermination condition is imposed. After reducing the inverse problem to a direct one, we solve the latter in several steps. First, we prove the existence and uniqueness of a weak solution to the corresponding initial-boundary value problem on a finite time interval. Next, we show that this solution can be extended in a bounded way to the semiaxis $t\ge 0$. In the following step, we further extend this bounded solution to all $t\in R$. Finally, we establish that if the data of the original problem are almost periodic (or periodic), then the resulting bounded weak solution is itself almost periodic (or periodic).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a bound on the heat trace of the Neumann Laplacian on a convex domain that captures the first two terms in its small-time expansion, but is valid for all times and depends on the underlying domain only through very simple geometric characteristics. This is proved via a precise and uniform expansion of the on-diagonal heat kernel close to the boundary. Most of our results are valid without the convexity assumption and we also consider two-term asymptotics for the heat trace for Lipschitz domains.</description>

      <title>Classification of single-bubble blow-up solutions for Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Calogero--Moser derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (CM-DNLS), a mass-critical and completely integrable dispersive model. Recent works established finite-time blow-up constructions and soliton resolution, describing the asymptotic behaviors of blow-up solutions.
  In this paper, we go beyond soliton resolution and provide a sharp classification of finite-time blow-up dynamics in the \textit{single-bubble} regime. Assuming that a solution blows up at time $0&lt;T&lt;\infty$ with a single-soliton profile, we determine all possible blow-up rates. For initial data in $H^{2L+1}(\mathbb{R})$ with $L\ge1$, we prove a dichotomy: either the solution lies in a \emph{quantized regime}, where the scaling parameter satisfies \[
  \lambda(t)\sim (T-t)^{2k},\qquad 1\le k\le L, \] with convergent phase and translation parameters, or it lies in an \emph{exotic regime}, where the blow-up rate satisfies $\lambda(t)\lesssim (T-t)^{2L+\frac 32}$. To our knowledge, this is the first classification result for quantized blow-up dynamics in the class of dispersive models. We provide a framework for identifying the quantized blow-up rates in classification problems.
  The proof relies on a modulation analysis combined with the hierarchy of conservation laws provided by the complete integrability of (CM-DNLS). However, it does not use \emph{more refined integrability-based techniques}, such as the inverse scattering method, the method of commuting flows, or the explicit formula. As a result, our analysis applies beyond the chiral solutions.</description>

      <title>Critical points of solutions of elliptic equations in divergence form in planar non simply connected domains with smooth or nonsmooth boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical points of the solution of second elliptic equations in divergence and diagonal form with a bounded and positive definite coefficient, under the assumption that the statement of the Hopf lemma holds (sign assumptions on its normal derivatives) along the boundary. The proof combines the argument principle introduced in [1] for elliptic equations with the representation formula (using quasi-conformal mappings) for operators in divergence form in simply connected domains [2]. The case of a degenerate coefficient is also treated where we combine the level lines technique and the maximum principle with the argument principle. Finally, some numerical experiments on illustrative examples are presented.

      <title>Log-concavity of solutions of parabolic equations related to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator and applications</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the log-concavity of the kernel for the parabolic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator in a bounded, convex domain. Consequently, we get the preservation of the log-concavity of the initial datum by the related flow. As an application, we give another proof of a Brunn-Minkowski type inequality for the first eigenvalue of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck operator and of the log-concavity of the related first eigenfunction (both results have been proved in [9], by different methods).</description>

      <title>Global renormalized solutions to Boltzmann systems modeling mixture gases of monatomic and polyatomic species</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by DiPerna-Lions' work \cite{Diperna-Lions}, we study the renormalized solutions to the large-data Cauchy problem of the Boltzmann systems modeling mixture gases of monatomic and polyatomic species, in which the distribution functions $f_\alpha$ characterized the polyatomic species contain the continuous internal energy variable $I \in \mathbb{R}_+$. We first construct the smooth approximated problem and establish the corresponding uniform and physically natural bounds. Then, by employing the averaged velocity (-internal energy) lemma, we can show that the weak $L^1$ limit of the approximated solution is exactly a renormalized solution what we required. Moreover, we also justify that the constructed renormalized solution subjects to the entropy inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a critical problem for an operator of mixed order obtained by the superposition of a Laplacian with a fractional Laplacian. The main novelty is that we consider a mixed operator of the form $-\Delta- \gamma(-\Delta)^s$, namely we suppose that the fractional Laplacian has the ``wrong sign'' and can be seen as a nonlocal perturbation of the purely local case, which is needed to produce a nontrivial solution of the critical problem.</description>

      <title>Backward Reconstruction of the Chafee--Infante Equation via Physics-Informed WGAN-GP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a physics-informed Wasserstein GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) for solving the inverse Chafee--Infante problem on two-dimensional domains with Dirichlet boundary conditions. The objective is to reconstruct an unknown initial condition from a near-equilibrium state obtained after 100 explicit forward Euler iterations of the reaction-diffusion equation \[ u_t - \gamma\Delta u + \kappa\left(u^3 - u\right)=0. \] Because this mapping strongly damps high-frequency content, the inverse problem is severely ill-posed and sensitive to noise.
  Our approach integrates a U-Net generator, a PatchGAN critic with spectral normalization, Wasserstein loss with gradient penalty, and several physics-informed auxiliary terms, including Lyapunov energy matching, distributional statistics, and a crucial forward-simulation penalty. This penalty enforces consistency between the predicted initial condition and its forward evolution under the \emph{same} forward Euler discretization used for dataset generation. Earlier experiments employing an Eyre-type semi-implicit solver were not compatible with this residual mechanism due to the cost and instability of Newton iterations within batched GPU training.
  On a dataset of 50k training and 10k testing pairs on $128\times128$ grids (with natural $[-1,1]$ amplitude scaling), the best trained model attains a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately \textbf{0.23988159} on the full test set, with a sample-wise standard deviation of about \textbf{0.00266345}. The results demonstrate stable inversion, accurate recovery of interfacial structure, and robustness to high-frequency noise in the initial data.</description>

      <title>Subprincipal Control of Pseudospectral Quasimodes, II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07743v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we continue the analysis of the effects of semiclassical sub principal controlled quasimodes, approximate solutions to P(h)u(h,b), depending on the subprincipal symbol b, which can give spectral insta bility (pseudospectrum). We consider a pseudodifferential operator, which has double zeros for the principal symbol, p. This means that p = dp = 0 in a small neighborhood. In the first paper in this series, we considered operators with transversal inter sections of bicharacteristics. Now we study operators with tangential in tersections of bicharacteristics, as well as with double characteristics for p. We put the pseudodifferential operator on normal form microlocally, and use a model operator, P(h) to test for quasimodes. We demonstrate two cases where this happens. We shall also continue with more advanced cases, when the operators are factorable to P(h) = P2(h)P1(h,B), thus annihilating the subprincipal control over the quasimodes.</description>

      <title>On the well-posedness of the initial value problem for the MMT model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the initial value problem (IVP) for the two-parameter family of dispersive wave equations known as the Majda-McLaughlin-Tabak (MMT) model, which arises in the weak turbulence theory of random waves. The MMT model can be viewed as a derivative nonlinear Schr\"odinger (dNLS) equation where both the nonlinearity and dispersion involve nonlocal fractional derivatives. The purpose of this study is twofold: first, to establish a sharp well-posedness theory for the MMT model; and second, to identify the critical threshold for the derivative in the nonlinearity relative to the dispersive order required to ensure well-posedness. As a by-product, we establish sharp well-posedness for non-local fractional dNLS equations; notably, our results resolve the regularity endpoint left open in https://www.aimsciences.org/article/doi/10.3934/dcdsb.2022039 .</description>

      <title>On a stochastic Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a stochastic version of the Cahn-Hilliard-Brinkman model in a smooth two- or three-dimensional domain with dynamical boundary conditions. The system describes creeping two-phase flows and is basically a coupling of the Brinkman equation for the velocity field that governs the flow through the porous media coupled with convective Cahn-Hilliard equations for the phase field, both with two independent sources of randomness given by general multiplicative-type Wiener noises in the Cahn-Hilliard equations. The existence of a weak solution, both in the probabilistic and PDEs sense, is proved. Our construction of a solution is based on the classical Faedo-Galerkin approximation, the Yosida approximation and uses a compactness method. Our paper is the first attempt to generalize the paper \cite{Colli+Knopf+Schimperna+Signor_2024} to a stochastic setting.</description>

      <title>New Calabi-Yau Metrics of Taub-NUT Type on C^{N+1}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of complete non-flat Calabi-Yau metrics on C^{N+1} for every N &gt;= 3, which generalize the Taub-NUT metrics from C^2 and C^3 and whose tangent cone at infinity is R^N. The construction relies on the generalized Gibbons-Hawking ansatz. A key obstacle is that the volume-form defect of the ansatz fails to decay near certain components of the discriminant locus, producing singularities more severe than those encountered in dimension three, we resolve this by a gluing procedure.</description>

      <title>The past stability of Kasner singularities for the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum spacetime under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06957v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we give a new proof to a past stability result established in Fournodavlos-Rodnianski-Speck (arXiv:2012.05888), for Kasner solutions of the $(3+1)$-dimensional Einstein vacuum equations under polarized $U(1)$-symmetry. Our method, inspired by Beyer-Oliynyk-Olvera-Santamar{\'\i}a-Zheng (arXiv:1907.04071, arXiv:2502.09210), relies on a newly developed $(2+1)$ orthonormal-frame decomposition and a careful symmetrization argument, after which the Fuchsian techniques can be applied.
  We show that the perturbed solutions are asymptotically pointwise Kasner, geodesically incomplete and crushing at the Big Bang singularity. They are achieved by reducing the $(3+1)$ Einstein vacuum equations to a Fuchsian system coupled with several constraint equations, with the symmetry assumption playing an important role in the reduction. Using Fuchsian theory together with finite speed of constraints propagation, we obtain global existence and precise asymptotics of the solutions up to the singularities.</description>

      <title>A Relaxed Direct-insertion Downscaling Method For Discrete-in-time Data Assimilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper improves the spectrally-filtered direct-insertion downscaling method for discrete-in-time data assimilation by introducing a relaxation parameter that overcomes a constraint on the observation frequency. Numerical simulations demonstrate that taking the relaxation parameter proportional to the time between observations allows one to vary the observation frequency over a wide range while maintaining convergence of the approximating solution to the reference solution. Under the same assumptions we analytically prove that taking the observation frequency to infinity results in the continuous-in-time nudging method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report partial progress on the weak coupling limit behavior of observables for the periodic quantum Lorentz gas. Our results indicate that for certain observables, the limit behavior is trivial and can be described via a transport equation, while for other observables, the existence of the limit hinges on the regularity properties at resonant momenta of a certain Bloch-Wigner transform. We are currently unable to prove or disprove this regularity property, and so the weak coupling limit for these observables remains an open question. A novelty of this work is the use of the sewing lemma in the derivation of the kinetic scaling limit for almost every mometum.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by a parabolic system of Li-Yuan-Zhang and the continuity equation of La Nave-Tian, we study a system of elliptic equations for a K\"ahler metric $\omega$ and a closed $(1, 1)$-form $\alpha$. Assuming a uniform estimate for $\omega$, we prove higher order estimates and smooth convergence to a cscK metric coupled to a harmonic $(1, 1)$-form. A simplification of the system is used to recover existence results for K\"ahler-Einstein metrics when $c_1(X) &lt; 0$. On Riemann surfaces with genus at least $2$, we show smooth convergence to the unique K\"ahler-Einstein metric from a large class of initial data.</description>

Abstract: The physical quantities in a gas should vary continuously across a shock. However, the physics inherent in the compressible Euler equations is insufficient to describe the width or structure of the shock. We demonstrate the existence of weak shock profiles to the kinetic Landau equation, that is, traveling wave solutions with Maxwellian asymptotic states whose hydrodynamic quantities satisfy the Rankine-Hugoniot conditions. These solutions serve to capture the structure of weak shocks at the kinetic level. Previous works considered only the Boltzmann equation with hard sphere and angular cut-off potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(\mathfrak{M},\rho,\mu)$ be a metric measure space satisfying a doubling condition, $p_0\in (1,\infty)$, and $T(t):L^{p_0}(\mathfrak{M},\mu)\rightarrow L^{p_0}(\mathfrak{M},\mu)$, $t\geq 0$, a strongly continuous semi-group. We provide sufficient conditions under which $T(t)$ is given by integration against an integral kernel satisfying higher-order Gaussian bounds of the form \[
  \left| K_t(x,y) \right| \leq C \exp\left( -c \left( \frac{\rho(x,y)^{2\kappa}}{t} \right)^{\frac{1}{2\kappa-1}} \right) \mu\left( B_\rho\left(x,\rho(x,y)+t^{1/2\kappa}\right) \right)^{-1}, \] where $B_\rho$ denotes the metric ball. We also provide conditions for similar bounds on ``derivatives'' of $K_t(x,y)$ and our results are localizable. If $A$ is the generator of $T(t)$ the main hypothesis is that $\partial_t -A$ and $\partial_t-A^{*}$ satisfy a hypoelliptic estimate at every scale, uniformly in the scale. We present applications to subelliptic PDEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we derive a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation with obstacle from a discrete non-linear integro-differential model of population dynamics, with exponentially decaying mutation kernel. The exponential decay of the kernel leads to a modification of the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation obtained previously from continuous models in \cite{BMP}. We consider a population composed of individuals characterized by a quantitative trait, subject to selection, mutation and competition. In a regime of small mutations, small spatial discretization step and large time we prove that the WKB transformation of the density converges to a viscosity solution of a constrained Hamilton-Jacobi equation with obstacle.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Analysis on Sharpened Singular Adams-Type Inequalities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a sharp Adams-type inequality in higher-order function spaces with singular weights on $\mathbb{R}^n$. A sharp singular concentration-compactness principle, improving Lions' result, is also proved. The study distinguishes between critical and subcritical sharp singular Adams-type inequalities and shows their equivalence. Furthermore, we analyze the asymptotic behavior of the associated bounds and relate the suprema of the critical and subcritical cases. A new compact embedding, crucial to our analysis, is also derived. Moreover, as an application of these results, by employing the mountain pass theorem, we study the existence of nontrivial solutions to a class of nonhomogeneous quasilinear elliptic equations involving the $(p,\frac{n}{2})$-biharmonic operator with singular exponential growth.</description>

      <title>Scalar behavior for a complex multi-soliton arising in blow-up for a semilinear wave equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with blow-up for the complex-valued semilinear wave equation with power nonlinearity in dimension 1. Up to a rotation of the solution in the complex plane, we show that near a characteristic blow-up point, the solution behaves exactly as in the real-valued case. Namely, up to a rotation in the complex plane, the solution decomposes into a sum of a finite number of decoupled solitons with alternate signs. The main novelty of our proof is a resolution of a complex-valued first order Toda system governing the evolution of the positions and the phases of the solitons.</description>

      <title>Shrinking vs. expanding: the evolution of spatial support in degenerate Keller-Segel systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider radially symmetric solutions of the degenerate Keller-Segel system \begin{align*}
  \begin{cases}
  \partial_t u=\nabla\cdot (u^{m-1}\nabla u - u\nabla v),\\
  0=\Delta v -\mu +u,\quad\mu =\frac{1}{|\Omega|}\int_\Omega u,
  \end{cases} \end{align*} in balls $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^n$, $n\ge 1$, where $m&gt;1$ is arbitrary. Our main result states that the initial evolution of the positivity set of $u$ is essentially determined by the shape of the (nonnegative, radially symmetric, H\"older continuous) initial data $u_0$ near the boundary of its support $\overline{B_{r_1}(0)}\subsetneq\Omega$: It shrinks for sufficiently flat and expands for sufficiently steep $u_0$.
  More precisely, there exists an explicit constant $A_{\mathrm{crit}} \in (0, \infty)$ (depending only on $m, n, R, r_1$ and $\int_\Omega u_0$) such that if \begin{align*}
  u_0(x)\le A(r_1-|x|)^\frac{1}{m-1}
  \qquad \text{for all $|x|\in(r_0, r_1)$ and some $r_0\in(0,r_1)$ and $A&lt;A_{\mathrm{crit}}$}, \end{align*} then there are $T&gt;0$ and $\zeta&gt;0$ such that $\sup\{\, |x| \mid x \in \operatorname{supp} u(\cdot, t)\,\}\le r_1 -\zeta t$ for all $t\in(0, T)$, while if \begin{align*}
  u_0(x)\ge A(r_1-|x|)^\frac{1}{m-1}
  \qquad \text{for all $|x|\in(r_0, r_1)$ and some $r_0 \in (0, r_1)$ and $A&gt;A_{\mathrm{crit}}$}, \end{align*} then we can find $T&gt;0$ and $\zeta&gt;0$ such that $\sup\{\, |x| \mid x \in \operatorname{supp} u(\cdot, t)\,\}\ge r_1 +\zeta t$ for all $t\in(0, T)$.</description>

      <title>On the global stability and large time behavior of solutions of the Boussinesq equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16226v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the two dimensional viscous Boussinesq equations, which model stratified flows in a circular domain under the influence of a general gravitational potential $f$. First, we show that the Boussinesq equations admit steady-state solutions only in the form of hydrostatic equilibria, $(\mathbf{u},\rho,p) = (0, \rho_s, p_s)$, where the pressure gradient satisfies $\nabla p_s = -\rho_s \nabla f$. Moreover, the relation between $\rho_s$ and $f$ is constrained by $(\partial_y \rho_s, -\partial_x \rho_s) \cdot (\partial_x f, \partial_y f) = 0$, which allows us to write $\nabla \rho_s = h(x,y) \nabla f$ for some scalar function $h(x,y)$. Second, we prove that any hydrostatic equilibrium $(0, \rho_s, p_s)$ is linearly unstable if $h(x_0, y_0) &gt; 0$ at some point $(x, y) = (x_0, y_0)$. This instability coincides with the classical Rayleigh--Taylor instability. Third, by employing a series of regularity estimates, we reveal that although the presence of the Rayleigh--Taylor instability makes perturbations around the unstable equilibrium grow exponentially in time, the system ultimately converges to a state of hydrostatic equilibrium. The analysis is carried out for perturbations about an arbitrary hydrostatic equilibrium, covering both stable and unstable configurations. Finally, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the initial density perturbation under which the density converges to a profile of the form $-\gamma f + \beta$ with constants $\gamma, \beta &gt; 0$. This result underscores the system's inherent tendency to settle into a hydrostatic state, even in the presence of Rayleigh--Taylor instability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We concern the long-time behavior of mild solutions to the spatially homogeneous Boltzmann--Fermi--Dirac equation with moderately soft potential. Based on the well-posedness results in [X-G. Lu, J. Stat. Phys., 105, (2001), 353-388], we prove that the mild solution decays algebraically to the Fermi--Dirac statistics with an explicit rate. Under the framework of the level set analysis by De Giorgi, we derive an $L^\infty$ estimate which is uniform with respect to the quantum parameter $\varepsilon$. All quantitative estimates are independent of $\varepsilon$, which implies that they also hold in the classical limit, i.e., the Boltzmann equation.</description>

      <title>Instability of the Standing Pulse in Skew-Gradient Systems and Its Application to FitzHugh-Nagumo Type Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical results from Sturm-Liouville theory establish that the Morse index of a one-dimensional Sturm-Liouville operator defined on $\mathbb{R}$ is equal to the number of its associated conjugate points. Recent advancements by Beck et al.~\cite{BCJLM18} have extended these results to higher-dimensional Sturm-Liouville operators on $\mathbb{R}$, utilizing the Maslov index to characterize the spectral stability of nonlinear waves in multi-component systems. In this paper, we extend this framework further to non-self-adjoint settings by investigating skew-gradient reaction-diffusion systems. By utilizing the Maslov index and spectral flow, we derive an instability criterion for standing pulses. This approach bridges the gap between variational methods and the stability index in systems where the standard self-adjoint structure is absent. As a primary application, we apply our results to FitzHugh-Nagumo type systems, where the reaction terms for both the activator and inhibitor exhibit intrinsic nonlinearities. This provides a robust topological method to account for the influence of nonlinear inhibition on pulse stability in the non-self-adjoint regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The introduction of abstract Friedrichs operators in 2007-an operator-theoretic framework for studying classical Friedrichs operators has led to significant developments in the field, including results on well-posedness, multiplicity, and classification. More recently, the von Neumann extension theory has been explored in this context, along with connections between abstract Friedrichs operators and skew-symmetric operators.
  In this work, we show that all m-accretive extensions of abstract Friedrichs operators correspond precisely to those satisfying (V)-boundary conditions. We also establish a connection between the m-accretive extensions of abstract Friedrichs operators and their skew-symmetric components. Additionally, the three equivalent formulations of boundary conditions are unified within a single interpretive framework. To conclude, we discuss a constructive relation between (V)- and (M)-boundary conditions and examine the multiplicity of the associated M-operators. We demonstrate our results on two examples, namely, the first order ordinary differential equation on an interval, with various boundary conditions, and the second-order elliptic partial differential equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Existence and Incompressible Limit of Weak and Classical Solutions to the Cauchy Problem for Compressible Navier-Stokes Equations with Large Bulk Viscosity and Large Initial Data</title>

Abstract: This paper investigates the Cauchy problem for the barotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the constant state as far field, which could be vacuum or non-vacuum. Under the assumption of a sufficiently large bulk viscosity coefficient, we establish the global existence of weak, strong, and classical solutions for the non-vacuum far-field case, and long-time existence for the vacuum far-field case. It should be mentioned that this result is obtained without any restrictions on the size of the initial data. Moreover, we demonstrate that the solutions of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to solutions of the inhomogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, as the bulk viscosity coefficient tends to infinity. The incompressible limit of the weak solutions holds even without requiring the initial velocity to be divergence-free.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08462v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The main objective of this manuscript is to investigate the global behavior of the solutions to the viscoelastic wave equation with a linear memory term of Boltzmann type, and a nonlinear damping modeling friction, as well as a supercritical source term which is a combined power-type nonlinearities. The global existence of the solutions is obtained provided that the energy sink dominates the energy source in an appropriate sense. In more general scenarios, we prove the global existence of the solutions if the initial history value $u_0$ is taken from a subset of a suitable potential well. Based on global existence results, the energy decay rate is derived which depends on the relaxation kernel as well as the growth rate of the damping term. In addition, we study blow-up of solutions when the source is stronger than dissipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.10304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the long-time behavior of a nonlocal Cahn-Hilliard equation in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ $(d\in\{2,3\})$, subject to a kinetic rate-dependent nonlocal dynamic boundary condition. The kinetic rate $1/L$, with $L\in[0,+\infty)$, distinguishes different types of bulk-surface interactions. For general singular potentials, including the physically relevant logarithmic potential, we establish the existence of a global attractor $\mathcal{A}_m^L$ in a suitable complete metric space for any $L\in[0,+\infty)$. Moreover, we verify that the global attractor $\mathcal{A}_m^0$ is stable with respect to perturbations $\mathcal{A}_m^L$ for small $L&gt;0$. When $L\in(0,+\infty)$, based on the strict separation property of global weak solutions, we further prove the existence of exponential attractors via a short-trajectory type technique, which also implies that the global attractor has finite fractal dimension. Finally, for this case, we show that every global weak solution converges to a single equilibrium in $\mathcal{L}^\infty$ as time goes to infinity, using a generalized {\L}ojasiewicz-Simon inequality and an Alikakos-Moser type iteration.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we establish higher-order Sobolev and Rellich-type inequalities on non-compact Riemannian manifolds supporting an isoperimetric inequality. We highlight two notable settings: manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature and having Euclidean volume growth (supporting Brendle's isoperimetric inequality) and manifolds with non-positive sectional curvature (satisfying the Cartan-Hadamard conjecture or supporting Croke's isoperimetric inequality). Our proofs rely on various symmetrization techniques, the key ingredient is an iterated Talenti's comparison principle. The non-iterated version is analogous to the main result of Chen and Li [J. Geom. Anal., 2023].</description>

Abstract: We consider an optimal control problem for a two-dimensional Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system arising in the modeling of fluid-membrane interaction. The fluid dynamics is governed by the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, which are nonlinearly coupled with a sixth-order Cahn-Hilliard type equation representing the deformation of a flexible membrane through a phase-field variable. Building on the previously established existence and uniqueness of global strong solutions for the coupled system, we introduce an external forcing term acting on the fluid as the control variable. Then we seek to minimize a tracking-type cost functional, demonstrating the existence of an optimal control and deriving the associated first-order necessary optimality conditions. A key issue is to establish sufficient regularity for solutions of the adjoint system, which is crucial for the rigorous derivation of optimality conditions in the fluid dynamic setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.09322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time-frequency representations stemmed in 1932 with the introduction of the Wigner distribution. For most of the 20th century, research in this area primarily focused on defining joint probability distributions for position and momentum in quantum mechanics. Applications to electrical engineering were soon established with the seminal works of Gabor and the researchers at Bell Labs. In 2012, Bai, Li and Cheng used for the first time metaplectic operators, defined in the middle of 20th century by Van Hove, to generalize the Wigner distribution and unify effectively the most used time-frequency representations under a common framework. This work serves as a comprehensive up-to-date survey on time-frequency representations defined by means of metaplectic operators, with particular emphasis on the recent contributions by Cordero and Rodino, who exploited metaplectic operators to their limits to generalize the Wigner distributions. Their idea provides a fruitful framework where properties of time-frequency representations can be explained naturally by the structure of the symplectic group.</description>

Abstract: In the context of metric measure spaces, we introduce an axiomatic formulation of mixed local and nonlocal $p$-energy forms. Within this framework, we use the Poincar\'{e} inequality, the cutoff Sobolev inequality, and mild assumptions on the jump measure to establish the weak and strong elliptic Harnack inequalities for such mixed forms. Our approach is based on the De Giorgi--Nash--Moser method and extends the corresponding results for Dirichlet forms without the killing part, as well as for mixed energy forms on Euclidean spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08460v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an inverse source problem for a semilinear parabolic equation in a bounded domain, where the nonlinearity depends on the unknown function and its gradient through a quadratic reaction term and a Burgers-type convection term. From partial boundary observation of the time derivative and its spatial gradient on an open portion of the boundary, together with an interior snapshot of the solution at a fixed time, we aim to recover an unknown spatial source factor. The analysis combines (i) a paradifferential paralinearization in Besov spaces on a short time window, which converts the nonlinear model into a linear parabolic equation with small bounded coefficients, and (ii) a Carleman estimate for the time-differentiated equation, yielding conditional Holder stability. The approach extends the cut-off free Carleman method for linear inverse source problems to a nonlinear setting while keeping the observation geometry unchanged.</description>

      <title>Instantaneous Type I blow-up and non-uniqueness of smooth solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.09556v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any smooth, divergence-free initial data, we construct a solution of the Navier--Stokes equations that exhibits Type~I blow-up of the $L^\infty$ norm at time $T_*&gt;0$, while remaining smooth in space and time on $\mathbb T^d\times([0,T]\setminus\{T_*\})$. An instantaneous injection of energy from infinite wavenumber initiates a bifurcation from the classical solution, producing an infinite family of spatially smooth solutions with the same data and thereby violating uniqueness of the Cauchy problem. A key ingredient is the first known construction of a complete inverse energy cascade realized by a classical Navier--Stokes flow, which transfers energy from infinitely high to low frequencies. The result holds in all dimensions $d\geq2$.</description>

      <title>Bounded Solutions of the sublinear Lane-Emden-Fowler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.14246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work examines the sublinear Lane-Emden-Fowler system in two dimensional exterior domains and subsequently applies the resulting analysis to the case of a rectangular domain. Motivated by the scalar results of Constantin (1997) and Yin (2004), we extend the analysis to the coupled system case, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been previously addressed in the literature. Using the Liouville transformation, Schauder's fixed point theorem, and the sub--supersolution method, we establish the existence of bounded positive solutions under natural integrability conditions on the nonlinear coefficients. Both radial and non-radial settings are treated, and in the strictly sublinear regime $\alpha+\beta&lt;1$ we obtain additional qualitative properties, including uniform boundedness, H\"older continuity, and precise asymptotic decay rates. Finally, we present a concrete model together with numerical simulations that illustrate and validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.23272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove existence, uniqueness of weak solutions of the following nonlocal nonlinear logistic equation \begin{equation*} \begin{cases} (-\Delta)_p^s u_\lambda=\lambda u_\lambda^q - b(x)u_\lambda^r \quad \text{in} \;\Omega,\\ u_\lambda=0 \quad \text{in} \; ( \mathbb{R}^d \backslash \Omega), \\ u_\lambda&gt;0 \text{ in} \; \Omega. \end{cases}\ \end{equation*} We also prove behavior of $u_\lambda$ with respect to $\lambda,$ underlining the effect of the nonlocal operator. We then study the associated parabolic problem, proving local and global existence, uniqueness and global behavior such as stabilization, finite time extinction and blow up.</description>

      <title>Scattering from a random thin coating of nanoparticles: the Dirichlet case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08487v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time-harmonic scattering by a heterogeneous object covered with a thin layer of randomly distributed sound-soft nanoparticles. The size of the particles, their distance between each other and the layer's thickness are all of the same order but small compared to the wavelength of the incident wave. Solving the Helmholtz equation in this context can be very costly and the simulation depends on the given distribution of particles. To circumvent this, we propose, via a multi-scale asymptotic expansion of the solution, an effective model where the layer of particles is replaced by an equivalent boundary condition. The coefficients that appear in this equivalent boundary condition depend on the solutions to corrector problems of Laplace type defined on unbounded random domains. Under the assumption that the particles are distributed given a stationary and mixing random point process, we prove that those problems admit a unique solution in the proper space. We then establish quantitative error estimates for the effec tive model and present numerical simulations that illustrate our theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Mean-field limits for interacting particle systems on general adaptive dynamical networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03742v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the large-population limit of interacting particle systems evolving on adaptive dynamical networks, motivated in particular by models of opinion dynamics. In such systems, agents interact through weighted graphs whose structure evolves over time in a coupled manner with the agents' states, leading to non-exchangeable dynamics. In the dense-graph regime, we show that the asymptotic behavior is described by a Vlasov-type equation posed on an extended phase space that includes both the agents' states and identities and the evolving interaction weights. We establish this limiting equation through two complementary approaches. The first follows the mean-field methodology in the spirit of Sznitman [28]. In this framework, we impose the additional assumption that the weight dynamics is independent of one of the agent's states, an assumption that remains well motivated from a modeling perspective and allows for a direct derivation of the mean-field limit. The second approach is based on the graph limit framework and is formulated in a deterministic setting. This perspective makes it possible to remove the aforementioned restriction on the weight dynamics and to handle more general interaction structures. Our analysis includes wellposedness and stability results for the limiting Vlasov-type equation, as well as quantitative estimates ensuring the propagation of independence. We further clarify the relationship between the continuum (graph limit) formulation and the mean-field limit, thereby providing a unified description of the asymptotic dynamics of interacting particle systems on adaptive dynamical networks.</description>

      <title>Small-time global controllability of a class of bilinear fourth-order parabolic equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.23339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the small-time global controllability properties of a class of fourth-order nonlinear parabolic equations driven by a bilinear control posed on the one-dimensional torus. The controls depend only on time and act through a prescribed family of spatial profiles. Our first result establishes the small-time global approximate controllability of the system using three scalar controls, between states that share the same sign. This property is obtained by adapting the geometric control approach to the fourth-order setting, using a finite family of frequency-localized controls. We then study the small-time global exact controllability to non-zero constant states for the concerned system. This second result is achieved by analyzing the null controllability of an appropriate linearized fourth-order system and by deducing the controllability of the nonlinear bilinear model through a fixed-point argument together with the small-time global approximate control property.</description>
