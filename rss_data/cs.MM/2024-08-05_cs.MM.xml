      <title>Multimodal Fusion via Hypergraph Autoencoder and Contrastive Learning for Emotion Recognition in Conversation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition in conversation (MERC) seeks to identify the speakers' emotions expressed in each utterance, offering significant potential across diverse fields. The challenge of MERC lies in balancing speaker modeling and context modeling, encompassing both long-distance and short-distance contexts, as well as addressing the complexity of multimodal information fusion. Recent research adopts graph-based methods to model intricate conversational relationships effectively. Nevertheless, the majority of these methods utilize a fixed fully connected structure to link all utterances, relying on convolution to interpret complex context. This approach can inherently heighten the redundancy in contextual messages and excessive graph network smoothing, particularly in the context of long-distance conversations. To address this issue, we propose a framework that dynamically adjusts hypergraph connections by variational hypergraph autoencoder (VHGAE), and employs contrastive learning to mitigate uncertainty factors during the reconstruction process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal against the state-of-the-art methods on IEMOCAP and MELD datasets. We release the code to support the reproducibility of this work at https://github.com/yzjred/-HAUCL.</description>

      <title>Out-Of-Distribution Detection for Audio-visual Generalized Zero-Shot Learning: A General Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) is a challenging task requiring accurate classification of both seen and unseen classes. Within this domain, Audio-visual GZSL emerges as an extremely exciting yet difficult task, given the inclusion of both visual and acoustic features as multi-modal inputs. Existing efforts in this field mostly utilize either embedding-based or generative-based methods. However, generative training is difficult and unstable, while embedding-based methods often encounter domain shift problem. Thus, we find it promising to integrate both methods into a unified framework to leverage their advantages while mitigating their respective disadvantages. Our study introduces a general framework employing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, aiming to harness the strengths of both approaches. We first employ generative adversarial networks to synthesize unseen features, enabling the training of an OOD detector alongside classifiers for seen and unseen classes. This detector determines whether a test feature belongs to seen or unseen classes, followed by classification utilizing separate classifiers for each feature type. We test our framework on three popular audio-visual datasets and observe a significant improvement comparing to existing state-of-the-art works. Codes can be found in https://github.com/liuyuan-wen/AV-OOD-GZSL.</description>

      <title>PC$^2$: Pseudo-Classification Based Pseudo-Captioning for Noisy Correspondence Learning in Cross-Modal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of cross-modal retrieval, seamlessly integrating diverse modalities within multimedia remains a formidable challenge, especially given the complexities introduced by noisy correspondence learning (NCL). Such noise often stems from mismatched data pairs, which is a significant obstacle distinct from traditional noisy labels. This paper introduces Pseudo-Classification based Pseudo-Captioning (PC$^2$) framework to address this challenge. PC$^2$ offers a threefold strategy: firstly, it establishes an auxiliary "pseudo-classification" task that interprets captions as categorical labels, steering the model to learn image-text semantic similarity through a non-contrastive mechanism. Secondly, unlike prevailing margin-based techniques, capitalizing on PC$^2$'s pseudo-classification capability, we generate pseudo-captions to provide more informative and tangible supervision for each mismatched pair. Thirdly, the oscillation of pseudo-classification is borrowed to assistant the correction of correspondence. In addition to technical contributions, we develop a realistic NCL dataset called Noise of Web (NoW), which could be a new powerful NCL benchmark where noise exists naturally. Empirical evaluations of PC$^2$ showcase marked improvements over existing state-of-the-art robust cross-modal retrieval techniques on both simulated and realistic datasets with various NCL settings. The contributed dataset and source code are released at https://github.com/alipay/PC2-NoiseofWeb.</description>

      <title>MuChoMusic: Evaluating Music Understanding in Multimodal Audio-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01337v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal models that jointly process audio and language hold great promise in audio understanding and are increasingly being adopted in the music domain. By allowing users to query via text and obtain information about a given audio input, these models have the potential to enable a variety of music understanding tasks via language-based interfaces. However, their evaluation poses considerable challenges, and it remains unclear how to effectively assess their ability to correctly interpret music-related inputs with current methods. Motivated by this, we introduce MuChoMusic, a benchmark for evaluating music understanding in multimodal language models focused on audio. MuChoMusic comprises 1,187 multiple-choice questions, all validated by human annotators, on 644 music tracks sourced from two publicly available music datasets, and covering a wide variety of genres. Questions in the benchmark are crafted to assess knowledge and reasoning abilities across several dimensions that cover fundamental musical concepts and their relation to cultural and functional contexts. Through the holistic analysis afforded by the benchmark, we evaluate five open-source models and identify several pitfalls, including an over-reliance on the language modality, pointing to a need for better multimodal integration. Data and code are open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Hallu-PI: Evaluating Hallucination in Multi-modal Large Language Models within Perturbed Inputs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01355v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance on various visual-language understanding and generation tasks. However, MLLMs occasionally generate content inconsistent with the given images, which is known as "hallucination". Prior works primarily center on evaluating hallucination using standard, unperturbed benchmarks, which overlook the prevalent occurrence of perturbed inputs in real-world scenarios-such as image cropping or blurring-that are critical for a comprehensive assessment of MLLMs' hallucination. In this paper, to bridge this gap, we propose Hallu-PI, the first benchmark designed to evaluate Hallucination in MLLMs within Perturbed Inputs. Specifically, Hallu-PI consists of seven perturbed scenarios, containing 1,260 perturbed images from 11 object types. Each image is accompanied by detailed annotations, which include fine-grained hallucination types, such as existence, attribute, and relation. We equip these annotations with a rich set of questions, making Hallu-PI suitable for both discriminative and generative tasks. Extensive experiments on 12 mainstream MLLMs, such as GPT-4V and Gemini-Pro Vision, demonstrate that these models exhibit significant hallucinations on Hallu-PI, which is not observed in unperturbed scenarios. Furthermore, our research reveals a severe bias in MLLMs' ability to handle different types of hallucinations. We also design two baselines specifically for perturbed scenarios, namely Perturbed-Reminder and Perturbed-ICL. We hope that our study will bring researchers' attention to the limitations of MLLMs when dealing with perturbed inputs, and spur further investigations to address this issue. Our code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/NJUNLP/Hallu-PI.</description>

      <title>Toward Automatic Relevance Judgment using Vision--Language Models for Image--Text Retrieval Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01363v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vision--Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated success across diverse applications, yet their potential to assist in relevance judgments remains uncertain. This paper assesses the relevance estimation capabilities of VLMs, including CLIP, LLaVA, and GPT-4V, within a large-scale \textit{ad hoc} retrieval task tailored for multimedia content creation in a zero-shot fashion. Preliminary experiments reveal the following: (1) Both LLaVA and GPT-4V, encompassing open-source and closed-source visual-instruction-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs), achieve notable Kendall's $\tau \sim 0.4$ when compared to human relevance judgments, surpassing the CLIPScore metric. (2) While CLIPScore is strongly preferred, LLMs are less biased towards CLIP-based retrieval systems. (3) GPT-4V's score distribution aligns more closely with human judgments than other models, achieving a Cohen's $\kappa$ value of around 0.08, which outperforms CLIPScore at approximately -0.096. These findings underscore the potential of LLM-powered VLMs in enhancing relevance judgments.</description>
