Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) are an important space radiation source, especially for the space weather environment in the inner heliosphere. The energy spectrum of SEP events is crucial both for evaluating their radiation effects and for understanding their acceleration process at the source region and their propagation mechanism. In this work, we investigate the properties of the SEP peak flux spectra and the fluence spectra and their potential formation mechanisms using statistical methods. We aim to advance our understanding of both SEPs' acceleration and propagation mechanisms. Employing the dataset of European Space Agency's Solar Energetic Particle Environment Modelling (SEPEM) program, we have obtained and fitted the peak-flux and fluence proton spectra of more than a hundred SEP events from 1974 to 2018. We analyzed the relationship among the solar activity, X-ray peak intensity of solar flares and the SEP spectral parameters. Based on the assumption that the initial spectrum of accelerated SEPs generally has a power-law distribution and also the diffusion coefficient has a power-law dependence on particle energy, we can assess both the source and propagation properties using the observed SEP event peak flux and fluence energy spectra. We confirm that SEPs' spectral properties are influenced by the solar source and the interplanetary conditions and their transportation process can be influenced by different phases of solar cycle. This study provides an observational perspective on the double power-law spectral characteristics of the SEP energy spectra, showing their correlation with the adiabatic cooling and diffusion processes during the particle propagation from the Sun to the observer. This contributes to a deeper understanding of the acceleration and propagation of SEP events, in particular the possible origins of the double-power law.</description>

      <title>Investigation on upstream ion events from L1 point observation: New Insights</title>

Abstract: Origin of energetic upstream ions propagating towards the Sun from the Earth's bow shock is not understood clearly. In this letter, relationship between solar wind suprathermal and upstream ions has been investigated by analyzing fluxes of H, 4He, and CNO obtained from multidirectional in-situ measurements at the first Lagrange point of the Sun-Earth system during 2012-2014. 49 upstream events have been selected based on flux enhancements of the upstream ions in comparison with the solar wind suprathermal ions. An energy cut-off at less than 300 keV is observed for the upstream events. This is attributed to the efficacy of the particle acceleration process near the bow shock. Interestingly, spectra of upstream ions soften systematically as compared to the spectra of their solar wind counterpart with decreasing mass of elements. The degree of spectral softening increases with decreasing mass-to-charge ratio of the species. Since during most of the events the interplanetary magnetic field was radial, we argue that cross-field diffusion of upstream ions gives rise to the modulation (spectral softening) of upstream ions, which is dependent on the mass-to-charge ratio of species. Our work indicates towards a systematic change in solar wind suprathermal ions after interaction with the bow shock.</description>
