      <title>Social learning with complex contagion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a mathematical model that combines the concepts of complex contagion with payoff-biased imitation, to describe how social behaviors spread through a population. Traditional models of social learning by imitation are based on simple contagion -- where an individual may imitate a more successful neighbor following a single interaction. Our framework generalizes this process to incorporate complex contagion, which requires multiple exposures before an individual considers adopting a different behavior. We formulate this as a discrete time and state stochastic process in a finite population, and we derive its continuum limit as an ordinary differential equation that generalizes the replicator equation, the most widely used dynamical model in evolutionary game theory. When applied to linear frequency-dependent games, our social learning with complex contagion produces qualitatively different outcomes than traditional imitation dynamics: it can shift the Prisoner's Dilemma from a unique all-defector equilibrium to either a stable mixture of cooperators and defectors in the population, or a bistable system; it changes the Snowdrift game from a single to a bistable equilibrium; and it can alter the Coordination game from bistability at the boundaries to two internal equilibria. The long-term outcome depends on the balance between the complexity of the contagion process and the strength of selection that biases imitation towards more successful types. Our analysis intercalates the fields of evolutionary game theory with complex contagions, and it provides a synthetic framework that describes more realistic forms of behavioral change in social systems.</description>

      <title>Phylogenetic least squares estimation without genetic distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.12717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.12717v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Least squares estimation of phylogenies is an established family of methods with good statistical properties. State-of-the-art least squares phylogenetic estimation proceeds by first estimating a distance matrix, which is then used to determine the phylogeny by minimizing a squared-error loss function. Here, we develop a method for least squares phylogenetic inference that does not rely on a pre-estimated distance matrix. Our approach allows us to circumvent the typical need to first estimate a distance matrix by forming a new loss function inspired by the phylogenetic likelihood score function; in this manner, inference is not based on a summary statistic of the sequence data, but directly on the sequence data itself. We use a Jukes-Cantor substitution model to show that our method leads to improvements over ordinary least squares phylogenetic inference, and is even observed to rival maximum likelihood estimation in terms of topology estimation efficiency. Using a Kimura 2-parameter model, we show that our method also allows for estimation of the global transition/transversion ratio simultaneously with the phylogeny and its branch lengths. This is impossible to accomplish with any other distance-based method as far as we know. Our developments pave the way for more optimal phylogenetic inference under the least squares framework, particularly in settings under which likelihood-based inference is infeasible, including when one desires to build a phylogeny based on information provided by only a subset of all possible nucleotide substitutions such as synonymous or non-synonymous substitutions.</description>

      <title>Singular effect of linkage on long term genetic gain in the infinitesimal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04095v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: During the founding of the field of quantitative genetics, Fisher formulated in 1918 his ``infinitesimal model'' that provided a novel mathematical framework to describe the Mendelian transmission of quantitative traits. If the infinitely many genes in that model are assumed to segregate independently during reproduction, corresponding to having no linkage, directional selection asymptotically leads to a constant genetic gain at each generation. In reality, genes are subject to strong linkage because they lie on chromosomes and thus segregate in a correlated way. Various approximations have been used in the past to study that more realistic case of the infinitesimal model with the expectation that the asymptotic gain per generation is modestly decreased. To treat this system even in the strong linkage limit, we take the genes to lie on continuous chromosomes. Surprisingly, the consequences of genetic linkage are in fact rather singular, changing the nature of the long-term gain per generation: the asymptotic gain vanishes rather than being simply decreased. Nevertheless, the per-generation gain tends to zero sufficiently slowly for the total gain, accumulated over generations, to be unbounded.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric inference of effective reproduction number dynamics from wastewater pathogen surveillance data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.15770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.15770v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Concentrations of pathogen genomes measured in wastewater have recently become available as a new data source to use when modeling the spread of infectious diseases. One promising use for this data source is inference of the effective reproduction number, the average number of individuals a newly infected person will infect. We propose a model where new infections arrive according to a time-varying immigration rate which can be interpreted as an average number of secondary infections produced by one infectious individual per unit time. This model allows us to estimate the effective reproduction number from concentrations of pathogen genomes while avoiding difficult to verify assumptions about the dynamics of the susceptible population. As a byproduct of our primary goal, we also produce a new model for estimating the effective reproduction number from case data using the same framework. We test this modeling framework in an agent-based simulation study with a realistic data generating mechanism which accounts for the time-varying dynamics of pathogen shedding. Finally, we apply our new model to estimating the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 in Los Angeles, California, using pathogen RNA concentrations collected from a large wastewater treatment facility.</description>
