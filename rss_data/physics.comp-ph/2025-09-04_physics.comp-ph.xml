      <title>Accurate and scalable deep Maxwell solvers using multilevel iterative methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks have promise as surrogate partial differential equation (PDE) solvers, but it remains a challenge to use these concepts to solve problems with high accuracy and scalability. In this work, we show that neural network surrogates can combine with iterative algorithms to accurately solve PDE problems featuring different scales, resolutions, and boundary conditions. We develop a subdomain neural operator model that supports arbitrary Robin-type boundary condition inputs, and we show that it can be utilized as a flexible preconditioner to iteratively solve subdomain problems with bounded accuracy. We further show that our subdomain models can facilitate the construction of global coarse spaces to enable accelerated, large scale PDE problem solving based on iterative multilevel domain decomposition. With two-dimensional Maxwell's equations as a model system, we train a single network to simulate large scale problems with different sizes, resolutions, wavelengths, and dielectric media distribution. We further demonstrate the utility of our platform in performing the accurate inverse design of multi-wavelength nanophotonic devices. Our work presents a promising path to building accurate and scalable multi-physics surrogate solvers for large practical problems.</description>

      <title>A Highly Scalable TDMA for GPUs and Its Application to Flow Solver Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A tridiagonal matrix algorithm (TDMA), Pipelined-TDMA, is developed for multi-GPU systems to resolve the scalability bottlenecks caused by the sequential structure of conventional divide-and-conquer TDMA. The proposed method pipelines multiple tridiagonal systems, overlapping communication with computation and executing GPU kernels concurrently to hide non-scalable stages behind scalable compute stages. To maximize performance, the batch size is optimized to strike a balance between GPU occupancy and pipeline efficiency: larger batches improve throughput for solving tridiagonal systems, while excessively large batches reduce pipeline utilization. Performance evaluations on up to 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs using a one-dimensional (1D) slab-type domain decomposition confirm that, except for the terminal phase of the pipeline, the proposed method successfully hides most of the non-scalable execution time-specifically inter-GPU communication and low-occupancy computation. The solver achieves ideal weak scaling up to 64 GPUs with one billion grid cells per GPU and reaches 74.7 percent of ideal performance in strong scaling tests for a 4-billion-cell problem, relative to a 4-GPU baseline. The optimized TDMA is integrated into an ADI-based fractional-step method to remove the scalability bottleneck in the Poisson solver of the flow solver (Ha et al., 2021). In a 9-billion-cell simulation on 64 GPUs, the TDMA component in the Poisson solver is accelerated by 4.37x, contributing to a 1.31x overall speedup of the complete flow solver.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Sampling in the Age of Machine Learning: Algorithms and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations hold great promise for providing insight into the microscopic behavior of complex molecular systems. However, their effectiveness is often constrained by long timescales associated with rare events. Enhanced sampling methods have been developed to address these challenges, and recent years have seen a growing integration with machine learning techniques. This review provides a comprehensive overview of how they are reshaping the field, with a particular focus on the data-driven construction of collective variables. Furthermore, these techniques have also improved biasing schemes and unlocked novel strategies via reinforcement learning and generative approaches. In addition to methodological advances, we highlight applications spanning different areas such as biomolecular processes, ligand binding, catalytic reactions, and phase transitions. We conclude by outlining future directions aimed at enabling more automated strategies for rare-event sampling.</description>

      <title>An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03539v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step, resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and resulting transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of lag time. We derive an additional expression for the transition rate, relate the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics based on the mean-squared residual, and discuss further numerical considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.</description>

      <title>Exploiting correlations in multi-coincidence Coulomb explosion patterns for differentiating molecular structures using machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coulomb explosion imaging (CEI) is a powerful technique for capturing the real-time motion of individual atoms during ultrafast photochemical reactions. CEI generates high-dimensional data with naturally embedded correlations that allow mapping the coordinated motion of nuclei in molecules. This enables reliable separation of competing reaction pathways and makes this approach uniquely suited for characterizing weak reaction channels. However, rich information contained in experimental CEI patterns remains largely underexploited due to challenges in visualizing correlations between multiple observables in multi-dimensional parameter space. Here we present a new approach to CEI of intermediate-sized polyatomic molecules, detecting up to eight ionic fragments in coincidence and leveraging machine-learning-based analysis to identify patterns and correlations in the resulting high-dimensional momentum-space data, enabling robust molecular structure identification and differentiation. Our approach provides high-dimensional background-free data encoding exceptionally rich structural information and establishes an automated, scalable framework for extracting insightful information from the data. As a demonstration, we apply this method to image and distinguish dichloroethylene isomers, showcasing its potential for broader applications in molecular imaging. Our results pave the way for channel-specific analysis of ultrafast structural dynamics in chemically relevant systems, particularly for disentangling mixed reaction pathways and detecting contributions from weak channels and minority species.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Low-Dimensional Turbulence via Multi-Dimensional Hybrid Quantum Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The prediction of complex dynamics remains an open problem across many domains of physics, where nonlinearities and multiscale interactions severely limit the reliability of conventional forecasting methods. Quantum reservoir computing (QRC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for information processing by exploiting the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space, where the dynamics of quantum systems take place. Here, we introduce a hybrid quantum-classical reservoir architecture capable of handling multivariate time series through quantum evolution combined with classical memory enhancement. Our model employs a five-qubit transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian with input-modulated dynamics and temporal multiplexing, enabling the encoding of input signals over multiple timescales. We apply this framework to two paradigmatic models of chaotic behavior in fluid dynamics, where multiscale dynamics and nonlinearities play a dominant role: a low-dimensional truncation of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations and the Lorenz-63 system. By systematically scanning the quantum system's parameter space, we identify regions that maximize forecasting performance, as measured by the Valid Prediction Time. The observed robustness and reliable performances for both dynamical systems suggest that this hybrid quantum approach offers a flexible platform for modelling complex nonlinear time series.</description>

      <title>An analog-electronic implementation of a harmonic oscillator recurrent neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Oscillatory recurrent networks, such as the Harmonic Oscillator Recurrent Network (HORN) model, offer advantages in parameter efficiency, learning speed, and robustness relative to traditional non-oscillating architectures. Yet, while many implementations of physical neural networks exploiting attractor dynamics have been studied, implementations of oscillatory models in analog-electronic hardware that utilize the networks' transient dynamics so far are lacking. This study explores the feasibility of implementing HORNs in analog-electronic hardware while maintaining the computational performance of the digital counterpart. Using a digital twin approach, we trained a four-node HORN in silico for sequential MNIST classification and transferred the trained parameters to an analog electronic implementation. A set of custom error metrics indicated that the analog system is able to successfully replicate the dynamics of the digital model in most test cases. However, despite the overall well-matching dynamics, when using the readout layer of the digital model on the data generated by the analog system, we only observed $28.39\%$ agreement with the predictions of the digital model. An analysis shows that this mismatch is due to a precision difference between the analog hardware and the floating-point representation exploited by the digital model to perform classification tasks. When the analog system was utilized as a reservoir with a re-trained linear readout, its classification performance could be recovered to that of the digital twin, indicating preserved information content within the analog dynamics. This proof-of-concept establishes that analog electronic circuits can effectively implement oscillatory neural networks for computation, providing a demonstration of energy-efficient analog systems that exploit brain-inspired transient dynamics for computation.</description>

      <title>Shape spectra of elastic shells with surface-adsorbed semiflexible polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The shape of biological shells, such as cell nuclei, membranes, and vesicles, often deviates from a perfect sphere due to an interplay of complex interactions with a myriad of molecular structures. In particular, semiflexible biopolymers adsorbed to the surfaces of such shells seem to affect their morphological properties. While the effect of a single, long, semiflexible chain is relatively well characterized, the mechanisms by which a high density of such surface-adsorbed polymers can alter the morphology of a spherical, soft confinement, akin to biological shells, remain relatively poorly understood. Here, we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to investigate how surface adsorption of many semiflexible polymers affects the morphology of a pressurized bead-spring shell, which is spherical in the absence of these chains. By varying the attraction strength between the chains and the shell surface, chain concentration, and the polymerization degree of chains, we demonstrate that strong surface localization of the chains can induce severe shape distortions and shrinkage, depending on the chain length and concentration. Conversely, weak localization does not induce significant shape fluctuations, yet nematically ordered phases appear on the surface. Notably, these ordered phases lead to elliptic shell shapes for chains with sizes comparable to or longer than the radius of the confinement when the elastic shell is composed of extensible, harmonic bonds. Overall, our findings offer a strategy to control the shape of synthetic shells by manipulating peripheral localization and length of semiflexible polymers while suggesting a mechanism for non-spherical shapes appearing in some biological systems.</description>

      <title>The Non-commutative Spaces of Higher-Order Networks of Bach's Solo Violin Compositions: Dimension, Curvature, and Distance through the Spectral Triplet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04311v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our work is concerned with simplicial complexes that describe higher-order interactions in real complex systems. This description allows to go beyond the pairwise node-to-node representation that simple networks provide and to capture a hierarchy of interactions of different orders. The prime contribution of this work is the introduction of geometric measures for these simplicial complexes. We do so by noting the non-commutativity of the algebra associated with their matrix representations and consequently we bring to bear the spectral triplet formalism of Connes on these structures and then notions of associated dimensions, curvature, and distance can be computed to serve as characterizing features in addition to known topological metrics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Norton dynamics: An alternative approach for the computation of transport coefficients in dissipative particle dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.14479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a novel alternative approach for the computation of transport coefficients at mesoscales. While standard nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) approaches fix the forcing and measure the average induced flux in the system driven out of equilibrium, the so-called ``stochastic Norton dynamics'' instead fixes the value of the flux and measures the average magnitude of the forcing needed to induce it. We extend recent results obtained in Langevin dynamics to consider the generalisation of the stochastic Norton dynamics in the popular dissipative particle dynamics (DPD) at mesoscales, important for a wide range of complex fluids and soft matter applications. We demonstrate that the responses profiles for both the NEMD and stochastic Norton dynamics approaches coincide in both linear and nonlinear regimes, indicating that the stochastic Norton dynamics can indeed act as an alternative approach for the computation of transport coefficients, including the mobility and the shear viscosity, as the NEMD dynamics. In addition, based on the linear response of the DPD system with small perturbations, we derive a closed-form expression for the shear viscosity, and numerically validate its effectiveness with various types of external forces. Moreover, our numerical experiments demonstrate that the stochastic Norton dynamics approach clearly outperforms the NEMD dynamics in controlling the asymptotic variance, a key metric to measure the associated computational costs, particularly in the high friction limit.</description>

      <title>FFTArray: A Python Library for the Implementation of Discretized Multi-Dimensional Fourier Transforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03697v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Partial differential equations describing the dynamics of physical systems rarely have closed-form solutions. Fourier spectral methods, which use Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to approximate solutions, are a common approach to solving these equations. However, mapping Fourier integrals to discrete FFTs is not straightforward, as the selection of the grid as well as the coordinate-dependent phase and scaling factors require special care. Moreover, most software packages that deal with this step integrate it tightly into their full-stack implementations. Such an integrated design sacrifices generality, making it difficult to adapt to new coordinate systems, boundary conditions, or problem-specific requirements. To address these challenges, we present FFTArray, a Python library that automates the general discretization of Fourier transforms. Its purpose is to reduce the barriers to developing high-performance, maintainable code for pseudo-spectral Fourier methods. Its interface enables the direct translation of textbook equations and complex research problems into code, and its modular design scales naturally to multiple dimensions. This makes the definition of valid coordinate grids straightforward, while coordinate grid specific corrections are applied with minimal impact on computational performance. Built on the Python Array API Standard, FFTArray integrates seamlessly with array backends like NumPy, JAX and PyTorch and supports Graphics Processing Unit acceleration.

      <title>Sampling parameters of ordinary differential equations with Langevin dynamics that satisfy constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fitting models to data to obtain distributions of consistent parameter values is important for uncertainty quantification, model comparison, and prediction. Standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches for fitting ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to time-series data involve proposing trial parameter sets, numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time, and accepting or rejecting the trial parameter sets. When the model dynamics depend nonlinearly on the parameters, as is generally the case, trial parameter sets are often rejected, and MCMC approaches become prohibitively computationally costly to converge. Here, we build on methods for numerical continuation and trajectory optimization to introduce an approach in which we use Langevin dynamics in the joint space of variables and parameters to sample models that satisfy constraints on the dynamics. We demonstrate the method by sampling Hopf bifurcations and limit cycles of a model of a biochemical oscillator in a Bayesian framework for parameter estimation, and we attain performance that matches or exceeds the performance of leading MCMC approaches that require numerically integrating the ODEs forward in time. We describe numerical experiments that provide insight into the speedup. The method is general and can be used in any framework for parameter estimation and model selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kinetic simulations excel at capturing microscale plasma physics phenomena with high accuracy, but their computational demands make them impractical for modeling large-scale space and astrophysical systems. In this context, we build a surrogate model, using Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets), based upon the Vlasov-Poisson simulation data to model the dynamical evolution of plasmas, focusing on the Landau damping process - a fundamental kinetic phenomenon in space and astrophysical plasmas. The trained DeepONets are able to capture the evolution of electric field energy in both linear and nonlinear regimes under various conditions. Extensive validation highlights DeepONets' robust performance in reproducing complex plasma behaviors with high accuracy, paving the way for large-scale modeling of space and astrophysical plasmas.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the low-energy configurations of N mutually repelling charges confined to a spherical cap and interacting via the Coulomb potential. In the continuum limit, this problem was solved by Lord Kelvin, who found a non-uniform charge distribution with an integrable singularity at the boundary. To explore the discrete analogue, we developed an efficient numerical method that enables energy minimization while maintaining the number of charges at the cap's edge fixed. Using this approach we have obtained numerical results for various values of N and cap angular widths. Based on these results, we analyze the emergence and behavior of topological defects as functions of both N and the cap's curvature.</description>

      <title>Towards Reasoning for PDE Foundation Models: A Reward-Model-Driven Inference-Time-Scaling Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking" strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational workflows in physics and engineering.</description>
