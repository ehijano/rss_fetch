      <title>Reliable and Private Utility Signaling for Data Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The explosive growth of data has highlighted its critical role in driving economic growth through data marketplaces, which enable extensive data sharing and access to high-quality datasets. To support effective trading, signaling mechanisms provide participants with information about data products before transactions, enabling informed decisions and facilitating trading. However, due to the inherent free-duplication nature of data, commonly practiced signaling methods face a dilemma between privacy and reliability, undermining the effectiveness of signals in guiding decision-making.
  To address this, this paper explores the benefits and develops a non-TCP-based construction for a desirable signaling mechanism that simultaneously ensures privacy and reliability. We begin by formally defining the desirable utility signaling mechanism and proving its ability to prevent suboptimal decisions for both participants and facilitate informed data trading. To design a protocol to realize its functionality, we propose leveraging maliciously secure multi-party computation (MPC) to ensure the privacy and robustness of signal computation and introduce an MPC-based hash verification scheme to ensure input reliability. In multi-seller scenarios requiring fair data valuation, we further explore the design and optimization of the MPC-based KNN-Shapley method with improved efficiency. Rigorous experiments demonstrate the efficiency and practicality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Centralized Group Equitability and Individual Envy-Freeness in the Allocation of Indivisible Items</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fair allocation of indivisible items for groups of agents from the perspectives of the agents and a centralized allocator. In our setting, the centralized allocator is interested in ensuring the allocation is fair among the groups and between agents. This setting applies to many real-world scenarios, including when a school administrator wants to allocate resources (e.g., office spaces and supplies) to staff members in departments and when a city council allocates limited housing units to various families in need across different communities. To ensure fair allocation between agents, we consider the classical envy-freeness (EF) notion. To ensure fairness among the groups, we define the notion of centralized group equitability (CGEQ) to capture the fairness for the groups from the allocator's perspective. Because an EF or CGEQ allocation does not always exist in general, we consider their corresponding natural relaxations of envy-freeness to one item (EF1) and centralized group equitability up to one item (CGEQ1). For different classes of valuation functions of the agents and the centralized allocator, we show that allocations satisfying both EF1 and CGEQ1 always exist and design efficient algorithms to compute these allocations. We also consider the centralized group maximin share (CGMMS) from the centralized allocator's perspective as a group-level fairness objective with EF1 for agents and present several results.</description>

      <title>Nash-equilibrium Seeking Algorithm for Power-Allocation Games on Networks of International Relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.</description>

      <title>Dividing Indivisible Items for the Benefit of All: It is Hard to Be Fair Without Social Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In standard fair division models, we assume that all agents are selfish. However, in many scenarios, division of resources has a direct impact on the whole group or even society. Therefore, we study fair allocations of indivisible items that, at the same time, maximize social impact. In this model, each agent is associated with two additive functions that define their value and social impact for each item. The goal is to allocate items so that the social impact is maximized while maintaining some fairness criterion. We reveal that the complexity of the problem heavily depends on whether the agents are socially aware, i.e., they take into consideration the social impact functions. For socially unaware agents, we prove that the problem is NP-hard for a variety of fairness notions, and that it is tractable only for very restricted cases, e.g., if, for every agent, the valuation equals social impact and it is binary. On the other hand, social awareness allows for fair allocations that maximize social impact, and such allocations can be computed in polynomial time. Interestingly, the problem becomes again intractable as soon as the definition of social awareness is relaxed.</description>

      <title>Classification in Equilibrium: Structure of Optimal Decision Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper characterizes optimal classification when individuals adjust their behavior in response to the classification rule. We model the interaction between a designer and a population as a Stackelberg game: the designer selects a classification rule anticipating how individuals will comply, cheat, or abstain in order to obtain a favorable classification. Under standard monotone likelihood ratio assumptions, optimal rules belong to a small and interpretable family (single-threshold and two-cut rules) that encompass both conventional and counterintuitive designs. Our results depart sharply from prior findings that optimal classifiers reward higher signals: in equilibrium, the designer may deliberately reward those with lower likelihood ratios or concentrate rewards/penalties in a middle band to improve informational quality.</description>

      <title>Fair Multi-agent Persuasion with Submodular Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of selection in the context of Bayesian persuasion. We are given multiple agents with hidden values (or quality scores), to whom resources must be allocated by a welfare-maximizing decision-maker. An intermediary with knowledge of the agents' values seeks to influence the outcome of the selection by designing informative signals and providing tie-breaking policies, so that when the receiver maximizes welfare over the resulting posteriors, the expected utilities of the agents (where utility is defined as allocation times value) achieve certain fairness properties. The fairness measure we will use is majorization, which simultaneously approximately maximizes all symmetric, monotone, concave functions of the utilities. We consider the general setting where the allocation to the agents needs to respect arbitrary submodular constraints, as given by the corresponding polymatroid.
  We present a signaling policy that, under a mild bounded rationality assumption on the receiver, achieves a logarithmically approximate majorized policy in this setting. The approximation ratio is almost best possible, and that significantly outperforms generic results that only yield linear approximations. A key component of our result is a structural characterization showing that the vector of agent utilities for a given signaling policy defines the base polytope of a different polymatroid, a result that may be of independent interest. In addition, we show that an arbitrarily good additive approximation to this vector can be produced in (weakly) polynomial time via the multiplicative weights update method.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary Analysis of Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games with Discounted Payoffs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a class of continuous-time dynamic games involving a large number of players. Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE.</description>

      <title>Deep (Predictive) Discounted Counterfactual Regret Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.08174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Counterfactual regret minimization (CFR) is a family of algorithms for effectively solving imperfect-information games. To enhance CFR's applicability in large games, researchers use neural networks to approximate its behavior. However, existing methods are mainly based on vanilla CFR and struggle to effectively integrate more advanced CFR variants. In this work, we propose an efficient model-free neural CFR algorithm, overcoming the limitations of existing methods in approximating advanced CFR variants. At each iteration, it collects variance-reduced sampled advantages based on a value network, fits cumulative advantages by bootstrapping, and applies discounting and clipping operations to simulate the update mechanisms of advanced CFR variants. Experimental results show that, compared with model-free neural algorithms, it exhibits faster convergence in typical imperfect-information games and demonstrates stronger adversarial performance in a large poker game.</description>

      <title>Strategizing against No-regret Learners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13861</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.13861v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How should a player who repeatedly plays a game against a no-regret learner strategize to maximize his utility? We study this question and show that under some mild assumptions, the player can always guarantee himself a utility of at least what he would get in a Stackelberg equilibrium of the game. When the no-regret learner has only two actions, we show that the player cannot get any higher utility than the Stackelberg equilibrium utility. But when the no-regret learner has more than two actions and plays a mean-based no-regret strategy, we show that the player can get strictly higher than the Stackelberg equilibrium utility. We provide a characterization of the optimal game-play for the player against a mean-based no-regret learner as a solution to a control problem. When the no-regret learner's strategy also guarantees him a no-swap regret, we show that the player cannot get anything higher than a Stackelberg equilibrium utility.</description>

      <title>The Curse of Shared Knowledge: Recursive Belief Reasoning in a Coordination Game with Imperfect Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.08849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.08849v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Common knowledge is crucial for safe group coordination. In its absence, humans must rely on shared knowledge, which is inherently limited in depth and therefore prone to coordination failures, because any finite-order knowledge attribution allows for an even higher order attribution that may change what is known by whom. In three separate experiments involving 802 participants, we investigate the extent to which humans can differentiate between common knowledge and nth-order shared knowledge. We designed a two-person coordination game with imperfect information to simplify the recursive game structure and higher-order uncertainties into a relatable everyday scenario. In this game, coordination for the highest payoff requires a specific fact to be common knowledge between players. However, this fact cannot become common knowledge in the game. The fact can at most be nth-order shared knowledge for some n. Our findings reveal that even at quite shallow depths of shared knowledge (low values of n), players behave as though they possess common knowledge, and claim similar levels of certainty in their actions, despite incurring significant penalties when falsely assuming guaranteed coordination. We term this phenomenon 'the curse of shared knowledge'. It arises either from the players' inability to distinguish between higher-order shared knowledge and common knowledge, or from their implicit assumption that their co-player cannot make this distinction.</description>
