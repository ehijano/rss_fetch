      <title>Collaborative Team Recognition: A Core Plus Extension Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific collaboration is a significant behavior in knowledge creation and idea exchange. To tackle large and complex research questions, a trend of team formation has been observed in recent decades. In this study, we focus on recognizing collaborative teams and exploring inner patterns using scholarly big graph data. We propose a collaborative team recognition (CORE) model with a "core + extension" team structure to recognize collaborative teams in large academic networks. In CORE, we combine an effective evaluation index called the collaboration intensity index with a series of structural features to recognize collaborative teams in which members are in close collaboration relationships. Then, CORE is used to guide the core team members to their extension members. CORE can also serve as the foundation for team-based research. The simulation results indicate that CORE reveals inner patterns of scientific collaboration: senior scholars have broad collaborative relationships and fixed collaboration patterns, which are the underlying mechanisms of team assembly. The experimental results demonstrate that CORE is promising compared with state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>PANDORA: Deep graph learning based COVID-19 infection risk level forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COVID-19 as a global pandemic causes a massive disruption to social stability that threatens human life and the economy. Policymakers and all elements of society must deliver measurable actions based on the pandemic's severity to minimize the detrimental impact of COVID-19. A proper forecasting system is arguably important to provide an early signal of the risk of COVID-19 infection so that the authorities are ready to protect the people from the worst. However, making a good forecasting model for infection risks in different cities or regions is not an easy task, because it has a lot of influential factors that are difficult to be identified manually. To address the current limitations, we propose a deep graph learning model, called PANDORA, to predict the infection risks of COVID-19, by considering all essential factors and integrating them into a geographical network. The framework uses geographical position relations and transportation frequency as higher-order structural properties formulated by higher-order network structures (i.e., network motifs). Moreover, four significant node attributes (i.e., multiple features of a particular area, including climate, medical condition, economy, and human mobility) are also considered. We propose three different aggregators to better aggregate node attributes and structural features, namely, Hadamard, Summation, and Connection. Experimental results over real data show that PANDORA outperforms the baseline method with higher accuracy and faster convergence speed, no matter which aggregator is chosen. We believe that PANDORA using deep graph learning provides a promising approach to get superior performance in infection risk level forecasting and help humans battle the COVID-19 crisis.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction in Bipartite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipartite networks serve as highly suitable models to represent systems involving interactions between two distinct types of entities, such as online dating platforms, job search services, or ecommerce websites. These models can be leveraged to tackle a number of tasks, including link prediction among the most useful ones, especially to design recommendation systems. However, if this task has garnered much interest when conducted on unipartite (i.e. standard) networks, it is far from being the case for bipartite ones. In this study, we address this gap by performing an experimental comparison of 19 link prediction methods able to handle bipartite graphs. Some come directly from the literature, and some are adapted by us from techniques originally designed for unipartite networks. We also propose to repurpose recommendation systems based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) as a novel link prediction solution for bipartite networks. To conduct our experiments, we constitute a benchmark of 3 real-world bipartite network datasets with various topologies. Our results indicate that GCN-based personalized recommendation systems, which have received significant attention in recent years, can produce successful results for link prediction in bipartite networks. Furthermore, purely heuristic metrics that do not rely on any learning process, like the Structural Perturbation Method (SPM), can also achieve success.</description>

      <title>Proximity Matters: Analyzing the Role of Geographical Proximity in Shaping AI Research Collaborations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of geographical proximity in facilitating inter-regional or inter-organizational collaborations has been studied thoroughly in recent years. However, the effect of geographical proximity on forming scientific collaborations at the individual level still needs to be addressed. Using publication data in the field of artificial intelligence from 2001 to 2019, in this work, the effect of geographical proximity on the likelihood of forming future scientific collaborations among researchers is studied. In addition, the interaction between geographical and network proximities is examined to see whether network proximity can substitute geographical proximity in encouraging long-distance scientific collaborations. Employing conventional and machine learning techniques, our results suggest that geographical distance impedes scientific collaboration at the individual level despite the tremendous improvements in transportation and communication technologies during recent decades. Moreover, our findings show that the effect of network proximity on the likelihood of scientific collaboration increases with geographical distance, implying that network proximity can act as a substitute for geographical proximity.</description>

      <title>Analyzing user archetypes in Singapore's Telegram groups on COVID-19 and climate change</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social media platforms, particularly Telegram, play a pivotal role in shaping public perceptions and opinions on global and national issues. Unlike traditional news media, Telegram allows for the proliferation of user-generated content with minimal oversight, making it a significant venue for the spread of controversial and misinformative content. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Telegram's popularity surged in Singapore, a country with one of the highest rates of social media use globally. We leverage Singapore-based Telegram data to analyze information flows within groups focused on COVID-19 and climate change. Using k-means clustering, we identified distinct user archetypes, including Skeptic, Engaged Advocate, Observer, and Analyst, each contributing uniquely to the discourse. We developed a model to classify users into these clusters (Precision: Climate change: 0.99; COVID-19: 0.95). By identifying these user archetypes and examining their contributions to information dissemination, we sought to uncover patterns to inform effective strategies for combating misinformation and enhancing public discourse on pressing global issues.</description>

      <title>Temporal Link Prediction in Social Networks Based on Agent Behavior Synchrony and a Cognitive Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temporality, a crucial characteristic in the formation of social relationships, was used to quantify the long-term time effects of networks for link prediction models, ignoring the heterogeneity of time effects on different time scales. In this work, we propose a novel approach to link prediction in temporal networks, extending existing methods with a cognitive mechanism that captures the dynamics of the interactions. Our approach computes the weight of the edges and their change over time, similar to memory traces in the human brain, by simulating the process of forgetting and strengthening connections depending on the intensity of interactions. We utilized five ground-truth datasets, which were used to predict social ties, missing events, and potential links. We found: (a) the cognitive mechanism enables more accurate capture of the heterogeneity of the temporal effect, leading to an average precision improvement of 9\% compared to baselines with competitive AUC. (b) the local structure and synchronous agent behavior contribute differently to different types of datasets. (c) appropriately increasing the time intervals, which may reduce the negative impact from noise when dividing time windows to calculate the behavioral synchrony of agents, is effective for link prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>Exploring Cognitive Bias Triggers in COVID-19 Misinformation Tweets: A Bot vs. Human Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During the COVID-19 pandemic, the proliferation of misinformation on social media has been rapidly increasing. Automated Bot authors are believed to be significant contributors of this surge. It is hypothesized that Bot authors deliberately craft online misinformation aimed at triggering and exploiting human cognitive biases, thereby enhancing tweet engagement and persuasive influence. This study investigates this hypothesis by studying triggers of biases embedded in Bot-authored misinformation and comparing them with their counterparts, Human-authored misinformation. We complied a Misinfo Dataset that contains COVID-19 vaccine-related misinformation tweets annotated by author identities, Bots vs Humans, from Twitter during the vaccination period from July 2020 to July 2021. We developed an algorithm to computationally automate the extraction of triggers for eight cognitive biase. Our analysis revealed that the Availability Bias, Cognitive Dissonance, and Confirmation Bias were most commonly present in misinformation, with Bot-authored tweets exhibiting a greater prevalence, with distinct patterns in utilizing bias triggers between Humans and Bots. We further linked these bias triggers with engagement metrics, inferring their potential influence on tweet engagement and persuasiveness. Overall, our findings indicate that bias-triggering tactics have been more influential on Bot-authored tweets than Human-authored tweets. While certain bias triggers boosted engagement for Bot-authored tweets, some other bias triggers unexpectedly decreased it. Conversely, triggers of most biases appeared to be unrelated to the engagement of Human-authored tweets. Our work sheds light on the differential utilization and effect of persuasion strategies between Bot-authored and Human-authored misinformation from the lens of human biases, offering insights for the development of effective counter-measures.</description>

      <title>Universal spatial inflation of human mobility</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between egocentric preference and urban structure in shaping human mobility has profound implications for improving epidemic intervention, social equity, and urban resilience. However, numerous existing studies either solely identify the egocentric preferences -- the anchoring effects from home -- or the impact of hierarchical urban structures. Here, we propose a network-based approach to present human mobility in both spatial and topological aspects within the urban system, using cell phone trajectory data from millions of users across three countries. By segmenting mobility trajectories into modules and examining their overlap with urban scales, we have observed the inflation law that the geospatial extent of these modules increases sub-linearly with their distance from home. Moreover, the egocentric preference for higher urban levels leads to this increase. This universal finding indicates that home-based preferences distort the hierarchical scales of human mobility in the urban environment, regardless of demographics or geography.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Social Networks and the Future of Free Speech Online</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized social networks like Mastodon and BlueSky are trending topics that have drawn much attention and discussion in recent years. By devolving powers from the central node to the end users, decentralized social networks aim to cure existing pathologies on the centralized platforms and have been viewed by many as the future of the Internet. This article critically and systematically assesses the decentralization project's prospect for communications online. It uses normative theories of free speech to examine whether and how the decentralization design could facilitate users' freedom of expression online. The analysis shows that both promises and pitfalls exist, highlighting the importance of value-based design in this area. Two most salient issues for the design of the decentralized networks are: how to balance the decentralization ideal with constant needs of centralization on the network, and how to empower users to make them truly capable of exercising their control. The article then uses some design examples, such as the shared blocklist and the opt-in search function, to illustrate the value considerations underlying the design choices. Some tentative proposals for law and policy interventions are offered to better facilitate the design of the new network. Rather than providing clear answers, the article seeks to map the value implications of the design choices, highlight the stakes, and point directions for future research.</description>

      <title>Turning the Tide on Dark Pools? Towards Multi-Stakeholder Vulnerability Notifications in the Ad-Tech Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Online advertising relies on a complex and opaque supply chain that involves multiple stakeholders, including advertisers, publishers, and ad-networks, each with distinct and sometimes conflicting incentives. Recent research has demonstrated the existence of ad-tech supply chain vulnerabilities such as dark pooling, where low-quality publishers bundle their ad inventory with higher-quality ones to mislead advertisers. We investigate the effectiveness of vulnerability notification campaigns aimed at mitigating dark pooling. Prior research on vulnerability notifications has primarily focused on single-stakeholder scenarios, and it is unclear whether vulnerability notifications can be effective in the multi-stakeholder ad-tech supply chain. We implement an automated vulnerability notification pipeline to systematically evaluate the responsiveness of various stakeholders, including publishers, ad-networks, and advertisers to vulnerability notifications by academics and activists. Our nine-month long multi-stakeholder notification study shows that notifications are an effective method for reducing dark pooling vulnerabilities in the online advertising ecosystem, especially when targeted towards ad-networks. Further, the sender reputation does not impact responses to notifications from activists and academics in a statistically different way. In addition to being the first notification study targeting the online advertising ecosystem, we are also the first to study multi-stakeholder context in vulnerability notifications.</description>

      <title>Delving into ChatGPT usage in academic writing through excess vocabulary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate and revise text with human-level performance, and have been widely commercialized in systems like ChatGPT. These models come with clear limitations: they can produce inaccurate information, reinforce existing biases, and be easily misused. Yet, many scientists have been using them to assist their scholarly writing. How wide-spread is LLM usage in the academic literature currently? To answer this question, we use an unbiased, large-scale approach, free from any assumptions on academic LLM usage. We study vocabulary changes in 14 million PubMed abstracts from 2010-2024, and show how the appearance of LLMs led to an abrupt increase in the frequency of certain style words. Our analysis based on excess words usage suggests that at least 10% of 2024 abstracts were processed with LLMs. This lower bound differed across disciplines, countries, and journals, and was as high as 30% for some PubMed sub-corpora. We show that the appearance of LLM-based writing assistants has had an unprecedented impact in the scientific literature, surpassing the effect of major world events such as the Covid pandemic.</description>

      <title>Scaling Large-Language-Model-based Multi-Agent Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pioneering advancements in large language model-powered agents have underscored the design pattern of multi-agent collaboration, demonstrating that collective intelligence can surpass the capabilities of each individual. Inspired by the neural scaling law, which posits that increasing neurons leads to emergent abilities, this study investigates whether a similar principle applies to increasing agents in multi-agent collaboration. Technically, we propose multi-agent collaboration networks (MacNet), which utilize directed acyclic graphs to organize agents and streamline their interactive reasoning via topological ordering, with solutions derived from their dialogues. Extensive experiments show that MacNet consistently outperforms baseline models, enabling effective agent collaboration across various network topologies and supporting cooperation among more than a thousand agents. Notably, we observed a small-world collaboration phenomenon, where topologies resembling small-world properties achieved superior performance. Additionally, we identified a collaborative scaling law, indicating that normalized solution quality follows a logistic growth pattern as scaling agents, with collaborative emergence occurring much earlier than previously observed instances of neural emergence. The code and data will be available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ChatDev.</description>

      <title>Toxic Memes: A Survey of Computational Perspectives on the Detection and Explanation of Meme Toxicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internet memes, channels for humor, social commentary, and cultural expression, are increasingly used to spread toxic messages. Studies on the computational analyses of toxic memes have significantly grown over the past five years, and the only three surveys on computational toxic meme analysis cover only work published until 2022, leading to inconsistent terminology and unexplored trends. Our work fills this gap by surveying content-based computational perspectives on toxic memes, and reviewing key developments until early 2024. Employing the PRISMA methodology, we systematically extend the previously considered papers, achieving a threefold result. First, we survey 119 new papers, analyzing 158 computational works focused on content-based toxic meme analysis. We identify over 30 datasets used in toxic meme analysis and examine their labeling systems. Second, after observing the existence of unclear definitions of meme toxicity in computational works, we introduce a new taxonomy for categorizing meme toxicity types. We also note an expansion in computational tasks beyond the simple binary classification of memes as toxic or non-toxic, indicating a shift towards achieving a nuanced comprehension of toxicity. Third, we identify three content-based dimensions of meme toxicity under automatic study: target, intent, and conveyance tactics. We develop a framework illustrating the relationships between these dimensions and meme toxicities. The survey analyzes key challenges and recent trends, such as enhanced cross-modal reasoning, integrating expert and cultural knowledge, the demand for automatic toxicity explanations, and handling meme toxicity in low-resource languages. Also, it notes the rising use of Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI for detecting and generating toxic memes. Finally, it proposes pathways for advancing toxic meme detection and interpretation.</description>

      <title>Mitigating Oversmoothing Through Reverse Process of GNNs for Heterophilic Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10543v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) resembles the diffusion process, leading to the over-smoothing of learned representations when stacking many layers. Hence, the reverse process of message passing can produce the distinguishable node representations by inverting the forward message propagation. The distinguishable representations can help us to better classify neighboring nodes with different labels, such as in heterophilic graphs. In this work, we apply the design principle of the reverse process to the three variants of the GNNs. Through the experiments on heterophilic graph data, where adjacent nodes need to have different representations for successful classification, we show that the reverse process significantly improves the prediction performance in many cases. Additional analysis reveals that the reverse mechanism can mitigate the over-smoothing over hundreds of layers. Our code is available at https://github.com/ml-postech/reverse-gnn.</description>

Abstract: We study processes of societal knowledge accumulation, where the validity of a new unit of knowledge depends both on the correctness of its derivation and on the validity of the units it depends on. A fundamental question in this setting is: If a constant fraction of the new derivations is wrong, can investing a constant fraction, bounded away from one, of effort ensure that a constant fraction of knowledge in society is valid? Ben-Eliezer, Mikulincer, Mossel, and Sudan (ITCS 2023) introduced a concrete probabilistic model to analyze such questions and showed an affirmative answer to this question. Their study, however, focuses on the simple case where each new unit depends on just one existing unit, and units attach according to a $\textit{preferential attachment rule}$.
  In this work, we consider much more general families of cumulative knowledge processes, where new units may attach according to varied attachment mechanisms and depend on multiple existing units. We also allow a (random) fraction of insertions of adversarial nodes.
  We give a robust affirmative answer to the above question by showing that for $\textit{all}$ of these models, as long as many of the units follow simple heuristics for checking a bounded number of units they depend on, all errors will be eventually eliminated. Our results indicate that preserving the quality of large interdependent collections of units of knowledge is feasible, as long as careful but not too costly checks are performed when new units are derived/deposited.</description>

      <title>#EpiTwitter: Public Health Messaging During the COVID-19 Pandemic</title>

Abstract: Effective communication during health crises is critical, with social media serving as a key platform for public health experts (PHEs) to engage with the public. However, it also amplifies pseudo-experts promoting contrarian views. Despite its importance, the role of emotional and moral language in PHEs' communication during COVID-19 remains under explored. This study examines how PHEs and pseudo-experts communicated on Twitter during the pandemic, focusing on emotional and moral language and their engagement with political elites. Analyzing tweets from 489 PHEs and 356 pseudo-experts from January 2020 to January 2021, alongside public responses, we identified key priorities and differences in messaging strategy. PHEs prioritize masking, healthcare, education, and vaccines, using positive emotional language like optimism. In contrast, pseudo-experts discuss therapeutics and lockdowns more frequently, employing negative emotions like pessimism and disgust. Negative emotional and moral language tends to drive engagement, but positive language from PHEs fosters positivity in public responses. PHEs exhibit liberal partisanship, expressing more positivity towards liberals and negativity towards conservative elites, while pseudo-experts show conservative partisanship. These findings shed light on the polarization of COVID-19 discourse and underscore the importance of strategic use of emotional and moral language by experts to mitigate polarization and enhance public trust.</description>
