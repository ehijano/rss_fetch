      <title>The Frenet immersed finite element method for elliptic interface problems: An error analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12884v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article presents an error analysis of the recently introduced Frenet immersed finite element (IFE) method. The Frenet IFE space employed in this method is constructed to be locally conforming to the function space of the associated weak form for the interface problem. This article further establishes a critical trace inequality for the Frenet IFE functions. These features enable us to prove that the Frenet IFE method converges optimally under mesh refinement in both $L^2$ and energy norms.</description>

      <title>Data driven learning to enhance a kinetic model of distressed crowd dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.12974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mathematical modeling of crowds is complicated by the fact that crowds possess the behavioral ability to develop and adapt moving strategies in response to the context. For example, in emergency situations, people tend to alter their walking strategy in response to fear. To be able to simulate these situations, we consider a kinetic model of crowd dynamics that features the level of stress as a parameter and propose to estimate this key parameter by solving an inverse crowd dynamics problem. This paper states the mathematical problem and presents a method for its numerical solution. We show some preliminary results based on a synthetic data set, i.e., test cases where the exact stress level is known and the crowd density data are generated numerically by solving a forward crowd dynamics problem.</description>

      <title>A new class of energy dissipative, mass conserving and positivity/bound-preserving schemes for Keller-Segel equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13067v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we improve the original Lagrange multiplier approach \cite{ChSh22,ChSh_II22} and introduce a new energy correction approach to construct a class of robust, positivity/bound-preserving, mass conserving and energy dissipative schemes for Keller-Segel equations which only need to solve several linear Poisson like equations. To be more specific, we use a predictor-corrector approach to construct a class of positivity/bound-preserving and mass conserving schemes which can be implemented with negligible cost. Then a energy correction step is introduced to construct schemes which are also energy dissipative, in addition to positivity/bound-preserving and mass conserving. This new approach is not restricted to any particular spatial discretization and can be combined with various time discretization to achieve high-order accuracy in time. We show stability results for mass-conservative, positivity/bound-preserving and energy dissipative schemes for two different Keller-Segel systems. A error analysis is presented for a second-order, bound-preserving, mass-conserving and energy dissipative scheme for the second-type of Keller-Segel equations. Ample numerical experiments are shown to validate the stability and accuracy of our approach.</description>

      <title>High Order Finite Difference Schemes for the Transparent Boundary Conditions and Their Applications in the 1D Schr\"odinger-Poisson Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The 1D Schr\"odinger equation closed with the transparent boundary conditions(TBCs) is known as a successful model for describing quantum effects, and is usually considered with a self-consistent Poisson equation in simulating quantum devices. We introduce discrete fourth order transparent boundary conditions(D4TBCs), which have been proven to be essentially non-oscillating when the potential vanishes, and to share the same accuracy order with the finite difference scheme used to discretize the 1D Schr\"odinger equation. Furthermore, a framework of analytic discretization of TBCs(aDTBCs) is proposed, which does not introduce any discretization error, thus is accurate. With the accurate discretizations, one is able to improve the accuracy of the discretization for the 1D Schr\"odinger problem to arbitrarily high levels. As numerical tools, two globally fourth order compact finite difference schemes are proposed for the 1D Schr\"odinger-Poisson problem, involving either of the D4TBCs or the aDTBCs, respectively, and the uniqueness of solutions of both discrete Schr\"odinger problems are rigorously proved. Numerical experiments, including simulations of a resistor and two nanoscale resonant tunneling diodes, verify the accuracy order of the discretization schemes and show potential of the numerical algorithm introduced for the 1D Schr\"odinger-Poisson problem in simulating various quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic-Preserving schemes for the Boltzmann mixture model with disparate mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop and implement an efficient asymptotic-preserving (AP) scheme to solve the gas mixture of Boltzmann equations, under the so-called "relaxation time scale" relevant to the epochal relaxation phenomenon. The disparity in molecular masses, ranging across several orders of magnitude, leads to significant challenges in both the evaluation of collision operators and designing of efficient numerical schemes in order to capture the multi-scale nature of the dynamics. A direct implementation by using the spectral method faces prohibitive computational costs as the mass ratio decreases due to the need to resolve vastly different thermal velocities. Different from [I. M. Gamba, S. Jin, and L. Liu, Commun. Math. Sci., 17 (2019), pp. 1257-1289], we propose an alternative approach by conducting asymptotic expansions for the collision operators, which can significantly reduce the computational complexity and works well for uniformly small $\varepsilon$. By incorporating the separation of three time scales in the model's relaxation process [P. Degond and B. Lucquin-Desreux, Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 6 (1996), pp. 405-436], we design an AP scheme that is able to capture the epochal relaxation phenomenon of disparage mass mixtures while maintaining the computational efficiency. Numerical experiments will demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in handling large mass ratios of heavy and light species, in addition to validating the AP properties.</description>

      <title>Functional normalizing flow for statistical inverse problems of partial differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse problems of partial differential equations are ubiquitous across various scientific disciplines and can be formulated as statistical inference problems using Bayes' theorem. To address large-scale problems, it is crucial to develop discretization-invariant algorithms, which can be achieved by formulating methods directly in infinite-dimensional space. We propose a novel normalizing flow based infinite-dimensional variational inference method (NF-iVI) to extract posterior information efficiently. Specifically, by introducing well-defined transformations, the prior in Bayes' formula is transformed into post-transformed measures that approximate the true posterior. To circumvent the issue of mutually singular probability measures, we formulate general conditions for the employed transformations. As guiding principles, these conditions yield four concrete transformations. Additionally, to minimize computational demands, we have developed a conditional normalizing flow variant, termed CNF-iVI, which is adept at processing measurement data of varying dimensions while requiring minimal computational resources. We apply the proposed algorithms to two typical inverse problems governed by a simple smooth equation and the steady-state Darcy flow equation. Numerical results confirm our theoretical findings, illustrate the efficiency of our algorithms, and verify the discretization-invariant property.</description>

      <title>Leveraging NMF to Investigate Air Quality in Central Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates air pollution in central Taiwan, focusing on key pollutants, including SO$_2$, NO$_2$, PM$_{10}$, and PM$_{2.5}$. We use non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) to reduce data dimensionality, followed by wind direction analysis and speed to trace pollution sources. Our findings indicate that PM$_{2.5}$ and NO$_2$ levels are primarily influenced by local sources, while SO$_2$ levels are more affected by transboundary factors. For PM$_{10}$, contributions from domestic and transboundary sources are nearly equal.</description>

      <title>Isogeometric collocation with smooth mixed degree splines over planar multi-patch domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel isogeometric collocation method for solving the Poisson's and the biharmonic equation over planar bilinearly parameterized multi-patch geometries. The proposed approach relies on the use of a modified construction of the C^s-smooth mixed degree isogeometric spline space [20] for s=2 and s=4 in case of the Poisson's and the biharmonic equation, respectively. The adapted spline space possesses the minimal possible degree p=s+1 everywhere on the multi-patch domain except in a small neighborhood of the inner edges and of the vertices of patch valency greater than one where a degree p=2s+1 is required. This allows to solve the PDEs with a much lower number of degrees of freedom compared to employing the C^s-smooth spline space [29] with the same high degree p=2s+1 everywhere. To perform isogeometric collocation with the smooth mixed degree spline functions, we introduce and study two different sets of collocation points, namely first a generalization of the standard Greville points to the set of mixed degree Greville points and second the so-called mixed degree superconvergent points. The collocation method is further extended to the class of bilinear-like G^s multi-patch parameterizations [26], which enables the modeling of multi-patch domains with curved boundaries, and is finally tested on the basis of several numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel architecture for learning geometry-aware preconditioners for linear partial differential equations (PDEs). We show that a deep operator network (Deeponet) can be trained on a simple geometry and remain a robust preconditioner for problems defined by different geometries without further fine-tuning or additional data mining. We demonstrate our method for the Helmholtz equation, which is used to solve problems in electromagnetics and acoustics; the Helmholtz equation is not positive definite, and with absorbing boundary conditions, it is not symmetric.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Assimilation with Score-based Sequential Langevin Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for nonlinear assimilation called score-based sequential Langevin sampling (SSLS) within a recursive Bayesian framework. SSLS decomposes the assimilation process into a sequence of prediction and update steps, utilizing dynamic models for prediction and observation data for updating via score-based Langevin Monte Carlo. An annealing strategy is incorporated to enhance convergence and facilitate multi-modal sampling. The convergence of SSLS in TV-distance is analyzed under certain conditions, providing insights into error behavior related to hyper-parameters. Numerical examples demonstrate its outstanding performance in high-dimensional and nonlinear scenarios, as well as in situations with sparse or partial measurements. Furthermore, SSLS effectively quantifies the uncertainty associated with the estimated states, highlighting its potential for error calibration.</description>

      <title>Long-term behaviour of symmetric partitioned linear multistep methods I. Global error and conservation of invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper an asymptotic expansion of the global error on the stepsize for partitioned linear multistep methods is proved. This provides a tool to analyse the behaviour of these integrators with respect to error growth with time and conservation of invariants. In particular, symmetric partitioned linear multistep methods with no common roots in their first characteristic polynomials, except unity, appear as efficient methods to approximate non-separable Hamiltonian systems since they can be explicit and show good long term behaviour at the same time. As a case study, a thorough analysis is given for small oscillations of the double pendulum problem, which is illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Space-time model reduction in the frequency domain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most model reduction methods are space-only in that they reduce the spatial dimension of the solution but not the temporal one. These methods integrate an encoding of the state of the nonlinear dynamical system forward in time. We propose a space-time method -- one that solves a system of algebraic equations for the encoding of the trajectory, i.e., the solution on a time interval $[0,T]$. The benefit of this approach is that with the same total number of degrees of freedom, a space-time encoding can leverage spatiotemporal correlations to represent the trajectory far more accurately than a space-only one. We use spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD) modes, a spatial basis at each temporal frequency tailored to the structures that appear at that frequency, to represent the trajectory. These modes have a number of properties that make them an ideal choice for space-time model reduction. We derive an algebraic system involving the SPOD coefficients that represent the solution, as well as the initial condition and the forcing. The online phase of the method consists of solving this system for the SPOD coefficients given the initial condition and forcing. We test the model on a Ginzburg-Landau system, a $1 + 1$ dimensional nonlinear PDE. We find that the proposed method is $\sim 2$ orders of magnitude more accurate than POD-Galerkin at the same number of modes and CPU time for all of our tests. In fact, the method is substantially more accurate even than the projection of the solution onto the POD modes, which is a lower bound for the error of any space-only Petrov-Galerkin method.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear orbital stability of stationary shock profiles for the Lax-Wendroff scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we study the spectral, linear and nonlinear stability of stationary shock profile solutions to the Lax-Wendroff scheme for hyperbolic conservation laws. We first clarify the spectral stability of such solutions depending on the convexity of the flux for the underlying conservation law. The main contribution of this article is a detailed study of the so-called Green's function for the linearized numerical scheme. As evidenced on numerical simulations, the Green's function exhibits a highly oscillating behavior ahead of the leading wave before this wave reaches the shock location. One of our main results gives a quantitative description of this behavior. Because of the existence of a one-parameter family of stationary shock profiles, the linearized numerical scheme admits the eigenvalue 1 that is embedded in its continuous spectrum, which gives rise to several contributions in the Green's function. Our detailed analysis of the Green's function describes these contributions by means of a so-called activation function. For large times, the activation function describes how the mass of the initial condition accumulates along the eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 1 of the linearized numerical scheme. We can then obtain sharp decay estimates for the linearized numerical scheme in polynomially weighted spaces, which in turn yield a nonlinear orbital stability result for spectrally stable stationary shock profiles. This nonlinear result is obtained despite the lack of uniform ${\ell}$ 1 estimates for the Green's function of the linearized numerical scheme, the lack of such estimates being linked with the dispersive nature of the numerical scheme. This dispersive feature is in sharp contrast with previous results on the orbital stability of traveling waves or discrete shock profiles for parabolic perturbations of conservation laws.</description>

      <title>A new T-compatibility condition and its application to the discretization of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.01878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the approximation of weakly T-coercive operators. The main property to ensure the convergence thereof is the regularity of the approximation (in the vocabulary of discrete approximation schemes). In a previous work the existence of discrete operators $T_n$ which converge to $T$ in a discrete norm was shown to be sufficient to obtain regularity. Although this framework proved useful for many applications for some instances the former assumption is too strong. Thus in the present article we report a weaker criterion for which the discrete operators $T_n$ only have to converge point-wise, but in addition a weak T-coercivity condition has to be satisfied on the discrete level. We apply the new framework to prove the convergence of certain $H^1$-conforming finite element discretizations of the damped time-harmonic Galbrun's equation, which is used to model the oscillations of stars. A main ingredient in the latter analysis is the uniformly stable invertibility of the divergence operator on certain spaces, which is related to the topic of divergence free elements for the Stokes equation.</description>

      <title>Numerical analysis of the SIMP model for the topology optimization problem of minimizing compliance in linear elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.04249v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the finite element approximation of the solid isotropic material with penalization method (SIMP) for the topology optimization problem of minimizing the compliance of a linearly elastic structure. To ensure the existence of a local minimizer to the infinite-dimensional problem, we consider two popular regularization methods: $W^{1,p}$-type penalty methods and density filtering. Previous results prove weak(-*) convergence in the space of the material distribution to a local minimizer of the infinite-dimensional problem. Notably, convergence was not guaranteed to \emph{all} the isolated local minimizers. In this work, we show that, for every isolated local or global minimizer, there exists a sequence of finite element local minimizers that strongly converges to the minimizer in the appropriate space. As a by-product, this ensures that there exists a sequence of unfiltered discretized material distributions that does not exhibit checkerboarding.</description>

      <title>Maximum bound principle preserving and energy decreasing exponential time differencing schemes for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work delves into the exponential time differencing (ETD) schemes for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation. In fact, the maximum bound principle (MBP) for the first- and second-order ETD schemes is presented in a prior publication [SIAM Review, 63(2), 2021], assuming a symmetric initial matrix field. Noteworthy is our novel contribution, demonstrating that the first- and second-order ETD schemes for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation -- both being linear schemes -- unconditionally preserve the MBP, even in instances of nonsymmetric initial conditions. Additionally, we prove that these two ETD schemes preserve the energy dissipation law unconditionally for the matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation. Some numerical examples are presented to verify our theoretical results and to simulate the evolution of corresponding matrix fields.</description>

      <title>Analysis of the Crouzeix-Raviart Surface Finite Element Method for vector-valued Laplacians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.16541v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently a nonconforming surface finite element was developed to discretize 2D vector-valued compressible flow problems in a 3D domain. In this contribution we derive an error analysis for this approach on a vector-valued Laplace problem, which is an important operator for fluid-equations on the surface. In our setup, the problem is approximated via edge-integration on local flat triangles using the nonconforming linear Crouzeix-Raviart element. The flat planes coincide with the surface at the edge midpoints. This is also the place, where the Crouzeix-Raviart element requires continuity between two neighbouring elements. The developed Crouzeix-Raviart approximation is a non-parametric approach that works on local coordinate systems, established in each triangle. This setup is numerically efficient and straightforward to implement. For this Crouzeix-Raviart discretization we derive optimal error bounds in the $H^1$-norm and $L^2$-norm and present an estimate for the geometric error. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Operator learning without the adjoint</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a mystery at the heart of operator learning: how can one recover a non-self-adjoint operator from data without probing the adjoint? Current practical approaches suggest that one can accurately recover an operator while only using data generated by the forward action of the operator without access to the adjoint. However, naively, it seems essential to sample the action of the adjoint. In this paper, we partially explain this mystery by proving that without querying the adjoint, one can approximate a family of non-self-adjoint infinite-dimensional compact operators via projection onto a Fourier basis. We then apply the result to recovering Green's functions of elliptic partial differential operators and derive an adjoint-free sample complexity bound. While existing theory justifies low sample complexity in operator learning, ours is the first adjoint-free analysis that attempts to close the gap between theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Singular value decompositions of third-order reduced biquaternion tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the applications of third-order reduced biquaternion tensors in color video processing. We first develop algorithms for computing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of a third-order reduced biquaternion tensor via a new Ht-product. As theoretical applications, we define the Moore-Penrose inverse of a third-order reduced biquaternion tensor and develop its characterizations. In addition, we discuss the general (or Hermitian) solutions to reduced biquaternion tensor equation $\mathcal{A}\ast_{Ht} \mathcal{X}=\mathcal{B}$ as well as its least-square solution. Finally, we compress the color video by this SVD, and the experimental data shows that our method is faster than the compared scheme.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.09872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate a convective Brinkman--Forchheimer problem coupled with a heat equation. The investigated model considers thermal diffusion and viscosity depending on the temperature. We prove the existence of a solution without restriction on the data and uniqueness when the solution is slightly smoother and the data is suitably restricted. We also propose a finite element discretization scheme for the considered model and derive convergence results and a priori error estimates. Finally, we illustrate the theory with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Half-closed discontinuous Galerkin discretisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of half-closed nodes for nodal discontinuous Galerkin (DG) discretisations. Unlike more commonly used closed nodes in DG, where on every element nodes are placed on all of its boundaries, half-closed nodes only require nodes to be placed on a subset of the element's boundaries. The effect of using different nodes on DG operator sparsity is studied and we find in particular for there to be no difference in the sparsity pattern of the Laplace operator whether closed or half-closed nodes are used. On quadrilateral/hexahedral elements we use the Gauss-Radau points as the half-closed nodes of choice, which we demonstrate is able to speed up DG operator assembly in addition to leverage previously known superconvergence results. We also discuss in this work some linear solver techniques commonly used for Finite Element or discontinuous Galerkin methods such as static condensation and block-based methods, and how they can be applied to half-closed DG discretisations.</description>

      <title>An objective isogeometric mixed finite element formulation for nonlinear elastodynamic beams with incompatible warping strains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stable mixed isogeometric finite element formulation for geometrically and materially nonlinear beams in transient elastodynamics, where a Cosserat beam formulation with extensible directors is used. The extensible directors yield a linear configuration space incorporating constant in-plane cross-sectional strains. Higher-order (incompatible) strains are introduced to correct stiffness, whose additional degrees-of-freedom are eliminated by an element-wise condensation. Further, the present discretization of the initial director field leads to the objectivity of approximated strain measures, regardless of the degree of basis functions. For physical stress resultants and strains, we employ a global patch-wise approximation using B-spline basis functions, whose higher-order continuity enables to use much less degrees-of-freedom, compared to element-wise approximation. For time-stepping, we employ an implicit energy-momentum consistent scheme, which exhibits superior numerical stability in comparison to standard trapezoidal and mid-point rules. Several numerical examples are presented to verify the present method.</description>

      <title>A simulation platform for slender, semiflexible, and inextensible fibers with Brownian hydrodynamics and steric repulsion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The last few years have witnessed an explosion of new numerical methods for filament hydrodynamics. Aside from their ubiquity in biology, physics, and engineering, filaments present unique challenges from an applied-mathematical point of view. Their slenderness, inextensibility, semiflexibility, and meso-scale nature all require numerical methods that can handle multiple lengthscales in the presence of constraints. Accounting for Brownian motion while keeping the dynamics in detailed balance and on the constraint is difficult, as is including a background solvent, which couples the dynamics of multiple filaments together in a suspension. In this paper, we present a simulation platform for deterministic and Brownian inextensible filament dynamics which includes nonlocal fluid dynamics and steric repulsion. For nonlocal hydrodynamics, we define the mobility on a single filament using line integrals of Rotne-Prager-Yamakawa regularized singularities, and numerically preserve the symmetric positive definite property by using a thicker regularization width for the nonlocal integrals than for the self term. For steric repulsion, we introduce a soft local repulsive potential defined as a double-integral over two filaments, then present a scheme to identify and evaluate the nonzero components of the integrand. Using a temporal integrator developed in previous work, we demonstrate that Langevin dynamics sample from the equilibrium distribution of free filament shapes, and that the modeling error in using the thicker regularization is small. We conclude with two examples, sedimenting filaments and cross-linked fiber networks, in which nonlocal hydrodynamics does and does not generate long-range flow fields, respectively. In the latter case, we show that the effect of hydrodynamics can be accounted for through steric repulsion.</description>
