      <title>Asymptotically short generalizations of $t$-design curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ehler and Gr\"{o}chenig posed the question of finding $t$-design curves $\gamma_t$$\unicode{x2013}$curves whose associated line integrals exactly average all degree at most $t$ polynomials$\unicode{x2013}$on $S^d$ of asymptotically optimal arc length $\ell(\gamma_t)\asymp t^{d-1}$ as $t\to\infty$. This work investigates analogues of this question for $\textit{weighted}$ and $\textit{$\varepsilon_t$-approximate $t$-design curves}$, proving existence of such curves $\gamma_t$ on $S^d$ of arc length $\ell(\gamma_t)\asymp t^{d-1}$ as $t\to\infty$ for all $d\in\Bbb N_+$ in the weighted setting (in which case such curves are asymptotically optimal) and all odd $d\in\Bbb N_+$ in the approximate setting (where we have $\varepsilon_t\asymp1/t$ as $t\to\infty$). Formulas for such weighted $t$-design curves for $d\in\{2,3\}$ are presented.</description>

      <title>The raspberries in three dimensions with at most two sizes of berry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In three dimensional Euclidean space, a raspberry is defined to be an arrangement of spheres with pairwise disjoint interiors, where all spheres are tangent to a central unit sphere and such that the contact graph of the non-central spheres triangulates the central sphere.
  We discuss the relevance of these structures in related work. We present a catalog of all configurations of radii that permit the formation of raspberries that have at most two sizes of non-central spheres. Throughout, we discuss the construction of this catalog.</description>

      <title>On the smallest eigenvalues of $3$-colorable graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the set of the smallest eigenvalues attained by $3$-colorable graphs is dense in $(-\infty, -\lambda^*)$, where $\lambda^* = \rho^{1/2} + \rho^{-1/2} \approx 2.01980$ and $\rho$ is the positive real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. As a consequence, in the context of spherical two-distance sets, our result precludes any further refinement of the forbidden-subgraph method through the chromatic number of signed graphs.</description>

      <title>On Perelman's $W$-entropy and Shannon entropy power for super Ricci flows on metric measure spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend Perelman's $W$-entropy formula and the concavity of the Shannon entropy power from smooth Ricci flow to super Ricci flows on metric measure spaces. Moreover, we prove the Li-Yau-Hamilton-Perelman Harnack inequality on super Ricci flows. As a significant application, we prove the equivalence between the volume non-local collapsing property and the lower boundedness of the $W$-entropy on RCD$(0, N)$ spaces. Finally, we use the $W$-entropy to study the logarithmic Sobolev inequality with optimal constant on super Ricci flows on metric measure spaces.</description>

      <title>Vector valued optimal transport: from dynamic to static formulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications in classification of vector valued measures and multispecies PDE, we develop a theory that unifies existing notions of vector valued optimal transport, from dynamic formulations (\`a la Benamou-Brenier) to static formulations (\`a la Kantorovich). In our framework, vector valued measures are modeled as probability measures on a product space $\mathbb{R}^d \times G$, where $G$ is a weighted graph over a finite set of nodes and the graph geometry strongly influences the associated dynamic and static distances. We obtain sharp inequalities relating four notions of vector valued optimal transport and prove that the distances are mutually bi-H\"older equivalent. We discuss the theoretical and practical advantages of each metric and indicate potential applications in multispecies PDE and data analysis. In particular, one of the static formulations discussed in the paper is amenable to linearization, a technique that has been explored in recent years to accelerate the computation of pairwise optimal transport distances.</description>

      <title>Designs related through projective and Hopf maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We verify a construction which, for $\Bbb K$ the reals, complex numbers, quaternions, or octonions, builds a spherical $t$-design by placing a spherical $t$-design on each $\Bbb K$-projective or $\Bbb K$-Hopf fiber associated to the points of a $\lfloor t/2\rfloor$-design on a quotient projective space $\Bbb{KP}^n\neq\Bbb{OP}^2$ or sphere. This generalizes work of K\"{o}nig and Kuperberg, who verified the $\Bbb K=\Bbb C$ case of the projective settings, and of Okuda, who (inspired by independent observation of this construction by Cohn, Conway, Elkies, and Kumar) verified the $\Bbb K=\Bbb C$ case of the generalized Hopf settings.</description>

      <title>Lifting couplings in Wasserstein spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.06591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.06591v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper makes mathematically precise the idea that conditional probabilities are analogous to path liftings in geometry.
  The idea of lifting is modelled in terms of the category-theoretic concept of a lens, which can be interpreted as a consistent choice of arrow liftings. The category we study is the one of probability measures over a given standard Borel space, with morphisms given by the couplings, or transport plans.
  The geometrical picture is even more apparent once we equip the arrows of the category with weights, which one can interpret as "lengths" or "costs", forming a so-called weighted category, which unifies several concepts of category theory and metric geometry.
  Indeed, we show that the weighted version of a lens is tightly connected to the notion of submetry in geometry.
  Every weighted category gives rise to a pseudo-quasimetric space via optimization over the arrows. In particular, Wasserstein spaces can be obtained from the weighted categories of probability measures and their couplings, with the weight of a coupling given by its cost.
  In this case, conditionals allow one to form weighted lenses, which one can interpret as "lifting transport plans, while preserving their cost".</description>
