      <title>OSCAgent: Accelerating the Discovery of Organic Solar Cells with LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic solar cells (OSCs) hold great promise for sustainable energy, but discovering high-performance materials is time-consuming and costly. Existing molecular generation methods can aid the design of OSC molecules, but they are mostly confined to optimizing known backbones and lack effective use of domain-specific chemical knowledge, often leading to unrealistic candidates. In this paper, we introduce OSCAgent, a multi-agent framework for OSC molecular discovery that unifies retrieval-augmented design, molecular generation, and systematic evaluation into a continuously improving pipeline, without requiring additional human intervention. OSCAgent comprises three collaborative agents. The Planner retrieves knowledge from literature-curated molecules and prior candidates to guide design directions. The Generator proposes new OSC acceptors aligned with these plans. The Experimenter performs comprehensive evaluation of candidate molecules and provides feedback for refinement. Experiments show that OSCAgent produces chemically valid, synthetically accessible OSC molecules and achieves superior predicted performance compared to both traditional and large language model (LLM)-only baselines. Representative results demonstrate that some candidates achieve predicted efficiencies approaching 18\%. The code will be publicly available.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Bayesian Framework for Inverse Problems via Optimization and Inversion: Surrogate Modeling, Parameter Inference, and Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper proposes a Bayesian framework for inverse problems that seamlessly integrates optimization and inversion to enable rapid surrogate modeling, accurate parameter inference, and rigorous uncertainty quantification. Bayesian optimization is employed to adaptively construct accurate Gaussian process surrogate models using a minimal number of high-fidelity model evaluations, strategically focusing sampling in regions of high predictive uncertainty. The trained surrogate model is then leveraged within a Bayesian inversion scheme to infer optimal parameter values by combining prior knowledge with observed quantities of interest, resulting in posterior distributions that rigorously characterize epistemic uncertainty. The framework is theoretically grounded, computationally efficient, and particularly suited for engineering applications in which high-fidelity models -- whether arising from numerical simulations or physical experiments -- are computationally expensive, analytically intractable, or difficult to replicate, and data availability is limited. Furthermore, the combined use of Bayesian optimization and inversion outperforms their separate application, highlighting the synergistic benefits of unifying the two approaches. The performance of the proposed Bayesian framework is demonstrated on a suite of one- and two-dimensional analytical benchmarks, including the Mixed Gaussian-Periodic, L\'evy, Griewank, Forrester, and Rosenbrock functions, which provide a controlled setting to assess surrogate modeling accuracy, parameter inference robustness, and uncertainty quantification. The results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in efficiently solving inverse problems while providing informative uncertainty quantification and supporting reliable engineering decision-making at reduced computational cost.</description>

      <title>Explainable Computer Vision Framework for Automated Pore Detection and Criticality Assessment in Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Internal porosity remains a critical defect mode in additively manufactured components, compromising structural performance and limiting industrial adoption. Automated defect detection methods exist but lack interpretability, preventing engineers from understanding the physical basis of criticality predictions. This study presents an explainable computer vision framework for pore detection and criticality assessment in three-dimensional tomographic volumes. Sequential grayscale slices were reconstructed into volumetric datasets, and intensity-based thresholding with connected component analysis identified 500 individual pores. Each pore was characterized using geometric descriptors including size, aspect ratio, extent, and spatial position relative to the specimen boundary. A pore interaction network was constructed using percentile-based Euclidean distance criteria, yielding 24,950 inter-pore connections. Machine learning models predicted pore criticality scores from extracted features, and SHAP analysis quantified individual feature contributions. Results demonstrate that normalized surface distance dominates model predictions, contributing more than an order of magnitude greater importance than all other descriptors. Pore size provides minimal influence, while geometric parameters show negligible impact. The strong inverse relationship between surface proximity and criticality reveals boundary-driven failure mechanisms. This interpretable framework enables transparent defect assessment and provides actionable insights for process optimization and quality control in additive manufacturing.</description>

      <title>Phaedra: Learning High-Fidelity Discrete Tokenization for the Physical Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tokens are discrete representations that allow modern deep learning to scale by transforming high-dimensional data into sequences that can be efficiently learned, generated, and generalized to new tasks. These have become foundational for image and video generation and, more recently, physical simulation. As existing tokenizers are designed for the explicit requirements of realistic visual perception of images, it is necessary to ask whether these approaches are optimal for scientific images, which exhibit a large dynamic range and require token embeddings to retain physical and spectral properties. In this work, we investigate the accuracy of a suite of image tokenizers across a range of metrics designed to measure the fidelity of PDE properties in both physical and spectral space. Based on the observation that these struggle to capture both fine details and precise magnitudes, we propose Phaedra, inspired by classical shape-gain quantization and proper orthogonal decomposition. We demonstrate that Phaedra consistently improves reconstruction across a range of PDE datasets. Additionally, our results show strong out-of-distribution generalization capabilities to three tasks of increasing complexity, namely known PDEs with different conditions, unknown PDEs, and real-world Earth observation and weather data.</description>

      <title>SpatiaLab: Can Vision-Language Models Perform Spatial Reasoning in the Wild?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.03916v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial reasoning is a fundamental aspect of human cognition, yet it remains a major challenge for contemporary vision-language models (VLMs). Prior work largely relied on synthetic or LLM-generated environments with limited task designs and puzzle-like setups, failing to capture the real-world complexity, visual noise, and diverse spatial relationships that VLMs encounter. To address this, we introduce SpatiaLab, a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs' spatial reasoning in realistic, unconstrained contexts. SpatiaLab comprises 1,400 visual question-answer pairs across six major categories: Relative Positioning, Depth &amp; Occlusion, Orientation, Size &amp; Scale, Spatial Navigation, and 3D Geometry, each with five subcategories, yielding 30 distinct task types. Each subcategory contains at least 25 questions, and each main category includes at least 200 questions, supporting both multiple-choice and open-ended evaluation. Experiments across diverse state-of-the-art VLMs, including open- and closed-source models, reasoning-focused, and specialized spatial reasoning models, reveal a substantial gap in spatial reasoning capabilities compared with humans. In the multiple-choice setup, InternVL3.5-72B achieves 54.93% accuracy versus 87.57% for humans. In the open-ended setting, all models show a performance drop of around 10-25%, with GPT-5-mini scoring highest at 40.93% versus 64.93% for humans. These results highlight key limitations in handling complex spatial relationships, depth perception, navigation, and 3D geometry. By providing a diverse, real-world evaluation framework, SpatiaLab exposes critical challenges and opportunities for advancing VLMs' spatial reasoning, offering a benchmark to guide future research toward robust, human-aligned spatial understanding.

      <title>Scalable physical source-to-field inference with hypernetworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a generative model that amortises computation for the field and potential around e.g.~gravitational or electromagnetic sources. Exact numerical calculation has either computational complexity $\mathcal{O}(M\times{}N)$ in the number of sources $M$ and evaluation points $N$, or requires a fixed evaluation grid to exploit fast Fourier transforms. Using an architecture where a hypernetwork produces an implicit representation of the field or potential around a source collection, our model instead performs as $\mathcal{O}(M + N)$, achieves relative error of $\sim\!4\%-6\%$, and allows evaluation at arbitrary locations for arbitrary numbers of sources, greatly increasing the speed of e.g.~physics simulations. We compare with existing models and develop two-dimensional examples, including cases where sources overlap or have more complex geometries, to demonstrate its application.</description>

      <title>Accurate and scalable exchange-correlation with deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14665v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the most widely used electronic structure method for predicting the properties of molecules and materials. Although DFT is, in principle, an exact reformulation of the Schr\"odinger equation, practical applications rely on approximations to the unknown exchange-correlation (XC) functional. Most existing XC functionals are constructed using a limited set of increasingly complex, hand-crafted features that improve accuracy at the expense of computational efficiency. Yet, no current approximation achieves the accuracy and generality for predictive modeling of laboratory experiments at chemical accuracy -- typically defined as errors below 1 kcal/mol. In this work, we present Skala, a modern deep learning-based XC functional that bypasses expensive hand-designed features by learning representations directly from data. Skala achieves chemical accuracy for atomization energies of small molecules while retaining the computational efficiency typical of semi-local DFT. This performance is enabled by training on an unprecedented volume of high-accuracy reference data generated using computationally intensive wavefunction-based methods. Notably, Skala systematically improves with additional training data covering diverse chemistry. By incorporating a modest amount of additional high-accuracy data tailored to chemistry beyond atomization energies, Skala achieves accuracy competitive with the best-performing hybrid functionals across general main group chemistry, at the cost of semi-local DFT. As the training dataset continues to expand, Skala is poised to further enhance the predictive power of first-principles simulations.</description>

      <title>Interpolation of GEDI Biomass Estimates with Calibrated Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16834v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reliable wall-to-wall biomass density estimation from NASA's GEDI mission requires interpolating sparse LIDAR observations across heterogeneous landscapes. While machine learning approaches like Random Forest and XGBoost are widely used, they treat spatial predictions of GEDI observations from multispectral or SAR remote sensing data as independent without adapting to the varying difficulty of heterogeneous landscapes. We demonstrate these approaches generally fail to produce calibrated prediction intervals. We show that this stems from conflating ensemble variance with aleatoric uncertainty and ignoring local spatial context.
  To resolve this, we introduce Attentive Neural Processes (ANPs), a probabilistic meta-learning architecture that explicitly conditions predictions on local observation sets and exploits geospatial foundation model embeddings. Unlike static ensembles, ANPs learn a flexible spatial covariance function, allowing estimates to be more uncertain in complex landscapes and less in homogeneous areas. We validate this approach across five distinct biomes ranging from tropical Amazonian forests to boreal, temperate, and alpine ecosystems, demonstrating that ANPs achieve competitive accuracy while maintaining near-ideal uncertainty calibration. We demonstrate the operational utility of the method through few-shot adaptation, where the model recovers most of the performance gap in cross-region transfer using minimal local data. This work provides a scalable, theoretically rigorous alternative to ensemble variance for continental scale earth observation.</description>
