      <title>Entanglement for Pattern Learning in Temporal Data with Logarithmic Complexity: Benchmarking on IBM Quantum Hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series forecasting is foundational in scientific and technological domains, from climate modelling to molecular dynamics. Classical approaches have significantly advanced sequential prediction, including autoregressive models and deep learning architectures such as temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) and Transformers. Yet, they remain resource-intensive and often scale poorly in data-limited or hardware-constrained settings. We propose a quantum-native time series forecasting framework that harnesses entanglement-based parameterized quantum circuits to learn temporal dependencies. Our Quantum Time Series (QTS) model encodes normalized sequential data into single-qubit rotations and embeds temporal structure through structured entanglement patterns. This design considers predictive performance with logarithmic complexity in training data and parameter count. We benchmark QTS against classical models on synthetic and real-world datasets, including geopotential height fields used in numerical weather prediction. Experiments on the noisy backend and real IBM quantum hardware demonstrate that QTS can capture temporal patterns using fewer data points. Hardware benchmarking results establish quantum entanglement as a practical computational resource for temporal modelling, with potential near-term applications in nano-scale systems, quantum sensor networks, and other forecasting scenarios.</description>

      <title>Copenhagenish interpretations of quantum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a class of Copenhagenish interpretations encompassing modern interpretations that follow the Copenhagen spirit. These interpretations are characterized by four postulates: Observers Observe, Universality, Anti-$\psi$-ontology, and Completeness. We explain why such interpretations are not equivalent to the textbook (or orthodox) interpretation, nor to the view that one should shut up and calculate, nor to strict operationalism. We then discuss what lessons are implied for Copenhagenish interpretations by the measurement problem, the Wigner's friend thought experiment, and the simple variants of the Wigner's friend thought experiment that we term Wigner's enemy, stalkee, and penpal. In particular, we discuss how Copenhagenish interpretations give multiple distinct descriptions of each experiment, where these descriptions are each individually true, yet cannot be combined into any single description. To make such interpretations consistent, then, one requires epistemological constraints forbidding certain perspectives from being combined. We discuss these constraints, their motivations, and some of the challenges they introduce.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Magic Resources of Quantum Many-Body Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the computational complexity of quantum states is a central challenge in quantum many-body physics. In qubit systems, fermionic Gaussian states can be efficiently simulated on classical computers and hence can be employed as a natural baseline for evaluating quantum complexity. In this work, we develop a framework for quantifying fermionic magic resources, also referred to as fermionic non-Gaussianity, which constitutes an essential resource for universal quantum computation. We leverage the algebraic structure of the fermionic commutant to define the fermionic antiflatness (FAF)-an efficiently computable and experimentally accessible measure of non-Gaussianity, with a clear physical interpretation in terms of Majorana fermion correlation functions. Studying systems in equilibrium, we show that FAF detects phase transitions, reveals universal features of critical points, and uncovers special solvable points in many-body systems. Extending the analysis to out-of-equilibrium settings, we demonstrate that fermionic magic resources become more abundant in highly excited eigenstates of many-body systems. We further investigate the growth and saturation of FAF under ergodic many-body dynamics, highlighting the roles of conservation laws and locality in constraining the increase of non-Gaussianity during unitary evolution. This work provides a framework for probing quantum many-body complexity from the perspective of fermionic Gaussian states and opens up new directions for investigating fermionic magic resources in many-body systems. Our results establish fermionic non-Gaussianity, alongside entanglement and non-stabilizerness, as a resource relevant not only to foundational studies but also to experimental platforms aiming to achieve quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Mid-circuit measurement as an algorithmic primitive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the usefulness of mid-circuit measurements to enhance quantum algorithmics. Specifically, we assess how quantum phase estimation (QPE) and mid-circuit measurements can improve the performance of variational quan- tum algorithms. Our focus is on the single-qubit version of QPE namely, the Hadamard test applied to the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) ansatz. We demonstrate that a mid-circuit measurement acts as a low- energy filter when the desired outcome is obtained. When the other outcome is measured we heuristically rely on the mixer to repopulate the low energy states. Numerical simulations show that this method effectively amplifies the ground state. We validate our approach on real quantum hardware namely the IBM Quantum system one ibm quebec.</description>

      <title>randextract: a Reference Library to Test and Validate Privacy Amplification Implementations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum cryptographic protocols do not rely only on quantum-physical resources, they also require reliable classical communication and computation. In particular, the secrecy of any quantum key distribution protocol critically depends on the correct execution of the privacy amplification step. This is a classical post-processing procedure transforming a partially secret bit string, known to be somewhat correlated with an adversary, into a shorter bit string that is close to uniform and independent of the adversary's knowledge. It is typically implemented using randomness extractors. Standardization efforts in quantum cryptography have focused on the security of physical devices and quantum operations. Future efforts should also consider all algorithms used in classical post-processing, especially in privacy amplification, due to its critical role in ensuring the final security of the key. We present randextract, a reference library to test and validate privacy amplification implementations.</description>

      <title>Romanesco codes: Bias-tailored qLDPC codes from fractal codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a family of Clifford-deformed bivariate bicycle codes that are tailored for biased noise. Our qLDPC codes are defined on a bipartite hexagonal lattice with limited-range gates and low-weight stabilizers. The code is non-CSS, featuring stabilizer generators that are each half X and half Z. We find small examples with high encoding rate that perform well for a large range of bias. In the limit of large noise bias, the code reduces to two independent classical cellular automaton codes, giving a distance scaling better than is possible with 2D topological quantum codes. Our construction combines two classical cellular automaton codes, LDPC codes that were recently proposed for use with noise-biased cat qubits, related to each other by a reflection. Each stabilizer in the quantum code is obtained by multiplying an all-X stabilizer from the first code with an all-Z stabilizer from the second code, or the other way around. The result is a self-dual quantum code with a number of qubits equal to the sum of the input codes and stabilizer weight and locality determined by the input codes. Under strong noise bias, the effective distance of the quantum code approaches the distance of the input codes. We simulate the logical performance of our qLDPC codes under code-capacity noise and find strong suppression of the logical error rate.</description>

      <title>Productionizing Quantum Mass Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For many practical applications of quantum computing, the most costly steps involve coherently accessing classical data. We help address this challenge by applying mass production techniques, which can reduce the cost of applying an operation multiple times in parallel. We combine these techniques with modern approaches for classical data loading based on "quantum read-only memory" (QROM). We find that we can polynomially reduce the total number of gates required for data loading, but we find no advantage in cost models that only count the number of non-Clifford gates. Furthermore, for realistic cost models and problem sizes, we find that it is possible to reduce the cost of parallel data loading by an order of magnitude or more. We present several applications of quantum mass production, including a scheme that uses parallel phase estimation to asymptotically reduce the gate complexity of state-of-the-art algorithms for estimating eigenvalues of the quantum chemical Hamiltonian, including both Clifford and non-Clifford gates, from $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(N_{orb}^2\right)$ to $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(N_{orb}^{\log_2 3}\right)$, where $N_{orb}$ denotes the number of orbitals. We also show that mass production can be used to reduce the cost of serial calls to the same data loading oracle by precomputing several copies of a novel QROM resource state.</description>

      <title>Efficient detection of genuine multipartite entanglement using moments of positive maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) represents the strongest form of entanglement in multipartite systems, providing significant advantages in various quantum information processing tasks. In this work, we propose an efficient and experimentally feasible scheme for detecting GME, based on the truncated moments of positive maps. Our method avoids the need for full state tomography, making it scalable for larger systems. We provide illustrative examples of both pure and mixed states to demonstrate the efficacy of our formalism in detecting inequivalent classes of tripartite genuine entanglement. Finally, we present a proposal for realising these moments in real experiments.</description>

      <title>Impact of surface roughness on the stability of nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors in the Casimir regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stability of nanoelectromechanical pressure sensors working in the Casimir regime is considered with account of surface roughness on both the sensor membrane and the ground plate. The equilibrium positions of the sensor membrane are found from the balance between the external measured, elastic, electric pressures, and the Casimir pressure computed by means of the Lifshitz theory. It is shown that the stable equilibrium position of the sensor membrane is nearly independent of the surface roughness, whereas its unstable equilibrium position is shifted to larger membrane-plate separations. The use of these results for creatign pressure sensors with further shrinked dimensions is discussed.</description>

      <title>Statistics of Strongly Coupled Defects in Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decoherence in superconducting qubits is dominated by defects that reside at amorphous interfaces. Interaction with discrete defects results in dropouts that complicate qubit operation and lead to nongaussian tails in the distribution of qubit energy relaxation time $T_1$ that degrade system performance. Spectral diffusion of defects over time leads to fluctuations in $T_1$, posing a challenge for calibration. In this work, we measure the energy relaxation of flux-tunable transmons over a range of operating frequencies. We vary qubit geometry to change the interface participation ratio by more than an order of magnitude. Our results are consistent with loss dominated by discrete interfacial defects. Moreover, we are able to localize the dominant defects to within 500 nm of the qubit junctions, where residues from liftoff are present. These results motivate new approaches to qubit junction fabrication that avoid the residues intrinsic to the liftoff process.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of a reconfigurable ground to space quantum networking scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a reconfigurable quantum network architecture suitable for integrating satellite links in metropolitan quantum networks. The network architecture is designed such that once a satellite is in range, it is configured in a multipoint-to-point topology where all ground nodes establish entanglement with the satellite receiver using time multiplexing to optimize long-distance transmission. Otherwise, the satellite up-link is rerouted to the ground nodes to form a pair-wise ground network. Leveraging both the time and frequency correlations of our photon-pair source, we demonstrate an increased coincidence-to-accidental ratio without additional resource overhead in a five-node network. To contextualize these experimental findings, we project their performance in a quantum key distribution scenario and outline a feasible route towards field deployment, using integrated photonics to enable network integration of up to 72 users.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an array of nonlinear waveguides, quantum states can be generated from classical states through spontaneous parametric down-conversion of photons. This work simulates and analyzes the effect of disorder on light propagation and its quantum correlations, implementing disorder in three system parameters: coupling, injection amplitude, and injection phase. It is determined that when light is injected into only one waveguide, disorder in the coupling increases localization and reduces dispersion. Moreover, in this case, propagation tends to remain ballistic, a characteristic feature of waveguide arrays. Conversely, disorder in the injection amplitude and phase tends to delocalize the wave function, with the latter having a more pronounced effect. Finally, it is observed that quantum correlations, obtained from the correlation matrix, are robust in the presence of disorder, particularly the null elements.

En un arreglo de gu\'ias de onda no lineales se pueden generar estados cu\'anticos a partir de estados cl\'asicos mediante la conversi\'on param\'etrica descendente espont\'anea de fotones. En este trabajo se simula y analiza el efecto del desorden en la propagaci\'on de la luz y sus correlaciones cu\'anticas, implementando desorden en tres perfiles del sistema: acoplamiento, amplitud de inyecci\'on y fase de inyecci\'on. Se determina que, cuando se inyecta solamente una gu\'ia de onda, el desorden en el acoplamiento aumenta la localizaci\'on y disminuye la dispersi\'on. Adem\'as, en este caso se preserva la propagaci\'on con tendencia a ser bal\'istica, lo cual es caracter\'istico de arreglos de gu\'ias de onda. Contrariamente, el desorden en la amplitud y fase de inyecci\'on tienden a deslocalizar la funci\'on de onda, siendo el efecto mayor en el \'ultimo caso. Finalmente, se observa que las correlaciones cu\'anticas, obtenidas a partir de la matriz de correlaci\'on, son robustas ante la presencia de desorden, en particular los elementos nulos.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Hamiltonian Compiler for Hybrid Qubit-Boson Processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum simulation of the interactions of fermions and bosons -- the fundamental particles of nature -- is essential for modeling complex quantum systems in material science, chemistry and high-energy physics and has been proposed as a promising application of fermion-boson quantum computers, which overcome the overhead encountered in mapping fermions and bosons to qubits. However, compiling the simulation of specific fermion-boson Hamiltonians into the natively available fermion-boson gate set is challenging. In particular, the large local dimension of bosons renders matrix-based compilation methods, as used for qubits and in existing tools such as Bosonic Qiskit or OpenFermion, challenging. We overcome this issue by introducing a novel symbolic compiler based on matrix-free symbolic manipulation of second quantised Hamiltonians, which automates the decomposition of fermion-boson second quantized problems into qubit-boson instruction set architectures. This integration establishes a comprehensive pipeline for simulating quantum systems on emerging qubit-boson and fermion-boson hardware, paving the way for their large-scale usage.</description>

      <title>Minimizing the number of edges in LC-equivalent graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00292v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph states are a powerful class of entangled states with numerous applications in quantum communication and quantum computation. Local Clifford (LC) operations that map one graph state to another can alter the structure of the corresponding graphs, including changing the number of edges. Here, we tackle the associated edge-minimization problem: finding graphs with the minimum number of edges in the LC-equivalence class of a given graph. Such graphs are called minimum edge representatives (MER), and are crucial for minimizing the resources required to create a graph state. We leverage Bouchet's algebraic formulation of LC-equivalence to encode the edge-minimization problem as an integer linear program (ILP). We further propose a simulated annealing (SA) approach guided by the local clustering coefficient for edge minimization. We identify new MERs for graph states with up to 16 qubits by combining SA and ILP. We extend the ILP to weighted-edge minimization, where each edge has an associated weight, and prove that this problem is NP-complete. Finally, we employ our tools to minimize resources required to create all-photonic generalized repeater graph states using fusion operations.</description>

      <title>Bosonic quantum error correction using squeezed Fock states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper, we develop a bosonic quantum error correction code based on squeezed Fock states. We compare our proposed code with one based on squeezed Schrodinger's cat states using the Knill-Laflamme cost function and the Petz map fidelity. We demonstrate that squeezed Fock states are competitive in protecting information in a channel with particle loss and dephasing.</description>

      <title>QTP-Net: A Quantum Text Pre-training Network for Natural Language Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Natural Language Processing (NLP) faces challenges in the ability to quickly model polysemous words. The Grover's Algorithm (GA) is expected to solve this problem but lacks adaptability. To address the above dilemma, a Quantum Text Pre-training Network (QTP-Net) is proposed to improve the performance of NLP tasks. First, a Quantum Enhanced Pre-training Feature Embedding (QEPFE) is developed to encode multiple meanings of words into quantum superposition states and exploit adaptive GA to fast capture rich text features. Subsequently, the QEPFE is combined with the Enhanced Representation through kNowledge IntEgration (ERNIE), a pre-trained language model proposed by Baidu, to construct QTP-Net, which is evaluated on Sentiment Classification (SC) and Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) tasks. Experiments show that in SC, the QTP-Net improves the average accuracy by 0.024 and the F1 score by 0.029 on six benchmark datasets, comprehensively outperforming both classical and quantum-inspired models. In WSD, it reaches 0.784 average F1 score, which is 0.016 higher than the sub-optimal GlossBERT, and significantly leads on SE2, SE13, and SE15. QTP-Net provides a new solution for implicit semantic modeling in NLP and lays the foundation for future research on quantum-enhanced models.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensates in a tilted optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the emergence of chaotic dynamics in Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) subjected to both alternating (AC) and constant (DC) components of the interaction strength, modeled through the scattering length. We systematically explore how the interplay of AC and DC nonlinearities affect the dynamical evolution of the condensate under a tilted optical lattice potential. Various types of chaos are identified across different parametric regimes, with numerical simulations revealing a clear distinction between regular and chaotic domains. The width of the regular domains is quantified, and the influence of AC and DC components in promoting stochastic behavior is highlighted. Lyapunov exponents, Poincar\'e sections, and other chaos indicators then confirm the transition to chaotic dynamics, in agreement with analytical expectations. A qualitative conjecture is proposed for the role of these interactions in BEC stabilization. Our findings offer insights into the dynamic control of BECs, with potential applications in quantum simulation and coherent matter-wave engineering, in line with entanglement and quantum transport, that are crucial for developing robust and reliable quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Strain Enhanced Spin Readout Contrast in Silicon Carbide Membranes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum defects in solids have emerged as a transformative platform for advancing quantum technologies. A key requirement for these applications is achieving high-fidelity single-spin readout, particularly at room temperature for quantum biosensing. Here, we demonstrate through ab initio simulations of a primary quantum defect in 4H silicon carbide that strain is an effective control parameter for significantly enhancing readout contrast. We validate this principle experimentally by inducing local strain in silicon carbide-on-insulator membranes, achieving a readout contrast exceeding 60% while preserving the favorable coherence properties of single spins. Our findings establish strain engineering as a powerful and versatile strategy for optimizing coherent spin-photon interfaces in solid-state quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lindblad equation is a widely used quantum master equation to model the dynamical evolution of open quantum systems whose states are described by density matrices. This equation is also a fundamental building block to design optimal control functions. In this paper we develop full- and low-rank exponential midpoint integrators for solving both the forward and adjoint Lindblad equations. These schemes are applicable to optimize-then-discretize approaches for optimal control of open quantum systems. We show that the proposed schemes preserve positivity and trace unconditionally. Furthermore, convergence of these numerical schemes is proved theoretically and verified numerically.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometric Tensor for Mixed States Based on the Covariant Derivative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) is a fundamental quantity for characterizing the geometric properties of quantum states and plays an essential role in elucidating various physical phenomena. The traditional QGT, defined only for pure states, has limited applicability in realistic scenarios where mixed states are common. To address this limitation, we generalize the definition of the QGT to mixed states using the purification bundle and the covariant derivative. Notably, our proposed definition reduces to the traditional QGT when mixed states approach pure states. In our framework, the real and imaginary parts of this generalized QGT correspond to the Bures metric and the mean gauge curvature, respectively, endowing it with a broad range of potential applications. Additionally, using our proposed mixed-state QGT (MSQGT), we derive the geodesic equation applicable to mixed states. This work establishes a unified framework for the geometric analysis of both pure and mixed states, thereby deepening our understanding of the geometric properties of quantum states.</description>

      <title>A Geometric Quantum Speed Limit: Theoretical Insights and Photonic Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00354v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum mechanics imposes a lower bound on the time required for a quantum system to reach certain given targets. In this paper, from a geometric perspective, we introduce a new quantum speed limit (QSL) based on the Bloch angle and derive the condition for it to saturate. Experimentally, we demonstrate the feasibility of measuring this QSL using a photonic system through direct Bloch angle measurements via a swap test, bypassing the need for comprehensive quantum state tomography. Compared to the existing Bloch-angle-based QSL mentioned in prior work, our QSL requires fewer computational and experimental resources and provides tighter constraints for specific dynamics. Our work underscores the Bloch angle's effectiveness in providing tighter and experimentally accessible QSLs and advances the understanding of quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Entanglement and Nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00366v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell inequalities on local hidden variables were used to test particle entanglement given by the quantum mechanics wavefunction. The experiments on correlated photon pairs showed a clear violation of Bell inequalities and agreement with quantum mechanics. This study revealed that the Bell inequalities on normalized density function is true only for photon polarization at individual instances but it does not hold over the entire population in a given system. The Bell inequalities is not an incompatibility criterion for local hidden variables vs quantum mechanics rather it is a criterion for an individual nature vs population dynamics. The study found that the local variables (photon polarization) described each quantity in Bell test and a complete agreement with the experiments where quantum mechanics was incapable to provide as it is a unified system. The paper concludes with great satisfaction that the simultaneous measurement of two correlated photons at a distance was a local cause (photon-filter interaction did not violate the special theory of relativity) and the nonlocality description given by the wavefunction was not physical.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The realization of quantum networks that exploit multiqubit entanglement opens avenues for transformative applications in the realm of quantum communication. In the paper, we present a set of heralded deterministic protocols designed for the generation of two-qubit, three-qubit, and $N$-qubit Knill-Laflamme-Milburn (KLM) states by the photon scattering property in one-dimensional waveguide-emitter system. In each protocol, the auxiliary single photon functions as a universal interface to bridge all stationary qubits. Our proposed protocols allow for the conversion of irregular scattering incidents occasioned by nonideal coupling and frequency detuning into detectable events by triggering the detectors, which mean that our protocols for the generation of arbitrary KLM states with the predictive operational character and high fidelities. Owing to the significant breakthroughs in the integration of quantum emitters with nanophotonic waveguides, our protocolfs possess ideal features that position them as the promising candidate for deployment in long-range multiqubit quantum networks systems.</description>

The derivation of quantization rules and energy levels is revisited using semiclassical methods. Sommerfeld-type integrals are evaluated by elementary techniques, and connections with the Schr\"{o}dinger and Dirac equations are established. Historical developments and key transitions from classical to quantum theory are discussed to clarify the structure and significance of the old quantum mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory is analysed by means of a set of bounded Hermitian operators constructed out of the unitary Weyl operators. These operators allow for both analytic and numerical approaches. While the former relies on the modular theory of Tomita-Takesaki, the latter is devised through an explicit construction of the test functions needed for the localization of the aforementioned operators. The case of causal tangent diamonds in $1+1$ Minkowski spacetime is scrutinized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems have elevated the second law of thermodynamics to a statistical realm by establishing a connection between time-forward and time-reversal probabilities, providing invaluable insight into nonequilibrium dynamics. While well established in classical systems, their quantum generalization, incorporating coherence and the diversity of quantum noise, remains open. We report the experimental validation of a quantum fluctuation theorem (QFT) in a photonic system, applicable to general quantum processes with nonclassical characteristics, including quasi-probabilistic descriptions of entropy production and multiple time-reversal processes. Our experiment confirms that the ratio between the quasi-probabilities of the time-forward and any multiple time-reversal processes obeys a generalized Crooks QFT. Moreover, coherence induced by a quantum process leads to the imaginary components of quantum entropy production, governing the phase factor in the QFT. These findings underscore the fundamental symmetry between a general quantum process and its time reversal, providing an elementary toolkit to explore noisy quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Manipulation of Photonic Spin Hall Effect via Interacting Rydberg Atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical study demonstrating enhanced tunability of the photonic spin Hall effect (PSHE) using a strongly interacting Rydberg atomic medium under electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) conditions. In contrast to conventional approaches that rely on static refractiveindex profiles or metamaterials, here the PSHE is controlled via a nonlocal third-order nonlinear susceptibility arising from long range Rydberg-Rydberg interactions. We show that this nonlocal nonlinearity enables dynamic modulation of spin-dependent light trajectories, amplifying the normally weak PSHE into a readily observable and adjustable effect. These results pave the way for new capabilities in photonic information processing and sensing. In particular, an adjustable PSHE may enable beam steering based on photon spin, improve the sensitivity of precision measurements, and support photonic devices whose functionality can be reconfigured in real time.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atomic processing units require robust entanglement between individual qubits, typically achieved via excitation to highly interacting Rydberg states. However, short Rydberg lifetimes and ionization risks limit the quantum volume score of the atomic processing units. Inspired by Landau resonances in alkaline atoms, we introduce Rydberg-Landau (rLandau) states created under a strong magnetic field (2.5 Tesla). These states exhibit significantly extended lifetimes and a magnetic confinement mechanism that prevents ionization, even under intense laser fields. We analyze their wavefunctions, excitation dynamics, dipole transition rules, lifetimes, and interactions, identifying states optimal for high-fidelity quantum operations. This approach simplifies the coherent excitation of long-lived, strongly interacting rLandau circular states akin to Coulombic counterparts, enabling deeper and more complex quantum algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a fault-tolerant protocol for code concatenation using a butterfly network architecture with high noise thresholds and low ancilla overhead to allow implementation on current devices. We develop a probability passing decoder using tensor networks that applies Bayesian updates to the marginal error probabilities after each layer of checks, achieving a state preparation threshold of $e_c \approx 0.089$ for erasure errors, and $\approx 0.015$ for unheralded noise. We implement our state preparation protocol on ion-trap hardware with added noise to demonstrate the threshold behavior in a real quantum device. We further theoretically test the performance of our scheme as a quantum memory and for universal quantum computation through the preparation of low-noise magic states for state distillation and $T$-gate injection.</description>

      <title>Heisenberg-limited Hamiltonian learning continuous variable systems via engineered dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discrete and continuous variables oftentimes require different treatments in many learning tasks. Identifying the Hamiltonian governing the evolution of a quantum system is a fundamental task in quantum learning theory. While previous works mostly focused on quantum spin systems, where quantum states can be seen as superpositions of discrete bit-strings, relatively little is known about Hamiltonian learning for continuous-variable quantum systems. In this work we focus on learning the Hamiltonian of a bosonic quantum system, a common type of continuous-variable quantum system. This learning task involves an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space and unbounded operators, making mathematically rigorous treatments challenging. We introduce an analytic framework to study the effects of strong dissipation in such systems, enabling a rigorous analysis of cat qubit stabilization via engineered dissipation. This framework also supports the development of Heisenberg-limited algorithms for learning general bosonic Hamiltonians with higher-order terms of the creation and annihilation operators. Notably, our scheme requires a total Hamiltonian evolution time that scales only logarithmically with the number of modes and inversely with the precision of the reconstructed coefficients. On a theoretical level, we derive a new quantitative adiabatic approximation estimate for general Lindbladian evolutions with unbounded generators. Finally, we discuss possible experimental implementations.</description>

      <title>Indefinite Causal Order Skip Logic with Coherently Conditioned Subroutines and Application to Grover Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00647v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Indefinite causal order (ICO) allows quantum circuits to superpose the sequence in which operations occur, enabling computational structures not possible under fixed gate ordering and new ways to manage circuit resources. This work introduces the Quantum Skip Gate (QSG), a unitary primitive that conditionally omits an expensive subroutine whenever a cheaper precursor has already solved the problem, all without mid-circuit measurement. Unlike dynamic circuits with mid-circuit measurement, the QSG performs skip logic through fully coherent unitary evolution. To our knowledge, this is the first gate-model implementation of skip logic via ICO. Embedding the QSG in a Grover-style search, we run proof-of-principle experiments on IBM Quantum hardware (IBM Brisbane, n = 4, k = 3) and observe that the circuit skips 9-25 percent of potential expensive subroutine invocations while boosting success per oracle efficiency by 31 to 61 percent compared with a fixed order baseline. Noise model simulations on the larger IBM Sherbrooke processor confirm the trend, showing depth matched efficiency improvements of 35 to 45 percent once a swap out construction removes superfluous controls. These results demonstrate that indefinite causal order can do more than permute operations. ICO can provide practical, coherence-preserving resource management in gate model algorithms, reducing both runtime cost and noise exposure on today's hardware.</description>

      <title>Coherent error induced phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of logical information in quantum stabilizer codes subject to coherent unitary errors. Beginning with a logical state, we apply a random unitary error channel and subsequently measure stabilizer checks, resulting in a syndrome-dependent post-measurement state. By examining both this syndrome state and the associated syndrome distribution, we identify a phase transition in the behavior of the logical state. Below a critical error threshold pc, the syndrome state remains in the same logical state, enabling successful recovery of the code's logical information via suitable error-correction protocols. Above pc, however, the syndrome state shifts to a different logical state, signaling the breakdown of efficient error correction. Notably, this process can often induce an effective unitary rotation within the logical space. This transition is accompanied by qualitative changes in both the global and local features of the syndrome distribution. We refer to this phenomenon as a coherent error induced phase transition. To illustrate this transition, we present two classes of quantum error correcting code models the toric code and non-local random stabilizer codes thereby shedding light on the design and performance limits of quantum error correction under coherent errors.</description>

      <title>Statistical Signal Processing for Quantum Error Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00683v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era, quantum error mitigation (QEM) is essential for producing reliable outputs from quantum circuits. We present a statistical signal processing approach to QEM that estimates the most likely noiseless outputs from noisy quantum measurements. Our model assumes that circuit depth is sufficient for depolarizing noise, producing corrupted observations that resemble a uniform distribution alongside classical bit-flip errors from readout. Our method consists of two steps: a filtering stage that discards uninformative depolarizing noise and an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that computes a maximum likelihood (ML) estimate over the remaining data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on small-qubit systems using IBM circuit simulations in Qiskit and compare its performance to contemporary statistical QEM techniques. We also show that our method scales to larger qubit counts using synthetically generated data consistent with our noise model. These results suggest that principled statistical methods can offer scalable and interpretable solutions for quantum error mitigation in realistic NISQ settings.</description>

      <title>High-order interactions in quantum optomechanics: fluctuations, dynamics and thermodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum optomechanics describes the interaction between a confined field and a fluctuating wall due to radiation pressure. The dynamics of this system is typically understood using perturbation theory up to second order in the small coupling. Improving beyond this regime can shed light onto new phenomena. In this work we study high-order resonant wall-field interactions characterized by two- and three-phonon scattering processes. We obtain the Hamiltonian, compute the perturbed energy spectrum and explicitly calculate corrections to the ground state. Finally, we study the dynamics of the system when second- and third-order resonance conditions are activated, showing that the presence of high-order terms in the Hamiltonian drastically affects the populations of all particles, as well as the entropy production rate.</description>

      <title>Multi-Controlled Quantum Gates in Linear Nearest Neighbor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-controlled single-target (MC) gates are some of the most crucial building blocks for varied quantum algorithms. How to implement them optimally is thus a pivotal question. To answer this question in an architecture-independent manner, and to get a worst-case estimate, we should look at a linear nearest-neighbor (LNN) architecture, as this can be embedded in almost any qubit connectivity. Motivated by the above, here we describe a method which implements MC gates using no more than $\sim 4k+8n$ CNOT gates -- up-to $60\%$ reduction over state-of-the-art -- while allowing for complete flexibility to choose the locations of $n$ controls, the target, and a dirty ancilla out of $k$ qubits. More strikingly, in case $k \approx n$, our upper bound is $\sim 12n$ -- the best known for unrestricted connectivity -- and if $n = 1$, our upper bound is $\sim 4k$ -- the best known for a single long-range CNOT gate over $k$ qubits -- therefore, if our upper bound can be reduced, then the cost of one or both of these simpler versions of MC gates will be immediately reduced accordingly. In practice, our method provides circuits that tend to require fewer CNOT gates than our upper bound for almost any given instance of MC gates.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Properties and Superstatistics of Graphene under a Constant Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present the solutions of the Dirac-Weyl equation for graphene under a constant magnetic field. The resulting spectrum is used to determine the partition function, a key quantity in the study of thermodynamic properties. From this function, we analyze the mean energy, specific heat, entropy, and free energy in two different frameworks: the canonical ensemble and the superstatistical approach. The study confirms the relativistic nature of electron transport in graphene under a magnetic field. It also reveals that fluctuations introduce additional disorder in the system. The obtained results are in good agreement with those already reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedup in quantum simulation of Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian via orbifold lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian -- an approach known for its efficiency in simulating SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and QCD on digital quantum computers -- can reproduce the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian in a controlled limit. While the original Kogut-Susskind approach faces significant implementation challenges on quantum hardware, we show that it emerges naturally as the infinite scalar mass limit of the orbifold lattice formulation, even at finite lattice spacing. Our analysis provides both a general analytical framework applicable to SU($N$) gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions and specific numerical evidence for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) Yang-Mills theories ($N=2,3$). Using Euclidean path integral methods, we quantify the convergence rate by comparing the standard Wilson action with the orbifold lattice action, matching lattice parameters, and systematically extrapolating results as the bare scalar mass approaches infinity. This reformulation resolves longstanding technical obstacles and offers a straightforward implementation protocol for digital quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian with exponential speedup compared to classical methods and previously known quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Spectral and Thermal Analysis of the Morse Potential within the Dunkl Formalism: Analytical Approximations and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the quantum dynamics of a particle subject to the Morse potential within the framework of Dunkl quantum mechanics. By employing the Dunkl derivative operator, which introduces reflection symmetry, we construct a deformed Schr\"odinger equation and obtain exact analytical solutions using the Pekeris approximation. The resulting energy spectrum and wavefunctions reveal how Dunkl parameters alter the effective potential and vibrational states. The model is applied to several diatomic molecules, including H$_2$, HCl, and I$_2$, illustrating the impact of symmetry deformation on energy spectra. We also compute thermodynamic functions, including the partition function, free energy, internal energy, entropy, and specific heat. The analysis shows that the Dunkl deformation induces distinct thermal behavior and offers a tunable approach to molecular modeling. These results highlight the potential of the Dunkl formalism as a useful tool for extending conventional quantum models and for exploring symmetry-deformed systems in molecular physics and quantum thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Work Extraction from Classically Correlated States in Noisy Quantum Channels with Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential of local non-unital noise and quantum channel memory to enhance work extraction from classically correlated quantum states. Utilizing the framework of daemonic ergotropy, which incorporates measurement-based feedback via an ancillary system, we show that amplitude damping channels can induce quantum correlations that enable additional extractable work. Through analytical derivations and numerical simulations, we quantify the daemonic gain and demonstrate that channel memory significantly amplifies this advantage by preserving system-ancilla correlations. Our results reveal that non-unital noise can serve not as a limitation but as a valuable thermodynamic resource in quantum protocols.</description>

      <title>Resonant Tunneling in Tri-layer 2H-MoTe2 grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy Coupled with layered WSe2 carrier Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here, we report a prominent quantum oscillation in the conductance of 2H-MoTe2 based resonant tunneling structure. In this work, a n-WSe2/HfO2/i-MoTe2/HfO2/Au resonant tunneling device (RTD) with a symmetric and asymmetric double barrier has been fabricated using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown 2H-MoTe2 and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) grown 2H-WSe2 along with theoretical modeling by adopting non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) formalism. The impact of MoTe2-quantum well widths equal, and above its excitonic Bohr radius (EBR:0.7 nm) on resonant tunneling current is investigated at cryogenic temperatures. Such peak values increase with downscaling of the well width up to a certain value and then it decreases with further miniaturization. The corresponding maximum peak-to-valley current ratio (PVR) is estimated to be 4 at 4K in the low voltage range for the very first time in MoTe2 based RTD. Therefore, the present work may provide the route for fabrication of WSe2/MoTe2-based high performance resonant tunneling devices integrable with HEMT device for modern Qubit architecture operational at ultra-low temperatures.</description>

      <title>AEQUAM: Accelerating Quantum Algorithm Validation through FPGA-Based Emulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents AEQUAM (Area Efficient QUAntum eMulation), a toolchain that enables faster and more accessible quantum circuit verification. It consists of a compiler that translates OpenQASM 2.0 into RISC-like instructions, Cython software models for selecting number representations and simulating circuits, and a VHDL generator that produces RTL descriptions for FPGA-based hardware emulators. The architecture leverages a SIMD approach to parallelize computation and reduces complexity by exploiting the sparsity of quantum gate matrices. The VHDL generator allows customization of the number of emulated qubits and parallelization levels to meet user requirements. Synthesized on an Altera Cyclone 10LP FPGA with a 20-bit fixed-point representation and nearest-type approximation, the architecture demonstrates better scalability than other state-of-the-art emulators. Specifically, the emulator has been validated by exploiting the well consolidated benchmark of mqt bench framework.</description>

      <title>The Bloch Equation Generator -- SimuF\'isica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction between multilevel quantum systems and coherent radiation underlies several phenomena in modern atomic optics. The formulation and solution of the Bloch equations, which describe the dynamics of such systems, become complex as the number of levels increases. In this work, we present the Bloch Equation Generator, a free, browser-based computational tool developed to automate the generation and numerical solution of Bloch equations for systems with up to 30 levels. Users can configure the level diagram, select allowed transitions, define decay rates, and choose whether or not to apply the rotating wave approximation. The software automatically generates the complete set of equations and provides C source code for numerical solutions in both the time and frequency domains. To illustrate its applicability, we present three examples: (i) a two-level system, (ii) a $\Lambda$-type system with analysis of CPT, EIT, and the Autler-Townes effect, and (iii) a realistic 12-level system based on the Zeeman-resolved $5S_{1/2} \to 5P_{3/2}$ transition of rubidium-87.</description>

      <title>Parity-Time Symmetric Spin-1/2 Richardson-Gaudin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we systematically investigate the integrable $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Richardson-Gaudin model for spin-$1/2$ particles in an arbitrary magnetic field. First, we define the parity and time-reversal transformation rules and determine the metric operator as well as the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric inner product. Using the metric operator, we derive the Hermitian counterparts of the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric conserved charges. We then compute and plot the eigenvalues of the conserved charges obtained from the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Richardson-Gaudin model. As expected for any $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric system, the spectrum exhibits both real eigenvalues and complex-conjugate pairs.
  We numerically study the spin dynamics of this model and compare it with the Hermitian case in both closed and open quantum systems. Our findings reveal that, in the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric Richardson-Gaudin model, the system fails to reach a steady state at weak coupling, demonstrating robustness against dissipation. However, at stronger coupling strengths, the system eventually reaches a steady state after some time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Realizing strong interactions between individual photons is a cornerstone for advancing photonic quantum computing and quantum nonlinear optics. Here, we experimentally demonstrate strong interactions between counter-propagating photons mediated by Rydberg polaritons, achieving a record-long anti-correlation range exceeding $1~\mu s$. This extended range enables the use of photon pulses that are long enough to fit within the polariton bandwidth, yet short enough to remain within the interaction range. Under these conditions, we observe complete photon blockade of entire pulses, tunable by the pulse timing, thus demonstrating the potential for controlled, deterministic operations. Extending to the three-photon regime, we observe enhanced interactions when a photon encounters two counter-propagating photons. Our results, supported by analytical theory and rigorous numerical simulations, establish counter-propagating Rydberg polaritons as a powerful platform for engineering interactions in quantum light fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient photon capture in optical cavities is essential for quantum networks and computing, yet single-pass methods suffer from uncaptured reflections due to finite capture windows and coupling strengths, precluding perfect transfer of arbitrary photonic states. We introduce a two-pass `pitch-and-catch' method that recycles initial reflections to achieve perfect capture of arbitrary pulses in the noiseless regime and enhances fidelity under intrinsic losses. The method extends to photon emission, enabling arbitrary pulse shaping. This advance offers significant improvements for quantum repeaters, memories, and transduction, enhancing the toolkit for quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Embedding via Ghost Gutzwiller Approximation for Enhanced Simulations of Correlated Electron Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating correlated materials on present-day quantum hardware remains challenging due to limited quantum resources. Quantum embedding methods offer a promising route by reducing computational complexity through the mapping of bulk systems onto effective impurity models, allowing more feasible simulations on pre- and early-fault-tolerant quantum devices. This work develops a quantum-classical embedding framework based on the ghost Gutzwiller approximation to enable quantum-enhanced simulations of ground-state properties and spectral functions of correlated electron systems. Circuit complexity is analyzed using an adaptive variational quantum algorithm on a statevector simulator, applied to the infinite-dimensional Hubbard model with increasing ghost mode numbers from 3 to 5, resulting in circuit depths growing from 16 to 104. Noise effects are examined using a realistic error model, revealing significant impact on the spectral weight of the Hubbard bands. To mitigate these effects, the Iceberg quantum error detection code is employed, achieving up to 40% error reduction in simulations. Finally, the accuracy of the density matrix estimation is benchmarked on IBM and Quantinuum quantum hardware, featuring distinct qubit-connectivity and employing multiple levels of error mitigation techniques.</description>

      <title>Long-Distance Device-Independent Conference Key Agreement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) enables two remote parties to share an information-theoretically secure key without any assumptions on the inner workings of the devices used. Device-independent conference key agreement (DI-CKA) is multipartite DI-QKD where more than two parties share a common secure key. The performance of DI-CKA, however, is strictly limited because of its susceptibility to losses due e.g. to imperfect detection efficiency and channel transmission. Here, we propose a DI-CKA protocol which reduces this limitation by using a heralding scheme to distribute multipartite entanglement. We analyze key rates of our protocol for two different measurement scenarios and we show that our protocol outperforms a previous DI-CKA protocol even with an experimentally feasible measurement.</description>

      <title>Neural-network-assisted Monte Carlo sampling trained by Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling problems are widely regarded as the task for which quantum computers can most readily provide a quantum advantage. Leveraging this feature, the quantum-enhanced Markov chain Monte Carlo [Layden, D. et al., Nature 619, 282-287 (2023)] has been proposed recently, where sampling from a quantum computer is used as a proposal distribution and convergence to a target distribution is accelerated. However, guaranteeing convergence to the target distribution typically forces one to impose restrictive symmetry constraints on the quantum circuit, which makes it hard to design good proposal distributions and prevents making full use of the advantage of a quantum computer. We explore a hybrid quantum-classical MCMC framework that combines a quantum circuit with a generative neural sampler (GNS). The GNS is trained on quantum samples and acts as a classical surrogate to efficiently emulate quantum outputs, thereby lifting circuit constraints. We apply this method to Boltzmann sampling of spin glasses using proposals trained with a QAOA circuit. This approach outperforms conventional methods, showing a $\sim$100$\times$ improvement in spectral gap over uniform proposals. Notably, it maintains similar acceleration even without parameter optimization. These results establish the method as a viable sampling-based quantum algorithm for NISQ devices and highlight its potential for solving practical problems with quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Thermalization and irreversibility of an isolated quantum system II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The irreversible entropy increase described by the second law of thermodynamics is fundamentally tied to thermalization and the emergence of equilibrium. In the first part of our work (Ref: arXiv.2503.04152), we constructed an isolated gas system model and numerically demonstrated irreversible growth of entanglement entropy caused by erasure of spread non-equilibrium state information. Here, we mathematically prove that for any macroscopic system in a non-equilibrium state $|\phi_0\rangle$, the quantum state $|\phi'_0\rangle = \hat{O}(t)|\phi_0\rangle$ will inevitably evolve toward equilibrium. Our work demonstrates that the second law of thermodynamics, and consequently the ergodic hypothesis in statistical physics, can be understood and proven from a quantum information perspective. From this perspective, the second law can be stated as: In generic macroscopic physical systems, the spreading and erasure of non-equilibrium information is unavoidable.</description>

      <title>Many-body critical non-Hermitian skin effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Criticality in non-Hermitian systems unveils unique phase transitions and scaling behaviors beyond Hermitian paradigms, offering new insights into the interplay between gain/loss, non-reciprocity, and complex energy spectra. In this paper, we uncover a new class of many-body critical non-Hermitian skin effect (CSE) originating from the interplay between multiple non-Hermitian pumping channels and Hubbard interactions. In particular, criticality in the real-to-complex transitions can selectively emerge within the subspace of bound states or scattering states, as well as their interacting admixtures. These mechanisms possess no single-particle analog and can be diagnosed through a specially defined correlation function. As more particles are involved, higher-order CSEs naturally arise, with greatly enhanced effective coupling strengths and hence greater experimental accessibility. Our results reveal an enriched landscape of non-Hermitian critical phenomena in interacting many-body systems, and pave the way for investigating unconventional non-Hermitian criticality in the context of various interaction-induced particle clustering configurations.</description>

      <title>New aspects of quantum topological data analysis: Betti number estimation, and testing and tracking of homology and cohomology classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the application of quantum computation to topological data analysis (TDA) has received increasing attention. In particular, several quantum algorithms have been proposed for estimating (normalized) Betti numbers, a central challenge in TDA. However, it was recently proven that estimating Betti numbers is an NP-hard problem, revealing a complexity-theoretic limitation to achieving a generic quantum advantage for this task. Motivated by this limitation and inspired by previous progress, we explore broader quantum approaches to TDA. First, we consider scenarios in which a simplicial complex is specified in a more informative form, enabling alternative quantum algorithms to estimate Betti numbers and persistent Betti numbers. We then move beyond Betti numbers and study the problem of testing the homology class of a given cycle, as well as distinguishing between homology classes. We also introduce cohomological techniques for these problems, along with a quantum algorithm. We then discuss their potential use in the testing and tracking of homology classes, which can be useful for TDA applications. Our results show that, despite the hardness of general Betti number estimation, quantum algorithms can still offer speed-ups in structured settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the intersection of quantum computing and agentic AI by examining how quantum technologies can enhance the capabilities of autonomous agents, and, conversely, how agentic AI can support the advancement of quantum systems. We analyze both directions of this synergy and present conceptual and technical foundations for future quantum-agentic platforms. Our work introduces a formal definition of quantum agents and outlines potential architectures that integrate quantum computing with agent-based systems. As a proof-of-concept, we develop and evaluate three quantum agent prototypes that demonstrate the feasibility of our proposed framework. Furthermore, we discuss use cases from both perspectives, including quantum-enhanced decision-making, quantum planning and optimization, and AI-driven orchestration of quantum workflows. By bridging these fields, we aim to chart a path toward scalable, intelligent, and adaptive quantum-agentic ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Optimal T depth quantum circuits for implementing arbitrary Boolean functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a generic construction to obtain an optimal T depth quantum circuit for any arbitrary $n$-input $m$-output Boolean function $f: \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow \{0,1\}^m$ having algebraic degree $k\leq n$, and it achieves an exact Toffoli (and T) depth of $\lceil \log_2 k \rceil$. This is a broader generalization of the recent result establishing the optimal Toffoli (and consequently T) depth for multi-controlled Toffoli decompositions (Dutta et al., Phys. Rev. A, 2025). We achieve this by inspecting the Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) of a Boolean function. Obtaining a benchmark for the minimum T depth of such circuits are of prime importance for efficient implementation of quantum algorithms by enabling greater parallelism, reducing time complexity, and minimizing circuit latency, making them suitable for near-term quantum devices with limited coherence times. The implications of our results are highlighted explaining the provable lower bounds on S-box and block cipher implementations, for example AES.</description>

      <title>hqQUBO: A Hybrid-querying Quantum Optimization Model Validated with 16-qubits on an Ion Trap Quantum Computer for Life Science Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AlphaFold has achieved groundbreaking advancements in protein structure prediction, exerting profound influence across biology, medicine, and drug discovery. However, its reliance on multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is inherently time-consuming due to the NP-hard nature of constructing MSAs. Quantum computing emerges as a promising alternative, compared to classical computers, offering the potentials for exponential speedup and improved accuracy on such complex optimization challenges. This work bridges the gap between quantum computing and MSA task efficiently and successfully, where we compared classical and quantum computational scaling as the number of qubits increases, and assessed the role of quantum entanglement in model performance. Furthermore, we proposed an innovative hybrid query encoding approach hyQUBO to avoid redundancy, and thereby the quantum resources significantly reduced to a scaling of $\mathcal{O}(NL)$. Additionally, coupling of VQE and the quenched CVaR scheme was utilized to enhance the robustness and convergence. The integration of multiple strategies facilitates the robust deployment of the quantum algorithm from idealized simulators (on CPU and GPU) to real-world, noisy quantum devices (HYQ-A37). To the best of our knowledge, our work represented the largest-scale implementation of digital simulation using up to 16 qubits on a trapped-ion quantum computer for life science problem, which achieved state of the art performance in both simulation and experimental results. Our work paves the way towards large-scale simulations of life science tasks on real quantum processors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a multitude of interpretations of quantum mechanics, but foundational principles are lacking. Relational quantum mechanics views the observer as a physical system, which allows for an unambiguous interpretation as all axioms are purely operational, describing the observer's information acquisition. The approach, however, is based on the premise that the observer retains only predictive information about the observed system. Here, we justify this premise using the following principle: Physically embedded observers choose information processing strategies that provide them with the option to approach physical limits to the greatest possible extent. Applied to a lower limit on energy dissipation, the principle leads directly to a compact predictive model, thus justifying the core premise of relational quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>State Similarity in Modular Superconducting Quantum Processors with Classical Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01657v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As quantum devices continue to scale, distributed quantum computing emerges as a promising strategy for executing large-scale tasks across modular quantum processors. A central challenge in this paradigm is verifying the correctness of computational outcomes when subcircuits are executed independently following circuit cutting. Here we propose a cross-platform fidelity estimation algorithm tailored for modular architectures. Our method achieves substantial reductions in sample complexity compared to previous approaches designed for single-processor systems. We experimentally implement the protocol on modular superconducting quantum processors with up to 6 qubits to verify the similarity of two 11-qubit GHZ states. Beyond verification, we show that our algorithm enables a federated quantum kernel method that preserves data privacy. As a proof of concept, we apply it to a 5-qubit quantum phase learning task using six 3-qubit modules, successfully extracting phase information with just eight training samples. These results establish a practical path for scalable verification and trustworthy quantum machine learning of modular quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Efficient fiber coupling of telecom single-photons from circular Bragg gratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deterministic sources of quantum light are becoming increasingly relevant in the development of quantum communication, particularly in deployed fiber networks. Therefore, efficient fiber-coupled sources at telecom wavelength are highly sought after. With this goal in mind, we systematically investigate the fiber coupling performance of quantum dots in optical resonators under three experimental configurations. We quantify coupling efficiency and sensitivity to spatial displacement for single-mode fibers with 3D printed optics on their tip, and benchmark their behavior over a commercial cleaved-cut fiber and a standard optical setup. The reduction of the required optical elements when operating with a lensed or a bare fiber allows for an increased end-to-end efficiency by a factor of up to 3.0 +/- 0.2 over a standard setup. For the perspective of realizing a mechanically stable fiber-coupled source, we precisely quantify the spatial tolerance to fiber-cavity misalignment, observing less than 50 % count rate drop for several micrometers displacement. These results will play a key role in the future development of fiber-coupled sources of quantum light.</description>

      <title>Synthesis of discrete-continuous quantum circuits with multimodal diffusion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently compiling quantum operations remains a major bottleneck in scaling quantum computing. Today's state-of-the-art methods achieve low compilation error by combining search algorithms with gradient-based parameter optimization, but they incur long runtimes and require multiple calls to quantum hardware or expensive classical simulations, making their scaling prohibitive. Recently, machine-learning models have emerged as an alternative, though they are currently restricted to discrete gate sets. Here, we introduce a multimodal denoising diffusion model that simultaneously generates a circuit's structure and its continuous parameters for compiling a target unitary. It leverages two independent diffusion processes, one for discrete gate selection and one for parameter prediction. We benchmark the model over different experiments, analyzing the method's accuracy across varying qubit counts, circuit depths, and proportions of parameterized gates. Finally, by exploiting its rapid circuit generation, we create large datasets of circuits for particular operations and use these to extract valuable heuristics that can help us discover new insights into quantum circuit synthesis.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of phase synchronization between quantum self-sustained oscillators has garnered significant interest in recent years. In this work, we study phase synchronization in three settings: between two continuous-variable oscillators, between two arbitrary quantum spins, and within a hybrid setup involving a spin and an oscillator. We derive a simple and general condition on the elements of the joint density matrix that must be satisfied for them to contribute to the relative phase distribution. In particular, we identify the subset of coherence elements in the joint density matrix that serve as key resources for enabling quantum phase synchronization. Our theory is validated against the previously proposed interaction models known to induce synchronization between the self-sustained oscillators. Moreover, our approach offers valuable insights into the relationship between phase synchronization and various information-theoretic measures.</description>

      <title>Predicting Post-Surgical Complications with Quantum Neural Networks: A Clinical Study on Anastomotic Leak</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01708v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing represents a transformative leap in computational power, with the potential to revolutionize various fields, including healthcare. In this study, we explore the application of quantum machine learning in medical diagnostics, specifically focusing on the prediction of anastomotic leak, a severe post-surgical complication. By comparing quantum neural networks implemented with different ansatz functions to classical classification approaches-including logistic regression, support vector machines, multilayer perceptron, naive Bayes, nearest neighbors, and ensemble methods like gradient boosting and AdaBoost-we evaluate their effectiveness in predictive modeling.
  All models were trained and evaluated using simulations on a classical computer, without quantum sampling, noise, or other quantum-related errors. We employed cross-validation to ensure that model performance was assessed on unseen data, minimizing overfitting. Given the clinical importance of identifying true positives, we analyzed predictions at the highest possible sensitivity levels. At these sensitivity levels, quantum neural networks using the RealAmplitudes ansatz demonstrated the best performance in terms of positive predictive value, negative predictive value, specificity, Brier score, log loss, and other classification metrics.
  Our findings highlight the potential of quantum machine learning to improve predictive accuracy in complex medical scenarios and underscore the promise of integrating quantum computing into healthcare for better diagnostic outcomes.</description>

      <title>Optimization Strategies for Variational Quantum Algorithms in Noisy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are a promising tool in the NISQ era, leveraging quantum computing across diverse fields. However, their performance is hindered by optimization challenges like local minima, barren plateaus, and noise from current quantum hardware. Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), a key subset of VQAs, approximates molecular ground-state energies by minimizing a Hamiltonian, enabling quantum chemistry applications. Beyond this, VQE contributes to condensed matter physics by exploring quantum phase transitions and exotic states, and to quantum machine learning by optimizing parameterized circuits for classifiers and generative models. This study systematically evaluates over 50 meta-heuristic optimization algorithms including evolution-based, swarm-based, and music-inspired methods-on their ability to navigate VQE's multimodal and noisy landscapes. Using a multi-phase sieve-like approach, we identify the most capable optimizers and compare their performance on a 1D Ising model (3-9 qubits). Further testing on the Hubbard model (up to 192 parameters) reveals insights into convergence rates, effectiveness, and resilience under noise, offering valuable guidance for advancing optimization in noisy quantum environments.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic entanglement of three magnon modes in three cavities via optical parametric amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a scheme to generate bipartite and tripartite entanglements of three magnon modes in a three-cavity system using a nonlinear optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The three magnon modes in three YIG spheres are respectively placed inside three cavities near the maximum magnetic fields of the cavities and coupled to cavity modes via linear magnetic dipole interaction. Additionally, linear coupling interaction exists between two cavities. Using experimentally feasible parameters, we demonstrate that OPA can prepare the three magnon modes in a steady-state entangled state, bipartite and tripartite entanglements increase with the nonlinear interaction strength of OPA. An alternative approach to enhance quantum entanglement involves multiplexed OPA inputs. By employing individual OPA for each cavity, we observe a significant improvement in entanglement generation. All the entanglements are robust against bath temperature.</description>

      <title>Electro-optic sampling of the electric-field operator for ultrabroadband pulses of Gaussian quantum light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum light pulses (QLPs) can be described by spatio-temporal modes, each of which is associated with a quantum state. In the mid-infrared spectral range, electro-optic sampling (EOS) provides a means to characterize quantum fluctuations in the electric field of such light pulses. Here, we present a protocol based on the two-port EOS technique that enables the complete characterization of multimode Gaussian quantum light, demonstrating robustness to both the shot noise and cascading effects. We validate this approach theoretically by reconstructing a multimode squeezed state of light generated in a thin nonlinear crystal driven by a single-cycle pulse. Our findings establish the two-port EOS technique as a versatile tool for characterizing ultrafast multimode quantum light, thereby broadening the reach of quantum state tomography. Potential applications include the characterization of complex quantum structures, such as correlations and entanglement in light and matter. Further, extensions to study multimode non-Gaussian QLPs can be envisaged.</description>

      <title>Improved belief propagation is sufficient for real-time decoding of quantum memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new heuristic decoder, Relay-BP, targeting real-time quantum circuit decoding for large-scale quantum computers. Relay-BP achieves high accuracy across circuit-noise decoding problems: significantly outperforming BP+OSD+CS-10 for bivariate-bicycle codes and comparable to min-weight-matching for surface codes. As a lightweight message-passing decoder, Relay-BP is inherently parallel, enabling rapid low-footprint decoding with FPGA or ASIC real-time implementations, similar to standard BP. A core aspect of our decoder is its enhancement of the standard BP algorithm by incorporating disordered memory strengths. This dampens oscillations and breaks symmetries that trap traditional BP algorithms. By dynamically adjusting memory strengths in a relay approach, Relay-BP can consecutively encounter multiple valid corrections to improve decoding accuracy. We observe that a problem-dependent distribution of memory strengths that includes negative values is indispensable for good performance.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Information Theoretic Approach to Tractable Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By recursively nesting sums and products, probabilistic circuits have emerged in recent years as an attractive class of generative models as they enjoy, for instance, polytime marginalization of random variables. In this work we study these machine learning models using the framework of quantum information theory, leading to the introduction of positive unital circuits (PUnCs), which generalize circuit evaluations over positive real-valued probabilities to circuit evaluations over positive semi-definite matrices. As a consequence, PUnCs strictly generalize probabilistic circuits as well as recently introduced circuit classes such as PSD circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce more general notions of Clifford codes and stabilizer codes, the latter we call weak stabilizer codes. This is all formulated in the language of projective representation theory of finite groups and we give a novel description of the detectable errors for a Clifford code. We also give examples of infinite families of non-stabilizer Clifford codes as well as examples of non-Clifford weak stabilizer codes. The latter of these types of examples is a class of codes that have not been studied in the same systematic framework as Clifford codes and stabilizer codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the issue of multishot discrimination between two qubit-amplitude damping channels by invoking a simple adaptive protocol that employs Helstrom measurement at each step and classical information feedforward. We contrast the performance of Bayesian and Markovian strategies. We show that the former is only slightly advantageous for a limited parameters' region.</description>

      <title>Emergence of thermodynamic functioning regimes from finite coupling between a quantum thermal machine and a load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Autonomous quantum thermal machines are particularly suited to understand how correlations between thermal baths, a load, and a thermal machine affect the overall thermodynamic functioning of the setup. Here, we show that by tuning the operating temperatures and the magnitude of the coupling between machine and load, the thermal machine can operate in four modes: engine, accelerator, heater, or refrigerator. In particular, we show that as we increase the coupling strength, the engine mode is suppressed, and the refrigerator mode is no longer attainable, leaving the heater as the most pronounced functioning modality, followed by the accelerator. This regime switching can be amplified by quantum effects, such as the bosonic enhancement factor for a harmonic oscillator load, which modifies the effective machine-load coupling, making the thermodynamic functioning sensitive to the initial preparation of the load.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The characterization of Hamiltonians and other components of open quantum dynamical systems plays a crucial role in quantum computing and other applications. Scientific machine learning techniques have been applied to this problem in a variety of ways, including by modeling with deep neural networks. However, the majority of mathematical models describing open quantum systems are linear, and the natural nonlinearities in learnable models have not been incorporated using physical principles. We present a data-driven model for open quantum systems that includes learnable, thermodynamically consistent terms. The trained model is interpretable, as it directly estimates the system Hamiltonian and linear components of coupling to the environment. We validate the model on synthetic two and three-level data, as well as experimental two-level data collected from a quantum device at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.</description>

      <title>Probing Quantum Spin Systems with Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Network Quantum States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural Quantum States (NQS) are a class of variational wave functions parametrized by neural networks (NNs) to study quantum many-body systems. In this work, we propose SineKAN, the NQS ansatz based on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), to represent quantum mechanical wave functions as nested univariate functions. We show that \sk wavefunction with learnable sinusoidal activation functions can capture the ground state energies, fidelities and various correlation functions of the 1D Transverse-Field Ising model, Anisotropic Heisenberg model, and Antiferromagnetic $J_{1}-J_{2}$ model with different chain lengths. In our study of the $J_1-J_2$ model with $L=100$ sites, we find that the SineKAN model outperforms several previously explored neural quantum state ans\"atze, including Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), Long Short-Term Memory models (LSTMs), and Feed-Forward Neural Networks (FFCN), when compared to the results obtained from the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm.</description>

      <title>Coherent polarization self-rotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study coherent polarization self-rotation (CPSR), a two-photon light-matter interaction in dense alkali-metal vapors that enables both narrowband optical spectroscopy of magnetic transitions and coherent coupling between light and collective atomic spins. Unlike conventional polarization self-rotation, CPSR requires initial spin polarization and a predominantly linearly polarized probe. It operates efficiently even in optically thick vapors with high buffer-gas pressure, rapid spin-exchange collisions, and optically-unresolved hyperfine structure. We demonstrate CPSR with near-unity contrast in rubidium and achieve an exceptionally narrow two-photon linewidth of 10 Hz in potassium. CPSR realizes a coherent interface between one optical quadrature and the long-lived collective electronic spin, offering a robust and scalable light-spin coupling in optically thick platforms. This opens new opportunities for quantum optics, including coherent transduction between light and ultra-long-lived noble-gas spins via alkali spins.</description>

      <title>Getting almost all the bits from a quantum random access code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quantum random access code (QRAC) is a map $x\mapsto\rho_x$ that encodes $n$-bit strings $x$ into $m$-qubit quantum states $\rho_x$, in a way that allows us to recover any one bit of $x$ with success probability $\geq p$. The measurement on $\rho_x$ that is used to recover, say, $x_1$ may destroy all the information about the other bits; this is in fact what happens in the well-known QRAC that encodes $n=2$ bits into $m=1$ qubits. Does this generalize to large $n$, i.e., could there exist QRACs that are so "obfuscated" that one cannot get much more than one bit out of them? Here we show that this is not the case: for every QRAC there exists a measurement that (with high probability) recovers the full $n$-bit string $x$ up to small Hamming distance, even for the worst-case $x$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We implement permanent spectral tuning to bring lifetime-limited emitters into collective resonance within an integrated photonic cavity. This addresses a fundamental challenge in solid-state cavity QED: combining multiple coherent quantum emitters with scalable nanophotonics. Our hybrid approach decouples emitter synthesis from nanophotonic fabrication using straightforward techniques that make cavity QED broadly accessible. High doping densities allow us to couple several coherent emitters to a single cavity mode, while optically-induced frequency shifting provides long-lived spectral control. By tuning two molecules into resonance, we demonstrate controlled formation of collective quantum states, establishing a scalable platform for many-body cavity QED. This opens pathways toward chemically-designed quantum systems where optical properties are engineered through synthetic chemistry.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Monty Hall Problem Through a Quantum Measurement Analogy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Monty Hall problem is a classic probability puzzle known for its counterintuitive solution, revealing fundamental discrepancies between mathematical reasoning and human intuition. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel explanatory framework inspired by quantum measurement theory. Specifically, we conceptualize the hosts' actions-opening doors to reveal non-prizes-as analogous to quantum measurements that cause asymmetric collapses of the probability distribution. This quantum-inspired interpretation not only clarifies why the intuitive misunderstanding arises but also provides generalized formulas consistent with standard Bayesian results. We further validate our analytical approach using Monte Carlo simulations across various problem settings, demonstrating precise agreement between theoretical predictions and empirical outcomes. Our quantum analogy thus offers a powerful pedagogical tool, enhancing intuitive understanding of conditional probability phenomena through the lens of probability redistribution and quantum-like measurement operations.</description>

      <title>Quantum theory of fractional topological pumping of lattice solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of topological quantum systems is the robust quantization of particle transport, which is the origin of the integer-valued Quantum Hall conductivity. In the presence of interactions the topological transport can also become fractional. Recent experiments on topological pumps constructed by arrays of photonic waveguides have demonstrated both integer and fractional transport of lattice solitons. Here a background medium mediates interactions between photons via a Kerr nonlinearity and leads to the formation of self-bound composites, called lattice solitons. Upon increasing the interaction strength of these solitons a sequence of transitions was observed from a phase with integer transport in a pump cycle through different phases of fractional transport to a phase with no transport. We here present a full quantum description of topological pumps of solitons. This approach allows us to identify a topological invariant, a many-body Chern number, determined by the band structure of the center-of-mass (COM) momentum of the solitons, which fully governs their transport. Increasing the interaction leads to a successive merging of COM bands which explains the observed sequence of topological phase transitions and also the potential for a breakdown of topological quantization for intermediate interaction strength</description>

Abstract: The pursuit of discovering new phenomena at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) demands constant innovation in algorithms and technologies. Tensor networks are mathematical models on the intersection of classical and quantum machine learning, which present a promising and efficient alternative for tackling these challenges. In this work, we propose a tensor network-based strategy for anomaly detection at the LHC and demonstrate its superior performance in identifying new phenomena compared to established quantum methods. Our model is a parametrized Matrix Product State with an isometric feature map, processing a latent representation of simulated LHC data generated by an autoencoder. Our results highlight the potential of tensor networks to enhance new-physics discovery.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-deformed toric codes and the quantum dimer model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent introduction of a $U(1)$-symmetric toric code model, we investigate symmetry-based deformations of topological order by systematically deconstructing the Gauss-law-enforcing star terms of the toric code (TC) Hamiltonian. This "term-dropping" protocol introduces global symmetries that go beyond the alternative framework of "ungauging" topological order in symmetry-deformed models and gives rise to models such as the $U(1)$TC or $XY$TC. These models inherit (emergent) subsystem symmetries (from the original 1-form symmetry of the TC) that can give rise to (subextensive) ground-state degeneracies, which can still be organized by the eigenvalues of Wilson loop operators. However, we demonstrate that these models do not support topological or fracton order (as has been conjectured in the literature) due to the loss of (emergent) gauge symmetry. An extreme deformation of the TC is the quantum dimer model (QDM), which we discuss along the family of symmetry-deformed models from the perspective of subsystem symmetries, sublattice modulation, and quantum order-by-disorder mechanisms resulting in rich phase diagrams. For the QDM, this allows us to identify an emergent SO(2) symmetry for what appears to be a gapless ground state (by numerical standards) that is unstable to the formation of a plaquette valence bond solid upon sublattice modulation.</description>

      <title>Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.</description>

      <title>A chip-scale atomic beam source for non-classical light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Room temperature thermal atoms have proven to be a powerful resource for magnetometry, electrometry, atom-entanglement generation, and robust atomic clocks. Recent efforts have sought to realize compact and highly manufacturable atomic vapors and atomic beams for chip-scale magnetometry and atomic clocks. Here, we show that a chip-scale rubidium beam source can be integrated with a high finesse cavity-QED system to generate non-classical light. By demonstrating the compatibility of these two technologies, we open a new path for distributed sources of non-classical light and set the stage for using cavity-QED to enhance the performance of chip-scale magnetometers and atomic clocks.</description>

      <title>Extensions of Schr\"odinger operators that generate $C_0$ contraction semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider a non-relativistic quantum particle with wave function $\psi$ in a bounded $C^2$ region $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$, and suppose detectors are placed along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Assume the detection process is irreversible, its mechanism is time independent and also hard, i.e., detections occur only along the boundary $\partial \Omega$. Under these conditions Tumulka argued that the dynamics of $\psi$ must be governed by a $C_0$ contraction semigroup that weakly solves the Schr\"odinger equation and proposed modeling the detector by a time-independent local absorbing boundary condition at $\partial \Omega$. In this paper, we apply the newly discovered theory of boundary quadruples to parameterize all $C_0$ contraction semigroups whose generators extend the Schr\"odinger Hamiltonian, and prove a variant of Tumulka's claim: all such evolutions are generated by the placement of (potentially nonlocal) absorbing boundary conditions on $\psi$ along $\partial \Omega$. We combine this result with the work of Werner to show that each $C_0$ contraction semigroup naturally admits a probability distribution for the time of detection along $\partial \Omega$, and we prove for a wide class of absorbing boundary conditions that the probability of the particle being ever detected is equal to $1$.</description>

      <title>The Einstein Equation from an Informational-Geometrical Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While any observer perceives its immediate neighborhood as locally flat, the metric field deviates from Minkowski space to relate infinitesimal distances assigned by local observers at distinct spacetime points. In a quantum description, these events should emerge from interactions (and thus correlations) between quantum systems, with one of them acting as a reference frame that defines relational localization. In this context, the metric field connects distances between interactions (events) \textit{from the perspective of} distinct physical local reference frames (LRFs). Building on this idea -- together with the connection between entanglement entropy and area (which, in turn, may be linked to the metric itself), and the fact that the Einstein equation does not require the explicit presence of these material frames -- we propose an \emph{informational-geometrical equivalence} (IGE): for a sufficiently small spacelike region $ B $, let $\rho_B $ and $ \sigma_B$ denote the reduced states of the quantum fields and the LRF within $ B $, respectively. In this picture, the relational content of the entropy of the quantum fields as seen by the LRF -- quantified by the conditional entropy $ \delta_\rho S(\rho_B | \sigma_B) $ -- is encoded in the variation $ \delta_{g,\rho} S(\rho_B) $ induced by a smooth geometric perturbation. When the reference frame has complete information about the infrared sector, this IGE recovers the semiclassical Einstein equation. Furthermore, considering the presence of quantum correlations between the system and the LRF reveals a positive cosmological constant related to the density of quantum correlation within $B$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical gravitational Casimir-Polder interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the time-dependent Casimir-Polder-like quantum gravitational interaction between a nonpointlike object and a gravitational Dirichlet boundary, i.e., the dynamical gravitational Casimir-Polder interaction, based on the theory of linearized quantum gravity. We demonstrate that the dynamical interaction potential is nonzero prior to the radiation, which is generated by the gravitational vacuum-fluctuation-induced mass quadrupole of the object, being reflected by the gravitational boundary and back-reacted to the object (i.e., the mirror image of the object lies outside its causal region). This indicates the nonlocality of the fluctuating gravitational field in vacuum and calls for a reevaluation of the inherent causality within the interaction. Moreover, the dynamical gravitational Casimir-Polder interaction can be either attractive or repulsive depending on the distance of the object with respect to the boundary and the time of interaction. When the interaction time is sufficiently long for the system to approach asymptotic equilibrium, the dynamical gravitational Casimir-Polder interaction potential reduces to the static one, which is time-independent and consistently repulsive in both the near and far regimes.</description>

      <title>Observation of effects of inter-atomic interaction on Autler-Townes splitting in cold Rydberg atoms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the effect of inter-atomic interaction in highly excited Rydberg atoms via Autler- Townes splitting in cold atoms. We measure the Autler-Townes (AT) splitting of the 5S1/2, F=2 to 5P3/2, F'=3 transition of 87Rb atoms arising due to the strong coupling of the transition via the cooling beams used for the magneto-optical trap (MOT). The AT splitting is probed using a weakly coupled transition from 5P3/2, F'=3 state to highly excited Rydberg states for a wide range of principal quantum numbers (n = 35 - 117). We observe the AT splitting via trap-loss spectroscopy in the MOT by scanning the probe frequency. We observe a drastic increase in the broadening of the AT splitting signal as a result of interaction-induced dephasing effect in cold Rydberg atoms for highly excited Rydberg states with principal quantum number n &gt; 100. We explain our observations using theoretical modelling and numerical simulations based on the Lindblad Master equation. We find a good agreement of the results of the numerical simulation with the experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>High-Efficiency, High-Fidelity Charge Initialization of Shallow Nitrogen Vacancy Centers in Diamond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond exhibit long spin coherence times, optical initialization, and optical spin readout under ambient conditions, making them excellent quantum sensors. However, the conventional scheme for charge state initialization based on off-resonant green excitation results in significant state preparation errors, typically around 30%. One method for improving charge state initialization fidelity is to use multicolor excitation, which has been demonstrated to achieve a near-unity preparation fidelity for bulk NV centers by using a few milliseconds of near-infrared (5 mW) and green (10 {\mu}W) excitation. The translation of such schemes to NV centers near the diamond surface with higher efficiency optical pumping would enable myriad tasks in nanoscale sensing. Here, we demonstrate a protocol for efficient charge initialization of shallow NV centers between 5 nm and 15 nm from the diamond surface. By carefully studying the charge dynamics of shallow NV centers, we identify a region of parameter space that allows for near-unity (95%) charge initialization within 300 {\mu}s of near-infrared (1 mW) and green (10 {\mu}W) excitation. The time to 90% charge initialization can be as fast as 10 {\mu}s for 4 mW of near-infrared and 39 {\mu}W of green illumination. This fast, efficient charge initialization protocol will enable nanoscale sensing applications where state preparation errors currently prohibit scaling, such as measuring higher-order multi-point correlators.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the analogy between collapsing Conformal Field Theories and measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. Motivated by this analogy we propose the notion of non-commutative (``quantum") Riemannian d-geometry. We explain how this structure is related to Connes's spectral triples in the case d=1. In the Appendix based on the unpublished joint work with Maxim Kontsevich we discuss deformation theory of Quantum Field Theories as well as an approach to QFTs in the case when the space-time is an arbitrary compact metric space.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable quantum interference of atomic spins on surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling quantum interference near avoided energy-level crossings is crucial for fast and reliable coherent manipulation in quantum information processing. However, achieving tunable quantum interference in atomically-precise engineered structures remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate electrical control of quantum interference using atomic spins on an insulating film in a scanning tunneling microscope. Using bias voltages applied across the tunnel junction, we modulate the atomically-confined magnetic interaction between the probe tip and surface atoms with a strong electric field, and drive the spin state rapidly through the energy-level anticrossing. This all-electrical manipulation allows us to achieve Landau-Zener-St\"uckelberg-Majorana (LZSM) interferometry on both single spins and pairs of interacting spins. The LZSM pattern exhibits multiphoton resonances, and its asymmetry suggests that the spin dynamics is influenced by spin-transfer torque of tunneling electrons. Multi-level LZSM spectra measured on coupled spins with tunable interactions show distinct interference patterns depending on their many-body energy landscapes. These results open new avenues for all-electrical quantum manipulation in spin-based quantum processors in the strongly driven regime.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>

      <title>Fast numerical generation of Lie closure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01120v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding the Lie-algebraic closure of a handful of matrices has important applications in quantum computing and quantum control. For most realistic cases, the closure cannot be determined analytically, necessitating an explicit numerical construction. The standard construction algorithm makes repeated calls to a subroutine that determines whether a matrix is linearly independent from a potentially large set of matrices. Because the common implementation of this subroutine has a high complexity, the construction of Lie closure is practically limited to trivially small matrix sizes. We present efficient alternative methods of linear independence check that simultaneously reduce the computational complexity and memory footprint. An implementation of one of the methods is validated against known results. Our new algorithms enable numerical studies of Lie closure in larger system sizes than was previously possible.</description>

      <title>Analogs of deconfined quantum criticality for non-invertible symmetry breaking in 1d</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to exotic phenomena such as coexistence of order and disorder. Here we explore second-order phase transitions in 1d spin chains between two phases that correspond to distinct patterns of non-invertible symmetry breaking. The critical point shares several features with well-understood examples of deconfined quantum critical points, such as enlarged symmetry and identical exponents for the two order parameters participating in the transition. Interestingly, such deconfined transitions involving non-invertible symmetries allow one to construct a whole family of similar critical points by gauging spin-flip symmetries. By employing gauging and bosonization, we characterize the phase diagram of our model in the vicinity of the critical point. We also explore proximate phases and phase transitions in related models, including a deconfined quantum critical point between invertible order parameters that is enforced by a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of four-body scattering in one-dimensional (1D) quantum systems using the adiabatic hyperspherical representation (AHR). Focusing on dimer-dimer collisions between two species of fermions interacting via the sinh-cosh potential, we implement the slow variable discretization (SVD) method to overcome numerical challenges posed by sharp avoided crossings in the potential curves. Our numerical approach is benchmarked against exact analytical results available in integrable regimes, demonstrating excellent agreement. We further explore non-integrable regimes where no analytical solutions exist, revealing novel features such as resonant enhancement of the scattering length associated with tetramer formation. These results highlight the power and flexibility of the AHR+SVD framework for accurate few-body scattering calculations in low-dimensional quantum systems, and establish a foundation for future investigations of universal few-body physics in ultracold gases.</description>

      <title>Time inversion symmetry in the Dirac and Schr\"odinger-Pauli theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory is generally believed to give a faithful representation of the nonrelativistic and weakly relativistic limit of the Dirac theory. However, the Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory is fundamentally incomplete in its account of broken time inversion symmetry, e.g., in magnetically ordered systems. In the Dirac theory of the electron, magnetic order breaks time inversion symmetry even in the nonrelativistic limit, whereas time inversion symmetry is effectively preserved in the Schr\"odinger-Pauli theory in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. In the Dirac theory, the Berry curvature $1/(2m^2c^2)$ is thus an intrinsic property of nonrelativistic electrons similar to the well-known spin magnetic moment $e\hbar/(2m)$, while this result is missed by the nonrelativistic or weakly relativistic Schr\"odinger-Pauli equation. In ferromagnetically ordered systems, the intrinsic Berry curvature yields a contribution to the anomalous Hall conductivity independent of spin-orbit coupling.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of scattering processes in scalar models with two Higgs doublets have recently hinted at a connection between the absence of flavour-space entanglement in $\Phi^+\Phi^0$ scattering and an emergent $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry in the scalar potential. We extend the analysis to all scattering channels with two particles in the external states by treating the process as a four-qubit system in the weak isospin and flavour subspaces of the $2$-particle state. We work with a generic quantum information-theoretic principle encoded by the commutativity of the initial state density matrix with the transition matrix (at leading order in perturbation theory). This yields a special case of the entanglement minimisation conditions previously derived in the literature, and we interpret the principle in terms of the conservation of non-stabiliserness (or magic). Working at leading order in the quartic couplings, we find a consistent set of conditions that implies an $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry on the quartic part of the potential for scattering an arbitrary initial state, but a smaller $\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ symmetry when the initial state is chosen to have definite isospin. This follows by accounting for Bose symmetry in the initial state, which introduces entanglement between the isospin and flavour subspaces.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the axial anomaly in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. The definition of axial charge operators is ambiguous, especially between conserved and nonconserved axial charges. While these charges appear to differ only by a higher-order term in lattice spacing, they do not coincide in the continuum limit. We demonstrate, through analytical and numerical calculations, that the conserved axial charge correctly reproduces the axial anomaly relation in continuous spacetime. Our finding would provide valuable insights for future studies on quantum computing for lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Rydberg Atomic Quantum MIMO Receivers for The Multi-User Uplink</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution for evolving wireless receivers from the classical to the quantum domain. To further unleash their great potential in wireless communications, we propose a flexible architecture for Rydberg atomic quantum multiple-input multiple-output (RAQ-MIMO) receivers in the multi-user uplink. Then the corresponding signal model of the RAQ-MIMO system is constructed by paving the way from quantum physics to classical wireless communications. Explicitly, we outline the associated operating principles and transmission flow. We also validate the linearity of our model and its feasible region. Based on our model, we derive closed-form asymptotic formulas for the ergodic achievable rate (EAR) of both the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and zero-forcing (ZF) receivers operating in uncorrelated fading channels (UFC) and the correlated fading channels (CFC), respectively. Furthermore, we theoretically characterize the EAR difference both between the UFC and CFC scenarios, as well as MRC and ZF schemes. More particularly, we quantify the superiority of RAQ-MIMO receivers over the classical massive MIMO (M-MIMO) receivers, specifying an increase of $\log_{2} \Pi$ of the EAR per user, $\Pi$-fold reduction of the users' transmit power, and $\sqrt[\nu]{\Pi}$-fold increase of the transmission distance, respectively, where $\Pi = \text{ReceiverGainRatio} / \text{ReceiverNoisePowerRatio}$ of the single-sensor receivers and $\nu$ is the path-loss exponent. Our simulation results reveal that, compared to classical M-MIMO receivers, our RAQ-MIMO scheme can either realize $\sim 12$ bits/s/Hz/user ($\sim 8$ bits/s/Hz/user) higher EAR, or $\sim 10000$-fold ($\sim 500$-fold) lower transmit power, or alternatively, $\sim 100$-fold ($\sim 21$-fold) longer distance in free-space transmissions, in the standard quantum limit (photon shot limit).</description>

      <title>Floquet M\"obius topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: M\"obius topological insulators hold twofold-degenerated dispersive edge bands with M\"obius twists in momentum space, which are protected by the combination of chiral and ${\mathbb Z}_2$-projective translational symmetries. In this work, we reveal a unique type of M\"obius topological insulator, whose edge bands could twist around the quasienergy $\pi$ of a periodically driven system and are thus of Floquet origin. By applying time-periodic quenches to an experimentally realized M\"obius insulator model, we obtain interconnected Floquet M\"obius edge bands around zero and $\pi$ quasienergies, which can coexist with a gapped or gapless bulk. These M\"obius bands are topologically characterized by a pair of generalized winding numbers, whose quantizations are guaranteed by an emergent chiral symmetry at a high-symmetry point in momentum space. Numerical investigations of the quasienergy and entanglement spectra provide consistent evidence for the presence of such M\"obius topological phases. A protocol based on the adiabatic switching of edge-band populations is further introduced to dynamically characterize the topology of Floquet M\"obius edge bands. Our findings thus extend the scope of M\"obius topological phases to nonequilibrium settings and unveil a unique class of M\"obius twisted topological edge states without static counterparts.</description>

      <title>Unwrapping photonic reservoirs: enhanced expressivity via random Fourier encoding over stretched domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01410v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Photonic Reservoir Computing (RC) systems leverage the complex propagation and nonlinear interaction of optical waves to perform information processing tasks. These systems employ a combination of optical data encoding (in the field amplitude and/or phase), random scattering, and nonlinear detection to generate nonlinear features that can be processed via a linear readout layer. In this work, we propose a novel scattering-assisted photonic reservoir encoding scheme where the input phase is deliberately wrapped multiple times beyond the natural period of the optical waves $[0,2\pi)$. We demonstrate that, rather than hindering nonlinear separability through loss of bijectivity, wrapping significantly improves the reservoir's prediction performance across regression and classification tasks that are unattainable within the canonical $2\pi$ period. We demonstrate that this counterintuitive effect stems from the nonlinear interference between sets of random synthetic frequencies introduced by the encoding, which generates a rich feature space spanning both the feature and sample dimensions of the data. Our results highlight the potential of engineered phase wrapping as a computational resource in RC systems based on phase encoding, paving the way for novel approaches to designing and optimizing physical computing platforms based on topological and geometric stretching.</description>

      <title>Tunable direct bandgap and optical response in \ch{Mo_{1-x}W_xS2} monolayer alloys: A first-principles investigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic and optical properties of monolayer \ch{Mo_{1-x}W_xS2} alloys, systematically exploring the full compositional range ($x=0$ to $1$) using density functional theory (DFT). We establish that these alloys are thermodynamically stable and maintain the characteristic 2H crystal structure with minimal structural perturbation upon alloying. A key finding is the preservation of a direct bandgap at the $K$-point across all compositions. This gap exhibits continuous tunability, increasing near-monotonically from \SI{1.696}{\electronvolt} (\ch{MoS2}) to \SI{1.858}{\electronvolt} (\ch{WS2}), a critical feature for tailoring optoelectronic devices. Electronic structure analysis reveals the systematic evolution of the orbital contributions of transition metal $d$ and sulfur $p$ at the edges of the band with composition. Consequently, the optical spectra, evaluated up to \SI{8}{\electronvolt}, show a progressive blueshift in the main features of the interband transition with increasing \ch{W} content, accompanied by predictable changes in key optical constants. Our comprehensive results validate the monolayer \ch{Mo_{1-x} W_xS2} as an electronically versatile platform that offers fine control over electronic and optical properties via alloying, making these tunable direct-gap semiconductors highly promising for next-generation photodetectors, light emitters, and potentially flexible optoelectronic applications exploiting their 2D nature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show that under general resonance the classical piecewise linear Fermi-Ulam accelerator behaves substantially different from its quantization in the sense that the classical accelerator exhibits typical recurrence and non-escaping while the quantum version enjoys quadratic energy growth in general. We also describe a procedure to locate the escaping orbits, though exceptionally rare in the infinite-volume phase space, for the classical accelerators, which in particular include Ulam's very original proposal and the linearly escaping orbits therein in the existing literature, and hence provide a complete (modulo a null set) answer to Ulam's original question. For the quantum accelerators, we reveal under resonance the direct and explicit connection between the energy growth and the shape of the quasi-energy spectra.</description>

      <title>Quantum Circuit Encodings of Polynomial Chaos Expansions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the expressive power of quantum circuits in approximating high-dimensional, real-valued functions. We focus on countably-parametric holomorphic maps $u:U\to \mathbb{R}$, where the parameter domain is $U=[-1,1]^{\mathbb{N}}$. We establish dimension-independent quantum circuit approximation rates via the best $n$-term truncations of generalized polynomial chaos (gPC) expansions of these parametric maps, demonstrating that these rates depend solely on the summability exponent of the gPC expansion coefficients. The key to our findings is based on the fact that so-called ``$(\bsb,\epsilon)$-holomorphic'' functions, where $\bsb\in (0,1]^\mathbb N \cap \ell^p(\mathbb N)$ for some $p\in(0,1)$, permit structured and sparse gPC expansions. Then, $n$-term truncated gPC expansions are known to admit approximation rates of order $ n^{-1/p + 1/2}$ in the $L^2$ norm and of order $ n^{-1/p + 1}$ in the $L^\infty$ norm. We show the existence of parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) encodings of these $n$-term truncated gPC expansions, and bound PQC depth and width via (i) tensorization of univariate PQCs that encode \Tsch-polynomials in $[-1,1]$ and (ii) linear combination of unitaries (LCU) to build PQC emulations of $n$-term truncated gPC expansions. The results provide a rigorous mathematical foundation for the use of quantum algorithms in high-dimensional function approximation. As countably-parametric holomorphic maps naturally arise in parametric PDE models and uncertainty quantification (UQ), our results have implications for quantum-enhanced algorithms for a wide range of maps in applications.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01831v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The K + KRb $\longrightarrow$ Rb + K$_{2}$ chemical reaction is the first ultracold atom-diatom chemical reaction for which experimental results have been reported for temperatures below 1 $\mu$K more than a decade ago. The reaction occurs through coupling with an excited electronic state that is accessible even in the ultracold limit. A previous quantum dynamics study, excluding non-adiabatic effects, has reported a rate coefficient that is about 35\% below the experimental value. Here, we report the first non-adiabatic quantum dynamics study of this reaction and obtain rate coefficients in better agreement with experiments. Our results show that short-range dynamics mediated by coupling with the excited electronic state introduces quantum interference effects that influence both the state-to-state rate coefficients and the overall reaction rates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Achieving quantum-limited motional control of optically trapped particles beyond the sub-micrometer scale is an outstanding problem in levitated optomechanics. A key obstacle is solving the light scattering problem and identifying particle geometries that allow stable trapping and efficient motional detection of their center of mass and rotational motion in three dimensions. Here, we present a computational framework that combines an efficient electromagnetic scattering solver with the adjoint method to inversely design printable microparticles tailored for levitated optomechanics. Our method allows identifying optimized geometries, characterized by enhanced optical trapping and detection efficiencies compared to conventional microspheres. This improves the feasibility of quantum-limited motional control of all translational and rotational degrees of freedom in a standard standing-wave optical trap.</description>

Abstract: The Vlasov-Poisson equations, fundamental in plasma physics and astrophysical applications, are rendered linear, finite-dimensional, and discrete by second quantization. Conditions for correspondence between the pre-quantized and quantized equations are derived, and numerical simulations demonstrating the quantized linear system can capture nonlinear dynamics are presented. Finally, encouraging scaling relations emphasizing the prospect of using quantum computers to efficiently integrate the second quantized Vlasov-Poisson equations as a model for the usual Vlasov-Poisson equations are derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic flux trapping is a significant hurdle limiting reliability and scalability of superconducting electronics, yet tools for imaging flux vortices remain slow or insensitive. We present a cryogenic widefield NV-diamond magnetic microscope capable of rapid, micron-scale imaging of flux trapping in superconducting devices. Using this technique, we measure vortex expulsion fields in Nb thin films and patterned strips, revealing a crossover in expulsion behavior between $10$ and $20~\mu$m strip widths. The observed scaling agrees with theoretical models and suggests the influence of film defects on vortex expulsion dynamics. This instrument enables high-throughput magnetic characterization of superconducting materials and circuits, providing new insight for flux mitigation strategies in scalable superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode NOON states generation with ultracold atoms via geodesic counterdiabatic driving</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a protocol for the generation of NOON states with ultracold atoms, leveraging the Bose-Hubbard model in the self-trapping regime. By the means of an optimized adiabatic protocol, we achieve a significant reduction in the time required for the preparation of highly entangled NOON states, involving two or more modes. Our method saturates the quantum speed limit, ensuring both efficiency and high fidelity in state preparation. A detailed analysis of the geodesic counterdiabatic driving protocol and its application to the Bose-Hubbard system highlights its ability to expand the energy gap, facilitating faster adiabatic evolution. Through perturbation theory, we derive effective parameters that emulate the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, enabling experimentally viable implementations with constant physical parameters. This approach is demonstrated to yield exponential time savings compared to standard geodesic driving, making it a powerful tool for creating complex entangled states for applications in quantum metrology and quantum information. Our findings pave the way for scalable and precise quantum state control in ultracold atomic systems.</description>

Abstract: We show that a large central charge conformal field theory with $W_3$ symmetry exhibits violation of the conjectured operator growth bound if the Liouvillian is modified to incorporate $W_3$ generators. We get 23 classes of Lanczos coefficients, obtained by the action of the Liouvillian on a descendant state. Among these, 10 classes of Lanczos coefficients violate the conjectured upper bound by exhibiting a faster than linear growth with descendant level $N$. Two classes of them have asymptotic growth saturating at $N^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2206.08074v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum coherence and quantum entanglement are two different manifestations of the superposition principle. In this article we show that the right choice of basis to be used to estimate coherence is the separable basis. The quantum coherence estimated using the Bell basis does not represent the coherence in the system, since there is a coherence in the system due to the choice of the basis states. We first compute the entanglement and quantum coherence in the two qubit mixed states prepared using the Bell states and one of the states from the computational basis. The quantum coherence is estimated using the l1-norm of coherence, the entanglement is measured using the concurrence and the mixedness is measured using the linear entropy. Then we estimate these quantities in the Bell basis and establish that coherence should be measured only in separable basis, whereas entanglement and mixedness can be measured in any basis. We then calculate the teleportation fidelity of these mixed states and find the regions where the states have a fidelity greater than the classical teleportation fidelity. We also examine the violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality to verify the quantum nonlocal correlations in the system. The estimation of the above mentioned quantum correlations, teleportation fidelity and the verification of Bell-CHSH inequality is also done for bipartite states obtained from the tripartite systems by the tracing out of one of their qubits. We find that for some of these states teleportation is possible even when the Bell-CHSH inequality is not violated, signifying that nonlocality is not a necessary condition for quantum teleportation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08572v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe a tensor network simulation of a neutral atom quantum system under the presence of noise, while introducing a new purity-preserving truncation technique that compromises between the simplicity of the matrix product state and the positivity of the matrix product density operator. We apply this simulation to a near-optimized iteration of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm on a transverse field Ising model in order to investigate the influence of large system sizes on the performance of the algorithm. We find that while circuits with a large number of qubits fail more often under noise that depletes the qubit population, their outputs on a successful measurement are just as robust under Rydberg atom dissipation or qubit dephasing as smaller systems. However, such circuits might not perform as well under coherent multi-qubit errors such as Rydberg atom crosstalk. We also find that the optimized parameters are especially robust to noise, suggesting that a noisier quantum system can be used to find the optimal parameters before switching to a cleaner system for measurements of observables.</description>

      <title>Nearest neighbor synthesis of CNOT circuits on general quantum architectures</title>

Abstract: NISQ devices have inherent limitations in terms of connectivity and hardware noise. The synthesis of CNOT circuits considers the physical constraints and transforms quantum algorithms into low-level quantum circuits that can execute on physical chips correctly. In the current trend, quantum chip architectures without Hamiltonian paths are gradually replacing architectures with Hamiltonian paths due to their scalability and low-noise characteristics. To this end, this paper addresses the nearest neighbor synthesis of CNOT circuits in the architectures with and without Hamiltonian paths, aiming to enhance the fidelity of the circuits after execution. Firstly, a key-qubit priority mapping model for general quantum architectures is proposed. Secondly, the initial mapping is further improved by using tabu search to reduce the number of CNOT gates after circuit synthesis and enhance its fidelity. Finally, the noise-aware CNOT circuit nearest neighbor synthesis algorithm for the general architecture is proposed based on the key-qubit priority mapping model. The algorithm is demonstrated on several popular cloud quantum computing platforms and simulators, showing that it effectively optimizes the fidelity of CNOT circuits compared with mainstream methods. Moreover, the method can be extended to more general circuits, thereby improving the overall performance of quantum computing on NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Single Qubit Multi-Party Transmission Using Universal Symmetric Quantum Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04920v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the hypothetical quantum network case where Alice wishes to transmit one qubit of information (specifically a pure quantum state) to $M$ parties, where $M$ is some large number. The remote receivers locally perform single qubit quantum state tomography on the transmitted qubits in order to compute the quantum state within some error rate (dependent on the tomography technique and the number of transmitted qubits). We show that with the use of an intermediate optimal symmetric universal quantum cloning machine (between Alice and the remote receivers) as a repeater-type node in a hypothetical quantum network, Alice can send significantly fewer qubits compared to direct transmission of the message qubits to each of the $M$ remote receivers. This is possible due to two properties of quantum cloning. The first being that single qubit quantum clones retain the same Bloch angle as the initial quantum state. This means that if the mixed state of the quantum clone can be computed to high enough accuracy, the original pure quantum state can be inferred by extrapolating that vector to the surface of the Bloch sphere. The second property is that the state overlap of approximate quantum clones, with respect to the original pure quantum state, quickly converges (specifically for $1 \rightarrow M$ the limit of the fidelity as M goes to infinity is $\frac{2}{3}$). This means that Alice can prepare a constant number of qubits (which are then passed through the quantum cloning machine) in order to achieve a desired error rate, if $M$ is large enough. Combined, these two properties mean that for large $M$, Alice can prepare many orders of magnitude fewer qubits in order to achieve the same single qubit transmission accuracy compared to the naive direct qubit transmission approach.</description>

      <title>Optimal compilation of parametrised quantum circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.12877v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Parametrised quantum circuits contain phase gates whose phase is determined by a classical algorithm prior to running the circuit on a quantum device. Such circuits are used in variational algorithms like QAOA and VQE. In order for these algorithms to be as efficient as possible it is important that we use the fewest number of parameters. We show that, while the general problem of minimising the number of parameters is NP-hard, when we restrict to circuits that are Clifford apart from parametrised phase gates and where each parameter is used just once, we *can* efficiently find the optimal parameter count. We show that when parameter transformations are required to be sufficiently well-behaved, the only rewrites that reduce parameters correspond to simple 'fusions'. Using this we find that a previous circuit optimisation strategy by some of the authors [Kissinger, van de Wetering. PRA (2019)] finds the optimal number of parameters. Our proof uses the ZX-calculus. We also prove that the standard rewrite rules of the ZX-calculus suffice to prove any equality between parametrised Clifford circuits.</description>

      <title>Non-maximally entangled mixed states of X and non-X types as teleportation channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12824v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Mixed spin-1/2 states violating Bell-CHSH inequality is useful for teleportation. There exist states which do not violate Bell-inequality but is still useful as teleportation channels. Maximally entangled mixed states of Munro class and Ishizaka-Hiroshima class are such types which although satisfy Bell-CHSH inequality, yet can perform better as teleportation channels for a given degree of mixedness\cite{adhikari2010}. In this work we construct class of mixed states of non-maximally entangled types whose efficacy as teleportation channels have been studied. For certain range of state parameters, these non-maximally entangled mixed states performs better as quantum teleportation channels than certain maximally entangled mixed states (such as Werner state). These constructed states, though entangled, satisfy Bell-CHSH inequality implying further that violation of local inequalities may not be good indicators of their ability to complete quantum processing tasks such as teleportation.</description>

      <title>Accurate heat currents via reorganised master equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate characterisation of energy exchanges between nanoscale quantum systems and their environments is of paramount importance for quantum technologies, and central to quantum thermodynamics. Here, we show that, in order to accurately approximate steady-state heat currents via perturbative master equations, the coupling-induced reorganisation correction to the system's energy must be carefully taken into account. Not doing so, may yield sizeable errors, especially at low, or even moderate temperatures. In particular, we show how a 'reorganised master equation' can produce very accurate estimates for the heat currents when the reorganisation energy is weak and one works with environments with a broad spectrum. Notably, such master equation outperforms its 'non-reorganised' counterpart in the calculation of heat currents, at modelling dynamics, and at correctly capturing equilibration. This is so even if both types of equation are derived to the same order of perturbation theory. Most importantly, working with reorganised master equations does not involve additional complications when compared with alternative approaches. Also, invoking the secular approximation to secure thermodynamic consistency does not compromise their precision.</description>

      <title>Guided-SPSA: Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation assisted by the Parameter Shift Rule</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of variational quantum algorithms (VQCs) has received significant attention from the quantum computing community in recent years. These hybrid algorithms, utilizing both classical and quantum components, are well-suited for noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Though estimating exact gradients using the parameter-shift rule to optimize the VQCs is realizable in NISQ devices, they do not scale well for larger problem sizes. The computational complexity, in terms of the number of circuit evaluations required for gradient estimation by the parameter-shift rule, scales linearly with the number of parameters in VQCs. On the other hand, techniques that approximate the gradients of the VQCs, such as the simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA), do not scale with the number of parameters but struggle with instability and often attain suboptimal solutions. In this work, we introduce a novel gradient estimation approach called Guided-SPSA, which meaningfully combines the parameter-shift rule and SPSA-based gradient approximation. The Guided-SPSA results in a 15% to 25% reduction in the number of circuit evaluations required during training for a similar or better optimality of the solution found compared to the parameter-shift rule. The Guided-SPSA outperforms standard SPSA in all scenarios and outperforms the parameter-shift rule in scenarios such as suboptimal initialization of the parameters. We demonstrate numerically the performance of Guided-SPSA on different paradigms of quantum machine learning, such as regression, classification, and reinforcement learning.</description>

Abstract: Tomographic reconstruction of quantum states plays a fundamental role in benchmarking quantum systems and accessing information encoded in quantum-mechanical systems. Among the informationally complete sets of quantum measurements, the tight ones provide a linear reconstruction formula and minimize the propagation of statistical errors. However, implementing tight measurements in the lab is challenging due to the high number of required measurement projections, involving a series of experimental setup preparations. In this work, we introduce the notion of cyclic tight measurements, which allow us to perform full quantum state tomography while considering only repeated application of a single unitary-based quantum device during the measurement stage. This type of measurement significantly simplifies the complexity of the experimental setup required to retrieve the quantum state of a physical system. Additionally, we design a feasible setup preparation procedure that produces well-approximated cyclic tight measurements in every finite dimension.</description>

      <title>Prospects for NMR Spectral Prediction on Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.09340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advanced atomic magnetometers have made it possible to acquire nuclear magnetic resonance spectra in zero to ultralow magnetic fields. This regime carries the benefit of compact, low-cost instrumentation with reduced spin relaxation effects and the ability to probe phenomena that are inaccessible in conventional high-field experiments. A tradeoff is that the resulting spectra must be interpreted using simulations that are taxing for classical computation. Working by example for small-molecule and protein spectroscopy, we demonstrate that these simulations are a promising target for fault-tolerant quantum computation. Our holistic analysis spans from input selection to the construction of explicit circuits for qubitized quantum dynamics. By maintaining parity with experimental requirements, we demonstrate how certain cases might be especially promising for early fault-tolerant architectures.</description>

Abstract: In the current era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology, quantum devices present new avenues for addressing complex, real-world challenges including potentially NP-hard optimization problems. This work aims to showcase how the inherent noise in NISQ devices can be leveraged to solve such real-world problems effectively. Utilizing a D-Wave quantum annealer and IonQ's gate-based NISQ computers, we generate and analyze solutions for managing train traffic under stochastic disturbances. Our case study focuses on the Baltimore Light RailLink, which embodies the characteristics of both tramway and railway networks. We explore the feasibility of using NISQ technology to model the stochastic nature of disruptions in these transportation systems. Our research marks the inaugural application of both quantum computing paradigms to tramway and railway rescheduling, highlighting the potential of quantum noise as a beneficial resource in complex optimization scenarios.</description>

      <title>Teleportation of unknown qubit via Star type tripartite states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11519v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eylee Jung \textit{et.al}\cite{jung2008} had conjectured that $P_{max}=\frac{1}{2}$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the perfect two-party teleportation and consequently the Groverian measure of entanglement for the entanglement resource must be $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. It is also known that prototype $W$ state is not useful for standard teleportation. Agrawal and Pati\cite{pati2006} have successfully executed perfect (standard) teleportation with non-prototype $W$ state. Aligned with Pati's protocol\cite{pati2006} we have considered here $Star$ type tripartite states and have shown that perfect teleportation is suitable with such states. Moreover, we have taken the linear superposition of non-prototype $W$ state and its spin-flipped version and shown that it belongs to $Star$ class. Also, standard teleportation is possible with these states. It is observed that genuine tripartite entanglement is not necessary requirement for a state to be used as a channel for successful standard teleportation. We have also shown that these $Star$ class states are $P_{max}=\frac{1}{4}$ states and their Groverian entanglement is $\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}$, thus concluding that Jung conjecture is not a necessary condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.17819v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interactions of molecules with their environment influence the course and outcome of almost all chemical reactions. However, classical computers struggle to accurately simulate complicated molecule-environment interactions because of the steep growth of computational resources with both molecule size and environment complexity. Therefore, many quantum-chemical simulations are restricted to isolated molecules, whose dynamics can dramatically differ from what happens in an environment. Here, we show that analog quantum simulators can simulate open molecular systems by using the native dissipation of the simulator and injecting additional controllable dissipation. By exploiting the native dissipation to simulate the molecular dissipation -- rather than seeing it as a limitation -- our approach enables longer simulations of open systems than are possible for closed systems. In particular, we show that trapped-ion simulators using a mixed qudit-boson (MQB) encoding could simulate molecules in a wide range of condensed phases by implementing widely used dissipative processes within the Lindblad formalism, including pure dephasing and both electronic and vibrational relaxation. The MQB open-system simulations require significantly fewer additional quantum resources compared to both classical and digital quantum approaches.</description>

      <title>Cross-resonance control of an oscillator with an auxiliary fluxonium qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18351v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conditional displacement (CD) gate between an oscillator and a discrete-variable auxiliary qubit plays a key role in quantum information processing tasks, such as enabling universal control of the oscillator and longitudinal readout of the qubit. However, the gate is unprotected against the propagation of auxiliary qubit decay errors and hence not fault-tolerant. Here, we propose a CD gate scheme with fluxonium as the auxiliary qubit, which has been experimentally demonstrated to have a large noise bias and millisecond-level lifetimes. The proposed gate is applied cross-resonantly by modulating the external flux of the fluxonium at the frequency of the target oscillator, which requires minimal hardware overhead and does not increase sensitivity to decoherence mechanisms like dephasing. We further provide a perturbative description of the gate mechanism and identify the error budget. Additionally, we develop an approximate procedure for choosing device and gate parameters that optimizes gate performance. Following the procedure for multiple sets of fluxonium parameters from the literature, we numerically demonstrate CD gates with unitary fidelity exceeding 99.9% and gate times of hundreds of nanoseconds.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we present a new model of the Discrete-Time Open Quantum Walk (DTOQW) applicable to an arbitrary graph, thereby going beyond the case of quantum walks on regular graphs. We study the impact of noise in the dynamics of quantum walk by applying Kraus operators of different dimensions which are constructed using the Weyl operators. The DTOQW employs these Kraus operators as its coin operators. The walker dynamics are studied under the impact of non-Markovian amplitude damping, dephasing and depolarizing noise channels. We also implement the walk on various graphs, including path graphs, cycle graphs, star graphs, complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, etc. We gauge the dynamics by computing coherence and fidelity at different time steps, taking into account the influence of noise. Furthermore, we compute the probability distribution at different time steps for the above noises, which represents the availability of the quantum walker at different vertices of the graph.</description>

Abstract: Logical qubits can be protected against environmental noise by encoding them into a highly entangled state of many physical qubits and actively intervening in the dynamics with stabilizer measurements. In this work, we numerically optimize the rate of these interventions: the number of stabilizer measurement rounds for a logical qubit encoded in a surface code patch and idling for a given time. We model the environmental noise on the circuit level, including gate errors, readout errors, amplitude and phase damping. We find, qualitatively, that the optimal number of stabilizer measurement rounds is getting smaller for better qubits and getting larger for better gates or larger code sizes. We discuss the implications of our results to some of the leading architectures, superconducting qubits, and neutral atoms.</description>

Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics that separate the quantum realm from the classical one. Characterization of entanglement as a physical resource for quantum technology became of uppermost importance. While the entanglement of bipartite systems is already well understood, the ultimate goal to cope with the properties of entanglement of multipartite systems is still far from being realized. This dissertation covers characterization of multipartite entanglement using algebraic-geometric tools. Firstly, we establish an algorithm to classify multipartite entanglement by $k$-secant varieties of the Segre variety and $\ell$-multilinear ranks that are invariant under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). We present a fine-structure classification of multiqubit and tripartite entanglement based on this algorithm. Another fundamental problem in quantum information theory is entanglement transformation that is quite challenging regarding to multipartite systems. It is captivating that the proposed entanglement classification by algebraic geometry can be considered as a reference to study SLOCC and asymptotic SLOCC interconversions among different resources based on tensor rank and border rank, respectively. In this regard, we also introduce a new class of tensors that we call \emph{persistent tensors} and construct a lower bound for their tensor rank. We further cover SLOCC convertibility of multipartite systems considering several families of persistent tensors.</description>

      <title>Directed st-connectivity with few paths is in quantum logspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12473v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a $\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\log n))$-procedure to count $st$-paths on directed graphs for which we are promised that there are at most polynomially many paths starting in $s$ and polynomially many paths ending in $t$. For comparison, the best known classical upper bound in this case just to decide $st$-connectivity is $\mathsf{DSPACE}(O(\log^2 n/ \log \log n))$. The result establishes a new relationship between~$\mathsf{BQL}$ and unambiguity and fewness subclasses of $\mathsf{NL}$. Further, we also show how to \emph{recognize} directed graphs with at most polynomially many paths between any two nodes in $\mathsf{BQSPACE}(O(\log n))$. This yields the first natural candidate for a language separating $\mathsf{BQL}$ from $\mathsf{L}$ and~$\mathsf{BPL}$. Until now, all candidates potentially separating these classes were inherently promise problems.</description>

      <title>Single nuclear spin detection and control in a van der Waals material</title>

Abstract: Optically active spin defects in solids are leading candidates for quantum sensing and quantum networking. Recently, single spin defects were discovered in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), a layered van der Waals (vdW) material. Due to its two-dimensional structure, hBN allows spin defects to be positioned closer to target samples than in three-dimensional crystals, making it ideal for atomic-scale quantum sensing, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of single molecules. However, the chemical structures of these defects remain unknown, and detecting a single nuclear spin with an hBN spin defect has been elusive. In this study, we created single spin defects in hBN using $^{13}$C ion implantation and identified three distinct defect types based on hyperfine interactions. We observed both S=1 and S=1/2 spin states within a single hBN spin defect. We demonstrated atomic-scale NMR and coherent control of individual nuclear spins in a vdW material, with a $\pi$-gate fidelity up to 99.75% at room temperature. By comparing experimental results with density-functional theory calculations, we propose chemical structures for these spin defects. Our work advances the understanding of single spin defects in hBN and provides a pathway to enhance quantum sensing using hBN spin defects with nuclear spins as quantum memories.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In non-relativistic physics, the concepts of geometry and topology are usually applied to characterize spatial structures or structures in momentum space. We introduce the concept of temporal geometry, which encompasses the geometric and topological properties of temporal shapes, i.e. trajectories traced by the tip of a time-dependent vector in vector space. We apply it to vectors describing ultrafast electron currents or induced polarization in chiral molecules. The central concepts of temporal geometry - Berry curvature and Berry connection - emerge as ubiquitous features of photoexcited, non-equilibrium, chiral electron dynamics. We demonstrate that the Berry curvature and Berry connection (i) rely on the polarization properties of light pulses, (ii) can be introduced for multiphoton processes, and (iii) control enantio-sensitive geometric observables via non-equilibrium electronic dynamics excited by tailored laser fields. Our findings may open a way to ultrafast, topologically non-trivial, and enantio-sensitive chemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Demonstration of Scully-Dr\"uhl-type quantum erasers on quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08053v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel quantum circuit that genuinely implements the Scully-Dr\"uhl-type delayed-choice quantum eraser, where the two recorders of the which-way information directly interact with the signal qubit and remain spatially separated. Experiments conducted on IBM Quantum and IonQ processors demonstrate that the recovery of interference patterns, to varying degrees, aligns closely with theoretical predictions, despite the presence of systematic errors. This quantum circuit-based approach, more manageable and versatile than traditional optical experiments, facilitates arbitrary adjustment of the erasure and enables a true random choice in a genuine delayed-choice manner. On the IBM Quantum platform, delay gates can be employed to further defer the random choice, thereby amplifying the retrocausal effect. Since gate operations are executed sequentially in time, the system does not have any involvement of random choice until after the signal qubit has been measured, therefore eliminating any potential philosophical loopholes regarding retrocausality that might exist in other experimental setups. Remarkably, quantum erasure is achieved with delay times up to $\sim1\,\mu\text{s}$ without noticeable decoherence, a feat challenging to replicate in optical setups.</description>

      <title>TE-PAI: Exact Time Evolution by Sampling Random Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16850v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulating time evolution under quantum Hamiltonians is one of the most natural applications of quantum computers. We introduce TE-PAI, which simulates time evolution exactly by sampling random quantum circuits for the purpose of estimating observable expectation values at the cost of an increased circuit repetition. The approach builds on the Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI) technique and we prove that it simulates time evolution without discretisation or algorithmic error while achieving shallow circuit depths with optimal scaling that saturates the Lieb-Robinson bound. Another significant advantage of TE-PAI is that it only requires executing random circuits that consist of Pauli rotation gates of only two kinds of rotation angles $\pm\Delta$ and $\pi$, along with measurements. While TE-PAI is highly beneficial for NISQ devices, we additionally develop an optimised early fault-tolerant implementation using catalyst circuits and repeat-until-success teleportation, concluding that the approach requires orders of magnitude fewer T-states than conventional techniques, such as Trotterization -- we estimate $3 \times 10^{5}$ T states are sufficient for the fault-tolerant simulation of a $100$-qubit Heisenberg spin Hamiltonian. Furthermore, TE-PAI allows for a highly configurable trade-off between circuit depth and measurement overhead by adjusting the rotation angle $\Delta$ arbitrarily. We expect that the approach will be a major enabler in the late NISQ and early fault-tolerant periods as it can compensate circuit-depth and qubit-number limitations through an increased circuit repetition.</description>

Abstract: We formulate a precise tradeoff relation between correlation and disturbance for sequential $n$-outcome quantum measurements in Hilbert spaces of arbitrary dimension. This relation highlights key symmetry properties useful for robust estimation and characterization of the measurement parameters against unitary noise, or in scenarios where shared reference frames are unavailable. In addition, we report on the experimental implementation of the proposal for the qubit case, more precisely in a neutron optical experiment, which is particularly valuable for calibrating and optimizing measurement devices, as confirmed by the theoretical results. Finally, we exploit the optimal tradeoff relation for direct estimation of the characteristic noise of single-photon detectors, dark counts, and the finite detection efficiency.</description>

      <title>Reducing Circuit Depth in Quantum State Preparation for Quantum Simulation Using Measurements and Feedforward</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reducing circuit depth and identifying an optimal trade-off between circuit depth and width is crucial for successful quantum computation. In this context, midcircuit measurement and feedforward have been shown to significantly reduce the depth of quantum circuits, particularly in implementing logical gates. By leveraging these techniques, we propose several parallelization strategies that reduce quantum circuit depth at the expense of increasing width in preparing various quantum states relevant to quantum simulation. With measurements and feedforward, we demonstrate that utilizing unary encoding as a bridge between two quantum states substantially reduces the circuit depth required for preparing quantum states, such as sparse quantum states and sums of Slater determinants within the first quantization framework, while maintaining an efficient circuit width. Additionally, we show that a Bethe wave function, characterized by its high degree of freedom in its phase, can be probabilistically prepared in a constant-depth quantum circuit using measurements and feedforward. We anticipate that our study will contribute to the reduction of circuit depth in initial state preparation, particularly for quantum simulation, which is a critical step toward achieving quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Are Hilbert Spaces Unphysical? Hardly, My Dear!</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the states of any quantum system are vectors in a Hilbert space. Not everyone agrees, however. The recent paper ``The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Carcassi, Calder\'on and Aidala is a thoughtful dissection of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics that seeks to pinpoint supposedly unsurmountable difficulties inherent in postulating that the physical states are elements of a Hilbert space. Its pivotal charge against Hilbert spaces is that by a change of variables, which is a change-of-basis unitary transformation, one ``can map states with finite expectation values to those with infinite ones''. In the present work it is shown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the error is spotted. In consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes ``the expectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time" is also faulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces ``turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity'' is unsubstantiated. Two other objections to Hilbert spaces on physical grounds, both technically correct, are the isomorphism of separable Hilbert spaces and the unavoidable existence of infinite-expectation-value states. The former turns out to be quite irrrelevant but the latter remains an issue without a fully satisfactory solution, although the evidence so far is that it is physically innocuous. All in all, while the authors' thesis that Hilbert spaces must be given up deserves some attention, it is a long way from being persuasive as it is founded chiefly on a misconception and, subsidiarily, on immaterial or flimsy arguments.</description>

      <title>Integrated Information in Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a quantum integrated-information measure $\Phi$ for multipartite states within the Relational Quantum Dynamics (RQD) framework. $\Phi(\rho)$ is defined as the minimum quantum Jensen-Shannon distance between an n-partite density operator $\rho$ and any product state over a bipartition of its subsystems. We prove that its square-root induces a genuine metric on state space and that $\Phi$ is monotonic under all completely positive trace-preserving maps. Restricting the search to bipartitions yields a unique optimal split and a unique closest product state. From this geometric picture we derive a canonical entanglement witness directly tied to $\Phi$ and construct an integration dendrogram that reveals the full hierarchical correlation structure of $\rho$. We further show that there always exists an "optimal observer"-a channel or basis-that preserves $\Phi$ better than any alternative. Finally, we propose a quantum Markov blanket theorem: the boundary of the optimal bipartition isolates subsystems most effectively. Our framework unites categorical enrichment, convex-geometric methods, and operational tools, forging a concrete bridge between integrated information theory and quantum information science.</description>

      <title>The iSWAP gate with polar molecules: Robustness criteria for entangling operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.21238v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultracold polar molecules in optical lattices or tweezer arrays offer a promising platform for quantum information processing and simulation, thanks to their rich internal structure and long-range dipolar interactions. Recent experimental advances now allow precise control over individual molecules, enabling two-qubit gates based on the iSWAP gate. A key challenge is however the sensitivity to variations of the dipole-dipole interaction strength - stemming from motion of the molecules and uncertainty on the precise positioning of external confining potentials - that limits current gate fidelities. To address this, we develop a quantum optimal control framework, based on a perturbative approach, to design gates that are robust with respect to quasi-static deviations of Hamiltonian parameters, and provide criteria to evaluate a priori whether a gate can be made robust for a given control Hamiltonian. By applying these criteria to exchange-coupled qubits, as polar molecules, we demonstrate that robustness cannot be achieved with global controls only, but can be attained by breaking the exchange symmetry through local controls, such as a local detuning. We determine the robust time-optimal solution for realizing an iSWAP gate, show that the control pulses can be designed to be smooth functions, and achieve theoretical gate fidelities compatible with error correction under realistic parameters. Additionally, we show that certain entangled state preparations, such as Bell states, can be made robust even with global controls only. We demonstrate that, under the adiabatic approximation - where molecular motion occurs on timescales faster than that of the exchange interaction - the noise arising from thermal motion can be effectively treated as quasi-static variations of Hamiltonian parameters. This allows us to extend our treatment to the concrete experimental case of polar molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) protects quantum systems against inevitable noises and control inaccuracies, providing a pathway towards fault-tolerant (FT) quantum computation. However, the significant overhead of physical qubits required to encode a single logical qubit poses a major challenge for scalability and practical implementation. Floquet QEC codes, a recent innovation, mitigate this challenge by utilizing time-periodic measurements to introduce additional dynamical logical qubits, thereby enhancing resource efficiency in QEC. Here, we experimentally implement the Floquet-Bacon-Shor code on a superconducting quantum processor. We encode a dynamical logical qubit within a $3\times 3$ lattice of data qubits, alongside a conventional static logical qubit. We demonstrate FT encoding and measurement of the two-qubit logical states and stabilize the states using repeated error detection cycles. Additionally, we showcase universal single-qubit logical gates on the dynamical qubit. By implementing a logical CNOT gate, we entangle the dynamical and static logical qubits, generating an error-detected logical Bell state with a fidelity of 75.9\%. Our results highlight the potential of Floquet codes for scalable and resource-efficient FT quantum computation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodically driven quantum systems exhibit many fascinating phenomena absent in equilibrium systems, but their simulation is more challenging than that of static systems. Consequently, quantum simulation of these systems offers greater opportunity for achieving quantum advantage. To build the foundation for simulating time-periodic Hamiltonians, we utilize the Floquet-Hilbert space formalism to transform the Hamiltonian into a time-independent form and provide its Pauli decomposition. We propose a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm, Floquet-ADAPT-VQE, to simulate the non- equilibrium physics of periodically driven quantum systems. We define a cost function based on the square of the shifted extended Floquet Hamiltonian and show how to prepare Floquet states using Floquet-ADAPT-VQE. We also obtain a suitable auxiliary initial state whose squared Floquet energy is independent of the number of auxiliary qubits as well as the driving frequency, which leads to better convergence with fewer ADAPT iterations. Additionally, we provide a framework to calculate the time-dependent expectation value of observables in the Floquet state with fixed-depth quantum circuit. We demonstrate our algorithm by performing numerical simulations on a periodically driven XYZ model with a magnetic field. We also explore potential applications of our algorithm for studying various non-equilibrium phenomena in periodically driven systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate an Otto thermodynamic cycle with a qubit Unruh-DeWitt detector as the working medium, coupled to a massless, conformally coupled scalar quantum field in the Hartle-Hawking vacuum in a (2+1)-dimensional BTZ black hole spacetime. We employ the thermal properties of the field to model heat and cold reservoirs between which the thermal machine operates. Treating the detector as an open quantum system, we employ a master equation to study its finite-time dynamics during each cycle stroke. We evaluate the output performance of the Otto heat engine and refrigerator by computing, respectively, the total work output and the cooling power for each of the Neumann, transparent, and Dirichlet boundary condition cases satisfied by the field at spatial infinity. Furthermore, we evaluate the optimal performance of the thermal machine by analyzing its efficiency at maximum power output and ecological impact. Our study presents a general framework for understanding the finite-time operation of relativistic quantum thermal machines, focusing on their energy optimization.</description>

      <title>Identifying Materials-Level Sources of Performance Variation in Superconducting Transmon Qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Superconducting Materials and Systems (SQMS) Center, a DOE National Quantum Information Science Research Center, has conducted a comprehensive and coordinated study using superconducting transmon qubit chips with known performance metrics to identify the underlying materials-level sources of device-to-device performance variation. Following qubit coherence measurements, these qubits of varying base superconducting metals and substrates have been examined with various nondestructive and invasive material characterization techniques at Northwestern University, Ames National Laboratory, and Fermilab as part of a blind study. We find trends in variations of the depth of the etched substrate trench, the thickness of the surface oxide, and the geometry of the sidewall, which when combined, lead to correlations with the T$_1$ lifetime across different devices. In addition, we provide a list of features that varied from device to device, for which the impact on performance requires further studies. Finally, we identify two low-temperature characterization techniques that may potentially serve as proxy tools for qubit measurements. These insights provide materials-oriented solutions to not only reduce performance variations across neighboring devices, but also to engineer and fabricate devices with optimal geometries to achieve performance metrics beyond the state-of-the-art values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24247v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Teleportation, a novel scheme, initially posited by Bennett \textit{et.al}, has been studied here in the context of sending a single qutrit from Alice to Bob using two qutrit entangled channels as resources. In this paper we have considered two special two qutrit entangled states, which belong to $SU(3)$ group, as useful resources for teleportation. For the successful teleportation, these entangled states have been chosen as quantum channels shared between Alice and Bob. Another entangled basis of two qutrit states have been used as auxiliary states, which would help Alice to manipulate with her channel so that the single qutrit she holds can be successfully teleported to Bob. Bob's choices of measurement operators influence the retrieval of Alice's single qutrit.</description>

      <title>Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention for Quantum Transformer Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Transformer models have revolutionized sequential learning across various domains, yet their self-attention mechanism incurs quadratic computational cost, posing limitations for real-time and resource-constrained tasks. To address this, we propose Quantum Adaptive Self-Attention (QASA), a novel hybrid architecture that enhances classical Transformer models with a quantum attention mechanism. QASA replaces dot-product attention with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) that adaptively captures inter-token relationships in the quantum Hilbert space. Additionally, a residual quantum projection module is introduced before the feedforward network to further refine temporal features. Our design retains classical efficiency in earlier layers while injecting quantum expressiveness in the final encoder block, ensuring compatibility with current NISQ hardware. Experiments on synthetic time-series tasks demonstrate that QASA achieves faster convergence and superior generalization compared to both standard Transformers and reduced classical variants. Preliminary complexity analysis suggests potential quantum advantages in gradient computation, opening new avenues for efficient quantum deep learning models.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Enhanced Channel Mixing in RWKV Models for Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural sequence modeling have led to architectures such as RWKV, which combine recurrent-style time mixing with feedforward channel mixing to enable efficient long-context processing. In this work, we propose QuantumRWKV, a hybrid quantum-classical extension of the RWKV model, where the standard feedforward network (FFN) is partially replaced by a variational quantum circuit (VQC). The quantum component is designed to enhance nonlinear representational capacity while preserving end-to-end differentiability via the PennyLane framework. To assess the impact of quantum enhancements, we conduct a comparative evaluation between QuantumRWKV and its classical counterpart across ten synthetic time-series forecasting tasks, encompassing linear (ARMA), chaotic (Logistic Map), oscillatory (Damped Oscillator, Sine Wave), and regime-switching signals. Our results show that QuantumRWKV outperforms the classical model in 6 out of 10 tasks, particularly excelling in sequences with nonlinear or chaotic dynamics, such as Chaotic Logistic, Noisy Damped Oscillator, Sine Wave, Triangle Wave, Sawtooth, and ARMA. However, it underperforms on tasks involving sharp regime shifts (Piecewise Regime) or smoother periodic patterns (Damped Oscillator, Seasonal Trend, Square Wave). This study provides one of the first systematic comparisons between hybrid quantum-classical and classical recurrent models in temporal domains, highlighting the scenarios where quantum circuits can offer tangible advantages. We conclude with a discussion on architectural trade-offs, such as variance sensitivity in quantum layers, and outline future directions for scaling quantum integration in long-context temporal learning systems.</description>

      <title>Strict advantage of complex quantum theory in a communication task</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Standard formulations of quantum theory are based on complex numbers: Quantum states can be in superpositions, with weights given by complex probability amplitudes. Motivated by quantum theory promising a range of practical advantages over classical for a multitude of tasks, we investigate how the presence of complex amplitudes in quantum theory can yield operational advantages over counterpart real formulations. We identify a straightforward communication task for which complex quantum theory exhibits a provably lower communication cost than not just any classical approach, but also any approach based on real quantum theory. We certify the necessity of complex quantum theory for optimal approaches to the task through geometric properties of quantum state ensembles that witness the presence of basis-independent complexity. This substantiates a strict operational advantage of complex quantum theory. We discuss the relevance of this finding for quantum advantages in stochastic simulation.</description>

      <title>Classical-to-quantum transfer of geometric phase for non-interferometric phase measurement and manipulation of quantum state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The geometric phase, originating from the cyclic evolution of a state, such as polarization on the Poincar\'e sphere, is typically measured through interferometric approaches that often include unwanted contributions from the dynamic phase. Here, we present a non-interferometric technique based on quantum correlation of pair photons to measure the geometric phase of a classical beam. The transfer of geometric phase of the classical pump beam arising from the cyclic evolution of its polarization state on the Poincar\'e sphere onto the polarization-entangled pair photons generated via spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a Sagnac interferometer enables easy control over the quantum state. Characterization of the generated quantum states reveals that the geometric phase of the pump beam controls the coincidence counts, entanglement visibility, Bell's parameter, quantum state tomography, and fidelity in close agreement with theoretical predictions. We observe sinusoidal modulation of the Bell's parameter and state fidelity with changes in the geometric phase, resulting in transitions between orthogonal Bell states and Bell-like maximally entangled states. Our results establish the geometric phase of the classical pump as a tunable parameter for quantum state control, offering a compact, passive platform for phase manipulation in quantum photonic systems, enabling geometric phase-based quantum gates, and compensating unwanted phase acquired by the quantum state on propagation.</description>

      <title>Tight qubit uncertainty relations studied through weak values in neutron interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.22221v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In its original formulation, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle describes a trade-off relation between the error of a quantum measurement and the thereby induced disturbance on the measured object. However, this relation is not valid in general. An alternative universally valid relation was derived by Ozawa in 2003, defining error and disturbance in a general concept, experimentally accessible via a tomographic method. Later, it was shown by Hall that these errors correspond to the statistical deviation between a physical property and its estimate. Recently, it was discovered that these errors can be observed experimentally when weak values are determined through a procedure named "feedback compensation". Here, we apply this procedure for the complete experimental characterization of the error-disturbance relation between a which-way observable in an interferometer and another observable associated with the output of the interferometer, confirming the theoretically predicted relation. As expected for pure states, the uncertainty is tightly fulfilled.</description>

      <title>Spin polarized enantio-sensitive multipolar photoelectron currents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests as a forward-backward asymmetry of electron emission in the direction orthogonal to the light polarization plane via one-photon ionization of chiral molecules with circularly polarized light. Multi-polar `PECD' currents, i.e., currents resolved along multiple directions, have also been predicted using two mutually-orthogonal linearly polarized light with carrier frequencies $\omega$ and $2\omega$. These currents arise from the interference between the one- and two-photon transitions. Here, we will show that photoelectron spin detection reveals enantio-sensitive multi-polar currents already in the one-photon regime since the two axes can be marked by the photoelectron momentum and spin-detection axis. Specifically, we consider one-photon ionization of an isotropic ensemble of randomly oriented chiral molecules via circularly polarized light and show that the resulting spin-resolved current has three components whose magnitudes are comparable and can be larger than PECD: (i) a spin-polarization vortex in the plane of light polarization that rotates in opposite directions for opposite enantiomers, (ii) either a spin-sink or source in the plane of light polarization for opposite enantiomers, and (iii) a spin analog of photoelectron vortex dichroism (\href{https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.233201}{Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{129}, 233201, 2022}) wherein the detected photoelectron spin encodes molecular chirality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.19673v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL) problem asks for a directed acyclic graph that maximizes a given score function. For networks with $n$ nodes, the fastest known algorithms run in time $O(2^n n^2)$ in the worst case, with no improvement in the asymptotic bound for two decades. Inspired by recent advances in quantum computing, we ask whether BNSL admits a polynomial quantum speedup, that is, whether the problem can be solved by a quantum algorithm in time $O(c^n)$ for some constant $c$ less than $2$. We answer the question in the affirmative by giving two algorithms achieving $c \le 1.817$ and $c \le 1.982$ assuming the number of potential parent sets is, respectively, subexponential and $O(1.453^n)$. Both algorithms assume the availability of a quantum random access memory. We also prove that one presumably cannot lower the base $2$ for any classical algorithm, as that would refute the strong exponential time hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10330v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Josephson junctions constructed from superconductor-semiconductor-superconductor heterostructures have been used to realize a variety of voltage-tunable superconducting quantum devices, including qubits and parametric amplifiers. To date theoretical descriptions of these systems have been restricted to small quantum fluctuations of the junction phase, making them inapplicable to many experiments. In this work we relax this, employing a path-integral formulation where the phase quantum dynamics is obtained self-consistently from an underlying many-body formalism. Our method recovers previously-known results for small phase fluctuations, and predicts new effects outside of that limit: (i) system capacitances undergo a gate-voltage-dependent renormalization; and (ii) an additional charge offset appears for asymmetric junctions. Our main results can be summarized in terms of a single-particle Hamiltonian, which can be directly compared to that of an ordinary Josephson junction. This more general theory could be a first step towards designing new quantum devices that go qualitatively beyond voltage-tunable variants of previously-known circuits.</description>

      <title>Spectral Multifractality and Emergent Energyscales Across the Many-Body Localisation Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07975v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a scaling theory of the many-body localisation transition in terms of emergent, characteristic energyscales. The analysis is based on the decomposition of the eigenstates in the basis of trivially localised states, resolved in the energies of the latter, which we refer to as the spectral decomposition of the eigenstates. The characteristic energyscales emerge when the multifractal properties, or lack thereof, of the spectral decomposition are studied at different scales. These characteristic scales correspond to the ones, above which the spectral decompositions exhibit their global behaviour, namely full ergodicity in the ergodic phase and multifractality in the many-body localised phase. On the other hand, at scales below the characteristic ones, the decomposition in the ergodic phase shows finer (multi)fractal structures whereas in the localised phase, the decomposition picks out well-separated, localised resonant peaks. The scaling of these characteristic energyscales across the many-body localisation transition admits a scaling theory consistent with a Kosterlitz-Thouless type scenario and bears striking resemblances to that of inverse participation ratios of eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04860v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the first concolic testing framework explicitly designed for quantum programs. The framework introduces quantum constraint generation methods for quantum control statements that quantify quantum states and offers a symbolization method for quantum variables. Based on this framework, we generate path constraints for each concrete execution path of a quantum program. These constraints guide the exploration of new paths, with a quantum constraint solver determining outcomes to create novel input samples, thereby enhancing branch coverage. Our framework has been implemented in Python and integrated with Qiskit for practical evaluation. Experimental results show that our concolic testing framework improves branch coverage, generates high-quality quantum input samples, and detects bugs, demonstrating its effectiveness and efficiency in quantum programming and bug detection. Regarding branch coverage, our framework achieves more than 74.27% on quantum programs with under 5 qubits.</description>

      <title>Gain-assisted control of the photonic spin Hall effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10565v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the photonic spin Hall effect (SHE), also known as the transverse shift, incident light photons with opposite spins are spatially separated in the transverse direction due to the spin-orbit interaction of light. Here, we propose a gain-assisted model to control the SHE in the reflected probe light. In this model, a probe light is incident on a cavity containing a three-level dilute gaseous atomic medium, where the interaction between the atom and the control field follows two-photon Raman transitions. We show that the direction of photonic spin accumulations can be switched between positive and negative values across the Brewster angle in both the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes. For the same magnitude of control fields, the peak value of the photonic SHE is higher in the anomalous dispersion region compared to the normal dispersion regime. Additionally, the angular range around the Brewster angle is wider in the normal dispersion regime than in the anomalous dispersion region. Furthermore, the peak value of the photonic SHE and the angular range can be controlled by changing the Rabi frequencies of the control fields and the probe field detuning. The measurement of photonic SHE based on gain assistance may enable spin-related applications such as optical sensing.</description>

      <title>Efficient conversion from fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fermionic Gaussian states are eigenstates of quadratic Hamiltonians and are widely used in quantum many-body problems. We propose a highly efficient algorithm that converts fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states. It can be formulated for finite-size systems without translation invariance, but becomes particularly appealing when applied to infinite systems with translation invariance. If the ground states of a topologically ordered system on infinite cylinders are expressed as matrix product states, then the fixed points of the transfer matrix can be harnessed to filter out the anyon eigenbasis, also known as minimally entangled states. This allows for efficient computation of universal properties, such as the entanglement spectrum and modular matrices. The potential of our method is demonstrated by numerical calculations in two chiral spin liquids that have the same topological orders as the bosonic Laughlin and Moore-Read states, respectively. The anyon eigenbasis for the first one has been worked out before and serves as a useful benchmark. The anyon eigenbasis of the second one is, however, not transparent, and its successful construction provides a nontrivial corroboration of our method.</description>

Abstract: Atomic spectroscopy can be used to search for new bosons that carry exotic forces between elementary fermions. A comparison of a recent precise measurement [Bullis \textit{et al.}, Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{130}, 203001 (2023)] of the hyperfine splitting of the 2S$_{1/2}$ electronic levels of hydrogen and up-to-date bound-state quantum electrodynamics theory yields improved constraints on electron-proton exotic interactions of the dimensionless coupling strengths $g_Ag_A$, $g_pg_p$, and $g_Vg_V$ corresponding to the exchange of a axial-vector, pseudoscalar (axionlike) or vector boson, respectively.</description>

      <title>Collectively-modified inter-molecular electron correlations: The connection of polaritonic chemistry and spin glass physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08986v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polaritonic chemistry has garnered increasing attention in recent years due to pioneering experimental results, which show that site- and bond-selective chemistry at room temperature is achievable through strong collective coupling to field fluctuations in optical cavities. Despite these notable experimental strides, the underlying theoretical mechanisms remain unclear. In this focus review, we highlight a fundamental theoretical link between the seemingly unrelated fields of polaritonic chemistry and spin glasses, exploring its profound implications for the theoretical framework of polaritonic chemistry. Specifically, we present a mapping of the dressed many-molecules electronic-structure problem under collective vibrational strong coupling to the spherical Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SSK) model of a spin glass. This mapping uncovers a collectively induced instability of the intermolecular electron correlations, which could provide the long sought-after seed for significant local chemical modifications in polaritonic chemistry. Overall, the qualitative predictions made from the SSK model (e.g., dispersion effects, phase transitions, differently modified bulk and rare event properties, heating,...) agree well with available experimental observations. Our connection paves the way to incorporate, adjust and probe numerous spin glass concepts in polaritonic chemistry, such as modified fluctuation-dissipation relations, (non-equilibrium) aging dynamics, time-reversal symmetry breaking or stochastic resonances. Ultimately, the connection also offers fresh insights into the applicability of spin glass theory beyond condensed matter systems suggesting novel theoretical directions such as spin glasses with explicitly time-dependent (random) interactions.</description>

      <title>Exact volume-law entangled zero-energy eigenstates in a large class of spin models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22773v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exact solutions for excited states in non-integrable quantum Hamiltonians have revealed novel dynamical phenomena that can occur in quantum many-body systems. This work proposes a method to analytically construct a specific set of volume-law-entangled zero-energy exact excited eigenstates in a large class of spin Hamiltonians. In particular, we show that all spin chains that satisfy a simple set of conditions host exact volume-law zero-energy eigenstates in the middle of their spectra. Examples of physically relevant spin chains of this type include the transverse-field Ising model, PXP model, spin-$S$ $XY$ model, and spin-$S$ Kitaev chain. Although these eigenstates are highly atypical in their structure, they are thermal with respect to local observables. Our framework also unifies many recent constructions of volume-law entangled eigenstates in the literature. Finally, we show that a similar construction also generalizes to spin models on graphs in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe and quantitatively explain both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions.</description>

      <title>A New Genuine Multipartite Entanglement Measure: from Qubits to Multiboundary Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Latent Entropy (L-entropy) as a novel measure to characterize the genuine multipartite entanglement in quantum systems. Our measure leverages the upper bound of reflected entropy and its maximal values attained by 2-uniform states for $n$-party ($n= 4,5$) and GHZ state for 3-party quantum systems. We demonstrate that the measure functions as a multipartite pure state entanglement monotone and briefly address its extension to mixed multipartite states. We then analyze its interesting characteristics in spin chain models and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Subsequently, we explore its implications to holography by deriving a Page-like curve for the L-entropy in the CFT dual to a multi-boundary wormhole model. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of L-entropy in Haar random states, deriving analytical expressions and validating them against numerical results. In particular, we show that for $n =5$, random states approximate 2-uniform states with maximal multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, we propose a potential connection between random states and multi-boundary wormhole geometries. Extending to finite-temperature systems, we introduce the Multipartite Thermal Pure Quantum (MTPQ) state, a multipartite generalization of the thermal pure quantum state, and explore its entanglement properties. By incorporating state dependent construction of MTPQ state, we resolve the factorization issue in the random average of the MTPQ state, ensuring consistency with the correlation functions in the holographic dual multiboundary wormhole. Finally, we apply this construction to the multi-copy SYK model and examine its multipartite entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>Introduction of Additive Particle Theory for Path Integral Approaches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06796v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Path integral approaches have been used for boson and fermion systems. The path integral approach has been successful in the many-boson system. However, in the many-fermion system, the path integral approach is not feasible due to the sign problem. In this letter, I introduce additive particle (AP) theory in order to generate an approximation method that avoids the sign problem. The AP theory considers one electron as a string polymer, and virtual particles are added into the system. The AP theory is an approximation, but it is constructed to be able to generate the pair distribution function between free electrons and the density of states of the free electrons at an arbitrary temperature. Hence, when the electrostatic interactions are decreased, the AP theory converges to the free electron system. On the other hand, it deviates from the actual system when the electrostatic interactions are increased.</description>

      <title>Mixture equivalence principles and post-quantum theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine the mixture equivalence principle (MEP), which states that proper and improper mixed states with the same density matrix are always experimentally indistinguishable, and a weaker version, which states that this is sometimes true in gravity theories. We point out that Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity violates the weak MEP and that nonlinear extensions of quantum mechanics violate the MEP. We further demonstrate that modifications of the Born rule in quantum theory also typically violate the MEP. We analyse such violations in the context of thermal baths, where proper and improper thermal states induce different physical situations. This has significant implications in the context of black hole physics. We argue that Moller-Rosenfeld semiclassical gravity is not the semiclassical limit of quantum gravity in the context of black hole spacetimes, even in the presence of $N\gg1$ matter fields.</description>

      <title>Optical Properties and Spin States of Inter-layer Carbon Defect Pairs in Hexagonal Boron Nitride: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17457v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Substitutional carbon defects in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) are prominent single photon emitters (SPEs), and their potential for spin activity ($S\geq1$) is particularly intriguing. While studies have largely focused on intra-layer defects, we employ density functional theory (DFT) to investigate inter-layer dimers of identical carbon species (C$_X$C$_X$). We demonstrate that these C$_X$C$_X$ pairs can exhibit a stable triplet spin state at room temperature when closely spaced (e.g., within 3.5-7.1 {\AA}) across hBN layers. As their separation increases beyond this range (e.g., $&gt;7$ {\AA}), they transition into weakly interacting $S=1/2$ pairs, characterized by singlet-triplet degeneracy. This regime is predicted to result in a very small zero-field splitting for the triplet manifold, offering a potential explanation for certain optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signals. The zero-phonon line (ZPL) energy of these inter-layer C$_X$C$_X$ pairs is found to be practically monochromatic and within the visible range. Furthermore, we identify specific C$_B$C$_B$ inter-layer configurations exhibiting atypical low-energy phonon replicas due to out-of-plane vibrational coupling, a finding that may clarify the vibronic structure of other hBN emitters, such as the 'yellow emitters'.</description>

      <title>HBT Interferometry and Quantum Nature of Primordial Gravitational Waves in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity (to be precise, its projectable version) is recognized as a renormalizable, unitary, and asymptotically free quantum field theory of gravity. Notably, one of its cosmological predictions is that it can produce scale-invariant primordial density fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves without relying on inflation. In this paper, we investigate the quantum nature of the primordial gravitational waves generated in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It has been suggested that, for some inflationary models, the non-classicality of primordial gravitational waves in the squeezed coherent quantum state can be detected using the Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) interferometry. We show that in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves can be generated during both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated eras of the Universe. Moreover, the frequency range of their quantum signatures is shown to extend beyond that of inflationary models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.13454v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of finite-size fermionic projected entangled pair states, in conjunction with variational Monte Carlo, to perform accurate simulations of the ground-state of the 2D Hubbard model. Using bond dimensions of up to $D=28$, we show that we can surpass state-of-the-art DMRG energies that use up to $m=32000$ SU(2) multiplets on 8-leg ladders. We further apply our methodology to $10\times 16$, $12\times 16$ and $16 \times 16$ lattices at $1/8$ hole doping and observe the dimensional crossover between stripe orientations. Our work shows the power of finite-size fermionic tensor networks to resolve the physics of the 2D Hubbard model and related problems.</description>

      <title>Electric field tunable spin-orbit gap in a bilayer graphene/WSe$_{2}$ quantum dot</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12252v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report on the investigation of proximity-induced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in a heterostructure of bilayer graphene (BLG) and tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$). A BLG quantum dot (QD) in the few-particle regime acts as a sensitive probe for induced SOC. Finite bias and magnetotransport spectroscopy measurements reveal a significantly enhanced SOC that decreases with the applied displacement field, distinguishing it from pristine BLG. Furthermore, our measurements demonstrate a reduced valley $g$-factor at larger displacement fields, consistent with a weaker lateral confinement of the QD. Our findings show evidence of the influence of WSe$_2$ across BLG layers, driven by reduced real-space confinement and increased layer localization of the QD states on the BLG layer distant to the WSe$_2$ at higher displacement fields. This study demonstrates the electrostatic tunability of the spin-orbit gap in BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures, which is especially relevant for the field of spintronics and future spin qubit control in BLG QDs.</description>

      <title>Temporal SU(1,1) Interferometer with Broadband Squeezed Light Injection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal optics has attracted much attention due to its ability for lossless stretching of ultrafast temporal pulses. At the same time, spatial SU(1,1) interferometers have been widely used because of their high sensitivity to phase changes. On this basis, we studied a temporal SU(1,1) interferometer based on a temporal Fourier transform system and injected broadband squeezing light into the interferometer for research. The results show that the output spectral characteristics of the interferometer depend on the ratio of the focal group velocity dispersion (GDD) of the two temporal lenses (this ratio is defined as the scaling factor $M$) and the phase derivative of the applied phase. The scaling factor $M$ significantly affects the bandwidth and squeezing degree of the output spectrum. The phase derivative induces a frequency-shift effect, and the magnitude of the shift exhibits a linear relationship to the phase derivative. Furthermore, in the output squeezed-state spectrum, the distribution of squeezing degree concentrates at the center frequency and at positions where frequency shifts occur. As the value of scaling factor $M$ increases, the proportion of squeezing degree allocated at the center frequency correspondingly increases. This temporal SU(1,1) interferometer architecture opens new avenues for the control of non-classical fields in the time-frequency domain and quantum information processing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.13394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the primary challenges in quantum chemistry is the accurate modeling of strong electron correlation. While multireference methods effectively capture such correlation, their steep scaling with system size prohibits their application to large molecules and extended materials. Quantum embedding offers a promising solution by partitioning complex systems into manageable subsystems. In this review, we highlight recent advances in multireference density matrix embedding and localized active space self-consistent field approaches for complex molecules and extended materials. We discuss both classical implementations and the emerging potential of these methods on quantum computers. By extending classical embedding concepts to the quantum landscape, these algorithms have the potential to expand the reach of multireference methods in quantum chemistry and materials.</description>

      <title>Holstein mechanism in single-site model with unitary evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16020v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Holstein mechanism in a single-electron (one-site) system, where unitary evolution intrinsically involves both fermion and boson operators under nonadiabatic conditions. The resulting unitary dynamics and boson-frequency dependence reveal a quantum phase transition, evidenced by distinct short-time (power-law decay) and long-time (exponential decay) behaviors, which are manifested in the polaronic shift, bosonic energy, and dynamics of reduced density matrix. This observation is consistent with a non-Markovian to Markovian transition.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hall Conductivities in Local Commuting Projector Models: Generalized Symmetries and Protected Surface Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.</description>

      <title>Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.</description>
