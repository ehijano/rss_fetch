      <title>How High a Field Can Be and Has Been Achieved in Superconducting Bulk Niobium Cavities Across Different RRR Values?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Brief Note explores the relationship between residual resistivity ratio (RRR) and the maximum surface magnetic field in superconducting bulk niobium (Nb) cavities. Data from the 1980s to 2020s, covering RRR values from 30 to 500, are compared with theoretical performance limits, including the lower critical field (Bc1), superheating field (Bsh), and thermal runaway field (Brun). The results show that modern Nb cavities are approaching Brun and the metastability region above Bc1 across the entire RRR range but remain below the fundamental limit at Bsh. Achieving Bsh requires not only advanced high-gradient surface processing but also improved thermal stability with low surface resistance, ultra-pure Nb, and optimized Kapitza conductance to ensure Brun &gt; Bsh.</description>

      <title>Phonon-mediated superconductivity in transition-metal trioxides XO3 (X = Ru, Re, Os, Ir, Pt) under pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18405v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent experiment by Shan {\it et al} [arXiv:2304.09011] found that rhenium trioxide ReO$_3$, a simple metal at the ambient pressure, becomes superconducting with a transition temperature as high as 17 K at 30 GPa. In this paper, we analyze the electron-phonon origin of superconductivity in rhombohedral ReO$_3$ in detail. In addition, we also conduct a high-throughout screening of isostructural transition-metal trioxides XO$_3$ in searching for potential pressure-induced superconductors. Totally twenty-eight XO$_3$ compounds have been studied, in which four candidates RuO$_3$, OsO$_3$, IrO$_3$ and PtO$_3$ are predicted superconducting with the transition temperatures of 26.4, 30.3, 0.9 and 2.8 K at 30 GPa, respectively. Both IrO$_3$ and PtO$_3$ stay superconducting even at the ambient pressure. In ReO$_3$, RuO$_3, $OsO$_3$ and IrO$_3$, the conduction electrons around the Fermi level are dominantly from the X-d and the O-2p orbitals, and their electron-phonon coupling originates from the lattice dynamics of both the heavier transition-metal-atom and the oxygen-atom. Inclusion of spin-orbital coupling would mildly suppress the transition temperatures of these transition-metal trioxide superconductors except RuO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Optically active Higgs and Leggett modes in multiband pair-density-wave superconductors with Lifshitz invariant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifshitz invariant is a symmetry invariant composed of multiple order parameters that contain a single spatial derivative in a Ginzburg-Landau (GL) free energy, which may induce a nonuniform configuration of the order parameters. In multiband superconductors, we find phase transitions from a uniform superconducting state to qualitatively distinct two pair-density-wave (PDW) states with small and large momenta $\boldsymbol{q}$ based on the GL theory. The former is induced by the Lifshitz invariant, while the latter originates from the drag effect. In the PDW states, the Higgs and Leggett modes (i.e., collective amplitude and relative phase oscillations of the order parameters) are shown to couple to electromagnetic fields linearly. We construct microscopic models of multiband superconductors with Lifshitz invariant that exhibit PDW states, and calculate the linear optical conductivity using the diagrammatic approach. We find optically active Higgs and Leggett modes in the small $\boldsymbol{q}$ PDW state, indicating that the PDW state is a suitable platform to explore collective modes of multiband superconductors in the linear response regime.</description>

      <title>A gauge-invariant formulation of optical responses in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductors are often discussed in the mean-field approximation that breaks $U(1)$ symmetry. Since the $U(1)$ symmetry underlies the charge conservation, naive application of response theory sometimes gives results that are not gauge-invariant. We study the effect of vertex corrections on the electromagnetic responses of superconductors by employing the gauge-invariant formulation, called consistent fluctuations of order parameters, that manifestly satisfy the Ward identity. For inversion broken two-band superconductors, we find that the linear and second-order optical responses are significantly affected by vertex corrections and the conductivities near the gap energy almost completely disappear. We also investigate the linear optical responses in $d$-wave superconductors and obtained qualitatively different results compared to the result using the solution to the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The full photon vertex used in our study, manifestly satisfies the Ward identity. Our results demonstrate the fundamental importance of vertex corrections in exploring optical responses in superconductors.</description>

      <title>Recombination of localized quasiparticles in disordered superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disordered superconductors offer new impedance regimes for quantum circuits, enable a pathway to protected qubits and improve superconducting single photon detectors due to their high kinetic inductance and sheet resistance. However, the relaxation of quasiparticles, which cause decoherence and microwave loss, is drastically affected by disorder, which is still not understood. We address this issue by measuring the quasiparticle relaxation time in a disordered $\beta$-Ta film, which we pattern as the inductor of a microwave resonator. We observe that the quasiparticle relaxation time is governed by the phonon scattering time and is independent on the phononic environment, which is in stark contrast to the relaxation of quasiparticles in ordered superconductors. We explain these observations in terms of the recombination of localized quasiparticles that first delocalize via phonon scattering. We analyse quasiparticle relaxation measurements on superconductors with different degrees of disorder and conclude that this phenomenon is inherent to disordered superconductors.</description>

      <title>Corner Flat Bands Induced by $d$-Density Wave and Partial Corner State Modification Due to Competition with $d$-Wave Superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the realm of condensed matter physics, higher-order topological insulators and superconductors have become a focal point of research due to their unique gapless boundary states at lower-dimensional boundaries such as corners and edges. This paper delves into the effects of a $d$-density wave (DDW) on first-order topological insulators and the competitive dynamics between DDW and $d$-wave superconductivity (DSC) within these systems. We demonstrate that a pure DDW state can instigate a transition to a higher-order topological phase, distinct from DSC behavior, as it is influenced by boundary shape and can generate corner flat bands without additional potentials. Furthermore, we investigate the competitive effects between DSC and DDW, which lead to the transfer of partial corner states. The interplay between these states results in the generation of partial corner states with different symmetries by proximity-induced DSC, while DDW disrupts these and creates new corner states at alternative locations. This study provides valuable insights into the manipulation of topological states through the competition of different order parameters, which could be pivotal for future research and applications in the field.</description>

      <title>Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The identification of novel mechanisms for superconductivity is a longstanding goal in theoretical physics. In this work, we argue that the combination of repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing, phase coherence and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moir\'e materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial Mott insulator. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs above the half-filled ground states not just near the putative critical point but over a remarkably broad range of coupling strengths on both sides of criticality. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the storied mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.</description>

      <title>Flat Electron Bands with Bad Valley Quantum Numbers in Twisted Bi-Layer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the energy spectrum of a nearest-neighbor electron hopping model for bi-layer graphene at commensurate twist angles. Specifically, we focus on the simplest bi-layer lattices, with moire patterns that have no subcells. The electron hopping hamiltonian is analyzed in momentum space, both by degenerate perturbation theory and by exact numerical calculation. We find that the degeneracy in energy along the edge of the moire Brillouin zone due to the two valley quantum numbers is noticeably broken in the flat central bands at the magic twist angle. A mechanism for the appearance of flat central bands themselves at the magic twist angle is also revealed. It is due to maximal level repulsion. The mechanism relies on the assumption that the phase factor for the AA hamiltonian matrix element for inter-graphene-sheet hopping at the middle of the edge of the moire Brillouin zone has a phase equal to half the twist angle. This assumption is confirmed in the case of uniform AA hopping in between the two sheets of graphene, in the limit of large moire unit cells.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Induced Phase Transitions in Bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ exists in two polymorphs: an unconventional structure with alternating layers of single- and triple-layered nickel-oxygen octahedra, and a classical double-layered Ruddlesden-Popper phase. In this study, we report the growth of single crystals of classical double-layered La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the floating zone method. Structural characterization under pressures up to 15.4 GPa reveals a gradual transition from orthorhombic to tetragonal symmetry near 12 GPa. Additionally, we present pressure and field-dependent electrical resistance measurements under pressures as high as 27.4 GPa, from which we construct a phase diagram.</description>

      <title>Odd-frequency superconducting pairing due to multiple Majorana edge modes in driven topological superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09517v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Majorana zero modes have been shown to be the simplest quasiparticles exhibiting pure odd-frequency pairing, an effect that has so far been theoretically established in the static regime. In this work, we investigate the formation of Majorana modes and odd-frequency pairing in $p$-wave spin-polarized superconductors under a time-dependent drive. We first show that the driven system hosts multiple Majorana modes emerging at zero and $\pi$, whose formation can be controlled by an appropriate tuning of the drive frequency and chemical potential, in agreement with previous studies. Then we explore the induced pair correlations and find that odd-frequency spin-polarized $s$-wave pairing is broadly induced, acquiring large values in the presence of Majorana modes. We discover that, while odd-frequency pairing is proportional to $\sim1/\omega$ in the presence of Majorana zero modes, it is proportional to $\sim 1/(\omega-\pi\hbar/T)$ in the presence of Majorana $\pi$ modes, where $T$ is the periodicity of the drive. Furthermore, we find that the amount of odd-frequency pairing becomes larger when multiple Majorana modes appear but the overall divergent profile as a function of frequency remains. We also show that the divergent odd-frequency pairing is robust against scalar disorder. Notably, we establish a spectral bulk-boundary correspondence between the amount of boundary odd-$\omega$ pairing and the bulk topological invariants in driven chiral systems, which we show to be protected by chiral symmetry and is thus robust against disorder. Our work thus paves the way for understanding the emergent pair correlations in driven topological superconductors</description>
