      <title>One-step architecture of bifunctional petal-like oxygen-deficient NiAl-LDHs nanosheets for high-performance hybrid supercapacitors and urea oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nickel-based layered double hydroxides (LDHs) are promising electrode materials in the fields of energy storage (supercapacitors) and conversion (urea oxidation). The rational construction of atomic and electronic structure is crucial for nickel-based LDHs to realize their satisfactory electrochemical performance. Herein, we report a facile, ecofriendly, one-step synthesis process to construct petal-like oxygen-deficient NiAl-LDH nanosheets for hybrid super-capacitors (HSCs) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR). The asprepared NiAl-LDH nanosheets with rich oxygen vacancies possess a large specific surface area of 216.6 m2 g-1 and a desirable electronic conductivity of 3.45 * 10-4 S cm-1 to deliver an ultra-high specific capacitance of 2801 F g-1 (700 C g-1) at 1 A g-1. Furthermore, high specific energy of 50.0 W h kg-1 at 400 W kg-1 and excellent cycle stability with 91% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles are achieved by the NiAl-LDHs/CFP (carbon fiber paper) (+)//YP-80F (a commercial activated carbon) (-) HSC. Besides, NiAl-LDH nanosheets also work as an efficient electrocatalyst for UOR, which only requires 1.42 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode to drive 10 mA cm-2 in 1 mol L-1 KOH with 0.33 mol L-1 urea. This remarkable performance is superior to most reported values of previous candidates owing to the thin structure of NiAl-LDH nanosheets for exposing more active sites and abundant oxygen vacancies. In addition, various reaction parameters are investigated to optimize the electrochemical performance. In general, this work paves a new way for the architecture of multifunctional nanostructured energy materials.</description>

      <title>3D printing of hierarchical structures made of inorganic silicon-rich glass featuring self-forming nanogratings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hierarchical structures are abundant in nature, such as in the superhydrophobic surfaces of lotus leaves and the structural coloration of butterfly wings. They consist of ordered features across multiple size scales, and their unique properties have attracted enormous interest in wide-ranging fields, including energy storage, nanofluidics, and nanophotonics. Femtosecond lasers, capable of inducing various material modifications, have shown promise for manufacturing tailored hierarchical structures. However, existing methods such as multiphoton lithography and 3D printing using nanoparticle-filled inks typically involve polymers and suffer from high process complexity. Here, we demonstrate 3D printing of hierarchical structures in inorganic silicon-rich glass featuring self-forming nanogratings. This approach takes advantage of our finding that femtosecond laser pulses can induce simultaneous multiphoton crosslinking and self-formation of nanogratings in hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ). The 3D printing process combines the 3D patterning capability of multiphoton lithography and the efficient generation of periodic structures by the self-formation of nanogratings. We 3D-printed micro-supercapacitors with large surface areas and a remarkable areal capacitance of 1 mF/cm^2 at an ultrahigh scan rate of 50 V/s, thereby demonstrating the utility of our 3D printing approach for device applications in emerging fields such as energy storage.</description>

      <title>Surface figure correction using differential deposition of WSi2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface figure of an x-ray mirror was improved by differential deposition of WSi2 layers. DC magnetron sputtering through beam-defining apertures was applied on moving substrates to generate thin films with arbitrary longitudinal thickness variations. The required velocity profiles were calculated using a deconvolution algorithm. Height errors were evaluated after each correction iteration using offline visible light surface metrology. WSi2 was selected as a promising material since it conserves the initial substrate surface roughness and limits the film stress to acceptable levels. On a 300 mm long flat Si mirror the shape error was reduced to less than 0.2 nm RMS.</description>

      <title>Microscale Morphology Driven Thermal Transport in Fiber Reinforced Polymer Composites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fiber-reinforced polymer composite (FRPC) materials are used extensively in various industries, such as aerospace, automobiles, and electronics packaging, due to their remarkable specific strength and desirable properties, such as enhanced durability and corrosion resistance. The evolution of thermal properties in FRPCs is crucial for advancing thermal management systems, optimizing material performance, and enhancing energy efficiency across these diverse sectors. Despite significant research efforts to develop new materials with improved thermal properties and reduced thermal degradation, there is a lack of understanding of the thermal transport phenomena considering the influence of microscale reinforcement morphology in these composites. In the current study, we performed experimental investigations complemented by computations to determine the thermal transport properties and associated phenomena in epoxy and carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy composites. The experimental findings were utilized as input data for numerical analysis to examine the impact of fiber morphology and volume fraction in thermal transport phenomena. Our results revealed that composites incorporating non-circular fibers manifested higher thermal conductivity than traditional circular fibers in the transverse direction. This can be attributed to increased interconnected heat flow pathways facilitated by the increased surface area of non-circular fibers with the same cross-sectional areas, resulting in efficient heat transfer.</description>

      <title>Analysis on reservoir activation with the nonlinearity harnessed from solution-processed MoS2 devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a recurrent neural network that has been applied across various domains in machine learning. The implementation of reservoir computing, however, often demands heavy computations for activating the reservoir. Configuring physical reservoir networks and harnessing the nonlinearity from the underlying devices for activation is an emergent solution to address the computational challenge. Herein, we analyze the feasibility of employing the nonlinearity from solution-processed molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) devices for reservoir activation. The devices, fabricated using liquid-phase exfoliated MoS2, exhibit a high-order nonlinearity achieved by Stark modulation of the MoS2 material. We demonstrate that this nonlinearity can be fitted and employed as the activation function to facilitate reservoir computing implementation. Notably, owing to the high-order nonlinearity, the network exhibits long-term synchronization and robust generalization abilities for approximating complex dynamical systems. Given the remarkable reservoir activation capability, coupled with the scalability of the device fabrication, our findings open the possibility for the physical realization of lightweight, efficient reservoir computing for, for instance, signal classification, motion tracking, and pattern recognition of complex time series as well as secure cryptography. As an example, we show the network can be appointed to generate chaotic random numbers for secure data encryption.</description>

      <title>Magnonic inverse-design processor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology has revolutionized our everyday lives and research. The concept of inverse design, which involves defining a functionality by a human and then using an algorithm to search for the device's design, opened new perspectives for information processing. A specialized AI-driven processor capable of solving an inverse problem in real-time offers a compelling alternative to the time and energy-intensive CMOS computations. Here, we report on a magnon-based processor that uses a complex reconfigurable medium to process data in the gigahertz range, catering to the demands of 5G and 6G telecommunication. Demonstrating its versatility, the processor solves inverse problems using two algorithms to realize RF notch filters and demultiplexers. The processor also exhibits potential for binary, reservoir, and neuromorphic computing paradigms.</description>

      <title>Implementing photometric stereo for scanning helium microscopy (SHeM) to reconstruct true-to-size 3D surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scanning Helium Microscopy (SHeM) offers a combination of spatial and angular resolution via a pinhole-collimated beam of thermal energy, neutral helium-4 atoms for non-destructive imaging. This thesis introduces a novel 3D imaging mode, "heliometric stereo", enabling true-to-size 3D surface reconstruction using an adapted photometric stereo algorithm. Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printed plastics are explored for SHeM pinhole plates due to limitations in traditional machining. FormLabs "Clear Resin" via SLA printing proves ideal for rapid prototyping of vacuum components, with a developed baking protocol ensuring vacuum compatibility. The study indicates re-wetting of such plastics is a surface process over weeks.
  Developing 3D image reconstruction for both single and multi-detector setups required a real-space point tracking method. The point tracking method facilitates facet angle measurement in various materials, including technological and biological crystals. It has since become integral to SHeM imaging protocols for sample manipulator debugging.
  The thesis also details a multi-detector SHeM instrument, referred to as B-SHeM. While primarily designed to perform heliometric stereo reconstructions, the instrument also enables the range of novel SHeM experiments such as mixed-species beams to investigate inelastic scattering.
  The heliometric stereo methods implemented in the work have motivated the development of a GPU accelerated version of the in-house Monte-Carlo based ray tracing framework, which is the de-facto standard for SHeM image analysis. GPU parallelisation was explored as a method for decreasing simulation time and enabling previously inaccessible simulations involving complex scattering distributions and high resolution, realistic sample geometries. Preliminary testing on an analogous problem yielded a potential performance increase of up to 380 times.</description>

      <title>Fractional Newton-Raphson Method Accelerated with Aitken's Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:1804.08445v5 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the following document, we present a way to obtain the order of convergence of the Fractional Newton-Raphson (F N-R) method, which seems to have an order of convergence at least linearly for the case in which the order $\alpha$ of the derivative is different from one. A simplified way of constructing the Riemann-Liouville (R-L) fractional operators, fractional integral and fractional derivative, is presented along with examples of its application on different functions. Furthermore, an introduction to the Aitken's method is made and it is explained why it has the ability to accelerate the convergence of the iterative methods, to finally present the results that were obtained when implementing the Aitken's method in the F N-R method.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear system related to investment under uncertainty solved using the fractional pseudo-Newton method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.05412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.05412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonlinear algebraic equation system of two variables is numerically solved, which is derived from a nonlinear algebraic equation system of four variables, that corresponds to a mathematical model related to investment under conditions of uncertainty. The theory of investment under uncertainty scenarios proposes a model to determine when a producer must expand or close, depending on his income. The system mentioned above is solved using a fractional iterative method, valid for one and several variables, that uses the properties of fractional calculus, in particular the fact that the fractional derivatives of constants are not always zero, to find solutions of nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Fractional flow equations. A model for pressure deficit in an oil well</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09068v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the Laplace space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.07710v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to solve numerically, using the meshless method via radial basis functions, time-space-fractional partial differential equations of type Black-Scholes. The time-fractional partial differential equation appears in several diffusion problems used in physics and engineering applications, and models subdiffusive and superdiffusive behavior of the prices at the stock market. This work shows the flexibility of the radial basis function scheme to solve multidimensional problems with several types of nodes and it also shows how to reduce the condition number of the matrices involved.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a way to define, classify and accelerate the order of convergence of an uncountable family of fractional fixed point methods, which may be useful to continue expanding the applications of fractional operators. The proposed method to accelerate convergence is used in a fractional iterative method, and with the obtained method are solved simultaneously two nonlinear algebraic systems that depend on time-dependent parameters, and that allow obtaining the temperatures and efficiencies of a hybrid solar receiver. Finally, two uncountable families of fractional fixed point methods are presented, in which the proposed method to accelerate convergence can be implemented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polarization arising from non-centrosymmetric wurtzite lattice underpins the physics and functionality of gallium nitride (GaN)-the most produced semiconductor materials second only to silicon. However, recent direct experimental measurements unveiled remanent polarization of unexpectedly large magnitudes and opposite orientations to traditionally anticipated. This significant discrepancy not only poses a formidable challenge to our existing theoretical paradigms but also accentuates the need for a critical rethinking and methodological refinement to integrate these novel observations with established knowledge, mitigating potential misunderstandings and misconceptions in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Microscopic Mechanism of Elementary Vortex Pinning in Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vortex pinning is a crucial factor that determines the critical current of practical superconductors. However, the understanding of its underlying mechanism has long been phenomenological without a clear microscopic description. Here using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy, we studied single vortex pinning induced by point defect in layered FeSe-based superconductors. We found the defect-vortex interaction drives low-energy vortex bound states away from EF, resulting a mini gap which effectively lowered the energy of vortex and caused the pinning. By measuring the local density-of-states, we directly obtained the elementary pinning energy and estimated the pinning force through the spatial gradient of pinning energy. The results align with the bulk critical current measurement. We further show that a general microscopic quantum model with considering defect-vortex interaction can well capture our observation. It indicates the local pairing near pinned vortex core is actually enhanced, which is beyond the traditional understanding that non-superconducting regions pin vortices.

      <title>Active elastic metamaterials with equidistant solely resonant bandgaps</title>

Abstract: Elastic metamaterials are man-made structures with properties that transcend naturally occurring materials. One predominant feature of elastic metamaterials is locally resonant bandgaps, i.e., frequency ranges at which wave propagation is blocked. Locally resonant bandgaps appear at relatively low frequency and arise from the existence of periodically placed mechanical local resonators. Typically, elastic metamaterials exhibit both locally resonant and Bragg-scattering bandgaps, which can generally be different in width and frequency ranges. This paper proposes two designs of active elastic metamaterials that only exhibit locally resonant bandgaps, which are infinite in number, evenly spaced in the frequency spectrum, and identical in width. The mathematical model is established using the transfer matrix method and synthesis of locally resonant bandgaps is achieved via an active elastic support with carefully designed frequency-dependent stiffness. A single unit cell of each proposed metamaterials is thoroughly studied, and its dispersion relation is derived analytically, along with the periodically repeating bandgap limits and widths. Following the dispersion analysis and bandgap parametric studies, finite arrays of the proposed metamaterials are considered, and their frequency response is calculated to verify the analytical predictions from dispersion analyses.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter quantum sensing and magnetic communications with a hybrid dc and rf optically pumped magnetometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and demonstrate a hybrid optically pumped magnetometer (HOPM) that simultaneously measures one dc field component and one rf field component quadrature with a single atomic spin ensemble. The HOPM achieves sub-pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ sensitivity for both dc and rf fields, and is limited in sensitivity by spin projection noise at low frequencies and by photon shot noise at high frequencies. We demonstrate with the HOPM a new application of multiparameter quantum sensing: background-cancelling spread spectrum magnetic communication. We encode a digital message as rf amplitude, spread among sixteen channels from \SI{29}{\kilo\hertz} to \SI{33}{\kilo\hertz} in a noisy magnetic environment, and observe quantum-noise-limited rf magnetic signal recovery enabled by quantum-noise-limited dc noise cancellation, reaching noise rejection of \SI{15}{\decibel} at \SI{100}{\hertz} and more than \SI{20}{\decibel} at \SI{60}{\hertz} and below. We measure signal fidelity versus signal strength and extrinsic noise in communication of a short text message. The combination of high sensitivity, quantum-noise-limited performance, and real-world application potential makes the HOPM ideally suited for study of high-performance multiparameter quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>PINN surrogate of Li-ion battery models for parameter inference. Part I: Implementation and multi-fidelity hierarchies for the single-particle model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17329</link>

Abstract: To plan and optimize energy storage demands that account for Li-ion battery aging dynamics, techniques need to be developed to diagnose battery internal states accurately and rapidly. This study seeks to reduce the computational resources needed to determine a battery's internal states by replacing physics-based Li-ion battery models -- such as the single-particle model (SPM) and the pseudo-2D (P2D) model -- with a physics-informed neural network (PINN) surrogate. The surrogate model makes high-throughput techniques, such as Bayesian calibration, tractable to determine battery internal parameters from voltage responses. This manuscript is the first of a two-part series that introduces PINN surrogates of Li-ion battery models for parameter inference (i.e., state-of-health diagnostics). In this first part, a method is presented for constructing a PINN surrogate of the SPM. A multi-fidelity hierarchical training, where several neural nets are trained with multiple physics-loss fidelities is shown to significantly improve the surrogate accuracy when only training on the governing equation residuals. The implementation is made available in a companion repository (https://github.com/NREL/pinnstripes). The techniques used to develop a PINN surrogate of the SPM are extended in Part II for the PINN surrogate for the P2D battery model, and explore the Bayesian calibration capabilities of both surrogates.</description>

      <title>PINN surrogate of Li-ion battery models for parameter inference. Part II: Regularization and application of the pseudo-2D model</title>

Abstract: Bayesian parameter inference is useful to improve Li-ion battery diagnostics and can help formulate battery aging models. However, it is computationally intensive and cannot be easily repeated for multiple cycles, multiple operating conditions, or multiple replicate cells. To reduce the computational cost of Bayesian calibration, numerical solvers for physics-based models can be replaced with faster surrogates. A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is developed as a surrogate for the pseudo-2D (P2D) battery model calibration. For the P2D surrogate, additional training regularization was needed as compared to the PINN single-particle model (SPM) developed in Part I. Both the PINN SPM and P2D surrogate models are exercised for parameter inference and compared to data obtained from a direct numerical solution of the governing equations. A parameter inference study highlights the ability to use these PINNs to calibrate scaling parameters for the cathode Li diffusion and the anode exchange current density. By realizing computational speed-ups of 2250x for the P2D model, as compared to using standard integrating methods, the PINN surrogates enable rapid state-of-health diagnostics. In the low-data availability scenario, the testing error was estimated to 2mV for the SPM surrogate and 10mV for the P2D surrogate which could be mitigated with additional data.</description>

      <title>Performance-based ice engineering: a data-driven multi-scale approach</title>

Abstract: Ice storms are one of the most devastating natural hazards which have the potential to inflict significant damage to the built environment. The multi-hazard nature of ice events complicates the analysis of their induced risk due to their inherent nonlinear interactions. In addition, the concurrent and interacting hazards are often responsible for several aerodynamical/dynamical instabilities such as the galloping mechanism. Moreover, the existing risk approaches are usually not suited for large-scale risk evaluation over extended geographical regions due to the involved high-computational costs. Therefore, in this study, a novel data-driven multi-scale performance-based ice engineering (PBIE) framework is developed to support the design of new structures subjected to ice storms or the rehabilitation of existing ones. In addition, the proposed PBIE is capable of rapidly estimating the real-time risk over an extended region due to an ice event. Specifically, it leverages the superior capabilities of state-of-the-art data-driven techniques (e.g., machine learning) to efficiently generate the corresponding risk maps and identify the high-risk areas. The proposed PBIE framework is applied to a simplified example in which the galloping-induced risk on iced conductors, in terms of the galloping amplitude, is evaluated for both local and regional scales. The resulting PBIE framework can be readily applied for design or retrofitting purposes or integrated within an emergency response management system to inform preventive actions that can mitigate the ice storm-induced damages and save lives.</description>

      <title>Metasurface-Enabled Multifunctional Single-Frequency Sensors without External Power</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: IoT sensors are crucial for visualizing multidimensional and multimodal information and enabling future IT applications/services such as cyber-physical space, digital twins, autonomous driving, smart cities, and virtual/augmented reality (VR or AR). However, IoT sensors need to be battery-free to realistically manage and maintain the growing number of available sensing devices. Here, we provide a novel sensor design approach that employs metasurfaces to enable multifunctional sensing without requiring an external power source. Importantly, unlike existing metasurface-based sensors, our metasurfaces can sense multiple physical parameters even at a fixed frequency by breaking classic harmonic oscillations in the time domain, making the proposed sensors viable for usage with limited frequency resources. Moreover, we provide a method for predicting physical parameters using the machine learning-based approach of random forest regression. The sensing performance was confirmed by estimating temperature and light intensity, and excellent determination coefficients larger than 0.96 were achieved. Our study affords new opportunities for sensing multiple physical properties without relying on an external power source or needing multiple frequencies, which markedly simplifies and facilitates the design of next-generation wireless communication systems.</description>
