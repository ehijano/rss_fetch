      <title>Triggered: A Statistical Analysis of Environmental Influences on Extremist Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online extremist communities operate within a wider information ecosystem shaped by real-world events, news coverage, and cross-community interaction. We adopt a systems perspective to examine these influences using seven years of data from two ideologically distinct extremist forums (Stormfront and Incels) and a mainstream reference community (r/News). We ask three questions: how extremist violence impacts community behaviour; whether news coverage of political entities predicts shifts in conversation dynamics; and whether linguistic diffusion occurs between mainstream and extremist spaces and across extremist ideologies. Methodologically, we combine counterfactual synthesis to estimate event-level impacts with vector autoregression and Granger causality analyses to model ongoing relationships among news signals, behavioural outcomes, and cross-community language change. Across analyses, our results indicate that Stormfront and r/News appear to be more reactive to external stimuli, while Incels demonstrates less cross-community linguistic influence and less responsiveness to news and violent events. These findings underscore that extremist communities are not homogeneous, but differ in how tightly they are coupled to the surrounding information ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Shifting landscape of disability and development in India: Analysis from historical trends to future predictions 2001-2031</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study delves into the causes and trends of disability-related health burdens across Indian states. Through multiple Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALY) types (covering communicable diseases, noncommunicable diseases, and injuries), gender disparities, and Human Development Index (HDI) values, these disability trends were evaluated. The data for this study was compiled from censuses, health research organisations, and data centres, among various other sources. We built regression models and used them to analyze trends across past decades and make projections for 2031. Our regression results show a strong inverse relationship between communicable disease DALYs and HDI. In other words, ongoing improvements in development and infrastructure significantly reduced communicable disease DALYs. In contrast, noncommunicable DALYs did not decrease despite rising HDI. And lastly, injury DALYs showed moderate declines with higher HDI, which reflects improvements in healthcare and safety systems. Gender analysis showed male overrepresentation among people with disabilities. These results from our study support that there is a need to shift public health focus toward chronic diseases and address gender disparities in disability outcomes.</description>

      <title>UniShare: A Unified Framework for Joint Video and Receiver Recommendation in Social Sharing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sharing behavior on short-video platforms constitutes a complex ternary interaction among the user (sharer), the video (content), and the receiver. Traditional industrial solutions often decouple this into two independent tasks: video recommendation (predicting share probability) and receiver recommendation (predicting whom to share with), leading to suboptimal performance due to isolated modeling and inadequate information utilization. To address this, we propose UniShare, a novel unified framework for joint sharing prediction on both video and receiver recommendation. UniShare models the share probability through an enhanced representation learning module that incorporates pre-trained GNN and multi-modal embeddings, alongside explicit bilateral interest and relationship matching. A key innovation is our joint training paradigm, which leverages signals from both tasks to mutually enhance each other, mitigating data sparsity and improving bilateral satisfaction. We also introduce K-Share, a large-scale real-world dataset constructed from Kuaishou platform logs to support research in this domain. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that UniShare significantly outperforms strong baselines on both tasks. Furthermore, online A/B testing on the Kuaishou platform confirms its effectiveness, achieving significant improvements in key metrics including the number of shares (+1.95%) and receiver reply rate (+0.482%).</description>

      <title>Popularity Feedback Constrains Innovation in Cultural Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Real-world creative processes ranging from art to science rely on social feedback-loops between selection and creation. Yet, the effects of popularity feedback on collective creativity remain poorly understood. We investigate how popularity ratings influence cultural dynamics in a large-scale online experiment where participants ($N = 1\,008$) iteratively \textit{select} images from evolving markets and \textit{produce} their own modifications. Results show that exposing the popularity of images reduces cultural diversity and slows innovation, delaying aesthetic improvements. These findings are mediated by alterations of both selection and creation. During selection, popularity information triggers cumulative advantage, with participants preferentially building upon popular images, reducing diversity. During creation, participants make less disruptive changes, and are more likely to expand existing visual patterns. Feedback loops in cultural markets thus not only shape selection, but also, directly or indirectly, the form and direction of cultural innovation.</description>

      <title>Human-AI Synergy Supports Collective Creative Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.10001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative AI is increasingly transforming creativity into a hybrid human-artificial process, but its impact on the quality and diversity of creative output remains unclear. We study collective creativity using a controlled word-guessing task that balances open-endedness with an objective measure of task performance. Participants attempt to infer a hidden target word, scored based on the semantic similarity of their guesses to the target, while also observing the best guess from previous players. We compare performance and outcome diversity across human-only, AI-only, and hybrid human-AI groups. Hybrid groups achieve the highest performance while preserving high diversity of guesses. Within hybrid groups, both humans and AI agents systematically adjust their strategies relative to single-agent conditions, suggesting higher-order interaction effects, whereby agents adapt to each other's presence. Although some performance benefits can be reproduced through collaboration between heterogeneous AI systems, human-AI collaboration remains superior, underscoring complementary roles in collective creativity.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Tripartite Modularity for Clustering Heterogeneous Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Clustering heterogeneous relational data remains a central challenge in graph learning, particularly when interactions involve more than two types of entities. While differentiable modularity objectives such as DMoN have enabled end-to-end community detection on homogeneous and bipartite graphs, extending these approaches to higher-order relational structures remains non-trivial.
  In this work, we introduce a differentiable formulation of tripartite modularity for graphs composed of three node types connected through mediated interactions. Community structure is defined in terms of weighted co-paths across the tripartite graph, together with an exact factorized computation that avoids the explicit construction of dense third-order tensors. A structural normalization at pivot nodes is introduced to control extreme degree heterogeneity and ensure stable optimization.
  The resulting objective can be optimized jointly with a graph neural network in an end-to-end manner, while retaining linear complexity in the number of edges. We validate the proposed framework on large-scale urban cadastral data, where it exhibits robust convergence behavior and produces spatially coherent partitions. These results highlight differentiable tripartite modularity as a generic methodological building block for unsupervised clustering of heterogeneous graphs.</description>

      <title>Effects of Backtracking on PageRank</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.13353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider three variations on standard PageRank: Non-backtracking PageRank, $\mu$-PageRank, and $\infty$-PageRank, all of which alter the standard formula by adjusting the likelihood of backtracking in the algorithm's random walk. We show that in the case of regular and bipartite biregular graphs, standard PageRank and its variants are equivalent. We also compare each centrality measure and investigate their clustering capabilities.</description>

      <title>Tiered Anonymity on Social-Media Platforms as a Countermeasure against Deepfakes and LLM-Driven Mass Misinformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We argue that governments should mandate a three-tier anonymity framework on social-media platforms as a reactionary measure prompted by the ease-of-production of deepfakes and large-language-model-driven misinformation. The tiers are determined by a given user's $\textit{reach score}$: Tier 1 permits full pseudonymity for smaller accounts, preserving everyday privacy; Tier 2 requires private legal-identity linkage for accounts with some influence, reinstating real-world accountability at moderate reach; Tier 3 would require per-post, independent, ML-assisted fact-checking, review for accounts that would traditionally be classed as sources-of-mass-information.
  An analysis of Reddit shows volunteer moderators converge on comparable gates as audience size increases - karma thresholds, approval queues, and identity proofs - demonstrating operational feasibility and social legitimacy. Acknowledging that existing engagement incentives deter voluntary adoption, we outline a regulatory pathway that adapts existing US jurisprudence and recent EU-UK safety statutes to embed reach-proportional identity checks into existing platform tooling, thereby curbing large-scale misinformation while preserving everyday privacy.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Fake-News Detection with Node-Level Topological Features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09974v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, the proliferation of misinformation and fake news has posed serious threats to individuals and society, spurring intense research into automated detection methods. Previous work showed that integrating content, user preferences, and propagation structure achieves strong performance, but leaves all graph-level representation learning entirely to the GNN, hiding any explicit topological cues. To close this gap, we introduce a lightweight enhancement: for each node, we append two classical graph-theoretic metrics, degree centrality and local clustering coefficient, to its original BERT and profile embeddings, thus explicitly flagging the roles of hub and community. In the UPFD Politifact subset, this simple modification boosts macro F1 from 0.7753 to 0.8344 over the original baseline. Our study not only demonstrates the practical value of explicit topology features in fake-news detection but also provides an interpretable, easily reproducible template for fusing graph metrics in other information-diffusion tasks.</description>

      <title>Offline World Models as Imagination Networks in Cognitive Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04391v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational role of imagination remains debated. While classical accounts emphasize reward maximization, emerging evidence suggests it accesses internal world models (IWMs). We employ psychological network analysis to compare IWMs in humans and large language models (LLMs) via imagination vividness ratings, distinguishing offline world models (persistent memory structures accessed independent of immediate goals) from online models (task-specific representations). Analyzing 2,743 humans across three populations and six LLM variants, we find human imagination networks exhibit robust structural consistency, with high centrality correlations and aligned clustering. LLMs show minimal clustering and weak correlations with human networks, even with conversational memory, across environmental and sensory contexts. These differences highlight disparities in how biological and artificial systems organize internal representations. Our framework offers quantitative metrics for evaluating offline world models in cognitive agents.</description>
