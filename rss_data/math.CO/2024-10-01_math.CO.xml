      <title>Four-coloring Eulerian triangulations of the torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hutchinson, Richter and Seymour [J. Combin. Theory Ser. B 84 (2002), 225-239] showed that every Eulerian triangulation of an orientable surface that has a sufficiently high representativity is 4-colorable. We give an explicit bound on the representativity in the case of the torus by proving that every Eulerian triangulation of the torus with representativity at least 10 is 4-colorable. We also observe that the bound on the representativity cannot be decreased to less than 8 as there exists a non-4-colorable Eulerian triangulation of the torus with representativity 7.</description>

      <title>Word length, bias and bijections in Penney's ante</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix two words over the binary alphabet $\{0,1\}$, and generate iid Bernoulli$(p)$ bits until one of the words occurs in sequence. This setup, commonly known as Penney's ante, was popularized by Conway, who found (in unpublished work) a simple formula for the probability that a given word occurs first. We study win probabilities in Penney's ante from an analytic and combinatorial perspective, building on previous results for the case $p = \frac{1}{2}$ and words of the same length. For words of arbitrary lengths, our results bound how large the win probability can be for the longer word. When $p = \frac{1}{2}$ we characterize when a longer word can be statistically favorable, and for $p \neq \frac{1}{2}$ we present a conjecture describing the optimal pairs, which is supported by computer computations. Additionally, we find that Penney's ante often exhibits symmetry under the transformation $p \to 1-p$. We construct new explicit bijections that account for these symmetries, under conditions that can be easily verified by examining auto- and cross-correlations of the words.</description>

      <title>Creating Subgraphs in Semi-Random Hypergraph Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-random hypergraph process is a natural generalisation of the semi-random graph process, which can be thought of as a one player game. For fixed $r &lt; s$, starting with an empty hypergraph on $n$ vertices, in each round a set of $r$ vertices $U$ is presented to the player independently and uniformly at random. The player then selects a set of $s-r$ vertices $V$ and adds the hyperedge $U \cup V$ to the $s$-uniform hypergraph. For a fixed (monotone) increasing graph property, the player's objective is to force the graph to satisfy this property with high probability in as few rounds as possible.
  We focus on the case where the player's objective is to construct a subgraph isomorphic to an arbitrary, fixed hypergraph $H$. In the case $r=1$ the threshold for the number of rounds required was already known in terms of the degeneracy of $H$. In the case $2 \le r &lt; s$, we give upper and lower bounds on this threshold for general $H$, and find further improved upper bounds for cliques in particular. We identify cases where the upper and lower bounds match. We also demonstrate that the lower bounds are not always tight by finding exact thresholds for various paths and cycles.</description>

      <title>On $r$-wise $t$-intersecting uniform families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider families, $\mathcal{F}$ of $k$-subsets of an $n$-set. For integers $r\geq 2$, $t\geq 1$, $\mathcal{F}$ is called $r$-wise $t$-intersecting if any $r$ of its members have at least $t$ elements in common. The most natural construction of such a family is the full $t$-star, consisting of all $k$-sets containing a fixed $t$-set. In the case $r=2$ the Exact Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado Theorem shows that the full $t$-star is largest if $n\geq (t+1)(k-t+1)$. In the present paper, we prove that for $n\geq (2.5t)^{1/(r-1)}(k-t)+k$, the full $t$-star is largest in case of $r\geq 3$. Examples show that the exponent $\frac{1}{r-1}$ is best possible. This represents a considerable improvement on a recent result of Balogh and Linz.</description>

      <title>Solitaire of Independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study a reversible process (more precisely, a groupoid/group action) resembling the classical 15-puzzle, where the legal moves are to ``move the unique hole inside a translate of a shape $S$''. Such a process can be defined for any finite subset $S$ of a group, and we refer to such a process as simply ``solitaire''. We develop a general theory of solitaire, and then concentrate on the simplest possible example, solitaire for the plane $\mathbb{Z}^2$, and $S$ the triangle shape (equivalently, any three-element set in general position). In this case, we give a polynomial time algorithm that puts any finite subset of the plane in normal form using solitaire moves, and show that the solitaire orbit of a line of consecutive ones -- the line orbit -- is completely characterised by the notion of a so-called fill matrix. We show that the diameter of the line orbit, as a graph with edges the solitaire moves, is cubic. We show that analogous results hold for the square shape, but indicate some shapes (still on the group $\mathbb{Z}^2$) where this is less immediate. We then explain in detail the connection of the solitaire to TEP and more generally permutive subshifts. Namely, the solitaire is a closure property of various sets of subsets of the group that can be associated to such a subshift, such as the independence, spanning and filling sets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Work of Glover and Huneke shows that a cubic graph embeds into the real projective plane if and only if it does not contain one of six topological minors called cubic projective plane obstructions. Here we classify up to equivalence the embeddings of these graphs into the torus.</description>

      <title>Reconfiguration graphs for vertex colorings of $P_5$-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any positive integer $k$, the reconfiguration graph for all $k$-colorings of a graph $G$, denoted by $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$, is the graph where vertices represent the $k$-colorings of $G$, and two $k$-colorings are joined by an edge if they differ in color on exactly one vertex. Bonamy et al. established that for any $2$-chromatic $P_5$-free graph $G$, $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$ is connected for each $k\geq 3$. On the other hand, Feghali and Merkel proved the existence of a $7p$-chromatic $P_5$-free graph $G$ for every positive integer $p$, such that $\mathcal{R}_{8p}(G)$ is disconnected.
  In this paper, we offer a detailed classification of the connectivity of $\mathcal{R} _k(G) $ concerning $t$-chromatic $P_5$-free graphs $G$ for cases $t=3$, and $t\geq4$ with $t+1\leq k \leq {t\choose2}$. We demonstrate that $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$ remains connected for each $3$-chromatic $P_5$-free graph $G$ and each $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, for each $t\geq4$ and $t+1 \leq k \leq {t\choose2}$, we provide a construction of a $t$-chromatic $P_5$-free graph $G$ with $\mathcal{R}_k(G)$ being disconnected. This resolves a question posed by Feghali and Merkel.</description>

      <title>Automated conjecturing in mathematics with \emph{TxGraffiti}</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: \emph{TxGraffiti} is a data-driven, heuristic-based computer program developed to automate the process of generating conjectures across various mathematical domains. Since its creation in 2017, \emph{TxGraffiti} has contributed to numerous mathematical publications, particularly in graph theory. In this paper, we present the design and core principles of \emph{TxGraffiti}, including its roots in the original \emph{Graffiti} program, which pioneered the automation of mathematical conjecturing. We describe the data collection process, the generation of plausible conjectures, and methods such as the \emph{Dalmatian} heuristic for filtering out redundant or transitive conjectures. Additionally, we highlight its contributions to the mathematical literature and introduce a new web-based interface that allows users to explore conjectures interactively. While we focus on graph theory, the techniques demonstrated extend to other areas of mathematics.</description>

      <title>Desarrangements revisited: statistics and pattern avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A desarrangement is a permutation whose first ascent is even. Desarrangements were introduced in the 1980s by Jacques D\'{e}sarm\'{e}nien, who proved that they are in bijection with derangements. We revisit the study of desarrangements, focusing on two themes: the refined enumeration of desarrangements with respect to permutation statistics, and pattern avoidance in desarrangements. Our main results include generating function formulas for counting desarrangements by the number of descents, peaks, valleys, double ascents, and double descents, as well as a complete enumeration of desarrangements avoiding a prescribed set of length 3 patterns. We find new interpretations of the Catalan, Fine, Jacobsthal, and Fibonacci numbers in terms of pattern-avoiding desarrangements.</description>

Abstract: Ajtai, Koml\'{o}s, Pintz, Spencer and Szemer\'{e}di proved that every $(r + 1)$-uniform ``locally sparse'' hypergraph $H$ of average degree $d \geq 1$ has an independent set of size \[ \Omega_r\Bigl(\frac{\log d}{d}\Bigr)^{\frac{1}{r}} \cdot |V(H)| \] as $d \rightarrow \infty$.

      <title>A new generalization of Fielder's lemma with applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Very recently Ma and Wu \cite{wu2024generalization} obtained a generalization of Fielder's lemma and applied to find adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian spectra of $P_n-$ product of commuting graphs. In this paper, we give a generalization of Fielder's lemma applying which not only one gets generalized result in \cite{wu2024generalization} as a particular case, but also one can find several kind of spectra of $H$-product of graphs when $H$ is an arbitrary graph. Moreover, we compute adjacency spectrum of $H-$ product of commuting graphs and universal adjacency spectrum of $H-$ product of commuting regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20160v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lonely Runner Conjecture originated in Diophantine approximation will turn 60 in 2028. Even if the conjecture is still widely open, the flow of partial results, innovative tools and connections to different problems and applications has been steady on its long life. This survey attempts to give a panoramic view of the status of the problem, trying to highlight the contributions of the many papers that it has originated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a positive rational $q$, we consider Dyck paths having height at most two with some constraints on the number of consecutive peaks and consecutive valleys, depending on $q$. We introduce a general class of Dyck paths, called rational Dyck paths, and provide the associated generating function, according to their semilength, as well as the construction of such a class. Moreover, we characterize some subsets of the rational Dyck paths that are enumerated by the $\mathbb Q$-bonacci numbers.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Hilbert space with basis indexed by infinite permutations and the cohomology ring of the infinite flag variety can be seen as representations of the Heisenberg algebra, which are isomorphic using the back-stable Schubert polynomials. We give a model for infinite permutations as certain two dimensional fermions, generalizing the Maya diagram construction for partitions. Under this framework, the pipedream model for Schubert polynomials can be viewed as the Hamiltonian time evolution of the 2D fermions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20478v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: R.P. Stanley defined a invariant for graphs called the chromatic symmetric function and conjectured it is complete invariant for trees. Miezaki et al. generalised the chromatic symmetric function and defined the Kneser chromatic functions denoted by $\{X_{K_{\mathbb{N},k}}\}_{k\in\mathbb{N}}$, and rephrase Stanley's conjecture that $X_{K_{\mathbb{N},1}}$ is a complete invariant for trees. This paper shows $X_{K_{\mathbb{N},2}}$ is a complete invariant for trees.</description>

      <title>Transitivity in wreath products with symmetric groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20495v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the notion of a transitive subgroup of a permutation group $P$ extends naturally to the subsets of $P$. We study transitive subsets of the wreath product $G \wr S_n$, where $G$ is a finite abelian group. This includes the hyperoctahedral group for $G=C_2$. We give structural characterisations of transitive subsets using the character theory of $G \wr S_n$ and interpret such subsets as designs in the conjugacy class association scheme of $G \wr S_n$. In particular, we prove a generalisation of the Livingstone-Wagner theorem and give explicit constructions of transitive sets. Moreover, we establish connections to orthogonal polynomials, namely the Charlier polynomials, and use them to study codes and designs in $C_r \wr S_n$. Many of our results extend results about the symmetric group $S_n$.</description>

      <title>The Closed Geodetic Game: algorithms and strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The geodetic closure of a set S of vertices of a graph is the set of all vertices in shortest paths between pairs of vertices of S. A set S of vertices in a graph is geodetic if its geodetic closure contains all the vertices of the graph. Buckley introduced in 1984 the idea of a game where two players construct together a geodetic set by alternately selecting vertices, the game ending when all vertices are in the geodetic closure. The Geodetic Game was then studied in 1985 by Buckley and Harary, and allowed players to select vertices already in the geodetic closure of the current set. We study the more natural variant, also introduced in 1985 by Buckley and Harary and called the Closed Geodetic Game, where the players alternate adding to a set S vertices that are not in the geodetic closure of S, until no move is available. This variant was only studied ever since for trees by Araujo et al. in 2024. We provide a full characterization of the Sprague-Grundy values of graph classes such as paths and cycles, of the outcomes of several products of graphs in function of the outcomes of the two graphs, and give polynomial-time algorithms to determine the Sprague-Grundy values of cactus and block graphs.</description>

      <title>An El-Zahar Type Theorem in $3$-graphs under Codegree Condition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $3$-uniform loose cycle, denoted by $C_t$, is a $t$-vertex 3-uniform hypergraph whose vertices can be ordered cyclically in such a way that the hyperedges are sets of consecutive three vertices and every two consecutive hyperedges share exactly one vertex. The length of $C_t$ is the number of its edges. We prove that for any $\eta&gt;0$, there exists an $n_0=n_0(\eta)$ such that for any $n\geq n_0$ the following holds. Let $\mathcal{C}$ be a $3$-graph consisting of vertex-disjoint loose cycles $C_{n_1}, C_{n_2}, \ldots, C_{n_r}$ such that $\sum_{i=1}^{r}n_i=n$ with each loose cycle having a length of at least $3$. Let $k$ be the number of loose cycles with odd lengths in $\mathcal{C}$. If $\mathcal{H}$ is a $3$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices with minimum codegree at least $(n+2k)/4+\eta n$, then $\mathcal{H}$ contains $\mathcal{C}$ as a spanning sub-hypergraph. This generalizes the results of K\"{u}hn and Osthus for loose Hamilton cycle and the result of Mycroft for loose cycle factors in $3$-graphs, where each cycle has length no less than $3$. The codegree bound is approximately tight. Our proof relies on a transversal blow-up lemma recently developed by the first author and Staden.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Cayley graphs on non-abelian simple groups of valency 7</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a connected $7$-valent symmetric Cayley graph on a finite non-abelian simple group $G$. If $\Gamma$ is not normal, Li {\em et al.} [On 7-valent symmetric Cayley graphs of finite simple groups, J. Algebraic Combin. 56 (2022) 1097-1118] characterised the group pairs $(\mathrm{soc}(\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)/K),GK/K)$, where $K$ is a maximal intransitive normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$. In this paper, we improve this result by proving that if $\Gamma$ is not normal, then $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$ contains an arc-transitive non-abelian simple normal subgroup $T$ such that $G&lt;T$ and $(T,G)=(\mathrm{A}_{n},\mathrm{A}_{n-1})$ with $n=7$, $3\cdot 7$, $3^2\cdot 7$, $2^2\cdot 3\cdot 7$, $2^3\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^3\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7$, $2^4\cdot3^2\cdot5\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^7\cdot3\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3^2\cdot7$, $2^6\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^8\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^7\cdot3^4\cdot5^2\cdot7$, $2^{10}\cdot3^2\cdot7$, $2^{24}\cdot3^2\cdot7$. Furthermore, $\mathrm{soc}(\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)/R)=(T\times R)/R$, where $R$ is the largest solvable normal subgroup of $\mathrm{Aut}(\Gamma)$.</description>

      <title>The $S_3$-symmetric $q$-Onsager algebra and its Lusztig automorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $q$-Onsager algebra $O_q$ is defined by two generators and two relations, called the $q$-Dolan/Grady relations. In 2019, Baseilhac and Kolb introduced two automorphisms of $O_q$, now called the Lusztig automorphisms. Recently, we introduced a generalization of $O_q$ called the $S_3$-symmetric $q$-Onsager algebra $\mathbb O_q$. The algebra $\mathbb O_q$ has six distinguished generators, said to be standard. The standard $\mathbb O_q$-generators can be identified with the vertices of a regular hexagon, such that nonadjacent generators commute and adjacent generators satisfy the $q$-Dolan/Grady relations. In the present paper we do the following: (i) for each standard $\mathbb O_q$-generator we construct an automorphism of $\mathbb O_q$ called a Lusztig automorphism; (ii) we describe how the six Lusztig automorphisms of $\mathbb O_q$ are related to each other; (iii) we describe what happens if a
  finite-dimensional irreducible $\mathbb O_q$-module is twisted by a Lusztig automorphism; (iv) we give a detailed example involving an irreducible
  $\mathbb O_q$-module with dimension 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by Zhou's method on the positivity of truncated pentagonal number series, we establish a general positivity result on tails of certain $q$-series which uniformly refines the positivity of truncated pentagonal number series, truncated Gauss' identities and some special cases of truncated Jacobi triple product identity. Our proof of the main results is elementary, in which a classical result on partitions of an integer into a finite set of positive integers and the mathematical software such as Maple play important roles.</description>

      <title>New matrix perturbation bounds via contour expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.20207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.20207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix perturbation bounds (such as Weyl and Davis-Kahan) are frequently used in many branches of mathematics. Most of the classical results in this area are optimal, in the worst-case analysis. However, in modern applications, both the ground and the nose matrices frequently have extra structural properties. For instance, it is often assumed that the ground matrix is essentially low rank, and the nose matrix is random or pseudo-random. We aim to rebuild a part of perturbation theory, adapting to these modern assumptions. We will do this using a contour expansion argument, which enables us to exploit the skewness among the leading eigenvectors of the ground and the noise matrix (which is significant when the two are uncorrelated) to our advantage. In the current paper, we focus on the perturbation of eigenspaces. This helps us to introduce the arguments in the cleanest way, avoiding the more technical consideration of the general case. In applications, this case is also one of the most useful. More general results appear in a subsequent paper. Our method has led to several improvements, which have direct applications in central problems. Among others, we derive a sharp result for the perturbation of a low rank matrix with random perturbation, answering an open question in this area. Next, we derive new results concerning the spike model, an important model in statistics, bridging two different directions of current research. Finally, we use our results on the perturbation of eigenspaces to derive new results concerning eigenvalues of deterministic and random matrices. In particular, we obtain new results concerning the outliers in the deformed Wigner model and the least singular value of random matrices with non-zero mean.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.20400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of $$ U_t(a,q):=\sum_{1\leq n_1&lt;n_2&lt;\cdots&lt;n_t}\frac{q^{n_1+n_2+\cdots+n_t}}{(1+aq^{n_1}+q^{2n_1})(1+aq^{n_2}+q^{2n_2})\cdots(1+aq^{n_t}+q^{2n_t})} $$ when $a$ is one of $0, \pm 1, \pm2$. The idea builds on our previous treatment of the case $a=-2$. It is shown that all these functions lie in the ring of quasi-modular forms. Among the more surprising findings is $$U_2(1,q)=\sum_{n\geq1} \frac{q^{3n}}{(1-q^{3n})^2}.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:1609.02209v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Unimodular networks are a generalization of finite graphs in a stochastic sense. We prove a lower bound to the spectral radius of the adjacency operator and of the Markov operator of an unimodular network in terms of its average degree. This allows to prove an Alon-Boppana type bound for the largest eigenvalues in absolute value of large, connected, bounded degree graphs, which generalizes the Alon-Boppana theorem for regular graphs.
  A key step is establishing a lower bound to the spectral radius of a unimodular tree in terms of its average degree. Similarly, we provide a lower bound on the volume growth rate of an unimodular tree in terms of its average degree.</description>

      <title>Borel sets of Rado graphs and Ramsey's Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.00266</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.00266v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Galvin-Prikry Theorem states that Borel subsets of the Baire space are Ramsey: Given any Borel subset $\mathcal{X}\subseteq [\omega]^{\omega}$, where $[\omega]^{\omega}$ is endowed with the metric topology, each infinite subset $X\subseteq \omega$ contains an infinite subset $Y\subseteq X$ such that $[Y]^{\omega}$ is either contained in $\mathcal{X}$ or disjoint from $\mathcal{X}$. Kechris, Pestov, and Todorcevic point out in their seminal 2005 paper the dearth of similar results for homogeneous structures. Such results are a necessary step to the larger goal of finding a correspondence between structures with infinite dimensional Ramsey properties and topological dynamics, extending their correspondence between the Ramsey property and extreme amenability. In this article, we prove an analogue of the Galvin-Prikry theorem for the Rado graph. Any such infinite dimensional Ramsey theorem is subject to constraints following from the 2006 work of Laflamme, Sauer, and Vuksanovic. The proof uses techniques developed for the author's work on the Ramsey theory of the Henson graphs as well as some new methods for fusion sequences, used to bypass the lack of a certain amalgamation property enjoyed by the Baire space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02936v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For $r,n\ge2$, an ordered $r$-uniform matching of size $n$ is an $r$-uniform hypergraph on a linearly ordered vertex set $V$, with $|V|=rn$, consisting of $n$ pairwise disjoint edges. There are $\tfrac12\binom{2r}r$ different ways two edges may intertwine, called here patterns. Among them we identify $3^{r-1}$ collectable patterns $P$, which have the potential of appearing in arbitrarily large quantities called $P$-cliques.
  We prove an Erd\H{o}s-Szekeres type result guaranteeing in every ordered $r$-uniform matching the presence of a $P$-clique of a prescribed size, for some collectable pattern $P$. In particular, in the diagonal case, one of the $P$-cliques must be of size $\Omega\left( n^{3^{1-r}}\right)$. In addition, for each collectable pattern $P$ we show that the largest size of a $P$-clique in a random ordered $r$-uniform matching of size $n$ is, with high probability, $\Theta\left(n^{1/r}\right)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02497v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${\cal H}=(V,E)$ be any $r$-uniform hypergraph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, where $r\ge 2$, $P({\cal H},k)$ be the chromatic polynomial of ${\cal H}$, $P({\cal H},L)$ be the number of $L$-colorings of ${\cal H}$ for any $k$-assignment $L$ and $P_l({\cal H},k)$ be the minimum value of $P({\cal H},L)$ over all $k$-assignments $L$. In this article, we show that $P_l({\cal H},k)=P({\cal H},k)$ holds whenever $k\ge m-1$, and in particular, $P({\cal H}, L)-P({\cal H},k)\ge (k-m+1)k^{n-r-1} \sum\limits_{e\in E} \left (k-\left|\bigcap\limits_{v\in e}L(v)\right|\right ) $ when $m\ge 5$. Our conclusion extends both our previous result in terms of graphs and the latest known result on hypergraphs by Wang, Qian and Yan.</description>

Abstract: The recently discovered "hat" aperiodic monotile mixes unreflected and reflected tiles in every tiling it admits, leaving open the question of whether a single shape can tile aperiodically using translations and rotations alone. We show that a close relative of the hat -- the equilateral member of the continuum to which it belongs -- is a weakly chiral aperiodic monotile: it admits only non-periodic tilings if we forbid reflections by fiat. Furthermore, by modifying this polygon's edges we obtain a family of shapes called Spectres that are strictly chiral aperiodic monotiles: they admit only chiral non-periodic tilings based on a hierarchical substitution system.</description>

Abstract: We characterize plane bipartite graphs whose resonance graphs are daisy cubes, and therefore generalize related results on resonance graphs of benzenoid graphs, catacondensed even ring systems, as well as 2-connected outerplane bipartite graphs. Firstly, we prove that if $G$ is a plane elementary bipartite graph other than $K_2$, then the resonance graph of $G$ is a daisy cube if and only if the Fries number of $G$ equals the number of finite faces of $G$. Next, we extend the above characterization from plane elementary bipartite graphs to plane bipartite graphs and show that the resonance graph of a plane bipartite graph $G$ is a daisy cube if and only if $G$ is weakly elementary bipartite such that each of its elementary component $G_i$ other than $K_2$ holds the property that the Fries number of $G_i$ equals the number of finite faces of $G_i$. Along the way, we provide a structural characterization for a plane elementary bipartite graph whose resonance graph is a daisy cube, and show that a Cartesian product graph is a daisy cube if and only if all of its nontrivial factors are daisy cubes.</description>

      <title>The Collatz map analogue in polynomial rings and in completions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00390v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study an analogue of the Collatz map in the polynomial ring $R[x]$, where $R$ is an arbitrary commutative ring. We prove that if $R$ is of positive characteristic, then every polynomial in $R[x]$ is eventually periodic with respect to this map. This extends previous works of the authors and of Hicks, Mullen, Yucas and Zavislak, who studied the Collatz map on $\mathbb{F}_p[x]$ and $\mathbb{F}_2[x]$, respectively. We also consider the Collatz map on the ring of formal power series $R[[x]]$ when $R$ is finite: we characterize the eventually periodic series in this ring, and give formulas for the number of cycles induced by the Collatz map, of any given length. We provide similar formulas for the original Collatz map defined on the ring $\mathbb{Z}_2$ of $2$-adic integers, extending previous results of Lagarias.</description>

      <title>Average hitting times in some $f$-equitable graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the average hitting times of simple random walks from any vertex to any other vertex in distance-regular graphs are determined by their intersection array. In this paper, we introduce a new graph classification called $f$-equitable, utilizing both the equitable partition and the function $f$, which represents a generalization of distance-regular graphs. We determine the average hitting times from any vertex to any other vertex in $f$-equitable graphs by using their parameter referred to as the quotient matrix. Furthermore, we prove that there is some function $f$ such that the Cartesian product of two strongly regular graphs is $f$-equitable. We then calculate the quotient matrix for these graphs and determine the average hitting times from any vertex to any other vertex in these graphs. In the same manner, we determine the average hitting times on some generalized Paley graphs.</description>

      <title>Maker-Breaker domination game played on corona products of graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13581v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the Maker-Breaker domination game, Dominator and Staller play on a graph $G$ by taking turns in which each player selects a not yet played vertex of $G$. Dominator's goal is to select all the vertices in a dominating set, while Staller aims to prevent this from happening. In this paper, the game is investigated on corona products of graphs. Its outcome is determined as a function of the outcome of the game on the second factor. Staller-Maker-Breaker domination numbers are determined for arbitrary corona products, while Maker-Breaker domination numbers of corona products are bounded from both sides. All the bounds presented are demonstrated to be sharp. Corona products as well as general graphs with small (Staller-)Maker-Breaker domination numbers are described.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a question and some enumerative conjectures of Richard Stanley, we explore the equivalence classes of words in the Weyl algebra, $\mathbf{k} \left&lt; D,U \mid DU - UD = 1 \right&gt;$. We show that each class is generated by the swapping of adjacent *balanced subwords*, i.e., those which have the same number of $D$'s as $U$'s, and give several other characterizations.
  Armed with this we deduce a number of enumerative results about the number of such equivalence classes and their sizes. We extend these results to the class of $c$-Dyck words, where every prefix has at least $c$ times as many $U$'s as $D$'s. We also connect these results to previous work on bond percolation and rook theory, and generalize them to some other algebras.</description>

Abstract: A circulant graph is a Cayley graph of a finite cyclic group. The Weisfeiler-Leman-dimension of a circulant graph $X$ with respect to the class of all circulant graphs is the smallest positive integer~$m$ such that the $m$-dimensional Weisfeiler-Leman algorithm correctly tests the isomorphism between $X$ and any other circulant graph. It is proved that for a circulant graph of order $n$ this dimension is less than or equal to $\Omega(n)+3$, where $\Omega(n)$ is the number of prime divisors of~$n$.</description>

      <title>When do the Kahn-Kalai Bounds Provide New Information?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02822v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Park-Pham theorem (previously known as the Kahn-Kalai conjecture), bounds the critical probability, $p_c(\mathcal{F})$, of the a non-trivial property $\mathcal{F}\subseteq 2^X$ that is closed under supersets by the product of a universal constant $K$, the expectation threshold of the property, $q(\mathcal{F})$, and the logarithm of the size of the property's largest minimal element, $\log\ell(\mathcal{F})$. That is, the Park-Pham theorem asserts that $p_c(\mathcal{F})\leq Kq(\mathcal{F})\log\ell(\mathcal{F})$. Since the critical probability $p_c(\mathcal{F})$ always satisfies $p_c(\mathcal{F})&lt;1$, one may ask when the upper bound posed by Kahn and Kalai gives us more information than this--that is, when is it true that $Kq(\mathcal{F})\log\ell(\mathcal{F}) &lt; 1$? There are many situations where this occurs, as well as many situations where this is not the case. In this short note, we provide a number of necessary conditions for this to happen and give a few sufficient conditions for the bounds to provide new (and, in fact, asymptotically perfect) information along the way. In the most interesting case where $\ell(\mathcal{F}_n)\rightarrow \infty$, we prove the following relatively strong necessary condition for the Kahn-Kalai bounds to provide new information: For every positive integer $t$, every collection of all-but-$t$ of the minimal elements of $\mathcal{F}_n$ may have nonempty intersection for only finitely many $n$. Consequently, not only must the number of minimal elements become arbitrarily large, but so too must the size of any cover. Intuitively, this means that such sequences $\mathcal{F}_n$ must occupy an ever-widening `wedge' in $2^{X_n}$: the further $\mathcal{F}_n$ climbs up $2^{X_n}$ in one area, the further it must spread down and across $2^{X_n}$ in another.</description>

      <title>Pushing Tree Decompositions Forward Along Graph Homomorphisms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15184v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is folklore that tree-width is monotone under taking subgraphs (i.e. injective graph homomorphisms) and contractions (certain kinds of surjective graph homomorphisms). However, although tree-width is obviously not monotone under any surjective graph homomorphism, it is not clear whether contractions are canonically the only class of surjections with respect to which it is monotone. We prove that this is indeed the case: we show that - up to isomorphism - contractions are the only surjective graph homomorphisms that preserve tree decompositions and the shape of the decomposition tree. Furthermore, our results provide a framework for answering questions of this sort for many other kinds of combinatorial data structures (such as directed multigraphs, hypergraphs, Petri nets, circular port graphs, half-edge graphs, databases, simplicial complexes etc.) for which natural analogues of tree decompositions can be defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.17067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a model of stable edge sets (``matchings'') in a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ in which the preferences for vertices of one side (``firms'') are given via choice functions subject to standard axioms of consistency, substitutability and cardinal monotonicity, whereas the preferences for the vertices of the other side (``workers'') via linear orders. For such a model, we present a combinatorial description of the structure of rotations and develop an algorithm to construct the poset of rotations, in time $O(|E|^2)$ (including oracle calls). As consequences, one can obtain a ``compact'' affine representation of stable matchings and efficiently solve some related problems.

      <description>arXiv:2409.14678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Smooth Fano polytopes (SFP) play an important role in toric geometry and combinatorics. In this paper, we introduce a specific subcollection of them, i.e., the unimodular smooth Fano polytopes (USFP). In Section 2, they are verified to satisfy the three (weak, strong, star) Ewald conditions. Besides, a characterisation of USFPs is provided as a corollary of the famous Seymour's decomposition theorem. Then, we briefly introduce the works by Luis Crespo on deeply monotone polytopes and give a proof of the claim that any deeply monotone polytope is in fact the dual polytope of some USFP. In other words, we extend his results on deeply monotone polytopes to the case of USFPs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04395v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In causal inference on directed acyclic graphs, the orientation of edges is in general only recovered up to Markov equivalence classes. We study Markov equivalence classes of uniformly random directed acyclic graphs. Using a tower decomposition, we show that the ratio between the number of Markov equivalence classes and directed acyclic graphs approaches a positive constant when the number of sites goes to infinity. For a typical directed acyclic graph, the expected number of elements in its Markov equivalence class remains bounded. More precisely, we prove that for a uniformly chosen directed acyclic graph, the size of its Markov equivalence class has super-polynomial tails.</description>

We introduce a combinatorial problem called the Assignment Problem and show its equivalence to the Discrete Gauss Image Problem.

Additionally, we provide new discrete interpretations of some classical concepts related to Aleksandrov's integral curtvature, such as, for example, connecting Aleksandrov relation to Hall's Marriage Theorem.</description>

      <title>Probability Metrics for Tropical Spaces of Different Dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.02846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The problem of comparing probability distributions is at the heart of many tasks in statistics and machine learning. Established comparison methods treat the standard setting that the distributions are supported in the same space. Recently, a new geometric solution has been proposed to address the more challenging problem of comparing measures in Euclidean spaces of differing dimensions. Here, we study the same problem of comparing probability distributions of different dimensions in the tropical setting, which is becoming increasingly relevant in applications involving complex data structures such as phylogenetic trees. Specifically, we construct a Wasserstein distance between measures on different tropical projective tori -- the focal metric spaces in both theory and applications of tropical geometry -- via tropical mappings between probability measures. We prove equivalence of the directionality of the maps, whether mapping from a low dimensional space to a high dimensional space or vice versa. As an important practical implication, our work provides a framework for comparing probability distributions on the spaces of phylogenetic trees with different leaf sets. We demonstrate the computational feasibility of our approach using existing optimisation techniques on both simulated and real data.</description>

      <title>A Combinatorial Perspective on Random Access Efficiency for DNA Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15722v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the fundamental limits of the recently proposed random access coverage depth problem for DNA data storage. Under this paradigm, it is assumed that the user information consists of $k$ information strands, which are encoded into $n$ strands via a generator matrix $G$. During the sequencing process, the strands are read uniformly at random, as each strand is available in a large number of copies. In this context, the random access coverage depth problem refers to the expected number of reads (i.e., sequenced strands) required to decode a specific information strand requested by the user. This problem heavily depends on the generator matrix $G$, and besides computing the expectation for different choices of $G$, the goal is to construct matrices that minimize the maximum expectation over all possible requested information strands, denoted by $T_{\max}(G)$. In this paper, we introduce new techniques to investigate the random access coverage depth problem, capturing its combinatorial nature and identifying the structural properties of generator matrices that are advantageous. We establish two general formulas to determine $T_{\max}(G)$ for arbitrary generator matrices. The first formula depends on the linear dependencies between columns of $G$, whereas the second formula takes into account recovery sets and their intersection structure. We also introduce the concept of recovery balanced codes and provide three sufficient conditions for a code to be recovery balanced. These conditions can be used to compute $T_{\max}(G)$ for various families of codes, such as MDS, simplex, Hamming, and binary Reed-Muller codes. Additionally, we study the performance of modified systematic MDS and simplex matrices, showing that the best results for $T_{\max}(G)$ are achieved with a specific combination of encoded strands and replication of the information strands.</description>

      <title>Capped Vertex Functions for $\text{Hilb}^n (\mathbb{C}^2)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00498v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain explicit formulas for capped descendent vertex functions of $\text{Hilb}^n(\mathbb{C}^2)$ for descendents given by chern classes of tautological bundles. The expression is the result of twisting a well known generating function for normalized Macdonald polynomials. This gives an explicit description of the rational function the capped vertex is an expansion of. Along the way we prove various limit expressions of the capping operator and the bare vertex function.</description>

      <title>Freiman's $3k-4$ Theorem for Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00183v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Freiman's $3k-4$ Theorem states that if a subset $A$ of $k$ integers has a Minkowski sum $A+A$ of size at most $3k-4$, then it must be contained in a short arithmetic progression. We prove a function field analogue that is also a generalisation: it states that if $K$ is a perfect field and if $S\supset K$ is a vector space of dimension $k$ inside an extension $F/K$ in which~$K$ is algebraically closed, and if the $K$-vector space generated by all products of pairs of elements of $S$ has dimension at most $3k-4$, then $K(S)$ is a function field of small genus, and $S$ is of small codimension inside a Riemann-Roch space of $K(S)$.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for complementary sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding the n-th positive square number is easy, as it is simply $n^2$. But how do we find the complementary sequence, i.e. the n-th positive nonsquare number? For this case there is an explicit formula. However, for general constraints on a number, this is harder to find. In this paper, we study how to compute the n-th integer that does (or does not) satisfy a certain condition. In particular, we consider it as a fixed point problem, relate it to the iterative method of Lambek and Moser, study a bisection approach to this problem and provide formulas for various complementary sequences such as the non-k-gonal numbers, non-k-gonal pyramidal numbers, non-k-simplex numbers, non-sum-of-k-th powers and non-k-th powers.</description>

      <title>Combinatorics of graded module categories over skew polynomial algebras at roots of unity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce an operation on skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ called switching, and also define a class of skew-symmetric matrices over $\mathbb{Z}/\ell\mathbb{Z}$ referred to as modular Eulerian matrices. We then show that these are closely related to the graded module categories over skew polynomial algebras at $\ell$-th roots of unity. As an application, we study the point simplicial complexes of skew polynomial algebras at cube roots of unity.</description>

      <title>SCMAlgebras: a Macaulay2 package to check sequential Cohen-Macaulayness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15134v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Macaulay2 package SCMAlgebras. It provides functions for computing deficiency modules and filter ideals, in order to check whether a module or an ideal is sequentially Cohen-Macaulay. After the basic algebraic notions and results are recalled, the main features of the package are described through examples.</description>
