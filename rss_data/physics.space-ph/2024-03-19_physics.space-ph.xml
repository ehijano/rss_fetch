      <title>A new launch pad failure mode: Analysis of fine particles from the launch of the first Starship orbital test flight</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study examines the characteristics, composition, and origin of fine particle debris samples collected following the launch of the first Starship orbital test flight, which suggests a new launch pad failure mode previously unknown. Particle shapes, sizes, bulk densities, and VIS/NIR/MIR spectra, of collected fine particle material from Port Isabel, TX, were analyzed and compared to pulverized concrete, Fondag (high temperature concrete), limestone, and sand recovered from the area near the Starship launch pad after this test flight. Raman spectroscopy was also used to determine mineral compositions of each sample. Results suggest that the fine particle material lofted by the Starship launch is consistent with sand derived from the launch site. These results imply that the destruction of the launch pad eroded and lofted material into the air from the underlying sandy, base-layer. From calculations, this lofted material likely remained suspended in the air for minutes following the launch from recirculation, allowing for transport over an extended range. Most of the recovered material was too coarse to be a respiration hazard, as a small mass fraction of the particles (&lt;1%) had diameters of 10 um or less. Video analysis and ballistic models also provide insight into the failure mechanism associated with the launch pad, which was consistent with a high-pressure eruption from the region below the failed launch pad.</description>

      <title>Cohesion and Shear Strength of Compacted Lunar and Martian Regolith Simulants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shear strength and cohesion of granular materials are important geotechnical properties that play a crucial role in the stability and behavior of lunar and Martian regolith, as well as their terrestrial analog materials. To characterize and predict shear strength and cohesion for future space missions, it is also important to understand the effects of particle size distribution and density on these fundamental geotechnical properties. Generalized equations have been established using empirical data from direct shear measurements of lunar and Martian regolith simulants to quantify the effects of particle size distribution and density on cohesion and shear strength. Preliminary results are also presented highlighting the effects of atmospheric absorbed water on shear strength and cohesion when conducting experiments in atmospheric conditions on Earth. The results of this study show that cohesion increases exponentially with bulk density, while the exponential growth constant is also dependent on particle size distribution.</description>

      <title>Radiative loss and ion-neutral collisional effects in astrophysical plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the role of radiative cooling in a two-fluid model consisting of coupled neutrals and charged particles. We first analyze the linearized two-fluid equations where we include radiative losses in the energy equation for the charged particles. In a 1D geometry for parallel propagation and in the limiting cases of weak and strong coupling, it can be shown analytically that the instability conditions for the thermal mode and the sound waves, the isobaric and isentropic criteria, respectively, remain unchanged with respect to one-fluid radiative plasmas. For the parameters considered in this paper, representative for the solar corona, the radiative cooling produces growth of the thermal mode and damping of the sound waves. When neutrals are included and are sufficiently coupled to the charges, the thermal mode growth rate and the wave damping both reduce by the same factor, which depends on the ionization fraction only. For a heating function which is constant in time, we find that the growth of the thermal mode and the damping of the sound waves are slightly larger. The numerical calculation of the eigenvalues of the general system of equations in a 3D geometry confirm the analytic results. We then run 2D fully nonlinear simulations which give consistent results: a higher ionization fraction or lower coupling will increase the growth rate. The magnetic field contribution is negligible in the linear phase. Ionization-recombination effects might play an important role because the radiative cooling produces a large range of temperatures in the system. In the numerical simulation, after the first condensation phase, when the minimum temperature is reached, the fraction of neutrals increases four orders of magnitude because of the recombination.</description>

      <title>Parallel Diffusion Coefficient of Energetic Charged Particles in the Inner Heliosphere from the Turbulent Magnetic Fields Measured by Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion coefficients of energetic charged particles in turbulent magnetic fields are a fundamental aspect of diffusive transport theory but remain incompletely understood. In this work, we use quasi-linear theory to evaluate the spatial variation of the parallel diffusion coefficient $\kappa_\parallel$ from the measured magnetic turbulence power spectra in the inner heliosphere. We consider the magnetic field and plasma velocity measurements from Parker Solar Probe made during Orbits 5-13. The parallel diffusion coefficient is calculated as a function of radial distance from 0.062 to 0.8 AU, and the particle energy from 100 keV to 1GeV. We find that $\kappa_\parallel$ increases exponentially with both heliocentric distance and energy of particles. The fluctuations in $\kappa_\parallel$ are related to the episodes of large-scale magnetic structures in the solar wind. By fitting the results, we also provide an empirical formula of $\kappa_{\parallel}=(5.16\pm1.22) \times 10^{18} \: r^{1.17\pm0.08} \: E^{0.71\pm 0.02} \; (cm^2/s)$ in the inner heliosphere which can be used as a reference in studying the transport and acceleration of solar energetic particles as well as the modulation of cosmic rays.</description>
