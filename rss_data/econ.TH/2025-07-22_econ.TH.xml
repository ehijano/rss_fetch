      <title>Approximate Revenue Maximization for Diffusion Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reserve prices are widely used in practice. The problem of designing revenue-optimal auctions based on reserve price has drawn much attention in the auction design community. Although they have been extensively studied, most developments rely on the significant assumption that the target audience of the sale is directly reachable by the auctioneer, while a large portion of bidders in the economic network unaware of the sale are omitted. This work follows the diffusion auction design, which aims to extend the target audience of optimal auction theory to all entities in economic networks. We investigate the design of simple and provably near-optimal network auctions via reserve price. Using Bayesian approximation analysis, we provide a simple and explicit form of the reserve price function tailored to the most representative network auction. We aim to balance setting a sufficiently high reserve price to induce high revenue in a successful sale, and attracting more buyers from the network to increase the probability of a successful sale. This reserve price function preserves incentive compatibility for network auctions, allowing the seller to extract additional revenue beyond that achieved by the Myerson optimal auction. Specifically, if the seller has $\rho$ direct neighbours in a network of size $n$, this reserve price guarantees a $1-{1 \over \rho}$ approximation to the theoretical upper bound, i.e., the maximum possible revenue from any network of size $n$. This result holds for any size and any structure of the networked market.</description>

      <title>Central Bank Digital Currency: Demand Shocks and Optimal Monetary Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the implications of a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the transmission of household preference shocks and for welfare in a New Keynesian framework where the CBDC competes with bank deposits for household resources and banks have market power. We show that an increase in the benefit of CBDC has a mildly expansionary effect, weakening bank market power and significantly reducing the deposit spread. As households economize on liquid asset holdings, they reduce both CBDC and deposit balances. However, the degree of bank disintermediation is low, as deposit outflows remain modest. We then examine the welfare implications of CBDC rate setting and find that, compared to a non-interest-bearing CBDC, the gains with standard coefficients for a CBDC interest rate Taylor rule are modest, but they become considerable when the coefficients are optimized. Welfare gains are higher when the CBDC provides a higher benefit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.15438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a dynamic model in which a developer incrementally improves a product of uncertain quality over time, with the quality evolving as a controlled Brownian motion. At each moment in time, the developer can continue exploring by paying a flow cost, restart from a previously attained quality level by paying a fixed cost, or terminate the process by either freely abandoning the project or by incurring a cost to launch the highest quality observed so far. The optimal strategy is characterized by a free boundary of an impulse-controlled Brownian motion.</description>

      <title>Strategic Complexity Promotes Egalitarianism in Legislative Bargaining</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strategic models of legislative bargaining predict that proposers can extract high shares of economic surplus by identifying and exploiting weak coalition partners. However, strength and weakness can be difficult to assess even with relatively simple bargaining protocols. We evaluate experimentally how strategic complexity affects the ability to identify weak coalition partners, and for the partners themselves to determine whether their positions are weak or strong. We find that, as strategic complexity progressively obscures bargaining strength, proposers migrate to egalitarianism, in significant part because non-proposers begin placing substantial weight on fairness. Greater analytic skill dampens but does not eliminate these patterns.</description>

      <title>Strategyproofness and Monotone Allocation of Auction in Social Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14472v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strategyproofness in network auctions requires that bidders not only report their valuations truthfully, but also do their best to invite neighbours from the social network. In contrast to canonical auctions, where the value-monotone allocation in Myerson's Lemma is a cornerstone, a general principle of allocation rules for strategyproof network auctions is still missing. We show that, due to the absence of such a principle, even extensions to multi-unit network auctions with single-unit demand present unexpected difficulties, and all pioneering researches fail to be strategyproof. For the first time in this field, we identify two categories of monotone allocation rules on networks: Invitation-Depressed Monotonicity (ID-MON) and Invitation-Promoted Monotonicity (IP-MON). They encompass all existing allocation rules of network auctions as specific instances. For any given ID-MON or IP-MON allocation rule, we characterize the existence and sufficient conditions for the strategyproof payment rules, and show that among all such payment rules, the revenue-maximizing one exists and is computationally feasible. With these results, the obstacle of combinatorial network auction with single-minded bidders is now resolved.</description>

      <title>Strategy Evolution in the Adoption of Conservation Tillage Technology under Time Preference Heterogeneity and Lemon Market: Insights from Evolutionary Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The promotion of Conservation Tillage Technology (CTT) is critical for mitigating global soil degradation, yet their actual adoption rates remain substantially lower than anticipated targets. Existing research predominantly focuses on static factor analyses, failing to adequately capture the dynamic evolutionary mechanisms of farmer strategic interactions and the impacts of information asymmetries in agricultural markets. This study constructs an evolutionary game model integrating heterogeneous time preferences and lemon market effects to reveal the dynamic equilibrium of technology adoption within farmer groups operating under bounded rationality. Key findings indicate that farmers with high time preferences significantly impede CTT adoption due to the excessive discounting of long-term benefits. Furthermore, the lemon market effect dictates the system's equilibrium states: 1) When the lemon market benefit ($P$) exceeds the lemon market loss ($Q$) ($P &gt; Q$), stable tripartite coexistence of adoption strategies emerges; 2) When $P &lt; Q$, the system evolves unpredictably, exhibiting dynamics characterized by heteroclinic cycles; 3) At the critical threshold $P = Q$, the system transforms into a conservative Hamiltonian system, yielding stable periodic oscillation solutions. Based on these insights, policy recommendations are proposed: implementing ecological certification schemes to mitigate information asymmetry, offering subsidies and insurance to reduce adoption risks, and utilizing environmental taxes to internalize the negative externalities associated with conventional tillage. This research not only provides a dynamic analytical paradigm for the diffusion of green agricultural technologies but also furnishes a theoretical foundation for designing sustainable agricultural policies in developing countries.</description>

      <title>Guaranteed shares of benefits and costs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14198v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A context-free problem of Fair Division is a function W from a profile of n types to a freely transferable amount of surplus W(x) they must share in the common property regime. A pair of tight guarantees assigns to each type an upper and a lower bound on its share under any profile of types of the other agents, and these bounds cannot be improved. The choice of a particular pair of such guarantees when the types and W have an economic interpretation vindicates ony some familiar fair sharing rules, and suggests many new ones. Our examples include the allocation of an indivisible good or bad, the classic model of a commons where types enter additively in the function W, and sharing the cost of a capacity or of the transportation costs to a location on a line.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16898v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a refinement of the maxmin approach to distributional robustness. A mechanism's payoff guarantee over an ambiguity set is robust if the guarantee is approximately satisfied at priors near the ambiguity set (in the weak topology). We show that many maxmin-optimal mechanisms in the literature give payoff guarantees that are not robust. Such mechanisms are often tailored to degenerate worst-case priors, making them simple but fragile. We propose a method of enriching the ambiguity set to include all nearby priors. The associated maxmin-optimal mechanism's payoff guarantee (over this new ambiguity set) is always robust.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15317v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study reputation formation where a long-run player repeatedly observes private signals and takes actions. Short-run players observe the long-run player's past actions but not her past signals. The long-run player can thus develop a reputation for playing a distribution over actions, but not necessarily for playing a particular mapping from signals to actions. Nonetheless, we show that the long-run player can secure her Stackelberg payoff if distinct commitment types are statistically distinguishable and the Stackelberg strategy is confound-defeating. This property holds if and only if the Stackelberg strategy is the unique solution to an optimal transport problem. If the long-run player's payoff is supermodular in one-dimensional signals and actions, she secures the Stackelberg payoff if and only if the Stackelberg strategy is monotone. Applications include deterrence, delegation, signaling, and persuasion. Our results extend to the case where distinct commitment types may be indistinguishable but the Stackelberg type is salient under the prior.</description>

      <title>On the merit principle in strategic exchange</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05678v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: New fairness notions aligned with the merit principle are proposed for designing exchange rules. We show that for an obviously strategy-proof, efficient and individually rational rule, (i) it rewards one with her favorite object whenever others unanimously perceive her object the best, if and only if preferences are single-peaked, and (ii) an upper bound of fairness attainable is that, if two agents possess objects considered the best by all others divided into two equal-size groups, it is guaranteed that one, not both, receives her favorite. This indicates an unambiguous trade-off between incentives and fairness in the design of exchange rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many settings -- like market research and social choice -- people may be presented with unfamiliar options. Classical mechanisms may perform poorly because they fail to incentivize people to learn about these options, or worse, encourage counterproductive information acquisition. We formalize this problem in a model of robust mechanism design where agents find it costly to learn about their values for a product or policy. We identify sharp limits on the designer's ability to elicit, or learn about, these values. Where these limits do not bind, we propose two-stage mechanisms that are detail-free and robust: the second stage is a classical mechanism and the first stage asks participants to predict the results of the second stage.</description>

      <title>Correlated equilibrium implementation: Navigating toward social optima with learning dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03528v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Implementation theory has made significant advances in characterizing which social choice functions can be implemented in Nash equilibrium, but these results typically assume sophisticated strategic reasoning by agents. However, evidence exists to show that agents frequently cannot perform such reasoning. In this paper, we present a finite mechanism which fully implements Maskin-monotonic social choice functions as the outcome of the unique correlated equilibrium of the induced game. Due to the results in Hart and MasColell (2000), this yields that even when agents use a simple adaptive heuristic like regret minimization rather than computing equilibrium strategies, the designer can expect to implement the SCF correctly. We demonstrate the mechanism's effectiveness through simulations in a bilateral trade environment, where agents using regret matching converge to the desired outcomes despite having no knowledge of others' preferences or the equilibrium structure. The mechanism does not use integer games or modulo games.</description>

      <title>Beyond Scalars: Zonotope-Valued Utility for Representation of Multidimensional Incomplete Preferences(Incomplete Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05844v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I propose a new framework for representing multidimensional incomplete preferences through zonotope-valued utilities, addressing the shortcomings of traditional scalar and vector-based models in decision theory. Traditional approaches assign single numerical values to alternatives, failing to capture the complexity of preferences where alternatives remainmain incomparable due to conflicting criteria across multiple dimensions. Our method maps each alternative to a zonotope, a convex geometric object in \(\mathbb{R}^m\) formed by Minkowski sums of intervals, which encapsulates the multidimensional structure of preferences with mathematical rigor. The set-valued nature of these payoffs stems from multiple sources, including non-probabilistic uncertainty, such as imprecise utility evaluation due to incomplete information about criteria weights, and probabilistic uncertainty arising from stochastic decision environments. By decomposing preference relations into interval orders and utilizing an extended set difference operator, we establish a rigorous axiomatization that defines preference as one alternative's zonotope differing from another's within the non-negative orthant of \(\mathbb{R}^m\). This framework generalizes existing representations and provides a visually intuitive and theoretically robust tool for modeling trade-offs among each dimension, while preferences are incomparable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13137v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a model of dynamic monopoly with differentiated goods that buyers can freely dispose of. The model extends the framework of Coasian bargaining to situations in which the quantity or quality of the good is endogenously determined. Our main result is that when players are patient, the seller can sustain in equilibrium any payoff between the lowest possible buyer valuation and (approximately) the highest payoff achievable with commitment power, thus establishing a folk theorem. We apply our model to data markets, where data brokers sell marketing lists to producers. Methodologically, we leverage the connection between sequential bargaining and static mechanism design.</description>

      <title>Analysis Theory of Data Economy: Dataization, Technological Progress and Dynamic General Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper constructs a clean and efficient representative agent model of the data economy from a macroeconomics perspective, in order to analyze the impact of dataization and technological progress on the dynamic general equilibrium of 'consumption-capital', and the catalysis effect of dataization on technological progress. We first set the data in production comes from dataization of the total output of the society and is exponentially functionally related to the technology. Secondly, the data production function is used to solve the optimization problem for firms and households and to construct a dynamic general equilibrium of 'consumption-capital' based on the endogenous interest rate solved by maximizing the returns of firms. Finally, by using numerical simulation and phase diagram analysis, we find that the effects of increasing dataization and encouraging technological progress each exhibit different nonlinear characteristics for equilibrium capital and equilibrium consumption, we thus conclude that dataization enables the positive effects of technological progress on economic development to be more rapid and persistent. We select two types of Chinese policies regarding data openness to represent the role of dataization, and demonstrate the catalysis role of datatization for the development of the digital economy by setting up difference in difference (DID) experiments, which provide persuasive evidence for the theoretical interpretation of the paper.</description>
