      <title>Ptychographic retrieval for complete ultrashort pulse amplitude swing reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrafast experiments require precise temporal characterization of laser pulses, where pulse reconstruction is typically achieved through iterative retrieval algorithms. In this context, the amplitude swing technique has emerged as a robust and versatile tool for measuring scalar and vector pulses, using a compact inline setup. Here, we develop a unified theory of amplitude swing and introduce a ptychographic iterative engine algorithm to retrieve scalar and vector pulses from the different amplitude swing implementations (conventional and generalizing). For scalar pulses, we show the new capability of retrieving both amplitude and phase. The algorithm is validated with simulated and experimental traces of scalar and vector pulses, which are benefited from the new algorithm. In conclusion, a powerful tool for pulse characterization is provided, extending the capabilities of amplitude swing (e.g., to double pulses) and enhancing the ultrafast optics measurement toolkit.</description>

      <title>Heterodyne coherent detection of phase modulation in a mid-infrared unipolar device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13206v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase modulation is demonstrated in a quantum Stark effect modulator designed to operate in the mid-infrared at wavelength around 10 $\mu$m. Both phase and amplitude modulation are simultaneously resolved through the measurement of the heterodyne signal arising from the beating of a quantum cascade laser with a highly stabilized frequency comb. The highest measured phase shift is more than 5 degrees with an associated intensity modulation of 5%. The experimental results are in full agreement with our model in which the complex susceptibility is precisely described considering the linear voltage dependent Stark shift of the optical resonance.</description>

      <title>High dimensional spatiotemporal toroidal light beams with arbitrary polarization and orientation through a multimode fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate high-dimensional, polarization-resolved, 3D spatiotemporal toroidal beams delivered through a multimode optical fiber (MMF). Our approach leverages advanced spectral and spatial shaping techniques, combined with full polarization control, to achieve precise manipulation of the amplitude, phase, and polarization of toroidal beams. These beams feature highly customizable 3D geometries, allowing independent control of their aspect ratio and orientation. We demonstrate the ability to deliver complex toroidal beams directly at the multimode fiber output, enabling beam rotations about any 3D spatiotemporal axis and the generation of beams with specific orbital angular momentum orientations. Our work establishes a platform for creating and delivering arbitrary toroidal beams, offering new tools for exploring light-matter interactions and pushing the boundaries of ultrafast photonics science and technology.</description>

      <title>Stabilization and Destabilization of Multimode Solitons in Nonlinear Degenerate Multi-Pass Cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical solitons in multimode nonlinear optical systems offer a unique platform for exploring the interplay of nonlinearity, dispersion, and spatial mode coupling, offering insights into complex nonlinear wave phenomena. Multi-pass cavities (MPCs) incorporating nonlinear Kerr media serve as prototypical systems, enabling high-efficiency supercontinuum generation and pulse compression. However, stabilizing femtosecond laser pulses in solid-medium-based MPCs (solid MPCs) under high Kerr nonlinearity remains a significant challenge due to multimode coupling, which disrupts beam stability. In this work, we address this challenge by investigating the stability of laser pulses in MPCs using Floquet analysis and first-order perturbation theory. We identify novel mode-coupling-suppression (MCS) medium lengths, where destructive interference among multimode wave components suppresses coupling and facilitates soliton stabilization. Under MCS conditions, we demonstrate stable beam propagation in solid MPCs with nonlinear phases up to 1.85{\pi} per pass, achieving 10-fold pulse compression with exceptional spatio-spectral homogeneity. Our findings offer valuable guidance for designing advanced MPCs with tailored Kerr media.</description>

      <title>Communicating at a record 14.5 bits per received photon through a photon-starved channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exploration of the Universe requires communication with Earth, either on a direct path or through a cascade of proximate celestial bodies. Microwaves have traditionally been used for space communication, but electromagnetic waves of higher frequencies, such as in the optical domain, will enable probing farther in space due to their considerably lower diffraction loss. At a given data rate, the ultimate limit to point-to-point optical communication is determined by the received signal power and the photon information efficiency. The latter measures the number of information bits extracted per photon incident on a detector. As distances across space and, consequently, path loss increases, the system that can achieve the highest photon information efficiency will determine the longest distance at which communication is possible. We report here an experimental demonstration of optical detection at a record photon information efficiency of 14.5 bits per incident photon, or 17.8 bits per detected photon, after 87.5 dB of attenuation. Expressed in terms of energy per bit, this corresponds to 8.84 zeptojoules per bit, or 0.069 photons per bit at 1550 nm. To our knowledge, this is the highest photon information efficiency or lowest energy per bit detection system ever demonstrated at optical frequencies. Such a sensitive detection system holds promise for a wide range of applications.</description>

      <title>Algebraic skin effect in two-dimensional non-Hermitian metamaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metamaterials have unlocked unprecedented control over light by leveraging novel mechanisms to expand their functionality. Non-Hermitian physics further enhances the tunability of non-Hermitian metamaterials (NHMs) through phenomena such as the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), enabling applications like directional amplification. The higher-dimensional NHSE manifests unique effects, including the algebraic skin effect (ASE), which features power-law decay instead of exponential localization, allowing for quasi-long-range interactions. In this work, we establish apparent criteria for achieving ASE in two-dimensional reciprocal NHMs with anisotropic and complex dielectric tensors. By numerically and theoretically demonstrating ASE through mismatched optical axes and geometric structures, we reveal that ASE is governed by a generalized Fermi surface whose dimensionality exceeds that of the Fermi surface. We further propose and validate a realistic photonic crystal design for ASE, which is experimentally accessible. Our recipe for ASE provides a versatile pathway for broader generalizations, including three-dimensional structures, synthetic dimensions, and other classical wave systems, paving the way for advancements in non-Hermitian photonics.</description>

      <title>A simplified method for full-wave simulation of metamaterials: utilizing near-field decoupling technology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the electromagnetic properties of large-scale, complex metamaterial structures demands significant time and memory resources. If these large-scale structures can be divided into smaller, simpler components, the overall cost of studying all the smaller structures could be much lower than directly simulating the entire structure. Unfortunately, decoupling complex structures has been challenging due to the unclear mechanisms of near-field coupling in metamaterials. In this paper, we identify that the key to understanding near-field coupling in metamaterials lies in evanescent wave interactions, which can be captured through full-wave simulations. Our findings suggest that by accounting for the influence of evanescent waves, it becomes possible to analytically decouple and then recouple structures, even when the types of metamaterial structures vary. Building on this insight, we successfully decomposed complex structures into multiple groups of simpler components. By studying these simpler components, the electromagnetic properties of the entire structure can be calculated analytically. This decoupling method dramatically reduces the computation time or memory required for research into the electromagnetic properties of metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Tailoring on-axis spectral density with circularly coherent light beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The on-axis cross-spectral density (CSD) of a beam radiated by a stationary source with a circular coherence state and a Gaussian spectral density is obtained in the closed form. It is revealed that the on-axis CSD is expressed via the Laplace transform of the source's degree of coherence or the Hilbert transform of the corresponding pseudo-mode weighting function. Such relations enable efficient tailoring of the on-axis spectral density, as we show with a slew of numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Partially coherent electromagnetic sources with cylindrical symmetry and infinite extent radiating outwards are introduced. Their 3x3 cross-spectral density matrix is given through expansions of the field components in terms of basis functions related to the Hankel functions. The spectral density and the three-dimensional degree of polarization of such sources and the fields they radiate are examined. Several examples are presented and discussed. Among them, a class of cylindrical sources whose coherent vector modes coincide with the above basis functions is defined and studied.</description>

      <title>Funnelling super-resolution STED microscopy through multimode fibres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Holographic multimode fibre endoscopes have recently shown their ability to unveil and monitor deep brain structures with sub-micrometre resolution, establishing themselves as a minimally-invasive technology with promising applications in neurobiology. In this approach, holographic control of the input light field entering the multimode fibres is achieved by means of wavefront shaping, usually treating the fibre as a complex medium. In contrast to other unpredictable and highly scattering complex media, multimode fibres feature symmetries and strong correlations between their input and output fields. Both step-index and graded-index multimode fibres offer a specific set of such correlations which, when appropriately leveraged, enable generating high-quality focused pulses with minimal intermodal dispersion. With this, we funnelled pulsed super-resolution STED microscopy with time-gated detection through a custom multimode fibre probe, combining the correlations of both multimode fibre types. We demonstrate resolution improvements over 3-times beyond the diffraction limit and showcase its applicability in bioimaging. This work provides not only a solution for delivering short pulses through step-index multimode fibre segments but also marks a step towards bringing advanced super-resolution imaging techniques with virtually no depth limitations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13574v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The degree of coherence and the intensity distribution on the axis of the beam radiated by a planar partially coherent source of the Schell-model type are investigated. We present an expression for the on-axis cross-spectral density which is valid for a very general Schell-model source, with the only constraint that the intensity distribution across the source is Gaussian. Furthermore, we show that such an expression takes very simple analytical forms for several commonly used degrees of coherence of the source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The work shows that visualization using microparticles allows one to distinguish objects that are inaccessible during direct observation. This analysis is based on a full two-dimensional simulation of optical image formation taking into account the diffraction of partially coherent light on the microparticle and the objects under study. The oscillating nature of optical resolution is shown depending on the size of the microparticle. The presence of strong resonances is shown in both transmission and reflection modes.</description>

      <title>Rapid wavefront shaping using an optical gradient acquisition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wavefront shaping systems aim to image deep into scattering tissue by reshaping incoming and outgoing light to correct aberrations caused by tissue inhomogeneity However, the desired modulation depends on the unknown tissue structure and therefore its estimation is a challenging time-consuming task. Most strategies rely on coordinate descent optimization, which sequentially varies each modulation parameter and assesses its impact on the resulting image. We propose a rapid wavefront shaping scheme that transitions from coordinate descent to gradient descent optimization, using the same measurement to update all modulation parameters simultaneously. To achieve this, we have developed an analytical framework that expresses the gradient of the wavefront shaping score with respect to all modulation parameters. Although this gradient depends on the unknown tissue structure, we demonstrate how it can be inferred from the optical system's measurements. Our new framework enables rapid inference of wavefront shaping modulations. Additionally, since the complexity of our algorithm does not scale with the number of modulation parameters, we can achieve very high-resolution modulations, leading to better corrections in thicker tissue layers. We showcase the effectiveness of our framework in correcting aberrations in a coherent confocal microscope.</description>

      <title>High-intensity wave vortices around subwavelength holes: from ocean tides to nanooptics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vortices are ubiquitous in nature; they appear in a variety of phenomena ranging from galaxy formation in astrophysics to topological defects in quantum fluids. In particular, wave vortices have attracted enormous attention and found applications in optics, acoustics, electron microscopy, etc. Such vortices carry quantized phase singularities accompanied by zero intensity in the center, and quantum-like orbital angular momentum, with the minimum localization scale of the wavelength. Here we describe a conceptually novel type of wave vortices, which can appear around arbitrarily small `holes' (i.e., excluded areas or defects) in a homogeneous 2D plane. Such vortices are characterized by high intensity and confinement at the edges of the hole and hence subwavelength localization of the angular momentum. We demonstrate the appearance of such vortices in: (i) optical near fields around metallic nanodiscs on a dielectric substrate, (ii) phonon-polariton fields around nanoholes in a polaritonic slab, and (iii) ocean tidal waves around islands of New Zealand and Madagascar. We also propose a simple toy model of the generation of such subwavelength vortices via the interference of a point-dipole source and a plane wave, where the vortex sign is controlled by the mutual phase between these waves. Our findings open avenues for subwavelength vortex/angular-momentum-based applications in various wave fields.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of performance limitation of computational refocusing in optical coherence tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-numerical-aperture optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables sub-cellular imaging but faces a trade-off between lateral resolution and depth of focus. Computational refocusing can correct defocus in Fourier-domain OCT, yet its limitations remain unaddressed theoretically. We model the pupil-based lateral imaging process to analyze defocus and the constraints of computational refocusing in point-scanning OCT and spatially-coherent full-field OCT (FFOCT). The maximum correctable defocus (MCD) is primarily limited by confocality in point-scanning OCT, while spatially-coherent FFOCT has no such constraint, achieving virtually infinite MCD. This makes spatially-coherent FFOCT particularly suitable for optical coherence microscopy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven developments in lensless imaging, such as machine learning-based reconstruction algorithms, require large datasets. In this work, we introduce a data acquisition pipeline that can capture from multiple lensless imaging systems in parallel, under the same imaging conditions, and paired with computational ground truth registration. We provide an open-access 25,000 image dataset with two lensless imagers, a reproducible hardware setup, and open-source camera synchronization code. Experimental datasets from our system can enable data-driven developments in lensless imaging, such as machine learning-based reconstruction algorithms and end-to-end system design.</description>

      <title>Liquid Metal-Exfoliated SnO$_2$-Based Mixed-dimensional Heterostructures for Visible-to-Near-Infrared Photodetection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultra-thin two-dimensional (2D) materials have gained significant attention for making next-generation optoelectronic devices. Here, we report a large-area heterojunction photodetector fabricated using a liquid metal-printed 2D $\text{SnO}_2$ layer transferred onto CdTe thin films. The resulting device demonstrates efficient broadband light sensing from visible to near-infrared wavelengths, with enhanced detectivity and faster photo response than bare CdTe photodetectors. Significantly, the device shows a nearly $10^5$-fold increase in current than the dark current level when illuminated with a 780 nm laser and achieves a specific detectivity of around $10^{12} \, \text{Jones}$, nearly two orders of magnitude higher than a device with pure CdTe thin film. Additionally, temperature-dependent optoelectronic testing shows that the device maintains a stable response up to $140^\circ \text{C}$ and generates distinctive photocurrent at temperatures up to $80^\circ \text{C}$, demonstrating its thermal stability. Using band structure analysis, density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and photocurrent mapping, the formation of a $p$-$n$ junction is indicated, contributing to the enhanced photo response attributed to the efficient carrier separation by the built-in potential in the hetero-junction and the superior electron mobility of 2D $\text{SnO}_2$. Our results highlight the effectiveness of integrating liquid metal-exfoliated 2D materials for enhanced photodetector performance.</description>

      <title>Optically and remotely controlling localization of exciton polariton condensates in a potential lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03625v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Exciton polaritons are inherently tunable systems with adjustable potential landscape. In this work we show that exciton polariton condensates can be selectively localized in a fixed optically induced periodic lattice with uniform potential depth, by judiciously controlling a second focused pump of very small size away from the lattice chain. Specifically, the localized polariton condensate can be tuned among different potential traps by adjusting the relative distance between the small pump spot and the potential lattice. The adjustment of the excitation position of the smaller pump spot and its combination with the fixed larger pump spot for the potential creation induce the mode selection determined by gain profile, group velocity, and potential distribution within the system. The localization of the exciton polariton condensate and its control are independent of the orientation of the potential lattice, thus, even in slightly disordered system, one can selectively excite such localized polariton condensates. Our results illuminate a path to the remote manipulation of exciton polariton bosonic condensates in fixed integrated photonic chips and circuits.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of a solely acoustic-wave-driven light amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Brillouin and Raman lasers, light is amplified by an input pump light through the excited acoustic and molecular oscillations in a medium. However, can medium oscillations alone amplify light in a realistic photonic circuit? Here, we demonstrate that modulating an optical resonator by a traveling wave having the frequency and phase velocity much smaller than the frequency and phase velocity of light can result in dramatically large light amplification accompanied with conversion to multiple comb lines within a relatively small frequency band. Our calculations show that the proposed light amplifier can be realized in a lithium niobate racetrack resonator with millimeter-scale perimeter modulated by a surface acoustic wave with a surprisingly small amplitude and with the propagation constant satisfying the Brillouin phase matching condition.</description>

      <title>Inverse Spin Thermal Hall Effect in Non-Reciprocal Photonic Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.15691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A transverse radiative heat flux induced by the gradient of spin angular momentum of photons in non-reciprocal systems is predicted. This thermal analog of the inverse spin Hall effect is analyzed in magneto-optical networks exhibiting C4 symmetry, under the action of spatially variable external magnetic fields. This finding opens new avenues for thermal management and energy conversion with non-reciprocal systems through a localized and dynamic control of the spin angular momentum of light.</description>

      <title>Nonreciprocal metasurfaces with epsilon-near-zero materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal optics enables asymmetric transmission of light when its sources and detectors are exchanged. A canonical example -- optical isolator -- enables light propagation in only one direction, similar to how electrical diodes enable unidirectional flow of electric current. Nonreciprocal optics today, unlike nonreciprocal electronics, remains bulky. Recently, nonlinear metasurfaces opened up a pathway to strong optical nonreciprocity at the nanoscale. However, demonstrations to date were based on optically slow nonlinearities involving thermal effects or phase transition materials. In this work, we demonstrate a nonreciprocal metasurface with an ultra-fast optical response based on indium tin oxide in its epsilon-near-zero regime. It operates in the spectral range of 1200-1300 nm with incident power densities of 40-70 GW/cm$^2$. Furthermore, the nonreciprocity of the metasurface extends to both amplitude and phase of the forward/backward transmission opening a pathway to nonreciprocal wavefront control at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>Impact of polarization mode dispersion on entangled photon distribution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Polarization mode dispersion (PMD) in optical fibers poses a major challenge for maintaining the fidelity of quantum states for quantum communications. In this work, a comprehensive model linking the probability of quantum measurement errors (infidelity) to PMD is developed and validated by experimental measurements of differential group delay and quantum bit error rate (QBER). Our research proposes effective methods to mitigate PMD effects for broadband entangled photons and evaluates the impact of higher-order PMD effects. The model provides an experimentally verified framework for the optimization of commercial quantum key distribution systems in deployed fiber optic lines.</description>

      <title>State Transfer in Latent-Symmetric Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12185v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The transport of quantum states is a crucial aspect of information processing systems, facilitating operations such as quantum key distribution and inter-component communication within quantum computers. Most quantum networks rely on symmetries to achieve an efficient state transfer. A straightforward way to design such networks is to use spatial symmetries, which severely limits the design space. Our work takes a novel approach to designing photonic networks that do not exhibit any conventional spatial symmetries, yet nevertheless support an efficient transfer of quantum states. Paradoxically, while a perfect transfer efficiency is technically unattainable in these networks, a fidelity arbitrarily close to unity is always reached within a finite time of evolution. Key to this approach are so-called latent, or 'hidden', symmetries, which are embodied in the spectral properties of the network. Latent symmetries substantially expand the design space of quantum networks and hold significant potential for applications in quantum cryptography and secure state transfer. We experimentally realize such a nine-site latent-symmetric network and successfully observe state transfer between two sites with a measured fidelity of 75%. Furthermore, by launching a two-photon state, we show that quantum interference is preserved by the network. This demonstrates that the latent symmetries enable efficient quantum state transfer, while offering greater flexibility in designing quantum networks.</description>
