      <title>On generic representations of quasi-split reductive groups over local fields of positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ be a locally compact non-Archimedean field, and $\bf G$ a connected quasi-split reductive group over $F$. We are interested in complex irreducible smooth generic representations $\pi$ of ${\bf G}(F)$. When $F$ has positive characteristic, we prove important properties which previously were only available for $F$ of characteristic 0. The first one is the tempered $L$-function conjecture of Shahidi, stating that when $\pi$ as above is tempered, then the $L$-functions attached to $\pi$ by the Langlands-Shahidi method have no pole for ${\rm Re}(s)&gt;0$. We also establish the standard module conjecture of Casselman and Shahidi, saying that if $\pi$ is written as the Langlands quotient of a standard module, then it is in fact the full standard module. Finally, for a split classical group $\bf G$ we prove a useful result on the unramified unitary spectrum of ${\bf G}(F)$.</description>

      <title>Irreducible representations of certain nilpotent groups of finite rank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper we study irreducible representations of some nilpotent groups of finite abelian total rank. The main result of the paper states that if a torsion-free minimax group $G$ of nilpotency class 2 admits a faithful irreducible representation $\varphi $ over a finitely generated field $k$ such that $chark \notin Sp(G)$ then there exist a subgroup $N$ and an irreducible primitive representation $\psi $ of the subgroup $N$ over $k$ such that the representation $\varphi $ is induced from $\psi $ and the quotient group $N/Ker\psi $ is finitely generated.</description>

      <title>The character values of Iwahori--Hecke algebras on Coxeter basis elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: These are unpublished notes from about 1992-1993 which, retrospectively, may be regarded as a complement to Lusztig's recent paper on the trace of Coxeter elements. Our notes include explicit tables for those traces. The proofs rely on a connection with Lusztig's work on Coxeter orbits and eigenspaces of Frobenius, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Semi-derived Ringel-Hall bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal{A}$ be an arbitrary hereditary abelian category. Lu and Peng defined the semi-derived Ringel-Hall algebra $SH(\mathcal{A})$ of $\mathcal{A}$ and proved that $SH(\mathcal{A})$ has a natural basis and is isomorphic to the Drinfeld double Ringel-Hall algebra of $\mathcal{A}$. In this paper, we introduce a coproduct formula on $SH(\mathcal{A})$ with respect to the basis of $SH(\mathcal{A})$ and prove that this coproduct is compatible with the product of $SH(\mathcal{A})$, thereby the semi-derived Ringel-Hall algebra of $\mathcal{A}$ is endowed with a bialgebra structure which is identified with the bialgebra structure of the Drinfeld double Ringel-Hall algebra of $\mathcal{A}$.</description>

      <title>The Langlands formula and perverse sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a complex reductive Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ with Cartan subalgebra $\mathfrak{h}$ and Weyl group $W$ we consider the category $\text{Perv}(W \backslash \mathfrak{h})$ of perverse sheaves on $W \backslash \mathfrak{h}$ smooth w.r.t. the natural stratification. We construct a category $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ such that $\text{Perv}(W\backslash \mathfrak{h})$ is identified with the category of functors from $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ to vector spaces. Objects of $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ are labelled by standard parabolic subalgebras in $\mathfrak{g}$. It has morphisms analogous to the operations of parabolic induction (Eisenstein series) and restriction (constant term) of automorphic forms. In particular, the Langlands formula for the constant term of an Eisenstein series has a counterpart in the form of an identity in $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$. We define $\boldsymbol{\mathcal{C}}$ as the category of $W$-invariants (in an appropriate sense) in the category $Q$ describing perverse sheaves on $\mathfrak{h}$ smooth w.r.t. the root arrangement. This matches, in an interesting way, the definition of $W \backslash \mathfrak{h}$ itself as the spectrum of the algebra of $W$-invariants.</description>

      <title>Geometric invariant theory and stretched Kostka quasi-polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For $G$ a simple, simply-connected complex algebraic group and two dominant integral weights $\lambda, \mu$, we consider the dimensions of weight spaces $V_\lambda(\mu)$ of weight $\mu$ in the irreducible, finite-dimensional highest weight $\lambda$ representation. For natural numbers $N$, the function $N \mapsto \dim V_{N\lambda}(N\mu)$ is quasi-polynomial in $N$, the stretched Kostka quasi-polynomial. Using methods of geometric invariant theory (GIT), we compute the degree of this quasi-polynomial, resolving a conjecture of Gao and Gao. We also discuss periods of this quasi-polynomial determined by the GIT approach, and give computational evidence supporting a geometric determination of the minimal period.</description>

      <title>Character of Irreducible Representations Restricted to Finite Order Elements -- An Asymptotic Formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected reductive group over the complex numbers and let $T\subset G$ be a maximal torus. For any $t\in T$ of finite order and any irreducible representation $V(\lambda)$ of $G$ of highest weight $\lambda$, we determine the character $ch(t, V(\lambda))$ by using the Lefschetz Trace Formula due to Atiyah-Singer and explicitly determining the connected components and their normal bundles of the fixed point subvariety $(G/P)^t\subset G/P$ (for any parabolic subgroup $P$). This together with Wirtinger's theorem gives an asymptotic formula for $ch(t, V(n\lambda))$ when $n$ goes to infinity.</description>

      <title>$q$-Whittaker polynomials: bases, branching and direct limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $q$-Whittaker polynomials and their monomial expansions given by the fermionic formula, the inv statistic of Haglund-Haiman-Loehr and the quinv statistic of Ayyer-Mandelshtam-Martin. The combinatorial models underlying these expansions are partition overlaid patterns and column strict fillings. The former model is closely tied to representations of the affine Lie algebra $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_n}$ and admits projections, branching maps and direct limits that mirror these structures in the Chari-Loktev basis of local Weyl modules. We formulate novel versions of these notions in the column strict fillings model and establish their main properties. We construct weight-preserving bijections between the models which are compatible with projection, branching and direct limits. We also establish connections to the coloured lattice paths formalism for $q$-Whittaker polynomials due to Wheeler and collaborators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00583v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a procedure for generating the irreducible representations of crystallography groups in any dimension. We also furnish a strategy to investigate the topology of the unitary dual of a crystallography group using sequences of matrices. All irreducible representations (up to unitary equivalence) of the dimension 3 crystallography group 90 and some calculations involving sequences of these irreducible representations are included as a proof of concept of this procedure and strategy.</description>

      <title>Uniformly dominant local rings and Orlov spectra of singularity categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define a uniformly dominant local ring as a commutative noetherian local ring with an integer r such that the residue field is built from any nonzero object in the singularity category by direct summands, shifts and at most r mapping cones. We find sufficient conditions for uniform dominance, by which we show Burch rings and local rings with quasi-decomposable maximal ideal are uniformly dominant. For a uniformly dominant excellent equicharacteristic isolated singularity, we get an upper bound of the Orlov spectrum of the singularity category. We prove uniform dominance is preserved under basic operations, and give techniques to construct uniformly dominant local rings. An application of our methods to local rings with decomposable maximal ideal is provided as well.</description>

      <title>An application of collapsing levels to the representation theory of affine vertex algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.09880</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.09880v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discover a large class of simple affine vertex algebras $V_{k} (\mathfrak g)$, associated to basic Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak g$ at non-admissible collapsing levels $k$, having exactly one irreducible $\mathfrak g$-locally finite module in the category ${\mathcal O}$. In the case when $\mathfrak g$ is a Lie algebra, we prove a complete reducibility result for $V_k(\mathfrak g)$-modules at an arbitrary collapsing level. We also determine the generators of the maximal ideal in the universal affine vertex algebra $V^k (\mathfrak g)$ at certain negative integer levels. Considering some conformal embeddings in the simple affine vertex algebras $V_{-1/2} (C_n)$ and $V_{-4}(E_7)$, we surprisingly obtain the realization of non-simple affine vertex algebras of types $B$ and $D$ having exactly one non-trivial ideal.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the representations of some simple affine vertex algebras at non-admissible level arising from rank one 4D SCFTs. In particular, we classify the irreducible highest weight modules of $L_{-2}(G_2)$ and $L_{-2}(B_3)$. It is known by the works of Adamovi\'{c} and Per\v{s}e that these vertex algebras can be conformally embedded into $L_{-2}(D_4)$. We also compute the associated variety of $L_{-2}(G_2)$, and show that it is the orbifold of the associated variety of $L_{-2}(D_4)$ by the symmetric group of degree 3 which is the Dynkin diagram automorphism group of $D_4$. This provides a new interesting example of associated variety satisfying a number of conjectures in the context of orbifold vertex algebras.</description>

      <title>Hesselink strata in small characteristic and Lusztig-Xue pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21469v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic $p\ge 0$ and $\mathfrak{g}={\rm Lie}(G)$. We show that the nilpotent pieces ${\rm LX}(\Delta)$ introduced by Lusztig coincide with the corresponding Hesselink strata $\mathcal{H}(\Delta)$ and hence form a partition of the nilpotent cone of $\mathfrak{g}$. Similar results are obtained for the unipotent pieces of $G$. Here $\Delta$ runs through the set of all weighted Dynkin diagrams of $G$. Thanks to the results obtained by Lusztig, Xue and Voggesberger this boils down to establishing the partition property of the pieces ${\rm LX}(\Delta)$ for groups of type ${\rm E_7}$ in characteristic $2$ and for groups of type ${\rm E_8}$ in characteristic $2$ and $3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.05888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the category of linear relations over an arbitrary commutative ring, and identify it as a subcategory of the category of Kronecker representations. We observe that this subcategory forms a definable, faithful and hereditary torsion-free class. We also generalise results used in the functorial filtrations method, known before only in case the ground ring is a field. In particular, our results strictly generalise what the so-called the `covering' and `splitting' properties from this method.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01420</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.01420v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper undertakes a study of the structure of the fibers of the Chevalley exponentiation maps $f_{(i_1,\dots ,i_d)}$. The fibers of these maps $f_{(i_1,\dots ,i_d)}$ encode the nonnegative real relations amongst exponentiated Chevalley generators. Our main theorems show that the fibers admit cell stratifications, that these cell stratifications have the same face posets as interior dual block complexes of subword complexes, and that these posets are contractible.
  We conjecture that each such fiber is a regular CW complex homeomorphic to the interior dual block complex of a subword complex. This conjecture is shown to have as a corollary a new proof of the Fomin-Shapiro Conjecture by way of general topological results regarding approximating maps by homeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Representation theory of topological full groups of \'etale groupoids and paradoxicality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:1912.10767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a unified treatment of several results concerning full groups of ample groupoids and paradoxical decompositions attached to them. This includes a criterion for the full group of an ample groupoid being amenable as well as comparison of its orbit, Koopman and groupoid-left-regular representations. Besides that, we unify several recent results about paradoxicality in semigroups and groupoids, relating embeddings of Thompson's group V into full groups of ample \'etale groupoids.</description>

      <title>Tight frames over the quaternions and equiangular lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.06126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2006.06126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that much of the theory of finite tight frames can be generalised to vector spaces over the quaternions. This includes the variational characterisation, group frames, and the characterisations of projective and unitary equivalence. We are particularly interested in sets of equiangular lines (equi-isoclinic subspaces) and the groups associated with them, and how to move them between the spaces $\Rd$, $\Cd$ and $\Hd$. We discuss what the analogue of Zauner's conjecture for equiangular lines in $\Hd$ might be.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Rational Conformal Field Theories in Small Genera, Chiral Fermionization, and Symmetry/Subalgebra Duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16921v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A (1+1)D unitary bosonic rational conformal field theory (RCFT) may be organized according to its genus, a tuple $(c,\mathscr{C})$ consisting of its central charge $c$ and a unitary modular tensor category $\mathscr{C}$ which describes the (2+1)D topological quantum field theory (TQFT) for which its maximally extended chiral algebra forms a holomorphic boundary condition. We establish a number of results pertaining to RCFTs in "small" genera, by which we informally mean genera with the central charge $c$ and the number of primary operators rank$(\mathscr{C})$ both not too large. We start by completely solving the modular bootstrap problem for theories with at most four primary operators. In particular, we characterize, and provide an algorithm which efficiently computes, the function spaces to which the partition function of any bosonic RCFT with rank$(\mathscr{C})\leq 4$ must belong. Using this result, and leveraging relationships between RCFTs and holomorphic vertex operator algebras which come from "gluing" and cosets, we rigorously enumerate all bosonic theories in $95$ of the $105$ genera $(c,\mathscr{C})$ with $c\leq 24$ and rank$(\mathscr{C})\leq 4$. This includes as (new) special cases the classification of chiral algebras with three primaries and $c&lt;120/7\sim 17.14$, and the classification of chiral algebras with four primaries and $c&lt;62/3\sim 20.67$. We then study two applications of our classification. First, by making use of chiral versions of bosonization and fermionization, we obtain the complete list of purely left-moving fermionic RCFTs with $c&lt;23$ as a corollary of the results of the previous paragraph. Second, using a (conjectural) concept which we call "symmetry/subalgebra duality," we precisely relate our bosonic classification to the problem of determining certain generalized global symmetries of holomorphic vertex operator algebras.</description>

Abstract: For an odd prime $p$, we explore some connections between the cohomology algebra $H^*(BPU{p^m};\mathbb{F}_p)$ and the subrings of the polynomial ring $\mathbb{F}_p[\xi_1,\eta_1,\cdots,\xi_l,\eta_l]$ that are invariant under some $Sp_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_p)$-action and $GL_{2m}(\mathbb{F}_p)$-action.</description>

      <title>Notes on a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the previous paper, we constructed a homomorphism from the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the standard degreewise completion of the affine Yangian associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1)$. In this article, by using this homomorphism, we construct homomorphisms from the affine Yangian to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$, which are different from the one in the previous paper. We also show that this homomorphism is related to the one from the quantum affine algebra associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n)$ to the quantum affine algebra associated with $\widehat{\mathfrak{sl}}(n+1)$ given by Li. Based on this result, we discuss a new definition of the affine shifted Yangian, from which it is expected that there exists a homomorphism to the universal enveloping algebra of a non-rectangular $W$-algebra of type $A$.</description>

      <title>On diagonal digraphs, Koszul algebras and triangulations of homology spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04748v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The article is devoted to the magnitude homology of digraphs, with a primary focus on diagonal digraphs, i.e., digraphs whose magnitude homology is concentrated on the diagonal. For any digraph $G$, we provide a complete description of the second magnitude homology ${\rm MH}_{2,k}(G)$. This allows us to define a combinatorial condition, denoted by $(\mathcal{V}_\ell)$, which is equivalent to the vanishing of ${\rm MH}_{2,k}(G, \mathbb{Z})$ for all $k &gt; \ell$. In particular, diagonal digraphs satisfy $(\mathcal{V}_2)$. As a corollary, we obtain that the 2-dimensional CW-complex obtained from a diagonal undirected graph by attaching 2-cells to all squares and triangles of the graph is simply connected. We also give an interpretation of diagonality in terms of Koszul algebras: a digraph $G$ is diagonal if and only if the distance algebra $\sigma G$ is Koszul for any ground field, and if and only if $G$ satisfies $(\mathcal{V}_2)$ and the path cochain algebra $\Omega^\bullet(G)$ is Koszul for any ground field. To provide a source of examples of digraphs, we study the extended Hasse diagram $\hat G_K$ of a pure simplicial complex $K$. For a triangulation $K$ of a topological manifold $M$, we express the non-diagonal part of the magnitude homology of $\hat G_K$ in terms of the homology of $M$. As a corollary, we obtain that if $K$ is a triangulation of a closed manifold $M$, then $\hat G_K$ is diagonal if and only if $M$ is a homology sphere.</description>

      <title>Unified Universality Theorem for Deep and Shallow Joint-Group-Equivariant Machines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13682v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a constructive universal approximation theorem for learning machines equipped with joint-group-equivariant feature maps, called the joint-equivariant machines, based on the group representation theory. "Constructive" here indicates that the distribution of parameters is given in a closed-form expression known as the ridgelet transform. Joint-group-equivariance encompasses a broad class of feature maps that generalize classical group-equivariance. Particularly, fully-connected networks are not group-equivariant but are joint-group-equivariant. Our main theorem also unifies the universal approximation theorems for both shallow and deep networks. Until this study, the universality of deep networks has been shown in a different manner from the universality of shallow networks, but our results discuss them on common ground. Now we can understand the approximation schemes of various learning machines in a unified manner. As applications, we show the constructive universal approximation properties of four examples: depth-$n$ joint-equivariant machine, depth-$n$ fully-connected network, depth-$n$ group-convolutional network, and a new depth-$2$ network with quadratic forms whose universality has not been known.</description>
