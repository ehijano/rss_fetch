      <title>Spectre operator, achievement sets and sets of P-sums in a hyperspace of compact sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(X,+,d)$ be an Abelian metric group and $A\subset X$. We investigate the spectre of a set $A$, defined as the set of all elements $z\in X$ such that for every $x\in A$ either $x+z \in A$ or $x-z \in A$. We consider the corresponding to this notion operator $S$ acting on the hyperspace of compact sets and examine its properties. Furthermore, we study the families of achievement sets and sets of $P$-sums in this hyperspace, as well as prove some properties of achievement sets in the plane.</description>

      <title>Measuring Asymptotic Convergence: A Unified Framework from Isotropic Infinity to Anisotropic Ends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a unified approach to defining a point at infinity for an arbitrary space and formalizing convergence to this point. Central to our work is a method to quantify and classify the rates at which functions approach their limits at infinity. Our framework applies to various settings (metric spaces, topological spaces, directed sets, measure spaces) by introducing an exhaustion of the space via an associated exhaustion function h. Using h, we adjoin an ideal point \omega_A to the space A and define convergence a \to \omega_A in a manner intrinsic to A. To measure convergence rates, we introduce a family of parameterized norms, denoted ||f||_{\infty,h,p}, which provides a refined classification of asymptotic behavior (e.g., distinguishing rates of order O(h^{-p})). Furthermore, the framework is extended to handle anisotropic spaces with multiple distinct ends by introducing a 'multi-exhaustion' formalism, allowing for a precise, directional analysis of convergence rates towards each asymptotic channel. This approach allows for a distinction between the global convergence captured by the norm and the purely asymptotic behavior at infinity, which can be analyzed via the limit superior of the convergence ratio. We further investigate the theoretical limits of this measure by establishing sufficient conditions (such as monotonicity) under which a finite norm guarantees convergence. The framework is shown to recover classical results, such as the Alexandroff one-point compactification and standard definitions of limits, while also providing a richer quantitative structure. Examples in each context are provided to illustrate the concepts.</description>

      <title>Euclidean-type algorithm for functions with same or similar origin</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12064v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Maps $f,g\colon X\to X$ are called kin if they are forward iterates of the same map $\varphi\colon X\to X$, up to a composition with a commuting homeomorphism. Kin form an important class of commuting maps on $X$. In this paper, we characterize kin, and give an Euclidean-type algorithm which tests when two maps $f,g\colon X\to X$ are kin. Furthermore, we compute the topological entropy of diagonal maps induced by commuting diagonal kin diagrams.</description>

      <title>Characterizing $ (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}) $-syndetic, $ (\mathcal{F}, \mathcal{G}) $-thick, and related notions of size using derived sets along ultrafilters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We characterize relative notions of syndetic and thick sets using, what we call, "derived" sets along ultrafilters. Manipulations of derived sets is a characteristic feature of algebra in the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification and its applications. Combined with the existence of idempotents and structure of the smallest ideal in closed subsemigroups of the Stone-\v{C}ch compactification, our particular use of derived sets adapt and generalize methods recently used by Griffin arXiv:2311.09436 to characterize relative piecewise syndetic sets. As an application, we define an algebraically interesting subset of the Stone-\v{C}ech compactification and show, in some ways, it shares structural properties analogous to the smallest ideal.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous actions on cones, joins, and $n$-universal bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10784v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that locally countably-compact Hausdorff topological groups $\mathbb{G}$ act continuously on their iterated joins $E_n\mathbb{G}:=\mathbb{G}^{*(n+1)}$ (the total spaces of the Milnor-model $n$-universal $\mathbb{G}$-bundles) as well as the colimit-topologized unions $E\mathbb{G}=\varinjlim_n E_n\mathbb{G}$, and the converse holds under the assumption that $\mathbb{G}$ is first-countable. In the latter case other mutually equivalent conditions provide characterizations of local countable compactness: the fact that $\mathbb{G}$ acts continuously on its first self-join $E_1\mathbb{G}$, or on its cone $\mathcal{C}\mathbb{G}$, or the coincidence of the product and quotient topologies on $\mathbb{G}\times \mathcal{C}X$ for all spaces $X$ or, equivalently, for the discrete countably-infinite $X:=\aleph_0$. These can all be regarded as weakened versions of $\mathbb{G}$'s exponentiability, all to the effect that $\mathbb{G}\times -$ preserves certain colimit shapes in the category of topological spaces; the results thus extend the equivalence (under the separation assumption) between local compactness and exponentiability.</description>
