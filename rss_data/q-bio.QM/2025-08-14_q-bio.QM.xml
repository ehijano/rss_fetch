      <title>Real-time deep learning phase imaging flow cytometer reveals blood cell aggregate biomarkers for haematology diagnostics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While analysing rare blood cell aggregates remains challenging in automated haematology, they could markedly advance label-free functional diagnostics. Conventional flow cytometers efficiently perform cell counting with leukocyte differentials but fail to identify aggregates with flagged results, requiring manual reviews. Quantitative phase imaging flow cytometry captures detailed aggregate morphologies, but clinical use is hampered by massive data storage and offline processing. Incorporating hidden biomarkers into routine haematology panels would significantly improve diagnostics without flagged results. We present RT-HAD, an end-to-end deep learning-based image and data processing framework for off-axis digital holographic microscopy (DHM), which combines physics-consistent holographic reconstruction and detection, representing each blood cell in a graph to recognize aggregates. RT-HAD processes &gt;30 GB of image data on-the-fly with turnaround time of &lt;1.5 min and error rate of 8.9% in platelet aggregate detection, which matches acceptable laboratory error rates of haematology biomarkers and solves the big data challenge for point-of-care diagnostics.</description>

      <title>Exploring Molecular Odor Taxonomies for Structure-based Odor Predictions using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the key challenges to predict odor from molecular structure is unarguably our limited understanding of the odor space and the complexity of the underlying structure-odor relationships. Here, we show that the predictive performance of machine learning models for structure-based odor predictions can be improved using both, an expert and a data-driven odor taxonomy. The expert taxonomy is based on semantic and perceptual similarities, while the data-driven taxonomy is based on clustering co-occurrence patterns of odor descriptors directly from the prepared dataset. Both taxonomies improve the predictions of different machine learning models and outperform random groupings of descriptors that do not reflect existing relations between odor descriptors. We assess the quality of both taxonomies through their predictive performance across different odor classes and perform an in-depth error analysis highlighting the complexity of odor-structure relationships and identifying potential inconsistencies within the taxonomies by showcasing pear odorants used in perfumery. The data-driven taxonomy allows us to critically evaluate our expert taxonomy and better understand the molecular odor space. Both taxonomies as well as a full dataset are made available to the community, providing a stepping stone for a future community-driven exploration of the molecular basis of smell. In addition, we provide a detailed multi-layer expert taxonomy including a total of 777 different descriptors from the Pyrfume repository.</description>

      <title>Cross-BCI, A Cross-BCI-Paradigm Classifica-tion Model Towards Universal BCI Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classification models used in brain-computer interface (BCI) are usually designed for a single BCI paradigm. This requires the redevelopment of the model when applying it to a new BCI paradigm, resulting in repeated costs and effort. Moreover, less complex deep learning models are desired for practical usage, as well as for deployment on portable devices. In or-der to fill the above gaps, we, in this study, proposed a light-weight and unified decoding model for cross-BCI-paradigm classification. The proposed model starts with a tempo-spatial convolution. It is followed by a multi-scale local feature selec-tion module, aiming to extract local features shared across BCI paradigms and generate weighted features. Finally, a mul-ti-dimensional global feature extraction module is designed, in which multi-dimensional global features are extracted from the weighted features and fused with the weighted features to form high-level feature representations associated with BCI para-digms. The results, evaluated on a mixture of three classical BCI paradigms (i.e., MI, SSVEP, and P300), demon-strate that the proposed model achieves 88.39%, 82.36%, 80.01%, and 0.8092 for accuracy, macro-precision, mac-ro-recall, and macro-F1-score, respectively, significantly out-performing the compared models. This study pro-vides a feasible solution for cross-BCI-paradigm classifica-tion. It lays a technological foundation for de-veloping a new generation of unified decoding systems, paving the way for low-cost and universal practical applications.</description>

      <title>Predictive Significance of CD276/B7-H3 Expression in Baseline Biopsies of Advanced Prostate Carcinoma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the time of diagnosis, prostate cancer can appear deceptively mild or already display signs of widespread disease. Predicting long-term outcomes is often uncertain. This research focused on measuring CD276/B7-H3, an immune checkpoint protein linked to tumor development, in diagnostic tissue samples from 248 men. Participants included both those with cancer confined to the prostate and those with confirmed metastases. Analysis showed that patients with metastatic disease were more likely to exhibit increased B7-H3 levels. Strong expression of this marker was associated with shorter survival times and was observed alongside higher PSA concentrations and greater tumor aggressiveness based on Gleason grading. These trends remained consistent even when other prognostic factors were taken into account. The results suggest that assessing B7-H3 during the initial biopsy could help clinicians identify high-risk patients earlier. This marker may also represent a new target for treatment strategies in advanced prostate cancer.</description>

      <title>CAKL: Commutative algebra k-mer learning of genomics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the availability of various sequence analysis models, comparative genomic analysis remains a challenge in genomics, genetics, and phylogenetics. Commutative algebra, a fundamental tool in algebraic geometry and number theory, has rarely been used in data and biological sciences. In this study, we introduce commutative algebra k-mer learning (CAKL) as the first-ever nonlinear algebraic framework for analyzing genomic sequences. CAKL bridges between commutative algebra, algebraic topology, combinatorics, and machine learning to establish a new mathematical paradigm for comparative genomic analysis. We evaluate its effectiveness on three tasks -- genetic variant identification, phylogenetic tree analysis, and viral genome classification -- typically requiring alignment-based, alignment-free, and machine-learning approaches, respectively. Across eleven datasets, CAKL outperforms five state-of-the-art sequence analysis methods, particularly in viral classification, and maintains stable predictive accuracy as dataset size increases, underscoring its scalability and robustness. This work ushers in a new era in commutative algebraic data analysis and learning.</description>

      <title>Quest for a clinically relevant medical image segmentation metric: the definition and implementation of Medical Similarity Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: In the field of radiology and radiotherapy, accurate delineation of tissues and organs plays a crucial role in both diagnostics and therapeutics. While the gold standard remains expert-driven manual segmentation, many automatic segmentation methods are emerging. The evaluation of these methods primarily relies on traditional metrics that only incorporate geometrical properties and fail to adapt to various applications.
  Aims: This study aims to develop and implement a clinically relevant segmentation metric that can be adapted for use in various medical imaging applications.
  Methods: Bidirectional local distance was defined, and the points of the test contour were paired with points of the reference contour. After correcting for the distance between the test and reference center of mass, Euclidean distance was calculated between the paired points, and a score was given to each test point. The overall medical similarity index was calculated as the average score across all the test points. For demonstration, we used myoma and prostate datasets; nnUNet neural networks were trained for segmentation.
  Results: An easy-to-use, sustainable image processing pipeline was created using Python. The code is available in a public GitHub repository along with Google Colaboratory notebooks. The algorithm can handle multislice images with multiple masks per slice. Mask splitting algorithm is also provided that can separate the concave masks. We demonstrate the adaptability with prostate segmentation evaluation.
  Conclusions: A novel segmentation evaluation metric was implemented, and an open-access image processing pipeline was also provided, which can be easily used for automatic measurement of clinical relevance of medical image segmentation.}</description>

      <title>NEUBORN: The Neurodevelopmental Evolution framework Using BiOmechanical RemodelliNg</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding individual cortical development is essential for identifying deviations linked to neurodevelopmental disorders. However, current normative modelling frameworks struggle to capture fine-scale anatomical details due to their reliance on modelling data within a population-average reference space. Here, we present a novel framework for learning individual growth trajectories from biomechanically constrained, longitudinal, diffeomorphic image registration, implemented via a hierarchical network architecture. Trained on neonatal MRI data from the Developing Human Connectome Project, the method improves the biological plausibility of warps, generating growth trajectories that better follow population-level trends while generating smoother warps, with fewer negative Jacobians, relative to state-of-the-art baselines. The resulting subject-specific deformations provide interpretable, biologically grounded mappings of development. This framework opens new possibilities for predictive modeling of brain maturation and early identification of malformations of cortical development.</description>

      <title>Presenting DiaData for Research on Type 1 Diabetes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates 15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution, data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55 minutes before hypoglycemia.</description>

      <title>Thermal Tracks: A Gaussian process-based framework for universal melting curve analysis enabling unconstrained hit identification in thermal proteome profiling experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Thermal Tracks is a Python-based statistical framework for analyzing protein thermal stability data that overcomes key limitations of existing thermal proteome profiling (TPP) work-flows. Unlike standard approaches that assume sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions (limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability, such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses, where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.</description>

      <title>Towards Comprehensive Cellular Characterisation of H&amp;E slides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell detection, segmentation and classification are essential for analyzing tumor microenvironments (TME) on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) slides. Existing methods suffer from poor performance on understudied cell types (rare or not present in public datasets) and limited cross-domain generalization. To address these shortcomings, we introduce HistoPLUS, a state-of-the-art model for cell analysis, trained on a novel curated pan-cancer dataset of 108,722 nuclei covering 13 cell types. In external validation across 4 independent cohorts, HistoPLUS outperforms current state-of-the-art models in detection quality by 5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model weights and inference code at https://github.com/owkin/histoplus/.</description>

      <title>Cryo-em images are intrinsically low dimensional</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</description>

      <title>Strong anomalous diffusion for free-ranging birds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diffusion and anomalous diffusion are widely observed and used to study movement across organisms, resulting in extensive use of the mean and mean-squared displacement (MSD). However, these measures - corresponding to specific displacement moments - do not capture the full complexity of movement behavior. Using high-resolution data from over 70 million localizations of young and adult free-ranging Barn Owls (\textit{Tyto alba}), we reveal strong anomalous diffusion as nonlinear growth of displacement moments. The moment spectrum function $\lambda_t(q)$ -- defined by $\left&lt;|\bm{x}(t)|^q\right&gt; \sim t^{\lambda_t(q)}$ -- displays piecewise linearity in $q$, with a critical moment marking the crossover between scaling regimes. This highlights the need of a broad spectrum of displacement moments to characterize movement, which we link to age-specific ecological drivers. Furthermore, a characteristic timescale of five minutes marks an unexpected transition from a convex to a concave $\lambda_t(q)$. Using two stochastic models - a bounded L\'evy walk and a multi-mode behavioral model - we account for the observed phenomena, showing good agreement with data, relating age-specific behavioral states to environmentally confined movement, and demonstrating how L\'evy walk-like patterns can arise from underlying behavioral structure. Finally, we discuss the ecological significance of our results, arguing that strong anomalous diffusion may be widespread in animal movement.</description>
