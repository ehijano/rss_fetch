      <title>Systematic non-thermal velocity increase preceding soft X-ray flare onset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-thermal velocities, derived from spectral line broadening, can provide crucial insights into plasma dynamics before and during solar flares. To systematically study the pre-flare phase, we constructed a Hinode/Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) flare catalog of 1,449 flares from 2011-2024. This enabled a large-scale analysis of flare loop footpoint non-thermal velocity evolution across different flare magnitudes (C, M, X-classes). Analyzing Fe VIII - Fe XXIV emission lines formed at log(T/K) ~5.7-7.3 with piecewise linear fits in the pre-flare period, we find that non-thermal velocities consistently increase 4-25 minutes before GOES soft X-ray start in C and M-class flares. Onset timing patterns vary with flare magnitude: smaller flares show temperature-dependent progression, while larger flares exhibit more compressed, near-simultaneous onsets across temperatures. While our limited X-class sample (N=18) also show onset before GOES, larger statistics are needed to confirm its behavior. M-class flares show a systematic precursor non-thermal velocity onset ~30-60 minutes before GOES peak. In a subset of M-class flares (2011-2018), eruptive events show even earlier non-thermal velocity increases ($&gt;$1 hour before GOES peak) than confined events, suggesting a link between extended pre-flare non-thermal broadening and successful eruptions. This large scale study establishes pre-flare non-thermal velocity increase at footpoints as a common precursor observable before any X-ray signature.</description>

      <title>High resolution radio observations of the Chamaeleon star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on large-scale radio observations of the Chamaeleon star-forming region obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) that led to the definite detection of five young stars and the tentative detection of five more. As in other regions surveyed in the radio domain, the majority of detected sources are fairly evolved low-mass T Tauri stars, but we also detect one protostellar object (Ced 110 IRS4) and one Herbig Ae/Be star. With the exception of the protostellar source, the radio emission mechanism is likely of non-thermal origin. The three brightest radio stars identified with ATCA were subsequently observed with the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA) and one, J11061540-7721567 (Ced 110 IRS2), was detected at three epochs. This confirms the non-thermal nature of the radio emission in that specific case, and enabled accurate radio position measurements. Comparison with predictions from Gaia DR3 strongly suggests that this star is a binary system with an orbital period of order 40 years; additional LBA observations in the next decades would enable accurate determinations of the individual stellar masses in that system.</description>

      <title>Coriolis force acting on near-surface horizontal flows during simulations of flux emergence produces a tilt angle consistent with Joy's law on the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Joy's law describes the tilt of bipolar active regions on the Sun away from an east-west orientation, where the flux of the polarity concentrated at the prograde side tends to be closer to the equator than the polarity on the retrograde side. Joy's law is attributed to the Coriolis force because of the observed increase in tilt angle at higher latitudes. This tilt plays a crucial role in some solar dynamo models. Our goal is to model the effects of the Coriolis force on a flux tube as it rises through the near-surface convection zone. We use a three-dimensional Cartesian magnetohydrodynamic simulation of an untwisted flux tube ascending from a depth of 11 Mm. We model the Coriolis effect using the f-plane approximation, that only considers and acts on horizontal flows. On the Sun, Joy's law is weak and is only evident as an average over many active regions. To achieve a measurable effect in a single simulation, we consider a rotation rate 110 times faster than the Sun. The simulation shows that the flux tube emerges at the surface with a tilt angle consistent with Joy's law when scaled to the Sun's slower rotation, and the tilt angle does not substantially change after emergence. This shows that the Coriolis force acting on flows horizontal to the surface within the near-surface convection zone is consistent with Joy's law.</description>

      <title>The investigation of 84 TESS totally eclipsing contact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the eclipsing binary catalog provided by \cite{2022ApJS..258...16P}, 84 totally eclipsing contact binaries with stable light curves were selected. The TESS light curves of these 84 targets were studied using the Physics Of Eclipsing Binaries code. The results indicate that there are 18 deep contact binaries, 39 moderate contact binaries, and 27 shallow contact binaries. Among them, 43 targets exhibit the O'Connell effect, which is attributed to the presence of star-spot on the component's surface. 15 targets are low-mass ratio deep contact binaries and may be contact binary merging candidates. Based on the relationship between the period and semi-major axis of contact binaries, their absolute physical parameters such as mass, radius, and luminosity were derived. The evolutionary status of these 84 targets was studied using the mass-luminosity and mass-radius relation diagrams. Their initial masses were also estimated. Our results are compared with those of targets that have been historically studied. Among the 84 targets, 44 targets have been studied before, and 21 of these have mass ratios $q$ that are consistent with historical values within a 10\% difference. For the inconsistent targets, we conducted a detailed investigation and found that the main reasons are poor quality of historical data, or the fact that the machine learning methods used in historical studies might not accurately determine the physical parameters for individual targets.</description>

      <title>Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) for heliospheric imager data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16194v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are space weather phenomena capable of causing significant disruptions to both space- and ground-based infrastructure. The timely and accurate detection and prediction of CMEs is a crucial steps towards implementing strategies to minimize the impacts of such events. CMEs are commonly observed using coronagraphs and heliospheric imagers (HIs), with some forecasting methods relying on manually tracking CMEs across successive images in order to provide an estimate of their arrival time and speed. This process is time-consuming, and the growing volume of available data makes manual identification of CMEs increasingly impractical.
  We investigate the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to the problem of automated CME detection, focusing on data from the HI instruments aboard the STEREO spacecraft. HI data facilitates the tracking of CMEs through interplanetary space, providing valuable information on their evolution along the way. Building on advances in image segmentation, we present the Solar Transient Recognition Using Deep Learning (STRUDL) model. STRUDL is designed to automatically detect and segment CME fronts in HI data. We address the challenges inherent to this task and evaluate the model's performance across a range of solar activity conditions. To complement segmentation, we implement a basic tracking algorithm that links CME detections across successive frames, thus allowing us to automatically generate time-distance profiles for all CMEs under study.
  Our results demonstrate the feasibility of applying ML-based segmentation techniques to HI data, while highlighting areas for future improvement, particularly regarding the accurate segmentation and tracking of faint and interacting CMEs.</description>

      <title>10,000 Resolved Triples from Gaia: Empirical Constraints on Triple Star Populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a catalog of $\sim 10,000$ resolved triple star systems within 500 pc of the Sun, constructed using Gaia data. The triples include main-sequence, red giant, and white dwarf components spanning separations of 10 to 50,000 au. A well-characterized selection function allows us to constrain intrinsic demographics of the triple star population. We find that (a) all systems are compatible with being hierarchical and dynamically stable; (b) mutual orbital inclinations are isotropic for wide triples but show modest alignment as the systems become more compact; (c) primary masses follow a Kroupa initial mass function weighted by the triple fraction; (d) inner binary orbital periods, eccentricities, and mass ratios mirror those of isolated binaries, including a pronounced twin excess (mass ratios greater than 0.95) out to separations of 1000+ au, suggesting a common formation pathway; (e) tertiary mass ratios follow a power-law distribution with slope -1.4; (f) tertiary orbits are consistent with a log-normal period distribution and thermal eccentricities, subject to dynamical stability. Informed by these observations, we develop a publicly available prescription for generating mock triple star populations. Finally, we estimate the catalog's completeness and infer the intrinsic triple fraction, which rises steadily with primary mass: from $5\%$ at $\lesssim 0.5\,{\rm M_\odot}$ to $35\%$ at $2\,{\rm M_\odot}$. The public catalog provides a robust testbed for models of triple star formation and evolution.</description>

      <title>Insights gained from the Light Echo of Cepheus A HW2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cepheus A HW2 is a well-studied massive young stellar object (MYSO) featuring Class II methanol masers. Recently, certain maser components have been found to flare every five years. This period went undetected in (NEO)WISE photometry due to detector saturation. However, difference imaging revealed a light echo (LE), representing a variability record. Its periodicity is similar to that of the masers. Thereby, the mid-IR light curve since 2007 could be reconstructed. Phase and period maps provide information on the circumstellar dust distribution and viewing geometry. This is the first time an LE has been used for reverberation mapping of a YSO environment and expanding its light curve into the past.</description>

      <title>Three-component Phase Separation for Ultramassive White Dwarf Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phase separation in oxygen-neon (O/Ne) ultramassive white dwarfs (UMWDs). Current stellar evolution codes, such as MESA, only account for $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ separation and do not include other minor species. To improve this, we implement ternary phase diagrams into MESA. We construct UMWD models with O/Ne/sodium (Na) and O/Ne/magnesium (Mg) cores to test our implementation. We also assess the effect of including $\mathrm{^{22}Ne}$ in the current two-species framework. Our results show that incorporating additional components into the phase separation significantly alters the chemical evolution of UMWDs. Heavier elements preferentially enrich the solid core, enhancing mixing in the overlying liquid. We compute the buoyancy flux driven by compositional instabilities during crystallization. As in previous studies, we find two convective regimes: an early, fast overturning convection, lasting less than a million years, followed by inefficient (thermohaline) convection. The fast convective regime lasts up to 100 times longer with three-species separation compared to the standard $\mathrm{^{16}O/^{20}Ne}$ case. We find that neutron-rich species can have a significant contribution to the buoyancy flux despite their small mass fraction (&lt;10\%). We compute the amount of cooling delay induced by phase separation in UMWDs, and find that the three-species phase separation produces a delay up to $\sim10$ times larger than the simplest case of fractionation, although still less than 1 Gyr. We predict that the change in the composition profile in the liquid region when three components are included should change the frequency of gravity modes that can propagate in the interior of pulsating UMWDs.</description>

      <title>Preconditioning of the interplanetary medium due to isolated ICMEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematic study of the preconditioning of the interplanetary (IP) medium due to isolated interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Preconditioning is highly relevant when ICMEs, ejected in close succession and direction, modify the IP medium to allow subsequent ICMEs to propagate more freely, decelerate less, and retain higher kinetic energy at larger distances. We base our study on a sample of carefully selected events. The IP medium is analyzed during time intervals of 48 hours before and after the ICMEs in order to statistically quantify their impact on the properties of the solar wind (SW) and interplanetary magnetic field (IMF). We find that the SW behind ICMEs on average exhibits reduced density (-41%) and dynamic pressure (-29%), and increased total velocity (+15%), while the trailing IMF is more intense (+14%) and more radially aligned (13 degrees). The results suggest that even relatively low speed ICMEs can significantly precondition the IP medium. The results are relevant for better understanding of CME propagation and SW interaction, and hold implications for heliospheric models and applied research of space weather.</description>

      <title>The PGPUC horizontal branch evolutionary tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The horizontal branch (HB) phase of stellar evolution plays a critical role in understanding the life cycle of stars, particularly in the context of low-mass stars. However, generating theoretical evolutionary tracks for HB stars is computationally intensive, especially when attempting to match a wide range of observational data. This work presents an extensive grid of HB evolutionary tracks computed using the PGPUC code, covering a broad range of chemical compositions, progenitor masses, and alpha-element distributions. The aim is to provide a robust tool for interpreting HB stellar populations and advancing our understanding of their diverse properties. The evolutionary tracks are made publicly available through the PGPUC Online database for easy access and interpolation. We computed over 19,000 HB evolutionary tracks encompassing a wide range in terms of mass, metallicity, helium abundance, and alpha-element enhancement, along with different progenitor masses. Using these tracks, we calculated zero-age, middle-age, and terminal-age loci. The PGPUC database now includes a fine grid of HB evolutionary tracks, allowing for precise interpolation. Key findings include the dependence of HB morphology on progenitor mass, metallicity, and helium abundance.</description>

      <title>Catastrophic Formation of Macro-Scale Flow and Magnetic Fields in the Relativistic Gas of Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is shown that a simple quasi-equilibrium analysis of a multi-component plasma can be harnessed to explain catastrophic energy transformations in astrophysical objects. We limit ourselves to the particular class of binary systems for which the typical plasma consists of one classical ion component, and two relativistic electron components - the bulk degenerate electron gas with a small contamination of hot electrons. We derive, analytically, the conditions conducive to such a catastrophic change. The pathway to such sudden changes is created by the slow changes in the initial parameters so that the governing equilibrium state can no longer be sustained and the system must find a new equilibrium that could have vastly different energy mix - of thermal, flow-kinetic and magnetic energies. In one such scenario, macro-scale flow kinetic, and magnetic energies abound in the final state. For the given multi-component plasma, we show that the flow (strongly Super-Alfv\'enic) kinetic energy is mostly carried by the small hot electron component. Under specific conditions, it is possible to generate strong macro-scale magnetic (velocity) field when all of the flow (magnetic) field energy is converted to the magnetic (velocity) field energy at the catastrophe. The analysis is applied to explain various observed characteristics of white dwarf (WD) systems, in particular, of the magnetic and dense/degenerate type.</description>

      <title>Transformers for Stratified Spectropolarimetric Inversion: Proof of Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar spectropolarimetric inversion -- inferring atmospheric conditions from the Stokes vector -- is a key diagnostic tool for understanding solar magnetism, but traditional inversion methods are computationally expensive and sensitive to local minima. Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer faster solutions, but are often restricted to shallow models or a few spectral lines. We present a proof-of-concept study using a transformer machine learning (ML) model for multi-line, full-Stokes inversion, to infer stratified parameters from synthetic spectra produced from 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations. We synthesise a large set of Stokes vectors using forward modelling across 15 spectral lines spanning the deep photosphere towards the chromosphere. The model maps full-Stokes input to temperature, magnetic field strength, inclination, azimuth (encoded as $\sin2\phi$, $\cos2\phi$), and line-of-sight velocity as a function of optical depth. The transformer incorporates an attention mechanism that allows the model to focus on the most informative regions of the spectrum for each inferred parameter, and uses positional embedding to encode wavelength and depth order. We benchmark it against a multilayer perceptron (MLP), test robustness to noise, and assess generalisation. The transformer outperforms the MLP, especially in the higher layers and for magnetic parameters, yielding higher correlations and more regularised stratifications. The model retains strong performance across a range of noise levels typical for real observations, with magnetic parameter inference degrading predictably while temperature and velocity remain stable. We establish transformer architectures as a powerful tool for spectropolarimetric regression. This approach paves the way for analysis of large datasets from large solar telescopes.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation by turbulent, magnetized and randomly inhomogeneous solar radio sources generated by electron beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16816v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During Type III solar radio bursts, electromagnetic waves are radiated at plasma frequency $\omega_p$ and its harmonics by electrostatic wave turbulence generated by electron beams ejected by Sun in randomly inhomogeneous solar wind and coronal plasmas. These emissions, detected since decades by spacecraft and radiotelescopes, are split by the plasma magnetic field into three modes $\mathcal{X}$, $\mathcal{O}$ and $\mathcal{Z}$ of different dispersion, polarization and radiation properties. This work demonstrates, using three independent and converging approaches, that only a small fraction of electromagnetic energy radiated at $\omega_p$ ($\lesssim10\%$) is escaping from beam-generated radio sources, mainly as $\mathcal{O}$-mode waves and, depending on plasma conditions, as $\mathcal{X}$-mode waves. Most energy is radiated in $\mathcal{Z}$-mode and can therefore be only observed close to sources. Results have major implications for solar radio emission and provide strong support for interpretation of observations performed up to close distances to Sun by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter spacecraft.</description>

      <title>The first phase of mass transfer in low-mass binaries: neither stable nor a common envelope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The masses of the white dwarfs in a binary carry information about previous mass-transfer phases. The core mass -- radius relation of low-mass giants gives the size of the progenitor of a helium white dwarf at the moment it last filled its Roche lobe. Previously, we used this information for a few observed systems to propose a new mass-transfer type, based on an angular momentum balance.
  Our aim is to investigate if stable mass transfer instead of the angular momentum prescription is consistent with the observed double helium white dwarf masses.
  We reconstruct the progenitor evolution of observed double helium white dwarfs using the core mass -- radius relation and evaluate if the periods at the start of the second phases of mass transfer are consistent with the outcome of stable mass transfer. More generally, we calculate the mass distribution of double helium white dwarfs for three different progenitors scenarios: double common envelope (with parameter $\alpha \lambda$), angular momentum prescription (with parameter $\gamma$) and stable mass transfer.
  We find that the observed systems are generally not consistent with stable mass transfer. Stable mass transfer leads to a tight correlation between the two white dwarf masses in a binary that is not consistent with the observed mass distribution. Double common envelope evolution is a particularly poor fit to the observations. The angular momentum prescription can populate the observed mass distribution, but not perfectly.
  We conclude that the first phase of mass transfer initiated on the red giant branch in low-mass systems does not generally proceed as stable mass transfer nor as common envelope, and thus is poorly understood. This may be related to the fact that for many observed binaries that have finished the first phase of mass transfer the orbit is eccentric, which is an unexpected outcome of mass transfer.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of interferometric observations and characterization of planet-induced structures at sub au to au scales in protoplanetary disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks by VLTI and ALMA have greatly improved our understanding of the detailed structure of these planetary birthplaces. These observations have revealed a variety of large-scale disk substructures, including rings, gaps, and spirals, spanning tens to hundreds of au, supporting the predictions of planet formation models. Recent instruments, such as MATISSE at the VLTI, allow one to resolve and investigate the inner few au of protoplanetary disks in nearby star formation regions, shedding light on the traces of planet formation and evolution at these small scales. The aim of this work is to assess the feasibility of interferometric observations of small-scale planet-induced substructures in protoplanetary disks in nearby star-forming regions. We aim to characterize these substructures in multi-wavelength and multi-epoch observations and subsequently differentiate between simulation parameters. On the basis of 3D hydrodynamic simulations of embedded planetary companions and subsequent 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, we calculated and analyzed interferometric observables, assuming observations with the VLTI in the K, L, M, and N bands. The hydrodynamic simulations exhibit mass-dependent planet-induced density waves that create observable substructures, most notably for the considered case of a 300 $M_{\oplus}$ planet. These substructures share similarities with observed large-scale structures and feature a prominent accretion region around the embedded planet. The visibilities show a detectable variability for multi-epoch VLTI/GRAVITY and VLTI/MATISSE observations, caused by the orbital motion of the planet, that are distinguishable from other sources of variability due to their unique combination of timescale and amplitude.</description>

      <title>Magnetic braking and dynamo evolution of $\beta$ Hydri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution of magnetic braking and dynamo processes in subgiant stars is essential for understanding how these stars lose angular momentum. We investigate the magnetic braking and dynamo evolution of $\beta$ Hydri, a G-type subgiant, to test the hypothesis of weakened magnetic braking and the potential rejuvenation of large-scale magnetic fields. We analyze spectropolarimetric observations from HARPS (HARPSpol; polarimetric mode of High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher), and combine them with archival X-ray data and asteroseismic properties from TESS (Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite) to estimate the current wind braking torque of $\beta$ Hydri. Despite experiencing weakened magnetic braking during the second half of its main-sequence lifetime, our results indicate that $\beta$ Hydri has regained significant magnetic activity and a large-scale magnetic field. This observation aligns with the "born-again" dynamo hypothesis. Furthermore, our estimated wind braking torque is considerably stronger than what would be expected for a star in the weakened magnetic braking regime. This suggests that subgiants with extended convective zones can temporarily re-establish large-scale dynamo action. These results provide critical constraints on stellar rotation models and improve our understanding of the interplay between magnetic field structure, stellar activity cycles, and angular momentum evolution in old solar-type stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14049v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study modifications of gravitational wave observables, such as the wave amplitude and frequency, which follow from the quantum equivalence principle, and are expressed in terms of the inertial, gravitational and rest masses of the LIGO/Virgo mirrors. We provide bounds on the violations of the quantum equivalence principle by comparing the results with the most resolved gravitational wave events observed by the LIGO/Virgo collaboration. The formalism is equally applicable to other future ground and space-based gravitational wave detectors.</description>

      <title>A Massive Yellow Supergiant in the Far Outer Disk of M31: Evidence for In Situ Massive Star Formation Beyond the Optical Radius</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While massive stars are known to shape galactic ecosystems, their formation has long been assumed to require the high-density environments of inner galactic disks. This paradigm is challenged by mounting evidence of young massive stars in extended galaxy outskirts, yet direct confirmation of in situ massive star formation in such extreme low-density environments remains scarce. Here, we present the discovery of LAMOST J0048+4154, a massive yellow supergiant situated at a deprojected galactocentric distance of ~34 kpc in M31, making it the most distant massive star confirmed in this galaxy. Through spectroscopic and photometric analyses, we classify J0048+4154 as an F5-F8I supergiant with an effective temperature of $6357^{+121}_{-118}$ K and a luminosity of $\log L/L_{\odot} = 5.00^{+0.06}_{-0.06}$, corresponding to an ~18 $M_{\odot}$ progenitor and an age of ~10 Myr. FAST H I observations reveal close spatial and kinematic alignment between the star and a faint H I external arm, suggesting in situ formation in a region of low gas density. The presence of other UV-bright, early-type stars in the vicinity further supports low-level recent star formation in M31's very outer disk. These findings challenge the prevailing assumption that massive star formation is confined to inner disks or classical star-forming regions and underscore the need to re-examine the role of spiral galaxy outskirts in fueling and sustaining star formation. J0048+4154 thereby expands our understanding of the extent of M31's young stellar component and exemplifies how outer disks may harbor conditions conducive to forming massive stars, despite low-density environments.</description>

      <title>Progenitor Insights of Type IIP SN 2018pq: A Comprehensive Photometric and Spectroscopic Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16148v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-cadence photometric and low-resolution (R $\sim$ 400--700) optical spectroscopic observations of Type IIP supernova, SN~2018pq, which exploded on the outskirts of the galaxy IC~3896A. The optically thick phase (``plateau'') lasts approximately 97 d, the plateau duration of normal Type IIP supernovae. SN~2018pq has a {\em V}-band absolute magnitude of $-16.42 \pm 0.01$ mag at 50 d, resembles normal-luminous supernova, and the V-band decline rate of 0.42$\pm$0.06 mag 50 d$^{-1}$ during the plateau phase. A steeper decline rate of 11.87$\pm$1.68 mag 100 d$^{-1}$ was observed compared to that of typical Type IIP supernovae during the transition between plateau to nebular phase. We employ detailed radiative transfer spectra modelling, TARDIS, to reveal the photospheric temperature and velocity at two spectral epochs. The well-fitted model spectra indicate SN~2018pq is a spectroscopically normal Type IIP supernova. Semi-analytical light curve modelling suggests the progenitor as a red supergiant star with an ejecta mass of $\sim$11 $M_\odot$ and an initial radius of 424 $R_\odot$. On the contrary, hydrodynamical modelling suggests a higher mass progenitor between 14--16 $M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>A Bimodal Metallicity Distribution Function in the Ultra-Faint Dwarf Galaxy Reticulum II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16462v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Star formation in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs, $M_* &lt;10^5M_\odot$) is suppressed by reionization, but may not be completely quenched. The metallicity distribution function (MDF) of stars in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies could show these signatures of reionization. However, past studies of UFD MDFs have been limited, because there are only a few dozen red giant branch (RGB) stars in such low-mass galaxies. We present low-resolution Magellan/IMACS spectroscopy of 167 stars in the UFD Reticulum II ($M_* \approx 3000 M_\odot$), increasing the number of stellar metallicities by 6.5 times and resulting in the most populated spectroscopic metallicity distribution function of any UFD. This is possible because we determined the first spectroscopic metallicities of main sequence turn-off stars in any UFD. The MDF of Reticulum II is clearly a bimodal distribution, displaying two peaks with about $80\%$ of the stars in the metal-poor peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-3.0$ and $20\%$ of the stars in the more metal-rich peak at $\rm[Fe/H]=-2.1$. Such a large metallicity gap can be explained by Type Ia supernova enrichment during a long quiescent period. This supports the currently-favored two-burst star formation history for Reticulum II and shows that such low-mass galaxies clearly can form stars after reionization.</description>

      <title>Disentangling Metallicity Effects in Hot Jupiter Occurrence Across Galactic Birth Radius and Phase-Space Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16511v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore how the correlation between host star metallicity and giant planets shapes hot Jupiter occurrence as a function of Galactic birth radius (\rbirth) and phase-space density in the Milky Way disk. Using the GALAH and APOGEE surveys and a galaxy from the NIHAO simulation suite, we inject hot Jupiters around stars based on metallicity power laws, reflecting the trend that giant planets preferentially form around metal-rich stars. For \rbirth\ $\geq 5$ kpc, hot Jupiter occurrence decreases with \rbirth\ by $\sim -0.1%$ per kpc; this is driven by the Galaxy's chemical evolution, where the inner regions of the disk are more metal-rich. Differences in GALAH occurrence rates versus APOGEE's and the simulation's at \rbirth\ $&lt; 5$ kpc arise from survey selection effects. APOGEE and the NIHAO simulation have more high-$\alpha$ sequence stars than GALAH, resulting in average differences in metallicity (0.2--0.4 dex), $\alpha$-process element enrichment (0.2 dex), and vertical velocities (7--14 km/s) at each \rbirth\ bin. Additionally, we replicate the result of \cite{Winter20}, which showed that over 92% of hot Jupiters are associated with stars in phase-space overdensities, or "clustered environments." However, our findings suggest that this clustering effect is primarily driven by chemical and kinematic differences between low and high-$\alpha$ sequence star properties. Our results support stellar characteristics, particularly metallicity, being the primary drivers of hot Jupiter formation, which serves as the "null hypothesis" for interpreting planet demographics. This underscores the need to disentangle planetary and stellar properties from Galactic-scale effects in future planet demographics studies.</description>

      <title>Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) XVII: A Compact but Structured Keplerian Disk and Large-scale Streamers Revealed in the Class I Protostellar System IRAS 04169+2702</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution ($\sim$0.05"; 8 au) dust continuum and molecular line observations toward the Class I protostellar system IRAS 04169+2702 in the Taurus B213 region, as part of the ALMA Large Program Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk). The 1.3-mm dust continuum emission traces a circumstellar disk with a central depression toward the protostar. Our VLA observations of the same target reveal a single central peak dominated by the free-free emission, which coincides with the depression of the thermal dust emission. The mean spectral index of the thermal dust emission from 1.3 mm to 1.4 cm is approximately 2.8, suggestive of the presence of grains grown to millimeter or centimeter sizes in the disk. Velocity gradients along the disk major axis are seen in emission from $^{12}$CO (2-1), $^{13}$CO (2-1), and C$^{18}$O (2-1) molecular lines. The position-velocity diagrams of these lines unveil a Keplerian-rotating disk with a radius of $\sim$21 au around a 1.3 $M_{\odot}$ protostar, as well as an infalling and rotating envelope with the angular momentum conserved. In addition to the compact disk, large-scale infalling spiral structures extending up to approximately 1400 au, streamers, are discovered in C$^{18}$O (2-1), SO (6$_5$-5$_4$), and H$_2$CO (3$_{0, 3}$-2$_{0, 2}$) as well as in the 1.3-mm continuum emission. Notably, in the region closer to the protostar, the spatial coincidence of C$^{18}$O and SO may indicate the presence of a shock related to accretion through the spiral arms.</description>

      <title>Chiral Invariant Mass Constraints from HESS J1731 347 in an Extended Parity Doublet Model with Isovector Scalar Meson</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent discovery of a central compact object (CCO) within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, with mass $0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17} \ M_\odot $ and radius $10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km is the lightest and smallest compact object ever observed. We identify it as an ultra-light Neutron star (NS) and constrain the chiral invariant mass of nucleon $m_0$ from the observational data of NS using an extended parity doublet model with including the isovector scalar meson $a_0(980)$. We study the higher order asymmertic matter properties such as the symmetry incompressibility $K_{sym}$ and the symmetry skewness $Q_{sym}$ in the presence of $a_0$ meson. We find that $K_{sym}$ and $Q_{sym}$ is sensitive to the chiral invariant mass of nucleon $m_0$ in the presence of $a_0$ meson. We show that the equation of state in the present model satisfies all observational constraints within $2\sigma$ credible region including the HESS J1731-347 observation, as well as the constraint from $K_{sym}$ when $740 \,\text{ MeV} \lesssim m_0 \lesssim 860 \,\text{ MeV}$ for $L_0 = $ 57.7 MeV. Yet, the $1\sigma$ constraint from neutron stars appears to be not fully compatible with the constraint from $K_{sym}$ from the present model.</description>

      <title>On the evolution of the mass density profile of dense molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We aim to obtain the equations which govern the evolution of the mass density profile of a dense irrotational molecular cloud (MC). Our study is based on the notion of "ensemble of MCs", introduced in our previous work. The MCs are modeled by use of the "ensemble abstract representative member": a spherically symmetric, isotropic and isothermal MC which accretes radially matter from its surroundings. Applying the equations of hydrodynamics to a self-gravitating isothermal spherical gas cloud, we obtain a system of 2 first-order non-linear partial differential equations, which govern the evolution of two unknown fields: the exponent of density profile and the accretion velocity. Assuming a steady-state flow, we get approximate solutions using the method of leading-order terms. Far from the cloud centre the obtained density profile is $\varrho=\ell^{-2}$ and the accretion velocity is constant, while near to the centre $\varrho=\ell^{-3/2}$ and $v_{\rm a}\propto\ell^{-1/2}$. Through our dynamical equations, the obtained solutions coincide completely with those found using the equation of energy conservation of a fluid element (in our previous work). Also, combining the equations of energy balance for a fluid element, we arrive at the conclusion that the cloud layers far from the centre are in a stable dynamical state if the accretion velocity flow is sub- or transsonic; otherwise they are marginally stable (moderately supersonic flow) or unstable (supersonic flow). Both solutions are consistent only if the accretion flow is subsonic and hence the outer layers are stable. Finally, under the assumption that both the accretion velocity and density scale with $\ell$ and their power-law exponents are position-independent, we show that the density scaling exponent far away from the centre is $p=2$ and this value is an attractor. Hence this value should be observable in dense MCs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Magellanic Clouds are two nearby dwarf irregular galaxies whose study can help us in understanding galaxy and stellar evolution. In particular, the Large Magellanic Cloud, the larger one, contains approximately 30 billion stars at various evolutionary stages. In this work, we present an SDSS $gri$-bands photometric analysis based on multiple images acquired with DECam, the Dark Energy Camera, installed on the Blanco telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (Chile). We performed a full image analysis and photometric calibration, resulting in a photometric catalog named COSMIC-L, consisting of 57,997,665 stars, of which 18,676,294 contain estimates for all three $gri$ magnitudes, resulting in a completeness magnitude of $\simeq 21$ and a limiting magnitude of $\simeq 22$ in all three bands.</description>

      <title>Dynamical Horizons and Black Hole Soft Hair</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the present work, quasilocal Brown-York charges are derived that coincide in the large sphere limit with the conserved supertranslation hair and superrotation charges introduced by Hawking, Perry and Strominger in [45, 46]. Given these charges, a general scenario is outlined in which a non-rotating black hole completely evaporates after its collapse due to particle creation effects, whereby a genuine one-way traversable event horizon is never formed, but merely a two-way traversable dynamical (resp. future trapping) horizon. The formation of such a dynamical horizon has the consequence, as is demonstrated, that quasilocal energy transported by the considered charges, and thus information, can continuously escape through the black hole horizon to infinity; a mechanism which, as is argued, could possibly prevent information loss once the black hole formation and evaporation process comes to an end.</description>

      <title>Magnetogram-matching Biot-Savart Law and Decomposition of Vector Magnetograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02134v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize a magnetogram-matching Biot-Savart law (BSL) from planar to spherical geometry. For a given coronal current density $\bf{J}$, this law determines the magnetic field $\tilde{\bf B}$ whose radial component vanishes at the surface. The superposition of $\tilde{\bf B}$ with a potential field defined by a given surface radial field, $B_r$, provides the entire configuration where $B_r$ remains unchanged by the currents. Using this approach, we (1) upgrade our regularized BSLs for constructing coronal magnetic flux ropes (MFRs) and (2) propose a new method for decomposing a measured photospheric magnetic field as ${\bf B} = {\bf B}_{\rm{pot}} + {\bf B}_T + {\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$, where the potential, ${\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$, toroidal, ${\bf B}_T$, and poloidal, ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$, fields are determined by $B_r$, $J_r$, and the surface divergence of ${\bf B} - {\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$, respectively, all derived from magnetic data. Our ${\bf B}_T$ is identical to the one in the alternative Gaussian decomposition by Schuck et al. (2022), while ${\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$ and ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$ are different from their poloidal fields ${\bf B}^{&lt;}_{\rm{P}}$ and ${\bf B}^{&gt;}_{\rm{P}}$, which are $potential$ in the infinitesimal proximity to the upper and lower side of the surface, respectively. In contrast, our ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$ has no such constraints and, as ${\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$ and ${\bf B}_T$, refers to the $same$ upper side of the surface. In spite of these differences, for a continuous $\bf{J}$ distribution across the surface, ${\bf B}_{\rm{pot}}$ and ${\bf B}_{\tilde{S}}$ are linear combinations of ${\bf B}^{&lt;}_{\rm{P}}$ and ${\bf B}^{&gt;}_{\rm{P}}$. We demonstrate that, similar to the Gaussian method, our decomposition allows one to identify the footprints and projected surface-location of MFRs in the solar corona, as well as the direction and connectivity of their currents.</description>

      <title>Prompt stellar and binary black hole mergers in tight triples: Insights from chemically homogeneous evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Short-period massive binary stars are predicted to undergo chemically homogeneous evolution (CHE), making them prime candidates for producing binary black holes (BBHs) that may merge within the age of the Universe. Most of these binaries have a tertiary companion, and here we explore how a nearby third body possibly influences this evolutionary channel. Our analysis combines analytic treatments of triple dynamics with insights from detailed stellar evolution models, focusing on the role of the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai mechanism while also accounting for tidal and general relativistic apsidal precession. We examine the dynamics of triples at three critical evolutionary stages: the zero-age main sequence, shortly after the main sequence, and at the time of BBH formation. We find that, for triples having outer orbital periods less than 70 d(120 d), the inner binary can merge during(or after) the main-sequence stage, leading to a hydrogen-rich(helium-rich) stellar merger. If a stellar merger is avoided, the inner binary may eventually form a BBH. In mildly hierarchical triples, with outer periods of around 100 d, the tertiary component can trigger a rapid merger of the BBH on timescales comparable to the outer orbital period. Stellar tides play a crucial role in determining the fate of the inner binary in such tight triple systems, as they can suppress the perturbative effects of the third star. When tidal forces damp the oscillations induced by the tertiary, the BBH merger may occur soon after stellar collapse. Notably, these outcomes are not restricted to CHE binaries but can also apply to any BBH formed from stars in tight orbits. Mergers in these systems are characterized by the proximity of a tertiary companion and the presence of recently ejected gas, making them promising candidates for electromagnetic counterparts and gravitational-wave signals influenced by nearby tertiary objects.</description>

      <title>Average solar active region: I. Intensities, velocities, and the photospheric magnetic field</title>

Abstract: Context: Solar active regions (ARs) are key manifestations of the Sun's magnetic activity, displaying diverse spatial and temporal characteristics. Their formation and evolution play a crucial role in understanding the solar dynamo and space weather. While individual ARs exhibit significant variability, ensemble averaging offers a method to extract their typical properties and evolution. Aims: This study aims to construct an average bipolar AR using ensemble averaging of observational data. By normalizing ARs in space and time, we seek to identify general trends in the evolution of magnetic flux, velocity fields, and atmospheric emissions, providing insights into the underlying physical mechanisms governing AR development. Methods: We analysed a sample of bipolar ARs observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and Atmospheric Imaging Assembly aboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The ARs were selected based on strict criteria, ensuring clear polarity separation and emergence within 60 degrees of the solar central meridian. Normalisation procedures were applied to align ARs spatially and temporally before computing an ensemble average of various observables, including line-of-sight magnetograms, Dopplergrams, and multi-wavelength intensity maps. Results: The average AR exhibits a well-defined evolutionary pattern, with flux emergence followed by peak activity and subsequent decay. The leading polarity retains coherence longer than the trailing one, consistent with previous studies. Surface flow maps revealed a diverging outflow near the emergence site before the emerged AR is clearly visible in magnetograms. Atmospheric emission variations indicate enhanced heating above the AR in later phases, possibly due to persistent reconnection events. The ensemble averaging approach highlights systematic features of AR evolution that are often obscured by individual-case variability.</description>

      <title>Evolutionary models for the Very Massive Stars in the R136 cluster of 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cluster R136 in the LMC contains a population of stars in excess of 100 M$_\odot$, including R136a1, the most massive star known. Very Massive Stars (VMSs) play an influential role in feedback processes and may potentially produce exotic supernova types and black holes of tens of solar masses. The evolutionary history and final fate of the three most luminous stars, R136a1, R136a2, and R136a3, has been a puzzling issue. We aim to resolve this by rotating single-star MESA models. We produce interpolated model grids and apply a Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis to compare our models with observations. The nature of supernova progenitors strongly depends on mass loss and the AM coupling schemes. We predict no pair-instability and no GRB progenitors from our fiducial model grid at LMC metallicity. The onset of Wolf-Rayet-type mass-loss rates on the main sequence leads to a rapid decrease in stellar mass and luminosity. The mass turnover implies that the evolutionary history can only be inferred if additional constraints are available. We utilise the surface helium abundance, which poses a conundrum: R136a1, the most luminous star, is less enriched in helium than R136a2 and R136a3. We propose that this can be explained if both R136a2 and R136a3 were initially more massive than R136a1. From a rigorous confrontation of our models to spectroscopically-derived observables, we estimate an initial mass of 346$\pm41$ M$_\odot$ for R136a1, and $\gtrsim$500 M$_\odot$ for R136a2 and R136a3. Even though VMSs are only present in the youngest clusters below 2 Myr of age, our study strengthens their role in local and galaxy evolution. At LMC metallicity, they will be observable as helium-enriched massive stars after their drastic mass loss, produced via single-star evolution. If the core collapse leads to a supernova, it will be of Type Ib/c. [abridged]</description>

      <title>Towards multi-messenger observations of core-collapse supernovae harbouring choked jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16234v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Choked jets (CJ) have attracted particular attention as potential sources of high-energy cosmic neutrinos. Testing this hypothesis is challenging because of the missing gamma-ray counterpart, hence the identification of other electromagnetic (EM) signatures is crucial. A CJ source is expected harbouring in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) with extended H envelopes, releasing ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission for a few days. The UV band will be visible with an unprecedentedly large field of view by the future satellite ULTRASAT, for which we investigate the detection prospects in relation to the CJ visibility in the optical band with the currently operating telescope ZTF. ULTRASAT will be able to double the volume of sky currently visible by ZTF for the same emitting sources (sample of observed Type II SNe enlarged by 50%). As these sources can produce neutrinos via hadronic/photohadronic interactions in CJ, we investigate how neutrino observations by existing Cherenkov high-energy neutrino telescopes (IceCube and KM3NeT) can be used in association with EM signals coming from shock breakout (SBO) events. For optimized multimessenger detections, the delay between neutrino produced at SBO (during the jet propagation inside the stellar envelope) and ULTRASAT observations should be of around 4(5) days, with a follow-up by instruments like ZTF about one week after. We estimate that at most ~20% of the CCSNe from red supergiant stars detectable with ULTRASAT might host a CJ and release TeV neutrinos. EM and neutrino detections, if accompanied by photometric and spectroscopic follow-up with evidence for a relativistic jet launched by the central engine, would suggest CCSNe harbouring choked jets as main contributors to the cosmic diffuse neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos as background and signal in searches using the Migdal effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17649v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ionization or excitation resulting from the noninstantaneous response of the electron cloud to nuclear recoil is known as the Migdal effect. Dark matter searches utilizing this process set the most stringent bounds on the spin-independent dark matter-nucleon scattering cross section over a large region of the sub-GeV dark matter parameter space, underscoring its significance in dark matter detection. In this paper, we quantify the regions of dark matter parameter space that are challenging to probe via the Migdal effect due to the presence of dominant solar neutrino backgrounds for both liquid noble and semiconductor targets. Our findings reveal that there is no hard floor in the dark matter parameter space. Instead, we map the so-called neutrino fog. In mapping the neutrino fog, we identify the importance of incorporating the Migdal effect induced by neutrinos, as well as neutrino-electron scattering and dominant coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering, particularly for semiconductor targets. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large portion of the relic density allowed parameter space lies within the neutrino fog. Finally, we estimate the exposure required to detect neutrino-induced Migdal events in direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>The ejection and detectability of high- and hyper-velocity stars by compact object binaries in globular clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14273v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dense cores of Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) play host to a variety of dynamical encounters between stellar objects, which can accelerate stars to velocities high enough to escape the GC. The most extreme examples of these encounters are interactions between single GC stars and binaries including at least one compact object. These interactions can result in ejection velocities of up to several hundred $\mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$, approaching or even exceeding the escape velocity of the Galaxy itself. In order to study whether these interactions contribute to the Galactic population of hypervelocity stars (stars moving faster than the Galactic escape speed), we combine Monte Carlo $N$-body GC simulations, observations of Galactic GCs, and a particle spray code to generate realistic populations of stars which have escaped from Milky Way GCs following star + compact object binary (S+COB) interactions. We find that over the last 500 Myr, S+COB interactions have likely ejected $\sim$6300 stars from Galactic GCs, of which $839_{-67}^{+70}$ have present-day velocities exceeding $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$. Using mock photometric observations, we find that $290_{-23}^{+28}$ ejected stars are detectable in Gaia Data Release 3, however, only $1_{-1}^{+2}$ stars faster than $500 \; \mathrm{km \ s^{-1}}$ are detectable. Even so, we show that observational prospects in the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time are more optimistic, and future detected fast extratidal GC stars will serve as a useful probe of GC cores.</description>
