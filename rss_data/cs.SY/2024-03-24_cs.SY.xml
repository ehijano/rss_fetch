      <title>Transmission Benefits and Cost Allocation under Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14803v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disputes over cost allocation can present a significant barrier to investment in shared infrastructure. While it may be desirable to allocate cost in a way that corresponds to expected benefits, investments in long-lived projects are made under conditions of substantial uncertainty. In the context of electricity transmission, uncertainty combined with the inherent complexity of power systems analysis prevents the calculation of an estimated distribution of benefits that is agreeable to all participants. To analyze aspects of the cost allocation problem, we construct a model for transmission and generation expansion planning under uncertainty, enabling the identification of transmission investments as well as the calculation of benefits for users of the network. Numerical tests confirm the potential for realized benefits at the participant level to differ significantly from ex ante estimates. Based on the model and numerical tests we discuss several issues, including 1) establishing a valid counterfactual against which to measure benefits, 2) allocating cost to new and incumbent generators vs. solely allocating to loads, 3) calculating benefits at the portfolio vs. the individual project level, 4) identifying losers in a surplus-enhancing transmission expansion, and 5) quantifying the divergence between cost allocation decisions made ex ante and benefits realized ex post.</description>

      <title>Robust Model Based Reinforcement Learning Using $\mathcal{L}_1$ Adaptive Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\mathcal{L}_1$-MBRL, a control-theoretic augmentation scheme for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) algorithms. Unlike model-free approaches, MBRL algorithms learn a model of the transition function using data and use it to design a control input. Our approach generates a series of approximate control-affine models of the learned transition function according to the proposed switching law. Using the approximate model, control input produced by the underlying MBRL is perturbed by the $\mathcal{L}_1$ adaptive control, which is designed to enhance the robustness of the system against uncertainties. Importantly, this approach is agnostic to the choice of MBRL algorithm, enabling the use of the scheme with various MBRL algorithms. MBRL algorithms with $\mathcal{L}_1$ augmentation exhibit enhanced performance and sample efficiency across multiple MuJoCo environments, outperforming the original MBRL algorithms, both with and without system noise.</description>

      <title>Optimisation of photodetectors design: comparison between Montecarlo and Genetic Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Montecarlo and Genetic Algorithm optimisations applied to the design of photodetectors based on a transimpedance amplifier and a photodiode. The circuit performance is evaluated with a merit function and the systematic search method is used as a reference. The design parameters are the feedback network components and the photodiode bias voltage. To evaluate the optimisations, we define the relative difference between its merit and the optimum merit obtained by the systematic search. In both algorithms, the relative difference decreases with the number of evaluations, following a power law. The power-law exponent for the Genetic Algorithm is larger than that of Montecarlo (0.74 vs. 0.50). We conclude that both algorithms are advantageous compared to the systematic search method, and that the Genetic Algorithm shows a better performance than Montecarlo.</description>

      <title>Structured stability analysis of networked systems with uncertain links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An input-output approach to stability analysis is explored for networked systems with uncertain link dynamics. The main result consists of a collection of integral quadratic constraints, which together imply robust stability of the uncertain networked system, under the assumption that stability is achieved with ideal links. The conditions are decentralized inasmuch as each involves only agent and uncertainty model parameters that are local to a corresponding link. This makes the main result, which imposes no restriction on network structure, suitable for the study of large-scale systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time Safety Index Adaptation for Parameter-varying Systems via Determinant Gradient Ascend</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Safety Index Synthesis (SIS) is critical for deriving safe control laws. Recent works propose to synthesize a safety index (SI) via nonlinear programming and derive a safe control law such that the system 1) achieves forward invariant (FI) with some safe set and 2) guarantees finite time convergence (FTC) to that safe set. However, real-world system dynamics can vary during run-time, making the control law infeasible and invalidating the initial SI. Since the full SIS nonlinear programming is computationally expensive, it is infeasible to re-synthesize the SI each time the dynamics are perturbed. To address that, this paper proposes an efficient approach to adapting the SI to varying system dynamics and maintaining the feasibility of the safe control law. The proposed method leverages determinant gradient ascend and derives a closed-form update to safety index parameters, enabling real-time adaptation performance. A numerical study validates the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>On the Solution Uniqueness of Data-Driven Modeling of Flexible Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter first explores the solution uniqueness of the data-driven modeling of price-responsive flexible loads (PFL). The PFL on the demand side is critical in modern power systems. An accurate PFL model is fundamental for system operations. Yet, whether the PFL model can be uniquely and correctly identified from operational data remains unclear. To address this, we analyze the structural and practical identifiability of the PFL model, deriving the condition for the solution uniqueness. Based on this, we point out the implications for selecting physical models of PFL to enhance the identification results. Numerical results validate this work.</description>

      <title>Implementation of Firm-Dispatchable Generation in South Africa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: South Africa is currently facing a critical situation in its power generation landscape, which is plagued by frequent power outages and the need to move from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. This period emphasizes the importance of having firm-dispatchable power to balance out the intermittent nature of wind and solar energy sources. The paper proposes to repurpose old coal-fired power plants to generate firm-dispatchable energy in line with the principles of a Just Transition. Eskom's coal plants are approaching the end of their economic life, and their declining energy availability factor is becoming a challenge in meeting the country's energy needs. The study suggests that a comprehensive strategy that integrates wind, solar, and firm-dispatchable power can be cost-effective and reliable compared to the traditional coal-based approach or the nuclear alternative. The study emphasizes the necessity of a 25-year plan that would invest in flexible and modular dispatchable generation. It also highlights the strategic location of this generating capacity, including repurposing decommissioned coal plant sites. The proposed model integrates private investment, adheres to established best practices, and emphasizes adaptability to changing demand dynamics. The study provides a roadmap for enabling firm-dispatchable capacity for South Africa's energy transition, emphasizing economic prudence, environmental sustainability, and alignment with the principles of the Just Transition program.</description>

      <title>Direct and Indirect Hydrogen Storage: Dynamics and Interactions in the Transition to a Renewable Energy Based System for Europe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15072v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To move towards a low-carbon society by 2050, understanding the intricate dynamics of energy systems is critical. Our study examines these interactions through the lens of hydrogen storage, dividing it into 'direct' and 'indirect' hydrogen storage. Direct hydrogen storage involves electrolysis-produced hydrogen being stored before use, while indirect storage first transforms hydrogen into gas via the Sabatier process for later energy distribution. Firstly, we utilize the PyPSA-Eur-Sec-30-path model to capture the interactions within the energy system. The model is an hour-level, one node per country system that encompasses a range of energy transformation technologies, outlining a pathway for Europe to reduce carbon emissions by 95 percent by 2050 compared to 1990, with updates every 5 years. Subsequently, we employ both quantitative and qualitative approaches to thoroughly analyze these complex relationships. Our research indicates that during the European green transition, cross-country flow of electricity will play an important role in Europe's rapid decarbonization stage before the large-scale introduction of energy storage. Under the paper cost assumptions, fuel cells are not considered a viable option. This research further identifies the significant impact of natural resource variability on the local energy mix, highlighting indirect hydrogen storage as a common solution due to the better economic performance and actively fluctuation pattern. Specifically, indirect hydrogen storage will contribute at least 60 percent of hydrogen storage benefits, reaching 100 percent in Italy. Moreover, its fluctuation pattern will change with the local energy structure, which is a distinct difference with the unchanged pattern of direct hydrogen storage and battery storage.</description>

      <title>Set-membership target search and tracking within an unknown cluttered area using cooperating UAVs equipped with vision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15113v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of target search and tracking using a fleet of cooperating UAVs evolving in some unknown region of interest containing an a priori unknown number of moving ground targets. Each drone is equipped with an embedded Computer Vision System (CVS), providing an image with labeled pixels and a depth map of the observed part of its environment. Moreover, a box containing the corresponding pixels in the image frame is available when a UAV identifies a target. Hypotheses regarding information provided by the pixel classification, depth map construction, and target identification algorithms are proposed to allow its exploitation by set-membership approaches. A set-membership target location estimator is developed using the information provided by the CVS. Each UAV evaluates sets guaranteed to contain the location of the identified targets and a set possibly containing the locations of targets still to be identified. Then, each UAV uses these sets to search and track targets cooperatively.</description>

      <title>Collision Avoidance Safety Filter for an Autonomous E-Scooter using Ultrasonic Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a collision avoidance safety filter for autonomous electric scooters to enable safe operation of such vehicles in pedestrian areas. In particular, we employ multiple low-cost ultrasonic sensors to detect a wide range of possible obstacles in front of the e-scooter. Based on possibly faulty distance measurements, we design a filter to mitigate measurement noise and missing values as well as a gain-scheduled controller to limit the velocity commanded to the e-scooter when required due to imminent collisions. The proposed controller structure is able to prevent collisions with unknown obstacles by deploying a reduced safe velocity ensuring a sufficiently large safety distance. The collision avoidance approach is designed such that it may be easily deployed in similar applications of general micromobility vehicles. The effectiveness of our proposed safety filter is demonstrated in real-world experiments.</description>

      <title>Hybrid integrator-gain system based integral resonant controllers for negative imaginary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid control system called a hybrid integrator-gain system (HIGS) based integral resonant controller (IRC) to stabilize negative imaginary (NI) systems. A HIGS-based IRC has a similar structure to an IRC, with the integrator replaced by a HIGS. We show that a HIGS-based IRC is an NI system. Also, for a SISO NI system with a minimal realization, we show there exists a HIGS-based IRC such that their closed-loop interconnection is asymptotically stable. Also, we propose a proportional-integral-double-integral resonant controller and a HIGS-based proportional-integral-double-integral resonant controller and show that both of them can be applied to asymptotically stabilize an NI system. An example is provided to illustrate the proposed results.</description>

      <title>Forecasting the load of Parcel Pickup Points using a Markov Jump Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growth of e-commerce has resulted in a surge in parcel deliveries, increasing transportation costs and pollution issues. Alternatives to home delivery have emerged, such as the delivery to so-called parcel pick-up points (PUPs), which eliminates delivery failure due to customers not being at home. Nevertheless, parcels reaching overloaded PUPs may need to be redirected to alternative PUPs, sometimes far from the chosen ones, which may generate customer dissatisfaction. Consequently, predicting the PUP load is critical for a PUP management company to infer the availability of PUPs for future orders and better balance parcel flows between PUPs.
  This paper proposes a new approach to forecasting the PUP load evolution using a Markov jump process that models the parcel life cycle. The latest known status of each parcel is considered to estimate its contribution to the future load of its target PUP. This approach can account for the variability of activity, the various parcel preparation delays by sellers, and the diversity of parcel carriers that may result in different delivery delays. Here, results are provided for predicting the load associated with parcels ordered from online retailers by customers (Business-to-Customer, B2C). The proposed approach is generic and can also be applied to other parcel flows to PUPs, such as second-hand products (Customer-to-Customer, C2C) sent via a PUP network.</description>

      <title>Control contraction metrics on Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the control contraction metrics (CCM) approach, which was originally proposed for the universal tracking control of nonlinear systems, to those that evolves on Lie groups. Our idea is to view the manifold as a constrained set that is embedded in Euclidean space, and then propose the sufficient conditions for the existence of a CCM and the associated controller design. Notably, we demonstrate that the search for CCM on Lie groups can be reformulated as convex conditions. The results extend the applicability of the CCM approach and provide a framework for analyzing the behavior of control systems with Lie group structures.</description>

      <title>Event-Triggered State Estimation Through Confidence Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers the state estimation problem for discrete-time linear systems under event-triggered scheme. In order to improve performance, a novel event-triggered scheme based on confidence level is proposed using the chi-square distribution and mild regularity assumption. In terms of the novel event-triggered scheme, a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) state estimator is proposed using some results presented in this paper. Two algorithms for communication rate estimation of the proposed MMSE state estimator are developed where the first algorithm is based on information with one-step delay, and the second algorithm is based on information with two-step delay. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed MMSE state estimator and the two communication rate estimation algorithms are illustrated using a target tracking scenario.</description>

      <title>Optimal Data-Driven Prediction and Predictive Control using Signal Matrix Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data-driven control uses a past signal trajectory to characterise the input-output behaviour of a system. Willems' lemma provides a data-based prediction model allowing a control designer to bypass the step of identifying a state-space or transfer function model. This paper provides a more parsimonious formulation of Willems' lemma that separates the model into initial condition matching and predictive control design parts. This avoids the need for regularisers in the predictive control problem that are found in other data-driven predictive control methods. It also gives a closed form expression for the optimal (minimum variance) unbiased predictor of the future output trajectory and applies it for predictive control. Simulation comparisons illustrate very good control performance.</description>

      <title>Cascading Blackout Severity Prediction with Statistically-Augmented Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher variability in grid conditions, resulting from growing renewable penetration and increased incidence of extreme weather events, has increased the difficulty of screening for scenarios that may lead to catastrophic cascading failures. Traditional power-flow-based tools for assessing cascading blackout risk are too slow to properly explore the space of possible failures and load/generation patterns. We add to the growing literature of faster graph-neural-network (GNN)-based techniques, developing two novel techniques for the estimation of blackout magnitude from initial grid conditions. First we propose several methods for employing an initial classification step to filter out safe "non blackout" scenarios prior to magnitude estimation. Second, using insights from the statistical properties of cascading blackouts, we propose a method for facilitating non-local message passing in our GNN models. We validate these two approaches on a large simulated dataset, and show the potential of both to increase blackout size estimation performance.</description>

      <title>Control Designs for Critical-Continegency Responsible Grid-Following Inverters and Seamless Transitions To and From Grid-Forming Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces two control frameworks: one for Grid-Following (GFL) inverters aiding Grid-Forming (GFM) inverters in voltage regulation during large contingency events and optimizing power transactions under normal conditions; and another for seamless transitions between grid-tied and grid-isolated setups, managing voltage transient characteristics. In microgrids, GFM inverters regulate voltage, while GFL inverters handle power transactions. The proposed GFL control detects abrupt load/generation changes, adjusting power transactions using local storage to support GFM inverters during contingencies. Additionally, a transition control ensures smooth GFL-GFM shifts, reducing power and voltage fluctuations. Simulation results validate improved voltage regulation during contingencies and enhanced power tracking during slow changes, alongside minimized transient overshoot.</description>

      <title>Initial Indications of Safety of Driverless Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As driverless automated driving systems (ADS) start to operate on public roads, there is an urgent need to understand how safely these systems are managing real-world traffic conditions. With data from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) becoming available for Transportation Network Companies (TNCs) operating in California with and without human drivers, there is an initial basis for comparing ADS and human driving safety.
  This paper analyzes the crash rates and characteristics for three types of driving: Uber ridesharing trips from the CPUC TNC Annual Report in 2020, supervised autonomous vehicles (AV) driving from the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) between December 2020 and November 2022, driverless ADS pilot (testing) and deployment (revenue service) program from Waymo and Cruise between March 2022 and August 2023. All of the driving was done within the city of San Francisco, excluding freeways. The same geographical confinement allows for controlling the exposure to vulnerable road users, population density, speed limit, and other external factors such as weather and road conditions. The study finds that supervised AV has almost equivalent crashes per million miles (CPMM) as Uber human driving, the driverless Waymo AV has a lower CPMM, and the driverless Cruise AV has a higher CPMM than Uber human driving. The data samples are not yet large enough to support conclusions about whether the current automated systems are more or less safe than human-operated vehicles in the complex San Francisco urban environment.</description>

      <title>Model order reduction of deep structured state-space models: A system-theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With a specific emphasis on control design objectives, achieving accurate system modeling with limited complexity is crucial in parametric system identification. The recently introduced deep structured state-space models (SSM), which feature linear dynamical blocks as key constituent components, offer high predictive performance. However, the learned representations often suffer from excessively large model orders, which render them unsuitable for control design purposes. The current paper addresses this challenge by means of system-theoretic model order reduction techniques that target the linear dynamical blocks of SSMs. We introduce two regularization terms which can be incorporated into the training loss for improved model order reduction. In particular, we consider modal $\ell_1$ and Hankel nuclear norm regularization to promote sparsity, allowing one to retain only the relevant states without sacrificing accuracy. The presented regularizers lead to advantages in terms of parsimonious representations and faster inference resulting from the reduced order models. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology is demonstrated using real-world ground vibration data from an aircraft.</description>

      <title>Joint Planning of Charging Stations and Power Systems for Heavy-Duty Drayage Trucks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14866v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As global concerns about climate change intensify, the transition towards zero-emission freight is becoming increasingly vital. Drayage is an important segment of the freight system, typically involving the transport of goods from seaports or intermodal terminals to nearby warehouses. This sector significantly contributes to not only greenhouse gas emissions, but also pollution in densely populated areas. This study presents a holistic optimization model designed for an efficient transition to zero-emission drayage, offering cost-effective strategies for the coordinated investment planning for power systems, charging infrastructure, and electric drayage trucks. The model is validated in the Greater Los Angeles area, where regulatory goals are among the most ambitious. Furthermore, the model's design allows for easy adaptation to other regions. By focusing on drayage trucks, this study also paves the way for future research into other freight categories, establishing a foundation for a more extensive exploration in this field.</description>

      <title>Network Learning with Directional Sign Patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complex systems can be effectively modeled via graphs that encode networked interactions, where relations between entities or nodes are often quantified by signed edge weights, e.g., promotion/inhibition in gene regulatory networks, or encoding political of friendship differences in social networks. However, it is often the case that only an aggregate consequence of such edge weights that characterize relations may be directly observable, as in protein expression of in gene regulatory networks. Thus, learning edge weights poses a significant challenge that is further exacerbated for intricate and large-scale networks. In this article, we address a model problem to determine the strength of sign-indefinite relations that explain marginal distributions that constitute our data. To this end, we develop a paradigm akin to that of the Schr\"odinger bridge problem and an efficient Sinkhorn type algorithm (more properly, Schr\"odinger-Fortet-Sinkhorn algorithm) that allows fast convergence to parameters that minimize a relative entropy/likelihood criterion between the sought signed adjacency matrix and a prior. The formalism that we present represents a novel generalization of the earlier Schr\"odinger formalism in that marginal computations may incorporate weights that model directionality in underlying relations, and further, that it can be extended to high-order networks -- the Schr\"odinger-Fortet-Sinkhorn algorithm that we derive is applicable all the same and allows geometric convergence to a sought sign-indefinite adjacency matrix or tensor, for high-order networks. We demonstrate our framework with synthetic and real-world examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14935v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel data-driven predictive control approach for systems subject to time-domain constraints. The approach combines the strengths of H-infinity control for rejecting disturbances and MPC for handling constraints. In particular, the approach can dynamically adapt H-infinity disturbance attenuation performance depending on measured system state and forecasted disturbance level to satisfy constraints. We establish theoretical properties of the approach including robust guarantees of closed-loop stability, disturbance attenuation, constraint satisfaction under noisy data, as well as sufficient conditions for recursive feasibility, and illustrate the approach with a numerical example.</description>

      <title>A Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient Algorithm for Autonomous Ground Vehicle Navigation via Digital Twin Perception Awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Autonomous ground vehicle (UGV) navigation has the potential to revolutionize the transportation system by increasing accessibility to disabled people, ensure safety and convenience of use. However, UGV requires extensive and efficient testing and evaluation to ensure its acceptance for public use. This testing are mostly done in a simulator which result to sim2real transfer gap. In this paper, we propose a digital twin perception awareness approach for the control of robot navigation without prior creation of the virtual environment (VT) environment state. To achieve this, we develop a twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) algorithm that ensures collision avoidance and goal-based path planning. We demonstrate the performance of our approach on different environment dynamics. We show that our approach is capable of efficiently avoiding collision with obstacles and navigating to its desired destination, while at the same time safely avoids obstacles using the information received from the LIDAR sensor mounted on the robot. Our approach bridges the gap between sim-to-real transfer and contributes to the adoption of UGVs in real world. We validate our approach in simulation and a real-world application in an office space.</description>

      <title>Improved Long Short-Term Memory-based Wastewater Treatment Simulators for Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Even though Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) showed outstanding results in the fields of Robotics and Games, it is still challenging to implement it in the optimization of industrial processes like wastewater treatment. One of the challenges is the lack of a simulation environment that will represent the actual plant as accurately as possible to train DRL policies. Stochasticity and non-linearity of wastewater treatment data lead to unstable and incorrect predictions of models over long time horizons. One possible reason for the models' incorrect simulation behavior can be related to the issue of compounding error, which is the accumulation of errors throughout the simulation. The compounding error occurs because the model utilizes its predictions as inputs at each time step. The error between the actual data and the prediction accumulates as the simulation continues. We implemented two methods to improve the trained models for wastewater treatment data, which resulted in more accurate simulators: 1- Using the model's prediction data as input in the training step as a tool of correction, and 2- Change in the loss function to consider the long-term predicted shape (dynamics). The experimental results showed that implementing these methods can improve the behavior of simulators in terms of Dynamic Time Warping throughout a year up to 98% compared to the base model. These improvements demonstrate significant promise in creating simulators for biological processes that do not need pre-existing knowledge of the process but instead depend exclusively on time series data obtained from the system.</description>

      <title>Infrastructure-Assisted Collaborative Perception in Automated Valet Parking: A Safety Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Environmental perception in Automated Valet Parking (AVP) has been a challenging task due to severe occlusions in parking garages. Although Collaborative Perception (CP) can be applied to broaden the field of view of connected vehicles, the limited bandwidth of vehicular communications restricts its application. In this work, we propose a BEV feature-based CP network architecture for infrastructure-assisted AVP systems. The model takes the roadside camera and LiDAR as optional inputs and adaptively fuses them with onboard sensors in a unified BEV representation. Autoencoder and downsampling are applied for channel-wise and spatial-wise dimension reduction, while sparsification and quantization further compress the feature map with little loss in data precision. Combining these techniques, the size of a BEV feature map is effectively compressed to fit in the feasible data rate of the NR-V2X network. With the synthetic AVP dataset, we observe that CP can effectively increase perception performance, especially for pedestrians. Moreover, the advantage of infrastructure-assisted CP is demonstrated in two typical safety-critical scenarios in the AVP setting, increasing the maximum safe cruising speed by up to 3m/s in both scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In classical works on a planar differential pursuit-evasion game with a faster pursuer, the intercept point resulting from the equilibrium strategies lies on the Apollonius circle. This property was exploited for the construction of the equilibrium strategies for two faster pursuers against one evader. Extensions for planar multiple-pursuer single-evader scenarios have been considered. We study a pursuit-evasion game on a sphere and the relation of the equilibrium intercept point to the Apollonius domain on the sphere. The domain is a generalization of the planar Apollonius circle set. We find a condition resulting in the intercept point belonging to the Apollonius domain, which is the characteristic of the planar game solution. Finally, we use this characteristic to discuss pursuit and evasion strategies in the context of two pursuers and a single slower evader on the sphere and illustrate it using numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decision making and learning in the presence of uncertainty has attracted significant attention in view of the increasing need to achieve robust and reliable operations. In the case where uncertainty stems from the presence of adversarial attacks this need is becoming more prominent. In this paper we focus on linear and nonlinear classification problems and propose a novel adversarial training method for robust classifiers, inspired by Support Vector Machine (SVM) margins. We view robustness under a data driven lens, and derive finite sample complexity bounds for both linear and non-linear classifiers in binary and multi-class scenarios. Notably, our bounds match natural classifiers' complexity. Our algorithm minimizes a worst-case surrogate loss using Linear Programming (LP) and Second Order Cone Programming (SOCP) for linear and non-linear models. Numerical experiments on the benchmark MNIST and CIFAR10 datasets show our approach's comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods, without needing adversarial examples during training. Our work offers a comprehensive framework for enhancing binary linear and non-linear classifier robustness, embedding robustness in learning under the presence of adversaries.</description>

Abstract: We present a simple and effective way to account for non-convex costs and constraints~in~state feedback synthesis, and an interpretation for the variables in which state feedback synthesis is typically convex. We achieve this by deriving the controller design using moment matrices of state and input. It turns out that this approach allows the consideration of non-convex constraints by relaxing them as expectation constraints, and that the variables in which state feedback synthesis is typically convexified can be identified with blocks of these moment matrices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of determining the optimal exploration strategy in an unconstrained scalar optimization problem depending on an unknown parameter to be learned from online collected noisy data. An optimal trade-off between exploration and exploitation is crucial for effective optimization under uncertainties, and to achieve this we consider a cumulative regret minimization approach over a finite horizon, with each time instant in the horizon characterized by a stochastic exploration signal, whose variance has to be designed. In this setting, under an idealized assumption on an appropriately defined information function associated with the excitation, we are able to show that the optimal exploration strategy is either to use no exploration at all (called lazy exploration) or adding an exploration excitation only at the first time instant of the horizon (called immediate exploration). A quadratic numerical example is used to illustrate the results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

      <description>arXiv:2211.06003v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a $H_\infty$-like methodology of coherent filtering for equalization of passive linear quantum systems to help mitigate degrading effects of quantum communication channels. For such systems, which include a wide range of linear quantum optical devices and signals, we seek to find a near optimal equalizing filter which is itself a passive quantum system. The problem amounts to solving an optimization problem subject to constraints dictated by the requirement for the equalizer to be physically realizable. By formulating these constraints in the frequency domain, we show that the problem admits a convex $H_\infty$-like formulation. This allows us to derive a set of suboptimal coherent equalizers using $J$-spectral factorization. An additional semidefinite relaxation combined with the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation is shown to lead to a tractable algorithm for the design of a near optimal coherent equalizer.</description>

      <title>DRAMS: Double-RIS Assisted Multihop Routing Scheme for Device-to-Device Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) is a promising solution for enhancing the performance of multihop wireless communication networks. In this paper, we propose a double-RIS assisted multihop routing scheme for a device-to-device (D2D) communication network. Specifically, the scheme is dependent on the already deployed RISs and users in the surroundings. Besides the RISs, the emphasis of this work is to make more use of the existing intermediate users (IUs), which can act as relays. Hence, the density of RIS deployment in the surroundings can be reduced, which leads to the avoidance of resource wastage. However, we cannot solely depend on the IUs because this implies complete dependence on their availability for relaying and as a result, the aspect of reliability in terms of delay-constrained information transfer cannot be guaranteed. Moreover, the IUs are considered capable of energy harvesting and as a result, they do not waste their own energy in the process of volunteering to act as a relay for other users. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed scheme over some existing approaches and lastly, useful insights related to the scheme design are also drawn, where we characterize the maximum acceptable delay at each hop under different set-ups.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Framework for Influencing Human Driving Behavior in Mixed-Autonomy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As autonomous vehicles (AVs) become increasingly prevalent, their interaction with human drivers presents a critical challenge. Current AVs lack social awareness, causing behavior that is often awkward or unsafe. To combat this, social AVs, which are proactive rather than reactive in their behavior, have been explored in recent years. With knowledge of robot-human interaction dynamics, a social AV can influence a human driver to exhibit desired behaviors by strategically altering its own behaviors. In this paper, we present a novel framework for achieving human influence. The foundation of our framework lies in an innovative use of control barrier functions to formulate the desired objectives of influence as constraints in an optimal control problem. The computed controls gradually push the system state toward satisfaction of the objectives, e.g. slowing the human down to some desired speed. We demonstrate the proposed framework's feasibility in a variety of scenarios related to car-following and lane changes, including multi-robot and multi-human configurations. In two case studies, we validate the framework's effectiveness when applied to the problems of traffic flow optimization and aggressive behavior mitigation. Given these results, the main contribution of our framework is its versatility in a wide spectrum of influence objectives and mixed-autonomy configurations.</description>

      <title>Scalable Neural Dynamic Equivalence for Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.16950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Traditional grid analytics are model-based, relying strongly on accurate models of power systems, especially the dynamic models of generators, controllers, loads and other dynamic components. However, acquiring thorough power system models can be impractical in real operation due to inaccessible system parameters and privacy of consumers, which necessitate data-driven dynamic equivalencing of unknown subsystems. Learning reliable dynamic equivalent models for the external systems from SCADA and PMU data, however, is a long-standing intractable problem in power system analysis due to complicated nonlinearity and unforeseeable dynamic modes of power systems. This paper advances a practical application of neural dynamic equivalence (NeuDyE) called Driving Port NeuDyE (DP-NeuDyE), which exploits physics-informed machine learning and neural-ordinary-differential-equations (ODE-NET) to discover a dynamic equivalence of external power grids while preserving its dynamic behaviors after disturbances. The new contributions are threefold: A NeuDyE formulation to enable a continuous-time, data-driven dynamic equivalence of power systems, saving the effort and expense of acquiring inaccessible system; An introduction of a Physics-Informed NeuDyE learning (PI-NeuDyE) to actively control the closed-loop accuracy of NeuDyE; and A DP-NeuDyE to reduce the number of inputs required for the training. We conduct extensive case studies on the NPCC system to validate the generalizability and accuracy of both PI-NeuDyE and DP-NeuDyE, which span a multitude of scenarios, differing in the time required for fault clearance, the specific fault locations, and the limitations of data. Test results have demonstrated the scalability and practicality of NeuDyE, showing its potential to be used in ISO and utility control centers for online transient stability analysis and for planning purposes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies the problem of developing computationally efficient solutions for steering the distribution of the state of a stochastic, linear dynamical system between two boundary Gaussian distributions in the presence of chance-constraints on the state and control input. It is assumed that the state is only partially available through a measurement model corrupted with noise. The filtered state is reconstructed with a Kalman filter, the chance constraints are reformulated as difference of convex (DC) constraints, and the resulting covariance control problem is reformulated as a DC program, which is solved using successive convexification. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated on a double integrator example with varying time horizons, and is compared to other state-of-the-art chance constrained covariance control methods.</description>

      <title>Representative Days and Hours with Piecewise Linear Transitions for Power System Planning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electric demand and renewable power are highly variable, and the solution of a planning model relies on capturing this variability. This paper proposes a hybrid multi-area method that effectively captures both the intraday and interday chronology of real data considering extreme values, using a limited number of representative days, and time points within each day. An optimization-based representative extraction method is proposed to improve intraday chronology capturing. It ensures higher precision in preserving data chronology and extreme values than hierarchical clustering methods. The proposed method is based on a piecewise linear demand and supply representation, which reduces approximation errors compared to the traditional piecewise constant formulation. Additionally, sequentially linked day blocks with identical representatives, created through a mapping process, are employed for interday chronology capturing. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method, a comprehensive expansion co-planning model is developed, including transmission lines, energy storage systems, and wind farms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11760v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces an efficient power management approach for shipboard microgrids that integrates diesel generators, a fuel cell, and battery energy storage system. This strategy addresses both unit commitment and power dispatch, considering the zero-emission capability of the ship, as well as optimizing the ship's speed. The optimization is done through mixed integer linear programming with the objective of minimizing the operational cost of all the power resources. Evaluations are conducted on a notional all-electric ship, with electrical load simulated using a Markov chain based on actual measurement data. The findings underscore the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in optimizing fuel consumption while ensuring protection against blackout occurrences.</description>

Abstract: The optimal controller design problem for systems equipped with sensors that measure only relative, rather than absolute, quantities is considered. This relative measurement structure is formulated as a design constraint; it is demonstrated that the resulting constrained controller design problem can be written as a convex program. Certain additional network structural constraints can be incorporated into this formulation, making it especially useful in distributed or networked settings. An illustrative example highlights the advantage of the proposed methodology over the standard formulation of the output feedback controller design problem. A numerical example is provided.</description>

      <title>A Wind-Aware Path Planning Method for UAV-Asisted Bridge Inspection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10519v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In response to the gap in considering wind conditions in the bridge inspection using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) , this paper proposes a path planning method for UAVs that takes into account the influence of wind, based on the simulated annealing algorithm. The algorithm considers the wind factors, including the influence of different wind speeds and directions at the same time on the path planning of the UAV. Firstly, An environment model is constructed specifically for UAV bridge inspection, taking into account the various objective functions and constraint conditions of UAVs. A more sophisticated and precise mathematical model is then developed based on this environmental model to enable efficient and effective UAV path planning. Secondly, the bridge separation planning model is applied in a novel way, and a series of parameters are simulated, including the adjustment of the initial temperature value. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared with traditional local search algorithms, the proposed method achieves a cost reduction of 30.05\% and significantly improves effectiveness. Compared to path planning methods that do not consider wind factors, the proposed approach yields more realistic and practical results for UAV applications, as demonstrated by its improved effectiveness in simulations. These findings highlight the value of our method in facilitating more accurate and efficient UAV path planning in wind-prone environments.</description>

      <title>A Control-Recoverable Added-Noise-based Privacy Scheme for LQ Control in Networked Control Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13346v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As networked control systems continue to evolve, ensuring the privacy of sensitive data becomes an increasingly pressing concern, especially in situations where the controller is physically separated from the plant. In this paper, we propose a secure control scheme for computing linear quadratic control in a networked control system utilizing two networked controllers, a privacy encoder and a control restorer. Specifically, the encoder generates two state signals blurred with random noise and sends them to the controllers, while the restorer reconstructs the correct control signal. The proposed design effectively preserves the privacy of the control system's state without sacrificing the control performance. We theoretically quantify the privacy-preserving performance in terms of the state estimation error of the controllers and the disclosure probability. Additionally, the proposed privacy-preserving scheme is also proven to satisfy differential privacy. Moreover, we extend the proposed privacy-preserving scheme and evaluation method to cases where collusion between two controllers occurs. Finally, we verify the validity of our proposed scheme through simulations.</description>

      <title>A Benchmark for the Application of Distributed Control Techniques to the Electricity Network of the European Economic Area</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The European Economic Area Electricity Network Benchmark (EEA-ENB) is a multi-area power system representing the European network of transmission systems for electricity to facilitate the application of distributed control techniques. In the EEA-ENB we consider the Load Frequency Control (LFC) problem in the presence of renewable energy sources (RESs), and energy storage systems (ESSs). RESs are known to cause instability in power networks due to their inertia-less and intermittent characteristics, while ESSs are introduced as a resource to mitigate the problem. In the EEA-ENB, particular attention is dedicated to Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC), whose application is often limited to small and homogeneous test cases due to the lack of standardized large-scale scenarios for testing, and due to the large computation time required to obtain a centralized MPC action for performance comparison with DMPC strategies under consideration. The second problem is exacerbated when the scale of the system grows. To address these challenges and to provide a real-world-based and control-independent benchmark, the EEA-ENB has been developed. The benchmark includes a centralized MPC strategy providing performance and computation time metrics to compare distributed control within a repeatable and realistic simulation environment.</description>

Abstract: This paper highlights the importance of maintenance techniques in the coming industrial revolution, reviews the evolution of maintenance techniques, and presents a comprehensive literature review on the latest advancement of maintenance techniques, i.e., Predictive Maintenance (PdM), with emphasis on system architectures, optimization objectives, and optimization methods. In industry, any outages and unplanned downtime of machines or systems would degrade or interrupt a company's core business, potentially resulting in significant penalties and immeasurable reputation and economic loss. Existing traditional maintenance approaches, such as Reactive Maintenance (RM) and Preventive Maintenance (PM), suffer from high prevent and repair costs, inadequate or inaccurate mathematical degradation processes, and manual feature extraction. The incoming fourth industrial revolution is also demanding for a new maintenance paradigm to reduce the maintenance cost and downtime, and increase system availability and reliability. Predictive Maintenance (PdM) is envisioned the solution. In this survey, we first provide a high-level view of the PdM system architectures including PdM 4.0, Open System Architecture for Condition Based Monitoring (OSA-CBM), and cloud-enhanced PdM system. Then, we review the specific optimization objectives, which mainly comprise cost minimization, availability/reliability maximization, and multi-objective optimization. Furthermore, we present the optimization methods to achieve the aforementioned objectives, which include traditional Machine Learning (ML) based and Deep Learning (DL) based approaches. Finally, we highlight the future research directions that are critical to promote the application of DL techniques in the context of PdM.</description>

      <title>Graph-structured tensor optimization for nonlinear density control and mean field games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05645v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we develop a numerical method for solving a type of convex graph-structured tensor optimization problems. This type of problems, which can be seen as a generalization of multi-marginal optimal transport problems with graph-structured costs, appear in many applications. Examples are unbalanced optimal transport and multi-species potential mean field games, where the latter is a class of nonlinear density control problems. The method we develop is based on coordinate ascent in a Lagrangian dual, and under mild assumptions we prove that the algorithm converges globally. Moreover, under a set of stricter assumptions, the algorithm converges R-linearly. To perform the coordinate ascent steps one has to compute projections of the tensor, and doing so by brute force is in general not computationally feasible. Nevertheless, for certain graph structures it is possible to derive efficient methods for computing these projections, and here we specifically consider the graph structure that occurs in multi-species potential mean field games. We also illustrate the methodology on a numerical example from this problem class.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of optimally designing a system for repeated use under uncertainty. We develop a modeling framework that integrates design and operational phases, which are represented by a mixed-integer program and discounted-cost infinite-horizon Markov decision processes, respectively. We seek to simultaneously minimize the design costs and the subsequent expected operational costs. This problem setting arises naturally in several application areas, as we illustrate through examples. We derive a bilevel mixed-integer linear programming formulation for the problem and perform a computational study to demonstrate that realistic instances can be solved numerically.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a data-driven control method for systems with aleatoric uncertainty, for example, robot fleets with variations between agents. Our method leverages shared trajectory data to increase the robustness of the designed controller and thus facilitate transfer to new variations without the need for prior parameter and uncertainty estimations. In contrast to existing work on experience transfer for performance, our approach focuses on robustness and uses data collected from multiple realizations to guarantee generalization to unseen ones. Our method is based on scenario optimization combined with recent formulations for direct data-driven control. We derive lower bounds on the amount of data required to achieve quadratic stability for probabilistic systems with aleatoric uncertainty and demonstrate the benefits of our data-driven method through a numerical example. We find that the learned controllers generalize well to high variations in the dynamics even when based on only a few short open-loop trajectories. Robust experience transfer enables the design of safe and robust controllers that work out of the box without any additional learning during deployment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01674v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: (Economic) nonlinear model predictive control ((e)NMPC) requires dynamic models that are sufficiently accurate and computationally tractable. Data-driven surrogate models for mechanistic models can reduce the computational burden of (e)NMPC; however, such models are typically trained by system identification for maximum prediction accuracy on simulation samples and perform suboptimally in (e)NMPC. We present a method for end-to-end reinforcement learning of Koopman surrogate models for optimal performance as part of (e)NMPC. We apply our method to two applications derived from an established nonlinear continuous stirred-tank reactor model. The controller performance is compared to that of (e)NMPCs utilizing models trained using system identification, and model-free neural network controllers trained using reinforcement learning. We show that the end-to-end trained models outperform those trained using system identification in (e)NMPC, and that, in contrast to the neural network controllers, the (e)NMPC controllers can react to changes in the control setting without retraining.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) using world models has found significant recent successes. However, when a sudden change to world mechanics or properties occurs then agent performance and reliability can dramatically decline. We refer to the sudden change in visual properties or state transitions as novelties. Implementing novelty detection within generated world model frameworks is a crucial task for protecting the agent when deployed. In this paper, we propose straightforward bounding approaches to incorporate novelty detection into world model RL agents, by utilizing the misalignment of the world model's hallucinated states and the true observed states as an anomaly score. We provide effective approaches to detecting novelties in a distribution of transitions learned by an agent in a world model. Finally, we show the advantage of our work in a novel environment compared to traditional machine learning novelty detection methods as well as currently accepted RL focused novelty detection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Stabilizing reinforcement learning control: A modular framework for optimizing over all stable behavior</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.14098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for the design of feedback controllers that combines the optimization-driven and model-free advantages of deep reinforcement learning with the stability guarantees provided by using the Youla-Kucera parameterization to define the search domain. Recent advances in behavioral systems allow us to construct a data-driven internal model; this enables an alternative realization of the Youla-Kucera parameterization based entirely on input-output exploration data. Perhaps of independent interest, we formulate and analyze the stability of such data-driven models in the presence of noise. The Youla-Kucera approach requires a stable "parameter" for controller design. For the training of reinforcement learning agents, the set of all stable linear operators is given explicitly through a matrix factorization approach. Moreover, a nonlinear extension is given using a neural network to express a parameterized set of stable operators, which enables seamless integration with standard deep learning libraries. Finally, we show how these ideas can also be applied to tune fixed-structure controllers.</description>

      <title>Positive Competitive Networks for Sparse Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.03821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and analyze a continuous-time firing-rate neural network, the positive firing-rate competitive network (\pfcn), to tackle sparse reconstruction problems with non-negativity constraints. These problems, which involve approximating a given input stimulus from a dictionary using a set of sparse (active) neurons, play a key role in a wide range of domains, including for example neuroscience, signal processing, and machine learning. First, by leveraging the theory of proximal operators, we relate the equilibria of a family of continuous-time firing-rate neural networks to the optimal solutions of sparse reconstruction problems. Then, we prove that the \pfcn is a positive system and give rigorous conditions for the convergence to the equilibrium. Specifically, we show that the convergence: (i) only depends on a property of the dictionary; (ii) is linear-exponential, in the sense that initially the convergence rate is at worst linear and then, after a transient, it becomes exponential. We also prove a number of technical results to assess the contractivity properties of the neural dynamics of interest. Our analysis leverages contraction theory to characterize the behavior of a family of firing-rate competitive networks for sparse reconstruction with and without non-negativity constraints. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach via a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Empowering Autonomous Driving with Large Language Models: A Safety Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.00812v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) encounters significant safety hurdles in long-tail unforeseen driving scenarios, largely stemming from the non-interpretability and poor generalization of the deep neural networks within the AD system, particularly in out-of-distribution and uncertain data. To this end, this paper explores the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into AD systems, leveraging their robust common-sense knowledge and reasoning abilities. The proposed methodologies employ LLMs as intelligent decision-makers in behavioral planning, augmented with a safety verifier shield for contextual safety learning, for enhancing driving performance and safety. We present two key studies in a simulated environment: an adaptive LLM-conditioned Model Predictive Control (MPC) and an LLM-enabled interactive behavior planning scheme with a state machine. Demonstrating superior performance and safety metrics compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our approach shows the promising potential for using LLMs for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Sparse Mean Field Load Balancing in Large Localized Queueing Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalable load balancing algorithms are of great interest in cloud networks and data centers, necessitating the use of tractable techniques to compute optimal load balancing policies for good performance. However, most existing scalable techniques, especially asymptotically scaling methods based on mean field theory, have not been able to model large queueing networks with strong locality. Meanwhile, general multi-agent reinforcement learning techniques can be hard to scale and usually lack a theoretical foundation. In this work, we address this challenge by leveraging recent advances in sparse mean field theory to learn a near-optimal load balancing policy in sparsely connected queueing networks in a tractable manner, which may be preferable to global approaches in terms of wireless communication overhead. Importantly, we obtain a general load balancing framework for a large class of sparse bounded-degree wireless topologies. By formulating a novel mean field control problem in the context of graphs with bounded degree, we reduce the otherwise difficult multi-agent problem to a single-agent problem. Theoretically, the approach is justified by approximation guarantees. Empirically, the proposed methodology performs well on several realistic and scalable wireless network topologies as compared to a number of well-known load balancing heuristics and existing scalable multi-agent reinforcement learning methods.</description>

      <title>Inferentialist Resource Semantics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In systems modelling, a system typically comprises located resources relative to which processes execute. One important use of logic in informatics is in modelling such systems for the purpose of reasoning (perhaps automated) about their behaviour and properties. To this end, one requires an interpretation of logical formulae in terms of the resources and states of the system; such an interpretation is called a resource semantics of the logic. This paper shows how inferentialism -- the view that meaning is given in terms of inferential behaviour -- enables a versatile and expressive framework for resource semantics. Specifically, how inferentialism seamlessly incorporates the assertion-based approach of the logic of Bunched Implications, foundational in program verification (e.g., as the basis of Separation Logic), and the renowned number-of-uses reading of Linear Logic. This integration enables reasoning about shared and separated resources in intuitive and familiar ways, as well as about the composition and interfacing of system components.</description>

      <title>Learning Hierarchical Control For Multi-Agent Capacity-Constrained Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel data-driven hierarchical control scheme for managing a fleet of nonlinear, capacity-constrained autonomous agents in an iterative environment. We propose a control framework consisting of a high-level dynamic task assignment and routing layer and low-level motion planning and tracking layer. Each layer of the control hierarchy uses a data-driven Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy, maintaining bounded computational complexity at each calculation of a new task assignment or actuation input. We utilize collected data to iteratively refine estimates of agent capacity usage, and update MPC policy parameters accordingly. Our approach leverages tools from iterative learning control to integrate learning at both levels of the hierarchy, and coordinates learning between levels in order to maintain closed-loop feasibility and performance improvement of the connected architecture.</description>
