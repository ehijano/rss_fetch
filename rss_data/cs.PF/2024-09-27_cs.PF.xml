      <title>EfiMon: A Process Analyser for Granular Power Consumption Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17368v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-performance computing (HPC) and supercomputing are critical in Artificial Intelligence (AI) research, development, and deployment. The extensive use of supercomputers for training complex AI models, which can take from days to months, raises significant concerns about energy consumption and carbon emissions. Traditional methods for estimating the energy consumption of HPC workloads rely on metering reports from computing nodes power supply units, assuming exclusive use of the entire node. This assumption is increasingly untenable with the advent of next-generation supercomputers that share resources to accelerate workloads, as seen in initiatives like Acceleration as a Service (XaaS) and cloud computing.
  This paper introduces EfiMon, an agnostic and non-invasive tool designed to extract detailed information about process execution, including instructions executed within specific time windows and CPU and RAM usage. Additionally, it captures comprehensive system metrics, such as power consumption reported by CPU sockets and PSUs. This data enables the development of prediction models to estimate the energy consumption of individual processes without requiring isolation.
  Using a regression-based mathematical model, our tool is able to estimate single processes' power consumption in isolated and shared resource environments. In shared scenarios, the model demonstrates robust performance, deviating by a maximum of 2.2% on Intel-based machines and 4.4% on AMD systems compared to non-shared cases. This significant accuracy showcases EfiMon's potential for enhancing energy accounting in supercomputing, contributing to more efficient and energy-aware optimisation strategies in HPC.</description>

      <title>VectorSearch: Enhancing Document Retrieval with Semantic Embeddings and Optimized Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional retrieval methods have been essential for assessing document similarity but struggle with capturing semantic nuances. Despite advancements in latent semantic analysis (LSA) and deep learning, achieving comprehensive semantic understanding and accurate retrieval remains challenging due to high dimensionality and semantic gaps. The above challenges call for new techniques to effectively reduce the dimensions and close the semantic gaps. To this end, we propose VectorSearch, which leverages advanced algorithms, embeddings, and indexing techniques for refined retrieval. By utilizing innovative multi-vector search operations and encoding searches with advanced language models, our approach significantly improves retrieval accuracy. Experiments on real-world datasets show that VectorSearch outperforms baseline metrics, demonstrating its efficacy for large-scale retrieval tasks.</description>

      <title>Results of the Big ANN: NeurIPS'23 competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17424v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2023 Big ANN Challenge, held at NeurIPS 2023, focused on advancing the state-of-the-art in indexing data structures and search algorithms for practical variants of Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) search that reflect the growing complexity and diversity of workloads. Unlike prior challenges that emphasized scaling up classical ANN search ~\cite{DBLP:conf/nips/SimhadriWADBBCH21}, this competition addressed filtered search, out-of-distribution data, sparse and streaming variants of ANNS. Participants developed and submitted innovative solutions that were evaluated on new standard datasets with constrained computational resources. The results showcased significant improvements in search accuracy and efficiency over industry-standard baselines, with notable contributions from both academic and industrial teams. This paper summarizes the competition tracks, datasets, evaluation metrics, and the innovative approaches of the top-performing submissions, providing insights into the current advancements and future directions in the field of approximate nearest neighbor search.</description>
