      <title>Heterogeneous Ensemble Enables a Universal Uncertainty Metric for Atomistic Foundation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universal machine learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) are reshaping atomistic simulation as foundation models, delivering near \textit{ab initio} accuracy at a fraction of the cost. Yet the lack of reliable, general uncertainty quantification limits their safe, wide-scale use. Here we introduce a unified, scalable uncertainty metric \(U\) based on a heterogeneous model ensemble with reuse of pretrained uMLIPs. Across chemically and structurally diverse datasets, \(U\) shows a strong correlation with the true prediction errors and provides a robust ranking of configuration-level risk. Leveraging this metric, we propose an uncertainty-aware model distillation framework to produce system-specific potentials: for W, an accuracy comparable to full-DFT training is achieved using only \(4\%\) of the DFT labels; for MoNbTaW, no additional DFT calculations are required. Notably, by filtering numerical label noise, the distilled models can, in some cases, surpass the accuracy of the DFT reference labels. The uncertainty-aware approach offers a practical monitor of uMLIP reliability in deployment, and guides data selection and fine-tuning strategies, thereby advancing the construction and safe use of foundation models and enabling cost-efficient development of accurate, system-specific potentials.</description>

      <title>Investigating the effects of local environment on nitrogen vacancies in high entropy metal nitrides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High entropy metal nitrides are an important material class in a variety of applications, and the role of nitrogen vacancies is of great importance for understanding their stability and mechanical properties. We study six different high entropy nitrides with eight different metal species to build a predictive model of the nitrogen vacancy formation energy. We construct sets of supercells that maximize the number of unique nitrogen environments for a given chemistry, and then use density-functional theory to calculate the energy density for all nitrogen sites, and the vacancy formation energies for the highest, lowest, and a median subset based on the energy densities. The energy density of nitrogen sites correlates with the vacancy formation energies, for binary, ternary and high entropy nitrides. A linear regression model predicts the vacancy formation energies using only the nearest-neighbor composition; across our eight metals, we find the largest vacancy formation energies next to Hf, then Zr, Ti, V, Cr, Ta, Nb, and the lowest near Mo. Additionally, we see that binary nitride data shows qualitatively similar vacancy formation energy trends for high entropy nitrides; however, the binary data alone is insufficient to predict the complex nitride behavior. Our model is both predictive and easily interpretable, and correlates with experimental data.</description>

      <title>Lifting spin degeneracy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene for high magnetoresistance applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many exotic properties in rhombohedral (or ABC-stacked) multilayer graphene have recently been reported experimentally. In this Letter, we first reveal the underlying mechanism of spin degeneracy lifting in rhombohedral trilayer graphene. Then, we propose a design concept for all-rhombohedral graphene-based magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) by utilizing pristine, back-gated, and top-gated ABC-stacked trilayer graphene, which exhibit semimetallic (conducting), semiconducting (insulating), and half-metallic (ferromagnetic) behavior, respectively. This enables the realization of an "all-in-one" magnetic tunnel junction based entirely on trilayer graphene. This design enables voltage-controlled spintronics (lower power than conventional MTJs) with perfect interfacial matching and sub-nm thickness uniformity across 4-inch wafers. Using first-principles calculations and the non-equilibrium Greens function, we comprehensively study electronic structures and transport properties of these all-graphene MTJs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that their characteristics can be tuned via a perpendicular electric field and electron doping. Our findings offer a new concept for the development of fully graphene-based spintronic devices utilizing the three distinct electronic phases of rhombohedral trilayer graphene.</description>

      <title>Gateways to Orbital and Spin Hall Effects in Rh-Doped Altermagnetic RuO$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ruthenium dioxide (RuO$_2$) has recently emerged as a prototypical material for exploring the fundamental properties of altermagnets. In this work, we investigate the impact of Rhodium (Rh) doping on the electronic and transport characteristics of altermagnetic RuO$_2$ using first-principles calculations. We show that Rh substitution at Ru sites modifies the spin-splitting of electronic bands across momentum space and reshapes the spin-resolved Fermi surface topology. These changes are found to significantly influence both the spin Hall and orbital Hall effects. In particular, we demonstrate that the orbital Berry curvature is strongly modulated by the doping concentration, opening new avenues for tuning orbital transport responses in multi-orbital systems without relying on strong spin-orbit coupling. Our results suggest that Rh-doped RuO$_2$ provides a versatile platform for engineering spin and orbital Hall effects in altermagnetic materials, and contributes to the growing efforts in designing next-generation orbitronic and spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Revisiting THz absorption in GO and rGO liquid crystalline films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With a swift progress in modern high-throughput communication systems, security, sensing and medicine utilizing THz range technologies, the demand for easy-to-fabricate, lightweight and high-performance absorbing materials has increased drastically. Notably, traditional approaches of eliminating unwanted radiation based on metasurfaces often face fabrication challenges limiting their practicality. In this study, we propose a straightforward approach for fabricating graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) liquid crystalline (LC) films via the vacuum filtration method and investigate their THz absorption characteristics. Here, the presence of LC phase in our electrochemically exfoliated GO and rGO LC films was confirmed by ellipsometric characterization. THz time-domain spectroscopy (TDS) measurements reveal that these films possess a low reflectance and transmittance confirming their strong absorptive properties within 0.4 - 1.6 THz frequency range for 2 micrometer thick GO and rGO LC films. Particularly, the GOLC film shows 37 % average absorption at a thickness of 2.12 micrometer, which is 221 times smaller than the central wavelength. Similarly, the rGOLC film reaches 50 % absorption with a 1.68 micrometer thickness, 279 times smaller than the central wavelength. These findings provide valuable insights for development of GO- and rGO-based LC THz absorbers with highly tunable properties due to the ordering of GO flakes. Specifically, the LC phase of GO contributes to the formation of more uniform films with enhanced absorption due to the compact stacking and denser packing, compared to conventional GO films with randomly oriented GO flakes.</description>

      <title>Theoretical investigations of the origin of persistent luminescence in spinel oxides MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4 have attracted significant interest due to their unique intrinsic persistent luminescence, offering promising potential for various applications. In this paper, from the perspective of defect physics, we systemically investigate the origin of persistent luminescence phenomena in pristine MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4, employing accurate hybrid functional calculations. Our results show that vacancies and antisite defects involving the two cations are the dominant point defects in both materials. Our calculated optical excitation and emission peaks associated with the MgGa defect agree well with the experimentally observed blue luminescence peak at about 2.9 eV in MgGa2O4. In MgAl2O4, the intradefect optical transition within the VO-MgAl donor-acceptor defect complex is identified as a likely origin for the observed 2.7 eV emission peak. Furthermore, the calculated radiative recombination coefficients of MgGa and VO-MgAl are significantly higher than their nonradiative counterparts, supporting their roles as efficient luminescent centers. Our results regarding the optical processes of oxygen vacancy VO in MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4 are also in good agreement with experimental results. Based on the calculated defect thermodynamic transition levels, the intrinsic persistent luminescence in MgGa2O4 and MgAl2O4 may be attributed to electron traps, GaMg and VO, in the former and a hole trap, MgAl, in the latter. Donor-acceptor defect complexes (VO+VMg and VO+VGa) are also found to serve as effective carrier trapping centers in MgGa2O4. The calculated trap depths are also consistent with thermoluminescence spectroscopy measurements.</description>

Abstract: We report a quantum oscillation study in the Dirac nodal-line semimetal candidate TaPtTe$_5$. The Fermi surface is probed via magnetic torque measurements with the magnetic field applied in the crystallographic a-b and b-c planes. The experimentally determined de Haas - van Alphen frequencies are consistent with results from band structure calculations. This study serves as an extension to the scarce quantum oscillation data on TaPtTe$_5$ currently present in the literature.</description>

      <title>Ultralow Lattice Thermal Conductivity Induced by Quasi-Chain Configuration in Rb2Se3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alkali metal-based compounds have garnered significant attention due to their exceptionally low lattice thermal conductivity, which is crucial for applications in thermoelectric energy conversion and thermal barrier coatings. However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying such ultralow lattice thermal conductivity remain poorly understood. In this study, we investigate the intrinsic origins of the ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in the alkali metal-based ionic compound Rb2Se3, which exhibits a simple orthorhombic structure. By employing first-principles density functional theory (DFT) and solving the phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE), we reveal that Rb2Se3 achieves lattice thermal conductivity values below 0.2 W/mK along all crystallographic directions at 300 K. Our analysis uncovers a unique quasi-chain configuration within the crystal structure, characterized by strongly covalent Se-Se-Se trimers that act as localized rigid units, while Rb atoms occupy weakly bonded interstitial sites. This configuration induces pronounced anisotropy, weak bonding, and strong anharmonicity, leading to significant rattling-like behavior of all atoms and a dominance of low-frequency phonon modes. The interplay between the rigid Se trimers and the soft Rb matrix results in extreme phonon anharmonicity, as evidenced by large Gruneisen parameters and high atomic displacement parameters (ADPs). These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the low lattice thermal conductivity in Rb2Se3 and establish a universal framework for designing low lattice thermal conductivity materials through the combination of rigid covalent clusters and soft ionic sublattices.</description>

      <title>Field driven Metal-Insulator transition in rhombohedral Bismuth and Arsenic crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The metal to insulator (MIT) transition is accompanied with huge changes in physical responses by the control and tuning of experimental parameters like doping, pressure, chemical composition, and magnetic field. Here, we study the magnetic field driven MIT for two pnictides in their elemental form, namely Arsenic and Bismuth. At low temperatures, Bismuth shows an unusual behaviour of a re-entrant IMT at high fields in addition to a higher temperature MIT at smaller fields. However, Arsenic shows the commonly observed single MIT. The Shubnikov de Haas (SdH) oscillations are observed for both As and Bi below 10 K, elucidating their two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) behaviour at low temperatures. Giant magneto-resistance of the order of 10^5 percent (MR percent) is observed for both crystals at 2 K and 14 Tesla transverse magnetic field. Based on a microscopic model, the microscopic processes underpinning the unusual features of a field-driven MIT and re-entrant IMT, along with the relevance of both excitonic and Bose metal correlations near these incipient instabilities, are qualitatively described in the framework of field-driven excitonic condensate and Das-Doniach preformed pair scenarios in one single picture.</description>

      <title>Dielectric Properties of Single Crystal Calcium Tungstate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This investigation employed microwave whispering gallery mode (WGM) analysis to characterize the dielectric properties of a cylindrical, single-crystal sample of calcium tungstate (CaWO$_4$). Through investigation of quasi-transverse\hyp{}magnetic and quasi-transverse\hyp{}electric mode families, we can assess loss mechanisms and relative permittivity from room temperature down to cryogenic conditions. We report the biaxial permittivity values of $\epsilon_{||} = 9.029 \pm 0.09$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.761 \pm 0.11$ at $295$ K, and $\epsilon_{||} = 8.797 \pm 0.088$ and $\epsilon_{\perp} = 10.442 \pm 0.104$ at $4$ K. Components are denoted with respect to the c\hyp{}axis of the crystal unit cell. The parallel component agrees well with the published literature at MHz frequencies; however, the perpendicular component is $4.8$\% lower. The WGM technique offers greater precision, with accuracy limited primarily by the uncertainty in the crystal's dimensions. WGMs also serve as sensitive probes of lattice dynamics, enabling monitoring of temperature-dependent loss mechanisms. At room temperature, the measured loss tangents were $\tan\delta_{||}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (4.1 \pm 1.4) \times 10^{-5}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{295,\mathrm{K}} = (3.64 \pm 0.92) \times 10^{-5}$. Upon cooling to 4 K, the loss tangents improved by approximately two orders of magnitude, reaching $\tan\delta_{||}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (1.56 \pm 0.52) \times 10^{-7}$ and $\tan\delta_{\perp}^{4,\mathrm{K}} = (2.05 \pm 0.79) \times 10^{-7}$. These cryogenic values are higher than those reported in prior studies, likely due to a magnetic loss channel associated with an unidentified paramagnetic spin ensemble. These findings have implications for the use of CaWO$_4$ in applications such as spin-based quantum systems and cryogenic bolometry, highlighting the potential of WGMs for novel sensing applications.</description>

      <title>White LED-based photocatalytic treatment using recoverable cobalt ferrite nanoparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Contamination of freshwater sources has been alarming due to the widespread use of toxic chemicals in various industries. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) such as photocatalysis are widely explored to tackle such problems. In photocatalysis, highly oxidative species such as hydroxyl radicals (*OH) are produced with the help of some semiconductor photocatalysts and light. A photocatalyst decomposes these toxic organic compounds in the presence of light. Spinel ferrite (MFe2O4, M = Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) materials are an important candidate as a photocatalyst due to their semiconducting behaviour and narrow optical bandgap. In this work, we have synthesized cobalt ferrite (CoFe2O4) nanoparticles using the sol-gel method and subsequently annealed at 500{\deg}C. The nanoparticles are characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, Raman, and Infrared spectroscopy for structural analysis. The band gap of the material is evaluated using UV-visible spectroscopy. The photocatalytic activity of the material is investigated using methyl orange and methylene blue aqueous solutions as a model dye and a low-power white LED as a light source. The material could decompose 95 % of the dye after 150 minutes of irradiation. Adding hydrogen peroxide further improves the decomposition rate, with over 90 % decomposition achieved within 90 minutes.</description>

      <title>Electrochemically-driven formation of Intermetallic Cu3ZnLi2 alters Li-transport in nanostructured bimetallic battery anode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21673v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The role of Li-based batteries in the electrification of society cannot be understated, however their operational lifetime is often limited by the formation of dendrites, i.e. the localised deposition of Li that can cause shorts between the two electrodes leading to the failure of the battery. Nanocrystalline bimetallic current collectors can be used for anode-free Li-metal batteries, with improved Li plating and limited or suppressed formation of dendrites. Here, we demonstrate that the microstructure of an alpha-Brass current collector, Cu 63% Zn 37%, used in an anode-free Li-metal battery evolves during cycling. It initially had a nanocrystalline deformation layer approximately 80 nm in thickness after polishing. After 100 cycles, the initial deformed brass layer was partially converted to a ternary Laves phase Cu3ZnLi2 within a nanocrystalline brass matrix that grew to 200 - 250 nm in thickness. Upon Li stripping, the phase partially decomposes electrochemically, but what remains can sequester Li thus forming "dead Li" thereby contributing to capacity loss. We propose a mechanism for the microstructural evolution including dynamic recrystallization and phase formation. Since this ternary Laves phase emerges during electrochemical cycling alone, binary alloy current collectors must be assessed for metastable ternary phase formation under different cycling conditions to either stabilize and exploit such phases or electrochemically fully strip them.</description>

      <title>Multiferroicity and 180$^\circ$ domain switching in LaFeO$_3$ via Antisite Defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Materials with coexisting and coupled ferroelectric and magnetic orders are rare. Here we show, using density functional theory calculations, that inducing Fe$_\mathrm{La}$ antisites into non-ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic LaFeO$_3$ renders the material at the same time ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic. Even more excitingly, we observe a direct coupling between the ferroelectric and ferrimagnetic polarization, the latter being switchable by the former. While on average the magnetic moments of antisites would cancel, we envision that preparing defective LaFeO$_3$ under simultaneous electric and magnetic fields will lead to a net magnetic moment due to magnetic domain reconfiguration. Moreover, ferroelectric switching under a static magnetic field can lead to 180$^\circ$ switching of the antiferromagnetic order in LaFeO$_3$.</description>

      <title>Orbital-selective charge transfer drives two-step negative thermal expansion structural transitions in PbTa2Se4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The negative thermal expansion (NTE) effect has been found generally combined with structural phase transitions. However, the charge and orbital freedoms of the NTE has not been well studied. This study employs angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first-principles calculations to elucidate the charge and orbital kinetics of the anomalous two-step negative thermal expansion structural phase transitions in PbTa2Se4. As the temperature decreases, each transition undergoes a similar block-layer sliding, although the charge transfer behaviors differ significantly. During the first transition, charge is mainly transferred from the Pb 6pz orbital to an M-shaped band below the Fermi level, barely altering the Fermi surface. In contrast, the second transition involves modifications to both the Fermi surface and charge-transfer orbitals, with charge selectively transferred from Pb 6px/py orbitals to Ta 5dz2 orbitals and a decrease of the Fermi pockets formed by Pb 6px/py orbitals. Furthermore, a small pressure can easily tune the base structure phase among the three phases and the corresponding superconductivity. Therefore, our findings reveal that the orbital-selective charge transfer drives the unusual structure transition in PbTa2Se4, offering new insights into the NTE mechanisms and providing a unique window to study the pressure-tuned superconductivity in this metal-intercalated transition chalcogenides.</description>

      <title>Interaction-Driven Altermagnetic Magnon Chiral Splitting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonrelativistic magnon chiral splitting in altermagnets has garnered significant recent attention. In this work, we demonstrate that nonlinear three-wave mixing -- where magnons split or coalesce -- extends this phenomenon into unprecedented relativistic regimes. Employing a bilayer antiferromagnet with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, we identify three distinct classes of chiral splitting, each dictated by specific symmetries, such as $C_4T$, $\sigma_v T$, or their combination. This reveals a novel bosonic mechanism for symmetry-protected chiral splitting, capitalizing on the unique ability of magnons to violate particle-number conservation, a feature absent in low-energy fermionic systems. Our findings pave the way for engineering altermagnetic splitting, with potential applications in advanced magnonic devices and deeper insights into magnon dynamics in complex magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Ultralow thermal conductivity via weak interactions in PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure for thermoelectric design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we systematically investigate the thermal and electronic transport properties of two-dimensional PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure by combining first-principles calculations, Boltzmann transport theory, and machine learning methods. The heterostructure exhibits a unique honeycomb-like corrugated and asymmetric configuration, which significantly enhances phonon scattering. Moreover, the relatively weak interatomic interactions in PbSe/PbTe lead to the formation of anti-bonding states, resulting in strong anharmonicity and ultimately yielding ultralow lattice thermal conductivity (${\kappa_{\rm L}}$). In the four-phonon scattering model, the ${\kappa_{\rm L}}$~values along the $x$ and $y$ directions are as low as 0.37 and 0.31 W/mK, respectively. Contrary to the conventional view that long mean free path acoustic phonons dominate heat transport, we find that optical phonons contribute approximately 59\% of the lattice thermal conductivity in this heterostructure. These optical phonons exhibit large Gr\"uneisen parameters, strong anharmonic scattering, and relatively high group velocities, thereby playing a crucial role in the low ${\kappa_{\rm L}}$ regime. Further analysis of thermoelectric performance shows that at a high temperature of 800 K, the heterostructure achieves an exceptional dimensionless figure of merit ($ZT$) of 5.3 along the $y$ direction, indicating outstanding thermoelectric conversion efficiency. These findings not only provide theoretical insights into the transport mechanisms of PbSe/PbTe monolayer heterostructure but also offer a practical design strategy for developing high-performance two-dimensional layered thermoelectric materials.</description>

      <title>Unified machine-learning framework for property prediction and time-evolution simulation of strained alloy microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a unified machine-learning framework designed to conveniently tackle the temporal evolution of alloy microstructures under the influence of an elastic field. This approach allows for the simultaneous extraction of elastic parameters from a short trajectory and for the prediction of further microstructure evolution under their influence. This is demonstrated by focusing on spinodal decomposition in the presence of a lattice mismatch eta, and by carrying out an extensive comparison between the ground-truth evolution supplied by phase field simulations and the predictions of suitable convolutional recurrent neural network architectures. The two tasks may then be performed subsequently into a cascade framework. Under a wide spectrum of misfit conditions, the here-presented cascade model accurately predicts eta and the full corresponding microstructure evolution, also when approaching critical conditions for spinodal decomposition. Scalability to larger computational domain sizes and mild extrapolation errors in time (for time sequences five times longer than the sampled ones during training) are demonstrated. The proposed framework is general and can be applied beyond the specific, prototypical system considered here as an example. Intriguingly, experimental videos could be used to infer unknown external parameters, prior to simulating further temporal evolution.</description>

      <title>Investigating CO Adsorption on Cu(111) and Rh(111) Surfaces Using Machine Learning Exchange-Correlation Functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The "CO adsorption puzzle", a persistent failure of utilizing generalized gradient approximations (GGA) in density functional theory to replicate CO's experimental preference for top-site adsorption on transition-metal surfaces, remains a critical barrier in surface chemistry. While hybrid functionals such as HSE06 partially resolve this discrepancy, their prohibitive computational cost limits broader applications. We tackle this issue by adopting the Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS) method to train machine-learned exchange-correlation functionals. Principal component analysis reveals that the input descriptors for electronic structures separate distinctly across different chemical environments, enabling the DeePKS models to generalize to multi-element systems. We train system-specific DeePKS models for transition-metal surfaces Cu(111) and Rh(111). These models successfully recover experimental site preferences, yielding adsorption energy differences of about 10 meV compared to HSE06. Furthermore, a single model for the two surfaces is trained, and the model achieves comparable accuracy in predicting not only adsorption energies and site preference but also potential energy surfaces and relaxed surface adsorption structures. The above work demonstrates a promising path towards universal models, enabling catalyst exploration with hybrid functional accuracy at substantially reduced cost.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite-type ternary nitrides with predicted exciting ferroelectricity and many other outstanding properties hold great promise to be an emerging class of advanced ferroelectrics for manufacturing diverse technologically important devices. However, such nitride ferroelectrics have not yet been experimentally identified, mainly due to the challenging sample synthesis by traditional methods at ambient pressure. Here we report the successful high-pressure synthesis of a high-quality ferroelectric nitride perovskite of CeTaN3-{\delta} with nitrogen deficiency, adopting an orthorhombic Pmn21 polar structure. This material is electrically insulating and exhibits switchable and robust electric polarization for producing ferroelectricity. Furthermore, a number of other extraordinary properties are also revealed in this nitride such as excellent mechanical properties and chemical inertness, which would make it practically useful for many device-relevant applications and fundamentally important for the study of condensed-matter physics.</description>

      <title>Reducing Data Requirements for Sequence-Property Prediction in Copolymer Compatibilizers via Deep Neural Network Tuning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21902v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Synthetic sequence-controlled polymers promise to transform polymer science by combining the chemical versatility of synthetic polymers with the precise sequence-mediated functionality of biological proteins. However, design of these materials has proven extraordinarily challenging, because they lack the massive datasets of closely related evolved molecules that accelerate design of proteins. Here we report on a new Artifical Intelligence strategy to dramatically reduce the amount of data necessary to accelerate these materials' design. We focus on data connecting the repeat-unit-sequence of a \emph{compatibilizer} molecule to its ability to reduce the interfacial tension between distinct polymer domains. The optimal sequence of these molecules, which are essential for applications such as mixed-waste polymer recycling, depends strongly on variables such as concentration and chemical details of the polymer. With current methods, this would demand an entirely distinct dataset to enable design at each condition. Here we show that a deep neural network trained on low-fidelity data for sequence/interfacial tension relations at one set of conditions can be rapidly tuned to make higher-fidelity predictions at a distinct set of conditions, requiring far less data that would ordinarily be needed. This priming-and-tuning approach should allow a single low-fidelity parent dataset to dramatically accelerate prediction and design in an entire constellation of related systems. In the long run, it may also provide an approach to bootstrapping quantitative atomistic design with AI insights from fast, coarse simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The control of material properties at the atomic scale remains a central challenge in materials science. Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) offer remarkable electronic and optical properties, but their functionality is largely dictated by their stable crystalline phases. Here we demonstrate a single-step, ligand-free strategy using femtosecond laser ablation in liquid to transform crystalline, stoichiometric palladium diselenide (PdSe$_{\mathrm{2}}$) into highly stable, amorphous, and non-stoichiometric nanoparticles (PdSe$_{\mathrm{2-x}}$, with x$\approx$1). This laser-driven amorphization creates a high density of selenium vacancies and coordinatively unsaturated sites, which unlock a range of emergent functions absent in the crystalline precursor, including plasmon-free surface-enhanced Raman scattering with an enhancement factor exceeding 10$^\mathrm{6}$, a 50-fold increase in photocatalytic activity, and near-infrared photothermal conversion efficiency reaching 83$\%$. Our findings establish laser-induced amorphization as a powerful top-down approach for defect-engineered TMDCs and advances their practical usage in optics, catalysis, and nanomedicine.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current-induced magnetization switching, a fundamental phenomenon related to spin-transport of electrons, enables non-voltaic and fast information write, facilitating applications in low-power memory and logic devices. However, magnetization switching by spin-orbit torques is usually attributed to current flowing in the nonmagnetic metal layer of multilayers or in magnetic alloys with heavy elements. Here, we report perpendicular magnetization switching induced by current flowing in an elemental ferromagnet nickel single layer. This prototype structure demonstrates that current-induced magnetization switching is a general phenomenon of magnet. The results suggest that the current induces an effective transverse magnetic field with an out-of-plane component leading to the magnetization switching, different to the conventional spin-orbit torques. Our work opens the new insight and reveals the intrinsic mechanism of current-induced torques.</description>

Abstract: Electrochemical ammonia synthesis via lithium-mediated nitrogen dissociation has demonstrated exceptional Faradaic efficiency at ambient conditions, but its viability is limited by a high energy cost of ~9.12 eV per NH3 via lithium electrodeposition. Here, we establish the thermodynamic limits for dissociative nitrogen reduction using elemental metals by decomposing the process into three steps: metal deposition, nitridation, and protonation. We derive energetic constraints that any viable mediator must satisfy and show that highly reducing metals impose significant energetic penalties. To reduce this cost, we explore solvent tuning and bimetallic alloy strategies that shift deposition potentials without compromising nitridation spontaneity. Our results offer design principles for lowering the energy input of dissociative nitrogen reduction while maintaining its selectivity advantage over associative routes.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Isoreticular Series of CALF-20 for Biogas Upgrading using a Pressure/Vacuum Swing Adsorption (PVSA) Process</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cyclic swing adsorption processes, such as pressure vacuum swing adsorption (PVSA), have emerged as a promising technology for upgrading biogas by separating carbon dioxide (CO2) from methane (CH4). The rational design of adsorbent materials with tailored properties is important for deployment of high-performance PVSA technology. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), particularly the CALF-20 isoreticular series, have attracted interest due to their high CO2 selectivity, thermal and water stability. In this study, we report a multiscale assessment of CALF-20 and its isoreticular five derivatives by integrating molecular simulations and PVSA cycle optimization. Structural parameters such as pore volume, pore size, and isosteric adsorption enthalpy were first calculated, followed by atomistic grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations. Process-level performances of the six materials were evaluated and optimized using the Thompson Sampling Efficient Multi-objective Optimization (TSEMO) algorithm. From the process-level optimization, we found that FumCALF-20 is the only material that can reach CH4 purity &gt; 0.90 while maintaining high recovery. Other materials either lacked sufficient CO2 capacity or showed inefficient CH4 desorption at low pressures. This study underscores the value of process-level optimization in MOF evaluation and screening for energy-efficient biogas upgrading.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polyurethane (PU) and its numerous fine-tuned derivatives are widely employed as CO2 scavengers thanks to (1) physisorption and (2) functionalization of the PU backbone with other CO2 sorbents. In the present work, it has been unraveled why PU cannot exhibit CO2 chemisorption, despite possessing the nitrogen docking sites and exhibiting strong electrostatic sorbent-sorbate interactions. Furthermore, a few types of spatial separation of the active sorption sites have been proposed to unleash the chemisorption functionality of PU. By comparing various structural modifications of PU by using the in-silico methodology, we have identified that CO2 chemisorption by PU takes place in the case of implementing methyl and ethyl fragments between the oxygen and nitrogen atoms of PU. Herewith, the introduction of the ethyl moiety even makes CO2 chemisorption energetically favorable relative to physisorption. The reported specific progress on materials design represents an obvious practical value for chemical engineers developing inexpensive CO2 scavengers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Developing efficient and universal polymer crosslinking strategies is pivotal for advanced material design, especially for challenging matrixes like polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Traditional crosslinkers such as divinylbenzene (DVB) often requires high-temperature radical initiators and are limited by poor compatibility with saturated hydrocarbon matrices. In contrast, bis-diazirine (BD) crosslinkers offer a promising alternative by harnessing thermally or photochemically generated carbene intermediates for highly selective C-H bond insertions. Here, we employ density functional theory (DFT)-based electronic structure calculations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms and energetics of BD-mediated crosslinking across PE, PP, and PS. We demonstrate that BD enables efficient covalent linkage through low free energy barriers , facilitating crosslinking at moderate temperatures without catalysts and with minimal sensitivity to polymer chain length. Moreover, BD exhibits selective reactivity towards the tertiary and secondary C-H bonds in PP and PS, respectively. Comparative analysis shows that BD dramatically outperforms DVB, especially in saturated polymers, enabling reaction times that are orders of magnitude faster. Our findings provide atomistic insights into BD crosslinker reactivity and establish a mechanistic foundation for next-generation, universal C-H activation-based crosslinking technologies.</description>

Abstract: Understanding the behavior and evolution of a dynamical many-body system by analyzing patterns in their experimentally captured images is a promising method relevant for a variety of living and non-living self-assembled systems. The arrays of moving liquid crystal skyrmions studied here are a representative example of hierarchically organized materials that exhibit complex spatiotemporal dynamics driven by multiscale processes. Joint geometric and topological data analysis (TDA) offers a powerful framework for investigating such systems by capturing the underlying structure of the data at multiple scales. In the TDA approach, we introduce the $\Psi$-function, a robust numerical topological descriptor related to both the spatiotemporal changes in the size and shape of individual topological solitons and the emergence of regions with their different spatial organization. The geometric method based on the analysis of vector fields generated from images of skyrmion ensembles offers insights into the nonlinear physical mechanisms of the system's response to external stimuli and provides a basis for comparison with theoretical predictions. The methodology presented here is very general and can provide a characterization of system behavior both at the level of individual pattern-forming agents and as a whole, allowing one to relate the results of image data analysis to processes occurring in a physical, chemical, or biological system in the real world.</description>

      <title>Zone-sectored organic crystals with spatially resolved exciton dynamics</title>

Abstract: Among the organic semiconductors, rubrene stands out in terms of hole mobility, luminescence yield and exciton migration distance. A novel type of rubrene microcrystal is prepared in the orthorhombic phase, exhibiting zone-sectored tabular domains with distinct photoluminescence (PL) characteristics. These sectors exhibit distinct PL spectra and time-evolution, arising from differences in the in-plane orientation of the orthorhombic unit cell relative to the crystal surface. A combination of polarised optical microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) is used to characterise the samples in terms of crystal orientation, fluorescence lifetime, and photoluminescence spectra. Spatially resolved PL spectroscopy reveals that the redshifted 650 nm emission band has polarisation along the transition dipole moment and is associated with high photon absorption due to the alignment of excitation polarisation and transition dipole moment and selectively localized within specific sectors of the crystal. The detected photon originates from direct emission of a geminate coherent triplet pair, or from its fusion. This band exhibits pure mono-exponential dynamics with 3.7 ns lifetime. The triplet fusion behaviour in the succeeding time regimes can be treated in the framework of power law scaling and random walk. The emission kinetics are modelled using rate equations describing geminate and non-geminate exciton fusion processes, enabling a quantitative interpretation of the spatially resolved PL kinetics. These findings introduce a material-based strategy, opening novel routes for photonic applications and light harvesting.</description>

      <title>Field-free Superconducting Diode Effect and Topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov Superconductivity in Altermagnetic Shiba Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by a directional asymmetry in the critical supercurrents, typically requires external magnetic fields to break time-reversal symmetry -- posing challenges for scalability and device integration. Here, we demonstrate a field-free realization of the SDE in a helical Shiba chain proximitized by a d-wave altermagnet. Using a self-consistent Bogoliubov-de Gennes approach, we uncover a topological Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting state that hosts tunable Majorana zero modes at the chain ends. This state is stabilized by the interplay between the exchange coupling of magnetic adatoms and the induced altermagnetic spin splitting. Crucially, the same FFLO phase supports strong nonreciprocal supercurrents, achieving diode efficiencies exceeding 45% without applied magnetic fields. The d-wave altermagnet plays a dual role: it intrinsically breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling topological superconductivity, and introduces inversion symmetry breaking via momentum-dependent spin-splitting, driving the field-free SDE in a junction-free setting. The supercurrent-controlled finite Cooper pair momentum of the FFLO state modulates both the topological gap and the diode response. Our results establish the Shiba chain-altermagnet heterostructure as a promising platform for realizing topological superconducting devices with efficient, intrinsic superconducting diode functionality -- offering a scalable pathway towards dissipationless quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Magneto-cubic and magneto-linear dependence observed in an in-plane anomalous Hall magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hall effect, particularly that arising from in-plane magnetic field, has recently emerged as a sensitive probe of quantum geometric properties in solids. Especially in trigonal systems, in-plane anomalous Hall effect (AHE) can be explicitly induced by nontrivial off-diagonal coupling between the magnetic field and the Hall vector on the principal plane. Here we elucidate multipolar dependence of the off-diagonal coupling in the in-plane AHE, by systematically measuring on the (001) principal plane of trigonal antiferromagnet EuCd2Sb2 thin films for each magnetic phase. Around zero field, magneto-cubic dependence of anomalous Hall resistivity is clearly observed not only in the paramagnetic phase but also even in the antiferromagnetic phase. An off-diagonal component of the octupolar tensor also exhibits unconventional decay above the magnetic ordering temperature, roughly depending on the inverse temperature to the third power. In the forced ferromagnetic phase, on the other hand, magneto-linear dependence dominantly appears and notably persists up to very high fields. Our findings clarify key aspects of the off-diagonal coupling in the in-plane AHE, paving the way for its future investigations and potential applications beyond conventional expectations about the Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Excited State Absorption Drives Low-Energy Optical Limiting in Oligothiophenes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical limiting (OL), a crucial mechanism for protecting human eyes and sensitive sensors from intense radiation, relies on understanding the optical nonlinearities acting on the systems. Assessing and disentangling the effects at play is crucial to predict and control the nonlinear optical response in real materials. In this ab initio study based on real-time time-dependent density-functional theory, we investigate non-perturbatively the absorption spectra of a set of thiophene oligomers, the building blocks of technologically relevant organic semiconductors, excited by broadband radiation of increasing intensity. Under strong electric fields, the absorption cross section grows significantly below the onset of linear excitations, exhibiting saturation typical of OL. By exciting the oligothiophenes with a train of pulses targeting the first and second excited states of each moiety and analyzing the resulting population dynamics, we reveal excited-state absorption (ESA) in the near-infrared to visible region. Our results indicate ESA as the driving mechanism for OL in oligothiophene molecules, thereby providing important insight to design novel compounds with optimized nonlinear optical characteristics.</description>

      <title>Electronic localization and optical activity of strain-engineered transition-metal dichalcogenide nanobubbles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strain-engineered transition-metal dichalcogenide nanobubbles are promising platforms for quantum emission, as revealed by recent experimental observations. In this work, we present an ab initio investigation of MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and WSe$_2$ nanobubbles, linking their structural and electronic properties to predictions of their optical activity. Inflating forces yield tunable geometries with non-uniform, apex-concentrated strain, which is sensitive to material rigidity. Strain modifies band gaps and universally induces non-dispersive valence states, exhibiting composition-dependent wave-function character, as revealed by an in-depth analysis of band structures and orbital contributions. Crucially, transitions from these apex-localized valence states are predominantly dark. This characteristic is attributed to their localization at the $\Gamma$-point, inhibiting transitions to the lowest unoccupied states that reside at the K-valley. While revealing that the herein considered sub-10-nm nanobubbles fall short as single-photon emitters, our findings provide essential understanding of the structure-property relations in emerging quantum materials, providing robust design rules to optimize their characteristics for novel quantum applications.</description>

      <title>evoxels: A differentiable physics framework for voxel-based microstructure simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21748v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Materials science inherently spans disciplines: experimentalists use advanced microscopy to uncover micro- and nanoscale structure, while theorists and computational scientists develop models that link processing, structure, and properties. Bridging these domains is essential for inverse material design where you start from desired performance and work backwards to optimal microstructures and manufacturing routes. Integrating high-resolution imaging with predictive simulations and data-driven optimization accelerates discovery and deepens understanding of process-structure-property relationships. The differentiable physics framework evoxels is based on a fully Pythonic, unified voxel-based approach that integrates segmented 3D microscopy data, physical simulations, inverse modeling, and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Learning Kinetic Monte Carlo stochastic dynamics with Deep Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.21763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) may be fruitfully exploited to learn stochastic dynamics, surrogating traditional models while capturing thermal fluctuations. Specifically, we showcase the application to a two-dimensional, many-particle system, focusing on surface-step fluctuations and on the related time-dependent roughness. After the construction of a dataset based on Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, a conditional GAN is trained to propagate stochastically the state of the system in time, allowing the generation of new sequences with a reduced computational cost. Modifications with respect to standard GANs, which facilitate convergence and increase accuracy, are discussed. The trained network is demonstrated to quantitatively reproduce equilibrium and kinetic properties, including scaling laws, with deviations of a few percent from the exact value. Extrapolation limits and future perspectives are critically discussed.</description>

      <title>Multi-Gap superconductivity in HgS under pressure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mercury chalcogenides are a class of materials that exhibit diverse structural phases under pressure, leading to a range of exotic physical properties, including topological phases and chiral phonons. In particular, the phase diagram of mercury sulfide (HgS) remains difficult to characterize, with significant uncertainty surrounding the transition pressure between phases. Based on recent experimental results, we employ Density Functional Theory and Superconducting Density Functional Theory to investigate the pressure-induced structural phase transition in HgS and its interplay with the emergence of superconductivity as the crystal transitions from the cinnabar phase (space group P3$_1$21) to the rock salt phase (space group Fm$\bar{3}$m). Remarkably, the rocksalt phase hosts a multigap superconducting state driven by distinct Fermi surface sheets, with two dominant gaps; the unusually high critical temperature of $\sim$11 K emerges naturally within this multiband scenario, highlighting the role of interband coupling beyond isotropic models. These results place HgS among the few systems where multiband superconducting gap structures emerge under pressure.</description>

      <title>Proximity screening greatly enhances electronic quality of graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The electronic quality of two-dimensional systems is crucial when exploring quantum transport phenomena. In semiconductor heterostructures, decades of optimization have yielded record-quality two-dimensional gases with transport and quantum mobilities reaching close to 10$^8$ and 10$^6$ cm$^2$/Vs, respectively. Although the quality of graphene devices has also been improving, it remains comparatively lower. Here we report a transformative improvement in the electronic quality of graphene by employing graphite gates placed in its immediate proximity, at 1 nm separation. The resulting screening reduces charge inhomogeneity by two orders of magnitude, bringing it down to a few 10$^7$ cm$^-2$ and limiting potential fluctuations to less than 1 meV. Quantum mobilities reach 10$^7$ cm$^2$/Vs, surpassing those in the highest-quality semiconductor heterostructures by an order of magnitude, and the transport mobilities match their record. This quality enables Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in fields as low as 1 mT and quantum Hall plateaus below 5 mT. Although proximity screening predictably suppresses electron-electron interactions, fractional quantum Hall states remain observable with their energy gaps reduced only by a factor of 3-5 compared to unscreened devices, demonstrating that many-body phenomena at spatial scales shorter than 10 nm remain robust. Our results offer a reliable route to improving electronic quality in graphene and other two-dimensional systems, which should facilitate the exploration of new physics previously obscured by disorder.</description>

      <title>Effect of applied pressure on the non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) of FeSb2 altermagnet: A first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the pressure-dependent electronic structure, phonon stability, and anomalous Hall response of the recently discovered altermagnet FeSb2 from density functional theory (DFT) and Wannier function analysis. From density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) calculations, we have found that FeSb2 remains dynamically stable up to 10 GPa, evidenced by positive phonon frequencies. Our spin-polarised band structure shows that the node of band crossing between spin-up and spin-down bands around the Fermi energy exactly lies at the Gamma and A-symmetry points. The Fermi crossing is mostly exhibited by band-24, band-25 and band-26. The non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS) along M'-Gamma-M and A-Z-A' symmetry is attributed to the broken time-reversal (PT ) symmetry. There are significant changes in the band profile under applied pressure, as one can see the shifting of the node of band-24 and band-26 towards the lower energy side. The NRSS exhibited by band-24 along M'-Gamma-M symmetry is notably small. Although the strength of NRSS of band-26 along A-Z-A' symmetry is significant but reduces under applied pressure. The anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) values are prominent in -1 to 1 eV range. A sharp peaked and positive AHC values at ambient pressure, becomes spectrally broadened and negative at 10 GPa due to pressure-induced band crossings and redistribution of Berry curvature near the Fermi level. We have observed that the values of spin hall conductivity (SHC) are around 2-2.5 times lower as compared to AHC and prominent in between -1.0 eV to 1.0 eV. Our results establish FeSb2 as a tunable altermagnetic candidate where pressure can modulate both topological transport and dynamic stability, offering opportunities for strain-engineered Hall responses in compensated magnetic systems.</description>

      <title>Revealing Spin and Spatial Symmetry Decoupling: New Insights into Magnetic Systems with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) generally locks spin and spatial degrees of freedom, as a result, the spin, despite being an axial vector, is fixed and cannot rotate independently, and the magnetic system should be described by magnetic space groups (MSGs). While as a new type of group, spin space groups (SSGs) have been introduced to approximately describe the symmetry of magnetic systems with negligible SOC, and received significant attention recently. In this work, we prove that in two cases of coplanar spin configurations, there are spin-only operations that strictly hold even with considerable Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), and the symmetry of their spin models could be described by the spin-coplanar SSG. In addition, we also find that for spin-collinear cases, regardless the strength of DMI, the magnon systems within the framework of linear spin wave theory (LSWT) also preserve the decoupled spin and spatial rotations, but the symmetry does not belong to the conventional definitions of collinear spin groups. We discuss the potential realization of these novel symmetries in rod, layer, and three-dimensional (3D) space groups. Our work extends the applicability of SSGs to magnetic materials with heavy elements, and reveals that the coexistence of DMI and SSG symmetries provides new opportunity for exploring novel magnon transport phenomena, and potential material realization had also been discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15582v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine-learned interatomic potentials are revolutionising atomistic materials simulations by providing accurate and scalable predictions within the scope covered by the training data. However, generation of an accurate and robust training data set remains a challenge, often requiring thousands of first-principles calculations to achieve high accuracy. Foundation models have started to emerge with the ambition to create universally applicable potentials across a wide range of materials. While foundation models can be robust and transferable, they do not yet achieve the accuracy required to predict reaction barriers, phase transitions, and material stability. This work demonstrates that foundation model potentials can reach chemical accuracy when fine-tuned using transfer learning with partially frozen weights and biases. For two challenging datasets on reactive chemistry at surfaces and stability and elastic properties of tertiary alloys, we show that frozen transfer learning with 10-20% of the data (hundreds of datapoints) achieves similar accuracies to models trained from scratch (on thousands of datapoints). Moreover, we show that an equally accurate, but significantly more efficient surrogate model can be built using the transfer learned potential as the ground truth. In combination, we present a simulation workflow for machine learning potentials that improves data efficiency and computational efficiency.</description>

Abstract: Sorbent materials, such as graphene-based systems coated with Cr, are being investigated as potential hydrogen storage materials. Graphene, a 2D material with a high surface-to-volume ratio, has been employed. A comparison is conducted between graphene systems with single vacancy defects and those without defects, using Cr adsorption. To verify the effectiveness of hydrogen storage, ab initio calculations are carried out both with and without Van der Waals interactions. The system's binding energy is calculated to assess efficiency. According to the Department of Energy in the United States, the ideal range for binding energy for reversible hydrogen storage is between 0.2 and 0.6 eV. To anticipate the stability of the efficient materials at room temperature, this work exploits the molecular dynamics computations to depict their thermal stability spectrum.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Spontaneous Exciton Dissociation via Phonon Emission in BiVO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00110v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monoclinic bismuth vanadate (m-BiVO$_4$) is a promising indirect band gap semiconductor for photoelectrochemical water splitting, yet the characteristics of its low-lying photoexcitations, or excitons, remain poorly understood. Here, we use an ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation approach that incorporates phonon screening to compute the nature and lifetimes of the low-lying excitons of m-BiVO$_4$. Our calculations indicate that at 0 K, the lowest-lying exciton energy exceeds the indirect band gap, enabling spontaneous dissociation into free carriers via phonon emission within picoseconds. At 300 K, both phonon emission and absorption effects reduce this timescale to only a few femtoseconds. Phonon screening also greatly reduces the binding energy of the lowest-lying exciton, leading to an optical absorption spectrum that better reproduces experimental measurements. Overall, our findings establish the general conditions under which phonon emission-driven exciton dissociation can occur in indirect gap semiconductors, and they emphasize the critical role phonon screening can play in predictive calculations of photophysical properties of complex materials.</description>

      <title>Bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y alloys with amorphous grain boundary complexions display high strength and compressive plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although nanocrystalline alloys regularly exhibit high strengths, their use in structural applications often face challenges due to sample size limitations, unstable microstructures, and the limited ability to plastically deform. The incorporation of amorphous grain boundary complexions has been proposed to address these issues, by simultaneously stabilizing nanocrystalline grain structures for scale-up processing and improving alloy toughness. In the present study, the mechanical behavior of bulk nanocrystalline Al-Mg-Y is examined with macroscale compression testing, probing a length scale that is relevant to real-world structural applications. Bulk samples were fabricated via a simple powder metallurgy approach, with different pressing temperatures and times employed for consolidation in order to investigate microstructural and property evolution. All of the specimens contained primary face-centered cubic Al and secondary Al4C3 and Al3Y phases, with the Al3Y particles exhibiting two populations of small equiaxed and larger elongated particles. Appreciable plasticity was measured along with high ultimate stresses over 800 MPa due to the presence of amorphous grain boundary complexions. Microstructural characterization of fracture surfaces revealed that the area fraction of dimpled regions increased with longer hot-pressing time. Most importantly, the elongated Al3Y particles formed regular cellular patterns with increasing hot-pressing time, delaying shear localization and significantly enhancing plasticity. The hierarchy present in the microstructure of the Al-Mg-Y alloy, from amorphous grain boundary complexions to secondary phases, gives rise to excellent bulk mechanical properties, which are attractive for structural applications.</description>

      <title>Testing the spin-bath view of self-attention: A Hamiltonian analysis of GPT-2 Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00683v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently proposed physics-based framework by Huo and Johnson~\cite{huo2024capturing} models the attention mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) as an interacting two-body spin system, offering a first-principles explanation for phenomena like repetition and bias. Building on this hypothesis, we extract the complete Query-Key weight matrices from a production-grade GPT-2 model and derive the corresponding effective Hamiltonian for every attention head. From these Hamiltonians, we obtain analytic phase boundaries and logit gap criteria that predict which token should dominate the next-token distribution for a given context. A systematic evaluation on 144 heads across 20 factual-recall prompts reveals a strong negative correlation between the theoretical logit gaps and the model's empirical token rankings ($r\approx-0.70$, $p&lt;10^{-3}$).Targeted ablations further show that suppressing the heads most aligned with the spin-bath predictions induces the anticipated shifts in output probabilities, confirming a causal link rather than a coincidental association. Taken together, our findings provide the first strong empirical evidence for the spin-bath analogy in a production-grade model. In this work, we utilize the context-field lens, which provides physics-grounded interpretability and motivates the development of novel generative models bridging theoretical condensed matter physics and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The nonreciprocal propagation of spin waves (SWs) offers opportunities for developing novel functional magnonic logic devices, where controllability is crucial for magnetic signal processing. Domain walls act as natural waveguides due to their magnetic configuration, offering a platform for the in-depth investigation of nonreciprocal SW propagation and its manipulation. In this work, we theoretically and numerically investigate the tunable spin-wave nonreciprocity in ferrimagnetic domain-wall channels under the influence of an external field. It is revealed that the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction exerts dual control over both nonreciprocal spin-wave propagation and spin-splitting phenomena. Moreover, SW nonreciprocity is magnetically tunable, with its sign reversibly switched by inverting the applied field direction, while preserving the host spin configuration. The orientation of the magnetic field can selectively stabilize or destabilize the domain wall structure, offering precise control over spin-wave nonreciprocity. Ultimately, we demonstrate a controllable SW transmission scheme via external magnetic field modulation, providing critical insights for the design of future magnonic devices.</description>

      <title>Semantic segmentation of SEM images of lower bainitic and tempered martensitic steels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17251v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study employs deep learning techniques to segment scanning electron microscope images, enabling a quantitative analysis of carbide precipitates in lower bainite and tempered martensite steels with comparable strength. Following segmentation, carbides are investigated, and their volume percentage, size distribution, and orientations are probed within the image dataset. Our findings reveal that lower bainite and tempered martensite exhibit comparable volume percentages of carbides, albeit with a more uniform distribution of carbides in tempered martensite. Carbides in lower bainite demonstrate a tendency for better alignment than those in tempered martensite, aligning with the observations of other researchers. However, both microstructures display a scattered carbide orientation, devoid of any discernible pattern. Comparative analysis of aspect ratios and sizes of carbides in lower bainite and tempered martensite unveils striking similarities. The deep learning model achieves an impressive pixelwise accuracy of 98.0% in classifying carbide/iron matrix at the individual pixel level. The semantic segmentation derived from deep learning extends its applicability to the analysis of secondary phases in various materials, offering a time-efficient, versatile AI-powered workflow for quantitative microstructure analysis.</description>

      <title>Convergence of Body-Orders in Linear Atomic Cluster Expansions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the convergence of a linear atomic cluster expansion (ACE) potential with respect to its basis functions, in terms of the effective two-body interactions of elemental Carbon and Silicon systems. We build ACE potentials with descriptor sets truncated at body-orders $K=2$ to $K=5$ trained on a diverse Carbon dataset and on Silicon dimers to pentamers. The potentials trained on diverse structures with standard ACE bases are not able to recover the correct dimer curves much less produce stable curves or solutions. While employing ACE bases removed of self-interactions still does not generalize to the DFT-expected results, properly tailored datasets and basis sets are able to show signs of convergence and stability in the curves and expansions, suggesting a method to build potentials with interpretable bases with respect to the cluster expansion.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle gap renormalization driven by internal and external screening in a WS$_2$ device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16234v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The electronic band gap of a two-dimensional semiconductor within a device architecture is sensitive to variations in screening properties of adjacent materials in the device and to gate-controlled doping. Here, we employ micro-focused angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy to separate band gap renormalization effects stemming from environmental screening and electron-doping during \textit{in situ} gating of a single-layer WS$_{2}$ device. The WS$_{2}$ is supported on hBN and contains a section that is exposed to vacuum and another section that is encapsulated by a graphene contact. We directly observe the doping-induced semiconductor-metal transition and band gap renormalization in the two sections of WS$_2$. Surprisingly, a larger band gap renormalization is observed in the vacuum-exposed section than in the graphene-encapsulated - and thus ostensibly better screened - section of the WS$_2$. Using $GW$ calculations, we determine that intrinsic screening due to stronger doping in vacuum exposed WS$_2$ exceeds the external environmental screening in graphene-encapsulated WS$_2$.</description>

      <title>The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: https://github.com/pfloos/QUESTDB.</description>

      <title>Streamline controlled rectification of supercurrent in thin-film asymmetric weak links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we examined the supercurrent diode effect (SDE) in mesoscopic superconducting weak links formed by asymmetric Dayem bridges. These planar metallic constrictions, which naturally exhibit Josephsonlike behavior, offer a fundamental platform for investigating nonreciprocal transport phenomena in a regime where the bridge width aligns with the superconducting coherence length. The foundational concept is inspired by the Tesla valve, a classical fluidic device that achieves flow rectification through interference and turbulence between fluid streams enabled by geometric asymmetry. Analogously, we demonstrate that spatial asymmetry within superconducting structures can result in rectification due to the polarity-dependent interaction between transport and screening currents. By implementing controlled geometric defects at the junction between the constriction and superconducting leads, we induce current crowding and disrupt spatial inversion symmetry, thus facilitating directional switching behavior. Experimental results indicate a linear-in-field rectification regime at low magnetic fields, driven by the interaction between transport and screening currents, which is succeeded by complex vortex dynamics within the superconducting banks at elevated fields. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations replicate significant features of the experimental observations and substantiate the influence of both screening currents and rearrangements of Abrikosov vortices. A comparative study across various geometries highlights the crucial role of defect shape and spatial confinement in determining the rectification efficiency, revealing a minimum threshold in bridge width below which crowding-induced SDE is significantly reduced. Our findings advocate for mesoscopic Dayem bridges as a flexible platform for designing and controlling superconducting diode functionalities.</description>
