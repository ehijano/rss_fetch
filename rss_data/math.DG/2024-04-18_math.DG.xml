      <title>Gromov-Hausdorff continuity of non-K\"ahler Calabi-Yau conifold transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the geometry of Calabi-Yau conifold transitions. This deformation process is known to possibly connect a K\"ahler threefold to a non-K\"ahler threefold. We use balanced and Hermitian-Yang-Mills metrics to geometrize the conifold transition and show that the whole operation is continuous in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology.</description>

      <title>On length-preserving and area-preserving inverse curvature flow of planar curves with singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper aims to investigate the evolution problem for planar curves with singularities. Motivated by the inverse curvature flow introduced by Li and Wang (Calc. Var. Partial Differ. Equ. 62 (2023), No. 135), we intend to consider the area-preserving and length-preserving inverse curvature flow with nonlocal term for $\ell$-convex Legendre curves. For the area-preserving flow, an $\ell$-convex Legendre curve %of with initial algebraic area $A_0&gt;0$ evolves to a circle of radius $\sqrt{\frac{A_0}{\pi}}$. For the length-preserving flow, an $\ell$-convex Legendre curve %of with initial algebraic length $L_0$ evolves to a circle of radius $\frac{L_0}{2\pi}$. As the by-product, we obtain some geometric inequalities for $\ell$-convex Legendre curves through the length-preserving flow.</description>

      <title>Geodesic extensions of mechanical systems with nonholonomic constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a Lagrangian system with nonholonomic constraints, we construct extensions of the equations of motion to sets of second-order ordinary differential equations. In the case of a purely kinetic Lagrangian, we investigate the conditions under which the nonholonomic trajectories are geodesics of a Riemannian metric, while preserving the constrained Lagrangian. We interpret the algebraic and PDE conditions of this problem as infinitesimal versions of the relation between the nonholonomic exponential map and the Riemannian metric. We discuss the special case of a Chaplygin system with symmetries and we end the paper with a worked-out example.</description>

      <title>Dynamics Over Homogeneous Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Euler-Lagrange and Hamilton's equations for a system whose configuration space is a unified product Lie group $G=M\bowtie_{\gamma} H$, for some $\gamma:M\times M \to H$. By reduction, then, we obtain the Euler-Lagrange type and Hamilton's type equations of the same form for the quotient space $M\cong G/H$, although it is not necessarily a Lie group. We observe, through further reduction, that it is possible to formulate the Euler-Poincar\'{e} type and Lie-Poisson type equations on the corresponding quotient $\mathfrak{m}\cong \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}$ of Lie algebras, which is not a priori a Lie algebra. Moreover, we realize the $n$th order iterated tangent group $T^{(n)}G$ of a Lie group $G$ as an extension of the $n$th order tangent group $T^nG$ of the same type. More precisely, $\mathfrak{g}$ being the Lie algebra of $G$, $T^{(n)}G \cong \mathfrak{g}^{\times \,2^n-1-n} \bowtie_\gamma T^nG$ for some $\gamma:\mathfrak{g}^{\times \,2^n-1-n} \times \mathfrak{g}^{\times \,2^n-1-n} \to T^nG$. We thus obtain the $n$th order Euler-Lagrange (and then the $n$th order Euler-Poincar\'e) equations over $T^nG$ by reduction from those on $T(T^{n-1}G)$. Finally, we illustrate our results in the realm of the Kepler problem, and the non-linear tokamak plasma dynamics.</description>

      <title>Global regularity of integral 2-varifolds with square integrable mean curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide sharp sufficient criteria for an integral $2$-varifold to be induced by a $W^{2,2}$-conformal immersion of a smooth surface. Our approach is based on a fine analysis of the Hausdorff density for $2$-varifolds with critical integrability of the mean curvature and a recent local regularity result by Bi-Zhou. In codimension one, there are only three possible density values below $2$, each of which can be attained with equality in the Li--Yau inequality for the Willmore functional by the unit sphere, the double bubble, and the triple bubble. We show that below an optimal threshold for the Willmore energy, a varifold induced by a current without boundary is in fact a curvature varifold with a uniform bound on its second fundamental form. Consequently, the minimization of the Willmore functional in the class of curvature varifolds with prescribed even Euler characteristic provides smooth solutions for the Willmore problem. In particular, the "ambient" varifold approach and the "parametric" approach are equivalent for minimizing the Willmore energy.</description>

      <title>New free boundary minimal annuli of revolution in the 3-sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We rigorously establish the existence of many free boundary minimal annuli with boundary in a geodesic sphere of $\mathbb{S}^3$. These arise as compact subdomains of a one-parameter family of complete minimal immersions of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^1$ into $\mathbb{S}^3$ described by do Carmo and Dajczer [1]. While the free boundary minimal annuli we exhibit may have self-intersections and may not be contained in a geodesic ball, we show that there is at least a one-parameter family of embedded examples that are contained in geodesic balls whose radius may be less than, equal to or greater than $\pi$/2. After explaining the connection to Otsuki tori [13], we establish lower bounds on the number of free boundary minimal annuli contained in each Otsuki torus in terms of the corresponding rational number. Finally, we show that some of the recent work of Lee and Seo [7] on isoperimetric inequalities and of Lima and Menezes [10] on index bounds extends to geodesic balls equal to or larger than a hemisphere.</description>

      <title>The topological complexity of the ordered configuration space of disks in a strip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How hard is it to program $n$ robots to move about a long narrow aisle such that only $w$ of them can fit across the width of the aisle? In this paper, we answer that question by calculating the topological complexity of $\text{conf}(n,w)$, the ordered configuration space of open unit-diameter disks in the infinite strip of width $w$. By studying its cohomology ring, we prove that, as long as $n$ is greater than $w$, the topological complexity of $\text{conf}(n,w)$ is $2n-2\big\lceil\frac{n}{w}\big\rceil+1$, providing a lower bound for the minimum number of cases such a program must consider.</description>

      <title>The port-Hamiltonian structure of continuum mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to the geometric formulation of solid and fluid mechanics within the port-Hamiltonian framework, which extends the standard Hamiltonian formulation to non-conservative and open dynamical systems. Leveraging Dirac structures, instead of symplectic or Poisson structures, this formalism allows the incorporation of energy exchange within the spatial domain or through its boundary, which allows for a more comprehensive description of continuum mechanics. Building upon our recent work in describing nonlinear elasticity using exterior calculus and bundle-valued differential forms, this paper focuses on the systematic derivation of port-Hamiltonian models for solid and fluid mechanics in the material, spatial, and convective representations using Hamiltonian reduction theory. This paper also discusses constitutive relations for stress within this framework including hyper-elasticity, for both finite- and infinite-strains, as well as viscous fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we study a broad class of fully nonlinear elliptic equations on Hermitian manifolds. On one hand, under the optimal structural assumptions we derive $C^{2,\alpha}$-estimate for solutions of the equations on closed Hermitian manifolds. On the other hand, we treat the Dirichlet problem. In both cases, we prove the existence theorems with unbounded condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2111.13202v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider spin manifolds with an Einstein metric, either Riemannian or indefinite, for which there exists a Killing spinor. We describe the intrinsic geometry of nondegenerate hypersurfaces in terms of a PDE satisfied by a pair of induced spinors, akin to the generalized Killing spinor equation. Conversely, we prove an embedding result for real analytic pseudo-Riemannian manifolds carrying a pair of spinors satisfying this condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.04015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show scalar-mean curvature rigidity of warped products of round spheres of dimension at least 2 over compact intervals equipped with strictly log-concave warping functions. This generalizes earlier results of Cecchini-Zeidler to all dimensions. Moreover, we show scalar curvature rigidity of round spheres of dimension at least 3 with two antipodal points removed. This resolves a problem in Gromov's ''Four Lectures'' in all dimensions. Our arguments are based on spin geometry.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional gradient Ricci solitons with (half) nonnegative isotropic curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our paper [24], in which we investigated the geometry of 4-dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with half positive (nonnegative) isotropic curvature. In this paper, we mainly focus on 4-dimensional gradient steady Ricci solitons with nonnegative isotropic curvature (WPIC) or half nonnegative isotropic curvature (half WPIC). In particular, for $4$D complete {\it ancient solutions} with WPIC, we are able to prove the nonnegativity of the Ricci curvature $Rc\geq 0$ and bound the curvature tensor $Rm$ by $|Rm| \leq R$. For 4D gradient steady solitons with WPIC, we obtain a classification result. We also give a partial classification of 4D gradient steady Ricci solitons with half WPIC. Moreover, we obtain a preliminary classification result for 4D complete gradient {\it expanding Ricci solitons} with WPIC. Finally, motivated by the recent work [60], we improve our earlier results in [24] on 4D gradient {\it shrinking Ricci solitons} with half PIC or half WPIC, and also provide a characterization of complete gradient K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers in complex dimension two among 4-dimensional gradient Ricci shrinkers.</description>

Abstract: We prove the following conjecture of Margulis. Let $G$ be a higher rank simple Lie group and let $\Lambda\le G$ be a discrete subgroup of infinite covolume. Then, the locally symmetric space $\Lambda\backslash G/K$ admits injected balls of any radius. This can be considered as a geometric interpretation of the celebrated Margulis normal subgroup theorem. However, it applies to general discrete subgroups not necessarily associated to lattices. Yet, the result is new even for subgroups of infinite index of lattices. We establish similar results for higher rank semisimple groups with Kazhdan's property (T). We prove a stiffness result for discrete stationary random subgroups in higher rank semisimple groups and a stationary variant of the St\"{u}ck-Zimmer theorem for higher rank semisimple groups with property (T). We also show that a stationary limit of a measure supported on discrete subgroups is almost surely discrete.</description>

      <title>Brieskorn spheres, cyclic group actions and the Milnor conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.05143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.05143v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we further develop the theory of equivariant Seiberg-Witten-Floer cohomology of the two authors, with an emphasis on Brieskorn homology spheres. We obtain the following applications. First, we show that the knot concordance invariants $\theta^{(c)}$ defined by the first author satisfy $\theta^{(c)}(T_{a,b}) = (a-1)(b-1)/2$ for torus knots, whenever $c$ is a prime not dividing $ab$. Since $\theta^{(c)}$ is a lower bound for the slice genus, this gives a new proof of the Milnor conjecture of a similar flavour to the proofs using the Ozsv\'ath-Szab\'o $\tau$-invariant or Rasmussen $s$-invariant. Second, we prove that a free cyclic group action on a Brieskorn homology $3$-sphere $Y = \Sigma(a_1 , \dots , a_r)$ does not extend smoothly to any contractible smooth $4$-manifold bounding $Y$. This generalises to arbitrary $r$ the result of Anvari-Hambleton in the case $r=3$. Third, given a finite subgroup of the Seifert circle action on $Y = \Sigma(a_1 , \dots , a_r)$ of prime order $p$ acting non-freely on $Y$, we prove that if the rank of $HF_{red}^+(Y)$ is greater than $p$ times the rank of $HF_{red}^+(Y/\mathbb{Z}_p)$, then the $\mathbb{Z}_p$-action on $Y$ does not extend smoothly to any contractible smooth $4$-manifold bounding $Y$. We also prove a similar non-extension result for equivariant connected sums of Brieskorn homology spheres.</description>

      <title>On divisorial stability of finite covers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Divisorial stability of a polarised variety is a stronger - but conjecturally equivalent - variant of uniform K-stability introduced by Boucksom-Jonsson. Whereas uniform K-stability is defined in terms of test configurations, divisorial stability is defined in terms of convex combinations of divisorial valuations on the variety.
  We consider the behaviour of divisorial stability under finite group actions, and prove that equivariant divisorial stability of a polarised variety is equivalent to log divisorial stability of its quotient. We use this and an interpolation technique to give a general construction of equivariantly divisorially stable polarised varieties.</description>

      <title>Milnor-Wood inequality for klt varieties of general type and uniformization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We generalize the definition of the Toledo invariant for representations of fundamental groups of smooth varieties of general type due to Koziarz and Maubon to the context of singular klt varieties, where the natural fundamental groups to consider are those of smooth loci. Assuming that the rank of the target Lie group is not greater than two, we show that the Toledo invariant satisfies a Milnor-Wood type inequality and we characterize the corresponding maximal representations.</description>
