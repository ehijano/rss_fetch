      <title>Multi-fidelity constraints in blackbox optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work studies constrained blackbox optimization problems that cannot be solved in reasonable time due to prohibitive computational costs. This challenge is especially prevalent in industrial applications, where blackbox evaluations are costly. However, constraints can be evaluated at various fidelities at a lower computational cost. More specifically, this work targets situations in which the infeasibility of each individual constraint can be detected at lower fidelities, and where a large discrete number of fidelities are available. Moreover, highly discontinuous problems which may fail to evaluate are considered, such that direct search methods are preferred to model-based ones. To this effect, the Interruptible Direct Search (IDS) and the Dynamic Interruptible Direct Search (DIDS) algorithms are proposed to leverage feasibility assessments from various fidelity levels to avoid high cost evaluations. The results show highly increased performances from NOMAD when it is paired with IDS or DIDS.</description>

      <title>On a Gradient Approach to Chebyshev Center Problems with Applications to Function Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce $\textsf{gradOL}$, the first gradient-based optimization framework for solving Chebyshev center problems, a fundamental challenge in optimal function learning and geometric optimization. $\textsf{gradOL}$ hinges on reformulating the semi-infinite problem as a finitary max-min optimization, making it amenable to gradient-based techniques. By leveraging automatic differentiation for precise numerical gradient computation, $\textsf{gradOL}$ ensures numerical stability and scalability, making it suitable for large-scale settings. Under strong convexity of the ambient norm, $\textsf{gradOL}$ provably recovers optimal Chebyshev centers while directly computing the associated radius. This addresses a key bottleneck in constructing stable optimal interpolants. Empirically, $\textsf{gradOL}$ achieves significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency on 34 benchmark Chebyshev center problems from a benchmark $\textsf{CSIP}$ library. Moreover, we extend $\textsf{gradOL}$ to general convex semi-infinite programming (CSIP), attaining up to $4000\times$ speedups over the state-of-the-art $\texttt{SIPAMPL}$ solver tested on the indicated $\textsf{CSIP}$ library containing 67 benchmark problems. Furthermore, we provide the first theoretical foundation for applying gradient-based methods to Chebyshev center problems, bridging rigorous analysis with practical algorithms. $\textsf{gradOL}$ thus offers a unified solution framework for Chebyshev centers and broader CSIPs.</description>

      <title>Resource-constrained Project Scheduling with Time-of-Use Energy Tariffs and Machine States: A Logic-based Benders Decomposition Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06542v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP) with time-of-use energy tariffs (TOU) and machine states, a variant of RCPSP for production scheduling where energy price is part of the criteria and one machine is highly energy-demanding and can be in one of the following three states: proc, idle, or off. The problem involves scheduling all tasks, respecting precedence constraints and resource limitations, while minimizing the combination of the overall makespan and the total energy cost (TEC), which varies according to the TOU pricing, which can take negative values. We propose two novel approaches to solve it: a monolithic Constraint Programming (CP) approach and a Logic-Based Benders Decomposition (LBBD) approach. The latter combines a master problem dealing with energy cost solved using Integer Linear Programming (ILP) with a subproblem handling the RCPSP resolved using CP. Both approaches surpass the monolithic compact ILP approach, but the LBBD significantly outperforms the CP when the ratio of energy-intensive tasks over the overall tasks is moderate, allowing for solving instances with up to 1600 tasks in sparse instances. Finally, we put forth a way of generalizing our LBBD approach to other problems sharing similar characteristics, and we applied it to a problem based on an RCPSP problem with blocking times &amp; total weighted tardiness criterion and a flexible job shop.</description>

      <title>Inexact DC Algorithms in Hilbert Spaces with Applications to PDE-Constrained Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we design and apply novel inexact adaptive algorithms to deal with minimizing difference-of-convex (DC) functions in Hilbert spaces. We first introduce I-ADCA, an inexact adaptive counterpart of the well-recognized DCA (difference-of-convex algorithm), that allows inexact subgradient evaluations and inexact solutions to convex subproblems while still guarantees global convergence to stationary points. Under a Polyak-Lojasiewicz type property for DC objectives, we obtain explicit convergence rates for the proposed algorithm. Our main application addresses elliptic optimal control problems with control constraints and nonconvex $L^{1-2}$ sparsity-enhanced regularizers admitting a DC decomposition. Employing I-ADCA and appropriate versions of finite element discretization leads us to an efficient procedure for solving such problems with establishing its well-posedness and error bound estimates confirmed by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>A finite-termination algorithm for testing copositivity over the positive semidefinite cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient algorithm for testing copositivity of homogeneous polynomials over the positive semidefinite cone. The algorithm is based on a novel matrix optimization reformulation and requires solving a hierarchy of semidefinite programs. Notably, it always terminates in finitely many iterations. If a homogeneous polynomial is copositive over the positive semidefinite cone, the algorithm provides a certificate; otherwise, it returns a vector that refutes copositivity. Building on a similar idea, we further propose an algorithm to test copositivity over the direct product of the positive semidefinite cone and the nonnegative orthant. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Water Demand Maximization: Quick Recovery of Nonlinear Physics Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Determining the maximum demand a water distribution network can satisfy is crucial for ensuring reliable supply and planning network expansion. This problem, typically formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear program (MINLP), is computationally challenging. A common strategy to address this challenge is to solve mixed-integer linear program (MILP) relaxations derived by partitioning variable domains and constructing linear over- and under-estimators to nonlinear constraints over each partition. While MILP relaxations are easier to solve up to a modest level of partitioning, their solutions often violate nonlinear water flow physics. Thus, recovering feasible MINLP solutions from the MILP relaxations is crucial for enhancing MILP-based approaches. In this paper, we propose a robust solution recovery method that efficiently computes feasible MINLP solutions from MILP relaxations, regardless of partition granularity. Combined with iterative partition refinement, our method generates a sequence of feasible solutions that progressively approach the optimum. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our method outperforms baseline methods and direct MINLP solves by consistently recovering high-quality feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation times.</description>

      <title>Splitting Proximal Point Algorithms for the Sum of Prox-Convex Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the minimization of a finite sum of prox-convex functions under Lipschitz continuity of each component. We propose two variants of the splitting proximal point algorithms proposed in \cite{Bacak,Bertsekas}: one deterministic with a fixed update order, and one stochastic with random sampling, and we extend them from convex to prox-convex functions. We prove global convergence for both methods under standard stepsize a\-ssump\-tions, with almost sure convergence for the stochastic variant via supermartingale theory. Numerical experiments with nonconvex quadratic functions illustrate the efficiency of the proposed methods and support the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>A belief-state restless bandit model for treatment adherence: Whittle indexability via partial conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study capacity-constrained treatment-adherence outreach via a belief-state restless multi-armed bandit model where patients are a partially observed two-state (adherent/nonadherent) Markov processes and interventions induce reset-type belief dynamics. Using partial conservation laws (PCLs), we establish Whittle indexability of the single-patient problem and derive a closed-form Whittle (marginal productivity) index, together with closed-form reward/work performance metrics under threshold policies and an explicit optimal threshold map. This yields an analytic Lagrangian relaxation: the single-patient Lagrangian value is a piecewise-affine convex function of the intervention price, enabling efficient computation of multi-patient dual bounds and certified relative optimality gaps. We also analyze how the Whittle index depends on the lapse and spontaneous-recovery parameters, providing qualitative insights on intervention priorities. In a large-scale numerical study over heterogeneous two-type populations, we compare Whittle's index policy with a myopic index rule and simple baselines; while myopic is highly competitive on most instances, Whittle's policy yields substantial gains in tight-capacity regimes with a fragile minority, reaching up to about $26\%$ higher reward and markedly smaller relative optimality gaps.</description>

      <title>Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers for nonlinear constrained convex problems and applications to distributed resource allocation and constrained machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a class of structured convex optimization problems, which have a two-block separable objective and nonlinear functional constraints as well as affine constraints that couple the two block variables. Such problems naturally arise from distributed resource allocation and constrained machine learning. To achieve high communication efficiency for the distributed applications, we propose a nonlinear alternating direction method of multipliers (NL-ADMM) that preserves the classical splitting structure while accommodating general convex functional constraints. Unlike existing ADMM variants for nonconvex constrained problems, the proposed method does not require smoothness of the objective functions or differentiability of the constraint mapping, by leveraging convexity of the considered problem. We establish global convergence and an ergodic $O(1/k)$ convergence rate of NL-ADMM by assuming the existence of a KKT solution. The results extend those of ADMM for linearly constrained convex problems. Numerical experiments are conducted on two representative distributed tasks. The results on numerous instances demonstrate that NL-ADMM can achieve (in many cases) 100x higher communication efficiency than the classic augmented Lagrangian method and nearly 2x higher than the Douglas-Rachford operator splitting method, making the new method well suited for large-scale distributed learning systems.</description>

      <title>Policy stability and ultimate stationarity in discounted risk-sensitive stochastic control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study discrete-time Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) on finite state-action spaces and analyze the stability of optimal policies and value functions in the long-run discounted risk-sensitive objective setting. Our analysis addresses robustness with respect to perturbations of the risk-aversion parameter and the discount factor, the emergence of ultimate stationarity, and the interaction between discounted and averaged formulations under suitable mixing assumptions. We further investigate limiting regimes associated with vanishing discount and vanishing risk sensitivity, and discuss the role of Blackwell-type stability properties in the discounted setting. Finally, we provide numerical illustrations that highlight the intrinsic non-stationarity of optimal discounted risk-sensitive policies.</description>

      <title>The G\"unt\"urk-Thao theorem revisited: polyhedral cones and limiting examples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2023, G\"unt\"urk and Thao proved that the sequence $(x^{(n)})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ generated by random (relaxed) projections drawn from a finite collection of innately regular closed subspaces in a real Hilbert space satisfies $\sum_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \|x^{(n)}-x^{(n+1)}\|^\gamma &lt;+\infty$ for all $\gamma&gt;0$.
  We extend their result to a finite collection of polyhedral cones. Moreover, we construct examples showing the tightness of our extension: indeed, the result fails for a line and a convex set in $\mathbb{R}^2$, and for a plane and a non-polyhedral cone in $\mathbb{R}^3$.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Robust Control for Uncertain Systems with Ellipsoid-Set Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite the celebrated success of stochastic control approaches for uncertain systems, such approaches are limited in the ability to handle non-Gaussian uncertainties. This work presents an adaptive robust control for linear uncertain systems, whose process noise, observation noise, and system states are depicted by ellipsoid sets rather than Gaussian distributions. We design an ellipsoid-set learning method to estimate the boundaries of state sets, and incorporate the learned sets into the control law derivation to reduce conservativeness in robust control. Further, we consider the parametric uncertainties in state-space matrices. Particularly, we assign finite candidates for the uncertain parameters, and construct a bank of candidate-conditional robust control problems for each candidate. We derive the final control law by aggregating the candidate-conditional control laws. In this way, we separate the control scheme into parallel robust controls, decoupling the learning and control, which otherwise renders the control unattainable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control in numerical simulations in the cases of linear quadratic regulation and tracking control.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Modulation Control of Multi-Conflict Connected Automated Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-conflict traffic is ubiquitous. Connected Automated Vehicles (CAVs) offer unprecedented opportunities to enhance safety, reduce emissions, and increase throughput through precise coordination and automation. However, existing CAV strategies remain confined to specialized scenarios, such as highway on-ramp merging or single-lane roundabouts, and traditional traffic signals sacrifice efficiency for safety via rigid phasing and all-red intervals. In this paper, we present Cyclic Modulation Control of Multi-Conflict Connected Automated Traffic (CMAT), a unified, geometry-agnostic framework that embeds each conflict point into a repeating sequence of "micro-phases". Vehicles dynamically form platoons with demand-responsive sizes and negotiate time slots for occupying conflict points, enabling collision-free traversal and high intersection utilization. CMAT aims to minimize delay, guarantee safety, and accommodate arbitrary merging, diverging, and crossing patterns without manual retuning. We formalize CMAT as a mixed-integer linear programming model constructed on a directed graph abstracted from the physical intersection layout. The performance of CMAT is evaluated across a suite of multi-conflict tests, including simple two-way crossings, four-leg intersections, complex connected intersections. The results demonstrate substantial reductions in delay and significant throughput improvements compared with state-of-the-art CAV coordination methods and traditional signal timing strategies.</description>

      <title>Robust maximum hands-off optimal control: existence, maximum principle, and $L^{0}$-$L^1$ equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work advances the maximum hands-off sparse control framework by developing a robust counterpart for constrained linear systems with parametric uncertainties. The resulting optimal control problem minimizes an $L^{0}$ objective subject to an uncountable, compact family of constraints, and is therefore a nonconvex, nonsmooth robust optimization problem. To address this, we replace the $L^{0}$ objective with its convex $L^{1}$ surrogate and, using a nonsmooth variant of the robust Pontryagin maximum principle, show that the $L^{0}$ and $L^{1}$ formulations have identical sets of optimal solutions -- we call this the robust hands-off principle. Building on this equivalence, we propose an algorithmic framework -- drawing on numerically viable techniques from the semi-infinite robust optimization literature -- to solve the resulting problems. An illustrative example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07326v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the AdamW-style Shampoo optimizer, an effective implementation of classical Shampoo that notably won the external tuning track of the AlgoPerf neural network training algorithm competition. Our analysis unifies one-sided and two-sided preconditioning and establishes the convergence rate $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^K E\left[\|\nabla f(X_k)\|_*\right]\leq O(\frac{\sqrt{m+n}C}{K^{1/4}})$ measured by nuclear norm, where $K$ represents the iteration number, $(m,n)$ denotes the size of matrix parameters, and $C$ matches the constant in the optimal convergence rate of SGD. Theoretically, we have $\|\nabla f(X)\|_F\leq \|\nabla f(X)\|_*\leq \sqrt{m+n}\|\nabla f(X)\|_F$, supporting that our convergence rate can be considered to be analogous to the optimal $\frac{1}{K}\sum_{k=1}^KE\left[\|\nabla f(X_k)\|_F\right]\leq O(\frac{C}{K^{1/4}})$ convergence rate of SGD in the ideal case of $\|\nabla f(X)\|_*= \Theta(\sqrt{m+n})\|\nabla f(X)\|_F$.</description>

      <title>Layerwise goal-oriented adaptivity for neural ODEs: an optimal control perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel layerwise adaptive construction method for neural network architectures. Our approach is based on a goal--oriented dual-weighted residual technique for the optimal control of neural differential equations. This leads to an ordinary differential equation constrained optimization problem with controls acting as coefficients and a specific loss function. We implement our approach on the basis of a DG(0) Galerkin discretization of the neural ODE, leading to an explicit Euler time marching scheme. For the optimization we use steepest descent. Finally, we apply our method to the construction of neural networks for the classification of data sets, where we present results for a selection of well known examples from the literature.</description>

      <title>Nonquadratic global asymptotic stability certificates for saturated linear feedbacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish sufficient conditions for positive (semi-)definiteness, with or without radial unboundedness, for nonquadratic Lyapunov function constructed as sign-indefinite quadratic forms involving the state and the deadzone of a suitable input. We then use these conditions to build weak nonquadratic Lyapunov functions establishing global asymptotic stability of linear systems in feedback through a saturation, leveraging invariance principles. Our results are shown to be non-conservative (necessary and sufficient) for a family of well known prototypical examples of linear SISO feedbacks that are not globally exponentially stabilizable (the so-called ANCBI plants). Our multi-input extension leads to convex stability analysis tests, formulated as linear matrix inequalities that are applicable to ANCBI non-globally-exponentially-stabilizable plants.</description>

      <title>Design of Optimal Controls in Acausal LQG Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In control theory, a system which has output depending only on the present and past values of the input is said to be causal (or nonanticipative). Respectively, a system is acausal (or non-causal) if its output depends on future inputs as well. Overall majority of literature in stochastic control theory discusses causal systems. Only a few sources indirectly concern acausal systems. In this paper, we systemize these results under main idea of acausality and present a background for designing optimal controls in acausal LQG problems.</description>

      <title>Online Markov Decision Processes with Terminal Law Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional reinforcement learning usually assumes either episodic interactions with resets or continuous operation to minimize average or cumulative loss. While episodic settings have many theoretical results, resets are often unrealistic in practice. The infinite-horizon setting avoids this issue but lacks non-asymptotic guarantees in online scenarios with unknown dynamics. In this work, we move towards closing this gap by introducing a reset-free framework called the periodic framework, where the goal is to find periodic policies: policies that not only minimize cumulative loss but also return the agents to their initial state distribution after a fixed number of steps. We formalize the problem of finding optimal periodic policies and identify sufficient conditions under which it is well-defined for tabular Markov decision processes. To evaluate algorithms in this framework, we introduce the periodic regret, a measure that balances cumulative loss with the terminal law constraint. We then propose the first algorithms for computing periodic policies in two multi-agent settings and show they achieve sublinear periodic regret of order $\tilde O(T^{3/4})$. This provides the first non-asymptotic guarantees for reset-free learning in the setting of $M$ homogeneous agents, for $M &gt; 1$.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Stochastic VRP: Integration of Forecast Duration into Optimization for Utility Workforce Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07514v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of machine learning forecasts of intervention durations into a stochastic variant of the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (CVRPTW). In particular, we exploit tree-based gradient boosting (XGBoost) trained on eight years of gas meter maintenance data to produce point predictions and uncertainty estimates, which then drive a multi-objective evolutionary optimization routine. The methodology addresses uncertainty through sub-Gaussian concentration bounds for route-level risk buffers and explicitly accounts for competing operational KPIs through a multi-objective formulation. Empirical analysis of prediction residuals validates the sub-Gaussian assumption underlying the risk model. From an empirical point of view, our results report improvements around 20-25\% in operator utilization and completion rates compared with plans computed using default durations. The integration of uncertainty quantification and risk-aware optimization provides a practical framework for handling stochastic service durations in real-world routing applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a generalized concept of boundedness of a subset of a normed vector space with respect to a cone, which is defined as lower boundedness of the images of the underlying set through all the positive functionals of the cone. We show that this is a weaker notion when compared to other similar ones and we explore several links with the existing literature. We subsequently demonstrate that this concept furnishes the properties required to obtain various generalizations of important results and techniques, including conic cancellation rules and the R{\aa}dstr\"om embedding procedure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This review outlines the major approaches to modelling opinion formation and manipulation in mathematics and computer science. Key tools such as ordinary and partial differential equations, stochastic models, control theory, and interaction protocols are introduced and compared as methods for describing manipulation. The review is separated into those models using a continuous opinion space and those using discrete or binary opinions, with the advantages and disadvantages of each discussed. Finally, the authors provide an interdisciplinary perspective on the field of opinion dynamics and its social significance.</description>

      <title>Beyond Single-GPU: Scaling PDLP to Distributed Multi-GPU Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a distributed implementation of the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient (PDHG) algorithm for solving massive-scale linear programming (LP) problems. Although PDHG-based solvers have shown strong performance on single-node GPU architectures, their applicability to industrial-scale instances is often limited by GPU memory capacity and computational throughput. To overcome these challenges, we extend the PDHG framework to a distributed-memory setting via a practical two-dimensional grid partitioning of the constraint matrix, enabling scalable execution across multiple GPUs. Our implementation leverages the NCCL communication backend to efficiently synchronize primal-dual updates across devices. To improve load balance and computational efficiency, we introduce a block-wise random shuffling strategy combined with nonzero-aware data distribution, and further accelerate computation through fused CUDA kernels. By distributing both memory and computation, the proposed framework not only overcomes the single-GPU memory bottleneck but also achieves substantial speedups by exploiting multi-GPU parallelism with relatively low communication overhead. Extensive experiments on standard LP benchmarks, including MIPLIB and Hans' instances, as well as large-scale real-world datasets, show that our distributed implementation, built upon cuPDLPx, achieves strong scalability and high performance while preserving full FP64 numerical accuracy.</description>

      <title>To report or not to report: Optimal claim reporting in a bonus-malus system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an optimal claim reporting problem in a bonus-malus setting. We assume, that the insurance contract consists of two regimes, where reporting a claim leads to a transition to a higher-premium regime, whereas remaining claim-free for a prespecified time period results in a shift to the lower premium regime. The insured can decide whether or not to report an occurred claim. We formulate this as an optimal control problem, where the policyholder follows a barrier-type reporting strategy, with the goal of maximizing the expected value of a function of their terminal wealth. We show that the associated value function is the unique viscosity solution to a system of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations. This characterization allows us to compute numerical approximations of the optimal barrier strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate convergence and turnpike properties for linear-quadratic mean field control problems with common noise. Within a unified framework, we analyze a finite-horizon social optimization problem, its mean field control limit, and the corresponding ergodic mean field control problem. The finite-horizon problems are characterized by coupled Riccati differential equations, whereas the ergodic problem is addressed via a Bellman equation on the Wasserstein space, which reduces to a system of stabilizing algebraic Riccati equations. By deriving estimates for these Riccati systems, we establish a turnpike property for the finite-horizon mean field control problem and obtain quantitative convergence results from the social optimization problem to its mean field limit and the associated ergodic control problem.</description>

      <title>Tree-Preconditioned Differentiable Optimization and Axioms as Layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a differentiable framework that embeds the axiomatic structure of Random Utility Models (RUM) directly into deep neural networks. Although projecting empirical choice data onto the RUM polytope is NP-hard in general, we uncover an isomorphism between RUM consistency and flow conservation on the Boolean lattice. Leveraging this combinatorial structure, we derive a novel Tree-Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient solver. By exploiting the spanning tree of the constraint graph, our preconditioner effectively "whitens" the ill-conditioned Hessian spectrum induced by the Interior Point Method barrier, achieving superlinear convergence and scaling to problem sizes previously deemed unsolvable. We further formulate the projection as a differentiable layer via the Implicit Function Theorem, where the exact Jacobian propagates geometric constraints during backpropagation. Empirical results demonstrate that this "Axioms-as-Layers" paradigm eliminates the structural overfitting inherent in penalty-based methods, enabling models that are jointly trainable, provably rational, and capable of generalizing from sparse data regimes where standard approximations fail.</description>

      <title>One if by Land, Two if by Sea, Three if by Four Seas, and More to Come -- Values of Perception, Prediction, Communication, and Common Sense in Decision Making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06077v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work aims to rigorously define the values of perception, prediction, communication, and common sense in decision making. The defined quantities are decision-theoretic, but have information-theoretic analogues, e.g., they share some simple but key mathematical properties with Shannon entropy and mutual information, and can reduce to these quantities in particular settings. One interesting observation is that, the value of perception without prediction can be negative, while the value of perception together with prediction and the value of prediction alone are always nonnegative. The defined quantities suggest answers to practical questions arising in the design of autonomous decision-making systems. Example questions include: Do we need to observe and predict the behavior of a particular agent? How important is it? What is the best order to observe and predict the agents? The defined quantities may also provide insights to cognitive science and neural science, toward the understanding of how natural decision makers make use of information gained from different sources and operations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of sparse optimization, with a focus on both sparse signal recovery and sparse regularization techniques. We will begin by exploring the foundations of sparse optimization, delving into the mathematical tools and models that underpin sparse signal recovery and LASSO. We will then discuss key algorithms for both sparse recovery (e.g., basis pursuit, matching pursuit) and sparse regularization (e.g., LASSO, elastic net), along with their applications in real-world problems. Throughout the text, we balance intuitive explanations with rigorous mathematical formulations to provide a comprehensive resource for both newcomers and experts in the field. Our aim is twofold: to provide a self-contained entry point for students and researchers new to the field, and to offer a rigorous reference for practitioners seeking to apply sparse optimization in science and engineering.</description>

      <title>Matrix Factorization Framework for Community Detection under the Degree-Corrected Block Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is a fundamental task in data analysis. Block models form a standard approach to partition nodes according to a graph model, facilitating the analysis and interpretation of the network structure. By grouping nodes with similar connection patterns, they enable the identification of a wide variety of underlying structures. The degree-corrected block model (DCBM) is an established model that accounts for the heterogeneity of node degrees. However, existing inference methods for the DCBM are heuristics that are highly sensitive to initialization, typically done randomly. In this work, we show that DCBM inference can be reformulated as a constrained nonnegative matrix factorization problem. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel method for community detection and a theoretically well-grounded initialization strategy that provides an initial estimate of communities for inference algorithms. Our approach is agnostic to any specific network structure and applies to graphs with any structure representable by a DCBM, not only assortative ones. Experiments on synthetic and real benchmark networks show that our method detects communities comparable to those found by DCBM inference, while scaling linearly with the number of edges and communities; for instance, it processes a graph with 100,000 nodes and 2,000,000 edges in approximately 4 minutes. Moreover, the proposed initialization strategy significantly improves solution quality and reduces the number of iterations required by all tested inference algorithms. Overall, this work provides a scalable and robust framework for community detection and highlights the benefits of a matrix-factorization perspective for the DCBM.</description>

      <title>Bipartitioning of Graph States for Distributed Measurement-Based Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measurement-Based Quantum Computing (MBQC) is inherently well-suited for Distributed Quantum Computing (DQC): once a resource state is prepared and distributed across a network of quantum nodes, computation proceeds through local measurements coordinated by classical communication. However, since non-local gates acting on different Quantum Processing Units (QPUs) are a bottleneck, it is crucial to optimize the qubit assignment to minimize inter-node entanglement of the shared resource. For graph state resources shared across two QPUs, this task reduces to finding bipartitions with minimal cut rank. We introduce a simulated annealing-based algorithm that efficiently updates the cut rank when two vertices swap sides across a bipartition, such that computing the new cut rank from scratch, which would be much more expensive, is not necessary. We show that the approach is highly effective for determining qubit assignments in distributed MBQC by testing it on grid graphs and the measurement-based Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA).</description>

      <title>Designing a Resilient Allee-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In stochastic population dynamics, stochastic wandering can produce transition to an absorbing state. In particular, under Allee effects, low densities amplify the possibility of population collapse. We investigate this in an Allee-Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (Allee-OU) model, that couples a bistable Allee growth equation, with demographic noise, and environmental fluctuations modeled as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. This process replaces the bifurcation parameter of the deterministic Allee effect equation. In the model, small noise may induce escape from the safe basin around the positive equilibrium toward extinction. We construct a stochastic control, altering the process to have a stationary distribution. We enable tractable control design, approximating the process by one with a stationary distribution. Two controlled models are developed, one acting directly on population size and another also modulating the environment. A threshold-based implementation minimizes the frequency of interventions while maximizing safe time. Simulations demonstrate that the control stabilizes fluctuations around the equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Computing the Petz-Augustin Capacity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06492v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first algorithms with non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for computing the Petz-Augustin capacity, which generalizes the channel capacity and characterizes the optimal error exponent in classical-quantum channel coding. This capacity can be equivalently expressed as the maximization of two generalizations of mutual information: the Petz-R\'{e}nyi information and the Petz-Augustin information. To maximize the Petz-R\'{e}nyi information, we show that it corresponds to a convex H\"{o}lder-smooth optimization problem, and hence the universal fast gradient method of Nesterov (2015), along with its convergence guarantees, readily applies. Regarding the maximization of the Petz-Augustin information, we adopt a two-layered approach: we show that the objective function is smooth relative to the negative Shannon entropy and can be efficiently optimized by entropic mirror descent; each iteration of entropic mirror descent requires computing the Petz-Augustin information, for which we propose a novel fixed-point algorithm and establish its contractivity with respect to the Thompson metric. Notably, this two-layered approach can be viewed as a generalization of the mirror-descent interpretation of the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm due to He et al. (2024).</description>

      <title>Inference-Time Alignment for Diffusion Models via Doob's Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inference-time alignment for diffusion models aims to adapt a pre-trained diffusion model toward a target distribution without retraining the base score network, thereby preserving the generative capacity of the base model while enforcing desired properties at the inference time. A central mechanism for achieving such alignment is guidance, which modifies the sampling dynamics through an additional drift term. In this work, we introduce Doob's matching, a novel framework for guidance estimation grounded in Doob's $h$-transform. Our approach formulates guidance as the gradient of logarithm of an underlying Doob's $h$-function and employs gradient-penalized regression to simultaneously estimate both the $h$-function and its gradient, resulting in a consistent estimator of the guidance. Theoretically, we establish non-asymptotic convergence rates for the estimated guidance. Moreover, we analyze the resulting controllable diffusion processes and prove non-asymptotic convergence guarantees for the generated distributions in the 2-Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel framework for density estimation under expectation constraints is proposed. The framework minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the estimated density and a prior, subject to the constraints that the expected value of a set of functions adopts or exceeds given values. The framework is generalized to include regularization inequalities to mitigate the artifacts in the target measure. An annealing-like algorithm is developed to address non-smooth constraints, with its effectiveness demonstrated through both synthetic and proof-of-concept real world examples in finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the extremal behaviour of deep holes in polyominoes. We determine the maximum number, $h_n$ of deep holes that an $n$-omino can enclose, ensuring that the boundary of each hole is disjoint from the boundaries of any other hole and from the outer boundary of the $n$-tile. Using the versatile application of Pick's theorem, we establish the lower and the upper bound for $h_n$, and show that $h_n=\frac{n}{3}+o(n)$ asymptotically. To further develop these results, we compute $h_n$ as a function of $n$ for an infinite subset of positive integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the convergence of symmetric stochastic differential games with interactions via control, where the volatility terms of both idiosyncratic and common noises are controlled. We apply the stochastic maximum principle, following the approach of Lauri\`{e}re and Tangpi, to reduce the convergence analysis to the study of forward-backward propagation of chaos. Under the standard monotonicity conditions, we derive quantitative convergence rates for open-loop Nash equilibria of $N$-player stochastic differential games toward the corresponding mean field equilibrium. As a prerequisite, we also establish the well-posedness of the conditional McKean--Vlasov forward-backward stochastic differential equations by the method of continuation. Moreover, we analyze a specific class of linear-quadratic settings to demonstrate the applicability of our main result.</description>

      <title>Surrogate-based Optimization via Clustering for Box-Constrained Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global optimization of large-scale, complex systems such as multi-physics black-box simulations and real-world industrial systems is important but challenging. This work presents a novel Surrogate-Based Optimization framework based on Clustering, SBOC for global optimization of such systems, which can be used with any surrogate modeling technique. At each iteration, it uses a single surrogate model for the entire domain, employs k-means clustering to identify unexplored domain, and exploits a local region around the surrogate optimum to potentially add three new sample points in the domain. SBOC has been tested against sixteen promising benchmarking algorithms using 52 analytical test functions of varying input dimensionalities and shape profiles. It successfully identified a global minimum for most test functions with substantially lower computational effort than other algorithms. It worked especially well on test functions with four or more input variables. It was also among the top six algorithms in approaching a global minimum closely. Overall, SBOC is a robust, reliable, and efficient algorithm for global optimization of box-constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Energy-efficient torque allocation for straight-line driving of electric vehicles based on pseudoconvex polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07527</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07527v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicles with multiple motors provide a flexibility in meeting the driver torque demand, which calls for minimizing the battery energy consumption through torque allocation. In this paper, we present an approach to this problem based on approximating electric motor losses using higher-order polynomials with specific properties. To ensure a well-behaved optimization landscape, monotonicity and positivity constraints are imposed on the polynomial models using sum of squares programming. This methodology provides robustness against noisy or sparse data, while retaining the computational efficiency of a polynomial function approximation. The torque allocation problem based on such polynomials is formulated as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem and solved efficiently using readily available solvers. In the nominal case, the first-order necessary conditions for optimality can also be used to obtain a global solution. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on several certification driving cycles against a grid search-based benchmark. Results show a modest influence on electric energy consumption, while enabling real-time optimization and integration with other vehicle control systems.</description>

Abstract: We address the problem of comparing and aligning spatial point configurations in $\mathbb{R}^3$ arising from structured geometric patterns. Each pattern is decomposed into arms along which we define a normalized finite-difference operator measuring local variations of the height component with respect to the planar geometry of the pattern. This quantity provides a parametrization-independent local descriptor that complements global similarity measures. In particular, it integrates naturally with Wasserstein-type distances for comparing point distributions and with Procrustes analysis for rigid alignment of geometric structures.</description>

      <title>Learning to accelerate Krasnosel'skii-Mann fixed-point iterations with guarantees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a principled learning to optimize (L2O) framework for solving fixed-point problems involving general nonexpansive mappings. Our idea is to deliberately inject summable perturbations into a standard Krasnosel'skii-Mann iteration to improve its average-case performance over a specific distribution of problems while retaining its convergence guarantees. Under a metric sub-regularity assumption, we prove that the proposed parametrization includes only iterations that locally achieve linear convergence-up to a vanishing bias term-and that it encompasses all iterations that do so at a sufficiently fast rate. We then demonstrate how our framework can be used to augment several widely-used operator splitting methods to accelerate the solution of structured monotone inclusion problems, and validate our approach on a best approximation problem using an L2O-augmented Douglas-Rachford splitting algorithm.</description>

      <title>Enforcing Priority in Schedule-based User Equilibrium Transit Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07712v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Denied boarding in congested transit systems induces queuing delays and departure-time shifts that can reshape passenger flows. Correctly modeling these responses in transit assignment hinges on the enforcement of two priority rules: continuance priority for onboard passengers and first-come-first-served (FCFS) boarding among waiting passengers. Existing schedule-based models typically enforce these rules through explicit dynamic loading and group-level expected costs, yet discrete vehicle runs can induce nontrivial within-group cost differences that undermine behavioral consistency. We revisit the implicit-priority framework of Nguyen et al. (2001), which, by encoding boarding priority through the notion of available capacity, characterizes route and departure choices based on realized personal (rather than group-averaged) travel experiences. However, the framework lacks an explicit mathematical formulation and exact computational methods for finding equilibria. Here, we derive an equivalent nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) formulation and establish equilibrium existence under mild conditions. We also show that multiple equilibria may exist, including behaviorally questionable ones. To rule out these artifacts, we propose a refined arc-level NCP formulation that not only corresponds to a tighter, behaviorally consistent equilibrium concept but also is more computationally tractable. We reformulate the NCP as a continuously differentiable mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) and propose two solution algorithms. Numerical studies on benchmark instances and a Hong Kong case study demonstrate that the model reproduces continuance priority and FCFS queuing and captures departure-time shifts driven by the competition for boarding priority.</description>

      <title>Joint Binary-Continuous Fractional Programming: Solution Methods and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.02152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.02152v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a class of non-convex sum-of-ratios programs relevant to decision-making in key areas such as product assortment and pricing, and facility location and cost planning. These optimization problems, characterized by both continuous and binary decision variables, are highly non-convex and challenging to solve. To the best of our knowledge, no existing methods can efficiently solve these problems to near-optimality with arbitrary precision. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative approach based on logarithmic transformations and piecewise linear approximation (PWLA) to approximate the nonlinear fractional program as a mixed-integer convex program with arbitrary precision, which can be efficiently solved using cutting plane (CP) or Branch-and-Cut (B&amp;C) procedures. Our method offers several advantages: it allows for a shared set of binary variables to approximate nonlinear terms and employs an optimal set of breakpoints to approximate other non-convex terms in the reformulation, resulting in an approximate model that is minimal in size. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis of the approximation errors associated with the solutions derived from the approximated problem. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to constrained competitive joint facility location and cost optimization, as well as constrained product assortment and pricing problems. Extensive experiments on instances of varying sizes, comparing our method with several alternatives, including general-purpose solvers and more direct PWLA-based approximations, show that our approach consistently achieves superior performance across all baselines, particularly in large-scale instances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09858v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that a suitable Slater condition implies a duality inequality between the Hoffman constants of the following feasibility problems: $$ \begin{array}{r} Ax-b \in S\\ x \in R \end{array} \qquad\text{ and }\qquad \begin{array}{r} c-A^T y \in R^*\\ y \in S^*. \end{array} $$ where $A\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$, and $R\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $S\subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$ are reference polyhedral cones, with respective dual cones $R^*\subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ and $S^*\subseteq \mathbb{R}^m$. Our approach relies on an exact characterization of Hoffman constants and introduces a novel Hoffman duality inequality for polyhedral set-valued mappings. These two fundamental results also yield a striking identity between the Hoffman constants of box-constrained feasibility problems, which feature a similar primal-dual structure with a box and a linear subspace as reference sets. Additionally, we establish a surprising identity between the Hoffman constants of box-constrained feasibility problems and the chi condition measures for weighted least-squares problems</description>

      <title>A multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model for supply chain planning of 3D printing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05213v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: 3D printing is considered the future of production systems and one of the physical elements of the Fourth Industrial Revolution. 3D printing will significantly impact the product lifecycle, considering cost, energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions, leading to the creation of sustainable production systems. Given the importance of these production systems and their effects on the quality of life for future generations, it is expected that 3D printing will soon become one of the global industry's fundamental needs. Although three decades have passed since the emergence of 3D printers, there has not yet been much research on production planning and mass production using these devices. Therefore, we aimed to identify the existing gaps in the planning of 3D printers and to propose a model for planning and scheduling these devices. In this research, several parts with different heights, areas, and volumes have been considered for allocation on identical 3D printers for various tasks. To solve this problem, a multi-objective mixed integer linear programming model has been proposed to minimize the earliness and tardiness of parts production, considering their order delivery times, and maximizing machine utilization. Additionally, a method has been proposed for the placement of parts in 3D printers, leading to the selection of the best edge as the height. Using a numerical example, we have plotted the Pareto curve obtained from solving the model using the epsilon constraint method for several parts and analyzed the impact of the method for selecting the best edge as the height, with and without considering it. Additionally, a comprehensive sensitivity and scenario analysis has been conducted to validate the results.</description>

      <title>Constrained Consensus-Based Optimization and Numerical Heuristics for the Few Particle Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consensus-based optimization (CBO) is a versatile multi-particle optimization method for performing nonconvex and nonsmooth global optimizations in high dimensions. Proofs of global convergence in probability have been achieved for a broad class of objective functions in unconstrained optimizations. In this work we adapt the algorithm for solving constrained optimizations on compact and unbounded domains with boundary by leveraging emerging reflective boundary conditions. In particular, we close a relevant gap in the literature by providing a global convergence proof for the many-particle regime comprehensive of convergence rates. On the one hand, for the sake of minimizing running cost, it is desirable to keep the number of particles small. On the other hand, reducing the number of particles implies a diminished capability of exploration of the algorithm. Hence numerical heuristics are needed to ensure convergence of CBO in the few-particle regime. In this work, we also significantly improve the convergence and complexity of CBO by utilizing an adaptive region control mechanism and by choosing geometry-specific random noise. In particular, by combining a hierarchical noise structure with a multigrid finite element method, we are able to compute global minimizers for a constrained $p$-Allen-Cahn problem with obstacles, a very challenging variational problem.</description>

      <title>Effectively Leveraging Momentum Terms in Stochastic Line Search Frameworks for Fast Optimization of Finite-Sum Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07102v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we address unconstrained finite-sum optimization problems, with particular focus on instances originating in large scale deep learning scenarios. Our main interest lies in the exploration of the relationship between recent line search approaches for stochastic optimization in the overparametrized regime and momentum directions. First, we point out that combining these two elements with computational benefits is not straightforward. To this aim, we propose a solution based on mini-batch persistency. We then introduce an algorithmic framework that exploits a mix of data persistency, conjugate-gradient type rules for the definition of the momentum parameter and stochastic line searches. The resulting algorithm provably possesses convergence properties under suitable assumptions and is empirically shown to outperform other popular methods from the literature, obtaining state-of-the-art results in both convex and nonconvex large scale training problems.</description>

      <title>Lagrange multiplier expressions for matrix polynomial optimization and tight relaxations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12579v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies matrix constrained polynomial optimization. We investigate how to get explicit expressions for Lagrange multiplier matrices from the first order optimality conditions. The existence of these expressions can be shown under the nondegeneracy condition. Using Lagrange multiplier matrix expressions, we propose a strengthened Moment-SOS hierarchy for solving matrix polynomial optimization. Under some general assumptions, we show that this strengthened hierarchy is tight, or equivalently, it has finite convergence. We also study how to detect tightness and how to extract optimizers. Numerical experiments are provided to show the efficiency of the strengthened hierarchy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19718v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the barges shipping problem, also known as the tugboats scheduling problem, within the context of a scenario where a single tugboat has the capacity to tow multiple barges and conduct multiple trips in a drop-and-pull mode during a daily work shift. The problem is mathematically formalized as mixed-integer programming models. To tackle real-world-sized problem instances, an adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) algorithm integrated with a decoding mathematical model is proposed. When applied to large-scale instances, the ALNS algorithm showcases performance superiority over the strengthened mathematical model.</description>

      <title>Agile Tradespace Exploration for Space Rendezvous Mission Design via Transformers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spacecraft rendezvous enables on-orbit servicing, debris removal, and crewed docking, forming the foundation for a scalable space economy. Designing such missions requires rapid exploration of the tradespace between control cost and flight time across multiple candidate targets. However, multi-objective optimization in this setting is challenging, as the underlying constraints are often nonconvex, and mission designers must balance accuracy (e.g., solving the full problem) with efficiency (e.g., convex relaxations), slowing iteration and limiting design agility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an AI-powered framework that enables agile and generalized rendezvous mission design. Given the orbital information of the target spacecraft, boundary conditions of the servicer, and a range of flight times, a transformer model generates a set of near-Pareto optimal trajectories across varying flight times in a single parallelized inference step, thereby enabling rapid mission trade studies. The model is further extended to accommodate variable flight times and perturbed orbital dynamics, supporting realistic multi-objective trade-offs. Validation on chance-constrained rendezvous problems in Earth orbits with passive safety constraints demonstrates that the model generalizes across both flight times and dynamics, consistently providing high-quality initial guesses that converge to superior solutions in fewer iterations. Moreover, the framework efficiently approximates the Pareto front, achieving runtimes comparable to convex relaxation by exploiting parallelized inference. Together, these results position the proposed framework as a practical surrogate for nonconvex trajectory generation and mark an important step toward AI-driven trajectory design for accelerating preliminary mission planning in real-world rendezvous applications.</description>

Abstract: This paper deals with the problem of designing unknown input observers for a class of coupled semilinear wave partial differential equations (PDE) systems. A state observer is designed to estimate the uncertain coupled wave PDE systems. Then, the analysis of the asymptotic stability and $H_{\infty}$ performance for the observer design of coupled wave PDE systems is investigated. Some sufficient conditions of asymptotic stability for the observer error system with disturbance attenuation level are derived via matrix inequalities based on the Lyapunov stability theory. Finally, a numerical simulation is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained result.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.23339v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the small-time global controllability properties of a class of fourth-order nonlinear parabolic equations driven by a bilinear control posed on the one-dimensional torus. The controls depend only on time and act through a prescribed family of spatial profiles. Our first result establishes the small-time global approximate controllability of the system using three scalar controls, between states that share the same sign. This property is obtained by adapting the geometric control approach to the fourth-order setting, using a finite family of frequency-localized controls. We then study the small-time global exact controllability to non-zero constant states for the concerned system. This second result is achieved by analyzing the null controllability of an appropriate linearized fourth-order system and by deducing the controllability of the nonlinear bilinear model through a fixed-point argument together with the small-time global approximate control property.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01248v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a stochastic control framework for global optimization over both Euclidean spaces and the Wasserstein space of probability measures, where the objective function may be non-convex and/or non-differentiable. In the Euclidean setting, the original minimization problem is approximated by a family of regularized stochastic control problems; using dynamic programming, we analyze the associated Hamilton--Jacobi--Bellman equations and obtain tractable representations via the Cole--Hopf transformation and the Feynman--Kac formula. For optimization over probability measures, we formulate a regularized mean-field control problem characterized by a master equation, and further approximate it by controlled $N$-particle systems. We establish that, as the regularization parameter tends to zero (and as the particle number tends to infinity for the optimization over probability measures), the value of the control problem converges to the global minimum of the original objective. Building on the resulting probabilistic representations, Monte Carlo-based numerical schemes are proposed and numerical experiments are reported to illustrate the effectiveness of the methods and to support the theoretical convergence rates.</description>

      <title>Markovian Compression: Looking to the Past Helps Accelerate the Future</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals with distributed optimization problems that use compressed communication to achieve efficient performance and mitigate communication bottleneck. We propose a family of compression schemes in which operators transform vectors fed to their input according to a Markov chain, i.e. the stochasticity of the compressors depends on previous iterations. The compressors are implemented in the vanilla Quantized Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm (QSGD), and, to further improve the efficiency and convergence rate, in the momentum accelerated QSGD. We provide convergence results for our algorithms with Markovian compressors, the analysis covers non-convex, Polyak-Lojasiewicz, and strongly convex cases. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach to distributed data-parallel optimization problems, we conduct experiments on the CIFAR-10 and GLUE datasets with the Resnet-18 and DeBERTaV3 models. Practical results show the superiority of methods that use our compressor design over existing schemes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present skwdro, a Python library for training robust machine learning models. The library is based on distributionally robust optimization using Wasserstein distances, popular in optimal transport and machine learnings. The goal of the library is to make the training of robust models easier for a wide audience by proposing a wrapper for PyTorch modules, enabling model loss' robustification with minimal code changes. It comes along with scikit-learn compatible estimators for some popular objectives. The core of the implementation relies on an entropic smoothing of the original robust objective, in order to ensure maximal model flexibility. The library is available at https://github.com/iutzeler/skwdro and the documentation at https://skwdro.readthedocs.io.</description>

      <title>SAD Neural Networks: Divergent Gradient Flows and Asymptotic Optimality via o-minimal Structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09572v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study gradient flows for loss landscapes of fully connected feedforward neural networks with commonly used continuously differentiable activation functions such as the logistic, hyperbolic tangent, softplus or GELU function. We prove that the gradient flow either converges to a critical point or diverges to infinity while the loss converges to an asymptotic critical value. Moreover, we prove the existence of a threshold $\varepsilon&gt;0$ such that the loss value of any gradient flow initialized at most $\varepsilon$ above the optimal level converges to it. For polynomial target functions and sufficiently big architecture and data set, we prove that the optimal loss value is zero and can only be realized asymptotically. From this setting, we deduce our main result that any gradient flow with sufficiently good initialization diverges to infinity. Our proof heavily relies on the geometry of o-minimal structures. We confirm these theoretical findings with numerical experiments and extend our investigation to more realistic scenarios, where we observe an analogous behavior.</description>

      <title>Certifying Stability of Reinforcement Learning Policies using Generalized Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10947v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Establishing stability certificates for closed-loop systems under reinforcement learning (RL) policies is essential to move beyond empirical performance and offer guarantees of system behavior. Classical Lyapunov methods require a strict stepwise decrease in the Lyapunov function but such certificates are difficult to construct for learned policies. The RL value function is a natural candidate but it is not well understood how it can be adapted for this purpose. To gain intuition, we first study the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) problem and make two key observations. First, a Lyapunov function can be obtained from the value function of an LQR policy by augmenting it with a residual term related to the system dynamics and stage cost. Second, the classical Lyapunov decrease requirement can be relaxed to a generalized Lyapunov condition requiring only decrease on average over multiple time steps. Using this intuition, we consider the nonlinear setting and formulate an approach to learn generalized Lyapunov functions by augmenting RL value functions with neural network residual terms. Our approach successfully certifies the stability of RL policies trained on Gymnasium and DeepMind Control benchmarks. We also extend our method to jointly train neural controllers and stability certificates using a multi-step Lyapunov loss, resulting in larger certified inner approximations of the region of attraction compared to the classical Lyapunov approach. Overall, our formulation enables stability certification for a broad class of systems with learned policies by making certificates easier to construct, thereby bridging classical control theory and modern learning-based methods.</description>

      <title>A Convergent Generalized Krylov Subspace Method for Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction with Gradient-Driven Denoisers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-based reconstruction plays a key role in compressed sensing (CS) MRI, as it incorporates effective image regularizers to improve the quality of reconstruction. The Plug-and-Play and Regularization-by-Denoising frameworks leverage advanced denoisers (e.g., convolutional neural network (CNN)-based denoisers) and have demonstrated strong empirical performance. However, their theoretical guarantees remain limited, as practical CNNs often violate key assumptions. In contrast, gradient-driven denoisers achieve competitive performance, and the required assumptions for theoretical analysis are easily satisfied. However, solving the associated optimization problem remains computationally demanding. To address this challenge, we propose a generalized Krylov subspace method (GKSM) to solve the optimization problem efficiently. Moreover, we also establish rigorous convergence guarantees for GKSM in nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on CS MRI reconstruction with spiral and radial acquisitions validate both the computational efficiency of GKSM and the accuracy of the theoretical predictions. The proposed optimization method is applicable to any linear inverse problem.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we report the first experimental demonstration of the recently emerged new paradigm in flapping flight physics called (Natural Hovering Extremum Seeking (NH-ES)) [doi.org/10.1103/4dm4-kc4g], which theorized that hovering flight physics observed in nature by flapping insects and hummingbirds can be generated via a model-free, real-time, computationally basic, sensory-based feedback mechanism that only needs the built-in natural oscillations of the flapping wing as its propulsive input. We run experiments, including moth-like, light source-seeking, on a flapping-wing body in a total model-free setting that is agnostic to morphological parameters and body/aerodynamic models, and show that the flapping body gains altitude and stabilizes hovering about the light source autonomously needing only sensor measurements of light intensity.</description>

Abstract: We consider the problem of adaptive control of a class of feedback linearizable plants with matched parametric uncertainties whose states are accessible, subject to state constraints, which often arise due to safety considerations. In this paper, we combine adaptation and control barrier functions into a real-time control architecture that guarantees stability, ensures control performance, and remains safe even with the parametric uncertainties. Two problems are considered, differing in the nature of the parametric uncertainties. In both cases, the control barrier function is assumed to have an arbitrary relative degree. In addition to guaranteeing stability, it is proved that both the control objective and safety objective are met with near-zero conservatism. No excitation conditions are imposed on the command signal. Simulation results demonstrate the non-conservatism of all of the theoretical developments.</description>

      <title>From Device to Dynamics: An Iterative Architectural Framework for High-Performance Single-Photon Detection at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01328v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photon detection is a cornerstone of quantum technology, traditionally regarded as a static device-level operation constrained by the intrinsic physical properties of single-photon detectors (SPDs). Consequently, high-performance detection has been heavily reliant on superconducting technologies, whose requirement for cryogenic temperatures imposes significant infrastructure burdens and limits scalable deployment. To circumvent these constraints, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detection (ESPD) framework, which shifts the photon-detection paradigm from device-centric optimization to an integrated quantum-information-processing (QIP) task. By incorporating state preparation, controlled operations, projective measurements, and multi-copy decision analysis, we establish a nonlinear dynamical model that reformulates detection as an iteratively enhanced process. This architecture enables systematic performance upgrades through structural design rather than material modification, allowing high-performance detection with exclusively room-temperature hardware. Through analytical approximations, Monte Carlo analysis, and numerical simulations, we show that the ESPD dynamics converge to a high-performance basin of attraction even when initialized by low-performance SPDs. While physical realization requires further component integration efforts, this work establishes a rigorous theoretical foundation for enhancing detection via architectural QIP principles. It provides not only a blueprint for next-generation room-temperature photon detection but also a general methodology for transcending device-level constraints in broader quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>The Blueprints of Intelligence: A Functional-Topological Foundation for Perception and Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-world phenomena do not generate arbitrary variability: their signals concentrate on compact, low-variability subsets of functional space, enabling rapid generalization from few examples. A small child can recognize a dog after extremely limited exposure because the perceptual manifold of "dog" is compact, structured, and low-dimensional. We formalize this principle through a deterministic functional-topological framework in which the set of valid realizations produced by a physical process forms a compact subset of a Banach space, endowed with stable invariants, a finite Hausdorff radius, and an induced continuous perceptual functional.
  This geometry provides explicit limits on knowledge, conditions for identifiability, and guarantees for generalization from sparse evidence -- properties fundamental to both natural and artificial intelligence. Across electromechanical, electrochemical, and physiological domains, we show that real-world processes consistently generate compact perceptual manifolds with the same geometric characteristics. Their boundaries can be discovered in a fully self-supervised manner as the empirical radius saturates with increasing sampling, even when the governing equations are unknown.
  These results demonstrate that deterministic functional topology offers a unified mathematical foundation for perception, representation, and world-model construction. It provides a geometric explanation for why biological learners and self-supervised AI systems can generalize from few observations, and establishes compact perceptual manifolds as a fundamental building block for future AI architectures. Finally, this work unifies biological perception and modern self-supervised models under a single geometric principle: both derive their generalization ability from the compactness and invariants of real-world perceptual manifolds.</description>
