      <title>Mathematical description of continuous time and space replicator-mutator equations for quadratic fitness landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The replicator-mutator equation is a model for populations of individuals carrying different traits, with a fitness function mediating their ability to replicate, and a stochastic model for mutation. We derive analytical solutions for the replicator-mutator equation in continuous time and for continuous traits for a quadratic fitness function. Using these results we can explain and quantify (without the need for numerical in-silico simulations) a series of evolutionary phenomena, in particular the flying kite effect, survival of the flattest, and the ability of a population to sustain itself while tracking an optimal feature which may be fixed, moving with bounded velocity in trait space, oscillating, or randomly fluctuating.</description>

      <title>Epidemiological dynamics in populations structured by neighbourhoods and households</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Epidemiological dynamics are affected by the spatial and demographic structure of the host population. Households and neighbourhoods are known to be important groupings but little is known about the epidemiological interplay between them. In order to explore the implications for infectious disease epidemiology of households with similar demographic structures clustered in space we develop a multi-scale epidemic model consisting of neighbourhoods of households. In our analysis we focus on key parameters which control household size, the importance of transmission within households relative to outside of them, and the degree to which the non-household transmission is localised within neighbourhoods. We construct the household reproduction number $R_*$ over all neighbourhoods and derive the analytic probability of an outbreak occurring from a single infected individual in a specific neighbourhood. We find that reduced localisation of transmission within neighbourhoods reduces $R_*$ when household size differs between neighbourhoods. This effect is amplified by larger differences between household sizes and larger divergence between transmission rates within households and outside of them. However, the impact of neighbourhoods with larger household sizes on an individual's risk of infection is mainly limited to the individuals that reside in those neighbourhoods. We consider various surveillance scenarios and show that household size information from the initial infectious cases is often more important than neighbourhood information while household size and neighbourhood localisation influences the sequence of neighbourhoods in which an outbreak is observed.</description>
